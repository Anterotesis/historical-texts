            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that others are not of his minde; we have been ſo

our enemies have not come in at our breaches, and
divided all among themſelves, before this time.

How much better then is it to be hated for Chriſt,
then to be beloved for ſinne? The reaſon he gives of
that ſtrange aſſertion of his, is, <hi>If thou beeſt loved for
God, it is an honour to thee, and thou art a debtour for that
honour; If thou beeſt hated for him, God is a debtour to thee,
he owes honour to thee,</hi> for ſo he is pleaſed to be to his
poore ſervants. But our diviſions have been and ſtill
are between good men, even Gods Diamonds do cut
one another; good men cauſe afflictions to good men;
every man is plotting, working, winding for himſelfe.
Every man ſtrives like <hi>Apelles</hi> and <hi>Protogenes</hi> who ſhall
draw the ſubtileſt line to attain his owne ends, but few

keep it open, yea to make it wider; the Lord deliver me
from ſuch a ſpirit: God knows I had rather die, then be

a cauſe of ſo great an evill. What this endeavour of
mine may work in mens hearts, God knowes. If it meet
with a ſon of peace, I hope it will ſpeake peace, it will
eſtabliſh peace in ſuch a heart: if with a ſon of ſtrife it
may worke <hi>ad modum recipientis.</hi> That which is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

            <p>Thoſe things which God himſelfe ordaines for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(the Sacraments) are by mans corruption made the
occaſion of the greateſt contention in the Chriſtian
world. No marvell then that what comes from mans
ſincereſt intentions and beſt endevours be turned quite
croſſe.</p>
            <p>Like enough theſe leaves may meet with ſome boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous
Reader, that may beat them one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that may pry and picke to finde that in them
which is not, looking thorough the contradictions of
his owne ſpirit he may think he ſees the like here. Let
the lines be never ſo ſtraight, yet he will wreſt and pul
them what he can to make them lye croſſe. I am ſo far
from being ſollicitous that they are ſo indeed, that the
ſpeciall thing I deſire of thee is the laying one thing to
another, the comparing one thing with another. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what the ſubject is, Diviſions, Differences.
I have in it to deale with various ſpirits, opinions,
wayes: remember the ſcope is to ſeeke the compoſing
of them what I can. If you ſee me now neare to the one
ſide, and by and by neare to the other, which yet are
very wide from one another, be not raſh to judge, that
I am off my center; reade on, and ſee what the iſſue
may come to.</p>
            <p>This path of mine hath beene upon ſharpe ſtones,
cutting ſhels, and pricking thornes; yet thorough the
<pb facs="tcp:104285:4"/>
helpe of the ſhooe of the preparation of the Goſpel of
peace, I doe not finde my feet cut.</p>
            <p>Peace is pretious to me, I feele the ſweetneſſe of it;
I am willing to do what I can to honour it. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
jarres, contentions, diſturbances abroad in
Church and Common-wealth are very grievous. They
ſay there are in the world ſuch things in Families alſo.
I have brought here ſome water: if my line had been
longer, my bucket had beene fuller. You have here
what I delivered: ſome things are added, eſpecially
quotations of Authors and Hiſtories. When they grow
to be many I thinke them fitter for the Preſſe then the
Pulpit. I was the more willing theſe things ſhould
come forth to publique view, becauſe otherwiſe what
other men apprehended to be my minde, would be
put into their owne words, and ſo rendred in an evill
appearance. But will Printing help? The boldneſſe
of this age is ſuch, as not onely to make a mans words
ſound otherwiſe then when they came from him, and
ſo traduce him; but confidently to averre that there
are ſuch things written in ſuch Bookes, of ſuch men,
which never yet came into their thoughts, much leſſe
into their pen. With what boldneſſe hath it been ſaid
and printed againe and againe, that I in that Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<hi>The glorious name of God, The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> did
call the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> the Lord of Hoſts. Surely the
ſight of theſe men is <hi>extramittendo,</hi> not <hi>intramittendo,</hi>
they ſend forth ſpecies of their owne dyed with the
evill of their hearts, and then they ſay they finde
them in ſuch a book. No man can finde that name gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by me to him. I indeed endeavoured to encourage
him in his worke, becauſe the Lord had made him the
Lord of our Hoſts, which is no more then the Lord of
<pb facs="tcp:104285:4"/>
our Armies. The utmoſt that ever was ſaid or writ
comes but to this, that God had put a name upon
him that came neare to his, but never mentioned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome difference from it. An abuſe in this kinde,
though not altogether ſo high, I have had from the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Apologiſt;</hi>
he quotes many places in my Lectures
upon <hi>Hoſea,</hi> he ſets downe the pages, wherein he ſayes,
I have contrary to what is in the Apology preached
for that way you call Independent. Would any man
but thinke, when he ſees the Booke named in Print,
the Lecture, the very page mentioned, but that the
thing is true, it is to be found there? But to this day
it hath never come to my eares that ever any man hath
found ſuch things there but himſelfe. Are thoſe the
places? Let moderate and quiet ſpirited men looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and they ſhall finde nothing there but what
the generality of Presbyteriall Brethren, yea I thinke
I may ſay every one, who is not either Prelaticall or
very violent, will acknowledge to bee truth, and if
ſo, I am free. But we ſhall have another time for this.
At this time I would gladly that this Treatiſe might
meet with no ſpirit exaſperated, but in calmneſſe
and quietneſſe, let what is here be examined. That
God that can create the fruit of the lips to be peace,
can make the fruit of the pen to be ſo. My aymes are
peace, which I ſhall never ceaſe endeavouring and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>This Heart-diviſion is either from God, or from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Their heart is divided between God and their Idols; They
would not caſt off the worſhip of God wholly, that was too
much; they loved their Idols, but they muſt not have all: to
divide between God and them they thought was faire. Their
hearts were alſo divided one from another; and juſt it is
with God, that thoſe who divide from him, ſhould divide
one from another. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. you may ſee what wofull divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
there were amonſt them, King againſt people, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
againſt King, Civill Wars. Their King comes upon one
of their owne Towns, and ſmites it, and rips up all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that were with Child in it, and all becauſe they opened
not to him. O the rage and cruelty of men of proud ſpirits,
when they get power into their hands! for then their pride
ſwells, being blown up with the flatteries of ſuch as are about
them: As if they were ſuch gods upon earth, as they might doe
whatſoever they pleaſed, and the lives, eſtates, liberties, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of all muſt lie under their feet, and muſt ſubmit to their
luſts and humours. You ſhall find further in the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
there was nothing but conſpiring, miſchieving, and
murthering one another. In their Church State there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but factions and rents one from another; ſome were for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104285:6"/>
the true worſhip, ſome for the falſe. And amongſt the falſe
worſhippers there were diviſions too: Some were for the calves
that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſet up at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> ſome were for <hi>Baal:</hi>
great contention there was between theſe. You know the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Jehu</hi> an Idolater, yet deſtroying the worſhippers of <hi>Baal</hi>
and his Idols.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jewes</hi> of old underſtood this Text of theſe Heart-diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
amongſt themſelves, as well as of their diviſions from
God, which appears by a notable tradition of theirs, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
in his Comment upon theſe words, relates: whereas (ſays
he) the Scripture, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. tells us, that <hi>Hoſhea was the laſt
King of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>in his time Iſrael was carryed captive;</hi> yet <hi>verſ.</hi>
2. It is ſaid, <hi>He did not evill in the ſight of the Lord, as the Kings
of Iſrael that were before him.</hi> Now the Jewes put this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Why was not Iſrael carryed captive with their King,
when they had the worſt King, but rather when things ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to goe ſomething better then before? God yet chooſes this
time.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer they give, is, Becauſe in former times the
people might pretend, they could not tell how to help what
they did amiſſe in the matter of Worſhip; Indeed they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
the Calves, but they were forced to it by the tyranny
of their Kings, it ſhould be the loſſe of all they had if they
did not: but (ſay they) in the days of <hi>Hoſhea</hi> there was more
liberty given then before. Now thoſe who would, might
goe up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip, and that they ſay is the
reaſon of that expreſſion, that <hi>Hoſhea</hi> did not evill as other
Kings had done; but when they came to have more liberty,
they fell to wrangling amongſt themſelves, (which is an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
concomitant of liberty) now their diviſion roſe high,
ſome would to up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip, others would not;
thoſe that went up, cryed out of thoſe who went not; and
thoſe who went not, vilified thoſe who went. Now their
hearts are thus divided, now ſhall they be found guilty. The
deſolating judgment muſt now come. This is the time for
their captivity. Now he gives them up to the Enemie. God
was exceedingly provoked with their contentions one againſt
another at this time. What? (ſays God) when I was in
ſome way of favour towards them, when I took off (in great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104285:7"/>
part) the yoke of bondage that was upon them, that ſore op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
that was before, none of them (a while ſince) dared
goe to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip, and now their Governours are
more moderate, their oppreſſing Courts are downe, there is
more liberty in the Land for my true worſhip, and do they
now fall out, contemn, divide, wrangle one with another? let
them goe into captivity, let the enemy come in upon them, my
ſoule takes no delight in ſuch a crooked perverſe Generation
as this is.</p>
               <p>Our condition ſeems to parallel with theirs very much, we
lately were under ſore and cruell bondage, nothing was more
dangerous then the worſhipping God in his own way, wee
were under hard Task-maſters, oppreſſing, undoing Courts;
The Lord hath in a great meaſure delivered us, it is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs,
the ſinfull diſtemper of mens ſpirits that makes
them ſay, what is done? it is as ill with us as ever it was; No,
we have much eaſe, ſuch liberties, as were our fore-fathers rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
out of their graves to ſee, they would admire Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and bleſs him with meltings of heart; but we ſpend that
ſtrength in ſiding, wrangling, contending, quarrelling, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
oppoſing one another, that we ſhould ſpend in magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
bleſſing and praiſing the Name of God for that mercy we
enjoy. We are a divided people, whoſe hearts are divided, and
heads too, and hands too; peace and unity ſeems to be flown
from us, and a ſpirit of contention and diviſion is come upon
us: King &amp; Subjects are divided, Parl. is divided, Aſſembly is
divided, Armies are divided, Church is divided, &amp; State is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
City is divided, Country is divided, Towns are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
Families divided, godly people are divided, Miniſters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every where are divided; yea, and what heart almoſt is
there at this time but is divided in it ſelf? the thoughts, the
counſels, contrivances, endeavours, ways of men, almoſt of all
men, how are they divided? O bleſſed Saviour! are theſe the
times thou ſpeakeſt of, wherein five ſhould be in one houſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
three againſt two, and two againſt three; <hi>the father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſon, and the ſon againſt the father; the mother againſt the
daughter, and the daughter againſt the mother?</hi> Oh woe to us! wee
find it ſo amongſt us, and yet there is found no healing; we are
broken, and there is no binding up: It is with us as it was with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104285:7"/>
                  <hi>Ezek. 2. 6. Briars and thorns are with us, and we dwell among
Scorpions.</hi> O Lord, what is this thy curſe at this time upon
<hi>England? Bryers and thornes ſhall it bring forth:</hi> We are rending
and tearing, and devouring one another, while the adverſary
ſtands before us ready to devour us: <hi>Ephraim</hi> is againſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,</hi>

the men of <hi>Sechem,</hi> and devours <hi>Abimilech;</hi> yea, there is a fire
kindled in our owne bowels, it riſes from our ſelves. <hi>Ezek.
19. 14. Fire is gone ont of a rod of her branches, which hath devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her fruit, ſo that ſhee hath no ſtrong rod to be a Seepter to rule,
this is a lamentation, and ſhall be for a lamentation.</hi> This is amongſt
us at this day, and how long it ſhall continue, God onely
knows.</p>
               <p>What this people were in their divided condition, that we
are; and what does this threaten, but that we ſhould be as they
a while after this were? namely, a people given up to the rage
and fury of the Enemie, which the Lord forbid.</p>
               <p>There is a great out-cry of our diviſions, and while we cry
out againſt them, wee ſtill encreaſe them; we are angry with
men rather, becauſe they are divided from our ſelves, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are divided from the truth; we are angry becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man is not of our own mind, &amp; does not as we do. There
was a great deal of doe in <hi>Luthers</hi> time about the ſeamleſs coat
of Chriſt. <hi>Granvillian</hi> the Emperours Deputy in a Speech he
made to the Citizens of <hi>Wormes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sleid. Com. lib. 13.</note> beſeeches them for the death
of Chriſt, and for all loves, that they would amend our Lords
coate, which is rent and torn on every ſide. When <hi>Luther</hi>
laboured to bring Reformation to the Rule, they bad him
take heed that he did not rend the ſeamleſs coat of Chriſt; and
becauſe they talked ſo much of the <hi>tunica inconſutilis,</hi> they
were called the <hi>Inconſutiliſtae,</hi> the <hi>ſeameleſſe men:</hi> And what a
ſtirre hath there been in out-cryes againſt men that would not
yeeld to every thing that was enjoyned? O they rent the ſeam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
Coat of Chriſt. I remember <hi>Muſculus</hi> in a Tract he hath
<hi>De Schiſmate,</hi> hath a witty and pious note upon this, The
Souldiers (ſaith he) would not divide the ſeameleſſe coat of
Chriſt; but what made them to be ſo carefull of it? was it out
of reſpect to Chriſt, that they were ſo unwilling it ſhould be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104285:8"/>
divided? No, but out of reſpect to their owne advantage, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one hoping it might fall to his ſhare, therefore ſay they,
<hi>Let us caſt lots for it;</hi> ſo, ſaith he, men would not have Chriſts
coat divided, they would have no diviſion in the Church;
but what do they aime at? their own advantage, that they
might enjoy quietly their owne eaſe, honour, and means, that
they might have none to contradict them, but that the ſtreame
may run ſmoothly and wholly with them, what a fine brave
thing were this? And becauſe they ſee they cannot doe this
while their ways are looked into and croſſed, therefore they
make ſuch an outcry againſt the dividing the ſeamleſſe coat
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But certainly, till our hearts be otherwiſe then yet they are,
all our out-cries wil not ſerve our ends, the ſtilling our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.
Did we leſs divide between God and our own ends, our

                  </gap>, we ſhould not divide ſo much one from another.

               <p>THis people would give God ſomething, and their idols
ſomething, and ſo think to pleaſe both, 2 <hi>King. 7. 33. They
feared the Lord, and ſerved their Idolls.</hi> Thus <hi>Judah</hi> in the days of
<hi>Joſiah, Zeph. 1. 5. ſware by the Lord, and by Malcham;</hi> Swearing
is a part of Gods worſhip, therefore no humane inſtituted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
ceremony ought to be joyned with it, no more then
with the Sacrament, or any other divine worſhip, no creature
ſhould ſhare in it, but they joyned <hi>Malcham,</hi> that is their King.
The worſhip and ſervice proper to God hath been too much
divided between God and the Kings of the Earth; but here it's
probable is meant their Idoll, to which they gave a Kingly
power over them, their Idoll Moloch had his name from
hence.</p>
               <p>I have read of <hi>Redwald</hi> King of the Eaſt Saxons, the firſt
Prince of his Nation that was baptized, in the ſame place wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
Chriſt, and ſet up an Altar to worſhip his Idols. Many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104285:8"/>
mens ſpirits lye like that Haven, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 12. towards the
Southweſt and Northweſt, two oppoſite points: Surely their
ſpirits muſt needs be very winding and crooked which lye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſuch oppoſites.</p>
               <p>This dividing with God is very wicked; what communion
hath God with <hi>Belial? How can you partake of the Table of the
Lord, and the Table of Devills?</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 21. And leſt they
ſhould thinke it a light thing thus to divide with God, hee
adds, <hi>verſ. 22. Doe we provoke the Lord to jealouſie? are we ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then he?</hi> It is a great provoking of God, and a fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, thus to divide in his worſhip. To think that God
ſhould accept of ſuch a dividing, is to make him cruel, like that
<hi>Harlot, 1 King.</hi> 3. 26. who was content to have the child divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>Let it be neither mine nor thine, but let it be divided.</hi> Gods
worſhip is as deare to him as any child can be to the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted
mother in the world. When <hi>Darius</hi> would have
divided with <hi>Alexander,</hi> No, ſayes <hi>Alexander,</hi> there can be but
one Sun in the Firmament. If we will be dividing with God,
he will caſt off all. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 33. it is ſaid, <hi>they feared the
Lord, and ſerved their Idolls;</hi> but <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. it is ſaid, <hi>they did
not feare God,</hi> God accounted a divided feare no feare at all.
<hi>Verſe</hi> 16. it is ſaid, <hi>They left all the Commandements of the Lord
their God, and made them molten Images.</hi> If they give any part
of Gods honour to molten Images, he acknowledges no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
at all given to him, he accounts all his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be left. So <hi>Jer. 32. 23. They have done nothing of all
that thou commandeſt them to doe:</hi> and <hi>verſ. 30. The children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
and the children of Judah have onely done evill before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God is infinite, and hath all excellency in him, therefore he
muſt have the whole heart; Idols doe not challenge ſo much,
becauſe they have not an univerſall excellency, a piece of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is enough for them; our hearts, eſtates, liberties, all wee
are or have, are more Gods then our owne. <hi>Cyrus</hi> tooke <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
by dividing the River: The Devill ſoon ſurprizes us, if
he can but divide our hearts.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why heathen <hi>Rome</hi> rejected Chriſt from being of
the number of their gods, when ſuch a thing was tendred to
their Senate, was, Becauſe (ſay they) if we receive him to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104285:9"/>
a God, he will ſuffer none of our other gods; if we take in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other new god, we may yet retain ſtill our old ones; but if
we take this Jeſus, all our old ones muſt be abandoned. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
at this day reject Chriſt upon this ground.</p>
               <p>The Romaniſts ſince thinke they can take in Chriſt for a
God, and yet divide between him and other gods; their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is made up of diviſions between God and their graven
Images; between Chriſt the Mediator, and Saints and Angels;
between the Word, and their owne Traditions; between Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inſtitutions, and Humane Inventions.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>King. 18. 21. Why halt ye between two opinions?</hi> Wee muſt
not be voluntary Cripples to halt between two. Why are
you diſmembred in your hearts and your opinions? ſo <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
in his Hiſtory mentioning that place. That is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when the Prophet put that queſtion to them, the Text
ſaith, <hi>The people held their peace,</hi> their mouths were ſtopped,
they had not a word to ſay for themſelves. If any thing be
pretended for this dividing, it is that trouble may be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
exactneſſe in Religion, through Reformation, giving up
our ſelves wholly to God and his truth, hath a ſhew of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

between two extreams, which are evill, but not partaking of

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104285:9"/>
If wee let out our hearts to any thing but in ſubordination
to God,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> then we divide between God and that thing ſinfully;
but though we do let out our affections to other things, yet if
it be in ſubordination to God, ſo farre as God is in thoſe
things, and we may be led nearer to God by them; this is no
dividing between God and other things, but an uniting all in
God, and enjoying God in all. The Saints are inſtructed in
this miſtery of godlineſſe, they know how to give God the
whole heart, and yet to enjoy the comforts of wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and eſtates, and callings, as much as any in the world;
they have that heavenly skil to unite all in God, and enjoy
God in all, God is all in all unto them in their enjoyments
of all good whatſoever; but if our hearts be let out to any
thing otherwiſe then thus, they go a whoring from God, and
will certainly vaniſh in their own folly. This is contrary to
that ſingleneſſe, to that oneneſſe of heart promiſed as a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Goſpel. Many of you complaine of barrenneſſe,
here is the reaſon your hearts are divided; were the ſtream of
your hearts wholly after God, it would runne ſtrongly, and
bear down oppoſition before it, you would be fruitfull in all
the wayes of holineſſe.</p>
               <p>How fruitful and gloriouſly uſefull would men in publike
place be, if their hearts were ſingle and one for God; did they
only care to honour God in their duty, and leave the care of
protection of, and proviſion for themſelves and ſtate to God?
Let not mens hearts be cut, be divided with their cares and
fears about conſequences and ſucceſſes; their wiſdom ſhould
be how to work all about for God, not how handſomely to
contrive that God may have part, and themſelves part. The
more fully we give up our ſelves, our ends, deſignes to God,
the more ſecurely may we ſit under Gods protection, care,
and bleſſing. Many of the good Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had their
hearts for God, but yet they let the high Places ſtand; their
politick wiſdom divided their hearts between God, and their
fears of diſturbance in the State; If they ſhould raiſe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
ſo high, by this their diviſion, their hearts lay flat,
the worke was neglected. But 2 <hi>Chron. 17. 6. Jehoſhaphats
heart was lift up in the wayes of the Lord, he tooke away the high
places and groves, he ſought to the Lord God of his father, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

in his commandements, not after the doings of Iſrael, verſ.</hi> 4.
But did he not bring diſturbance to the Kingdome by this his
zeale? No, <hi>Verſ. 5. Therefore the Lord ſtabliſhed that Kingdome
in his hand, and all Judah brought to Jehoſhaphat preſents, and hee
had riches and honour in abundance.</hi> And <hi>verſ 10. The feare of
the Lord fell upon all the kingdomes of the lands that were round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Judah, ſo that they made no warre againſt Jehoſhaphat.</hi> Verſ.

               </p>
               <p>Let our hearts be for God alone, for God alone is enough
to ſatisfie our hearts, to ſupply all good unto us for ever.</p>

of our times is to be the ſubject of the future diſcourſe. I
am not ignorant nor unſenſible of the difficulty, the trouble,
the danger there is in medling with ſuch a ſubject at ſuch a

may expect to be divided himſelf, to have his name, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,

A learned man being once asked why he did not write

and what can foment diviſion more then ſlandering, ſo far as
any, eſpecially in the Church, hath a hand in cauſing or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
diviſion, ſo farre as ſhe is a Devil in Scripture-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
the part of the Devil is acted by them. I remember <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan</hi>
hath a note upon that place in the Goſpel, where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
being caſt out of the man, who had a legion in him, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chriſt that they might not goe out of that region; why
would they not go out of that region? ſays <hi>Cajetan;</hi> He gives
this anſwer, The Devils have certain places to which they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
their work, ſuch Devils to ſuch a place for ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and ſuch to another for another ſervice; now theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
were loath to be diſplaced of their region, though they
were caſt out of the man, having further work to do in that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104285:11"/>
place: If this be ſo, ſurely the Devills that are appointed to
cauſe and foment diviſions and diſſentions above all regions,
love to be in the region of Churches, for no where do diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſuch hart as there, and at this time eſpecially; for now
the Devils ſee they cannot prevail to get men to their old ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
vanities; but ſome reformation there wil be, they
now ſeek to mingle a perverſe ſpirit of diviſion amongſt men,
hoping they ſhall prevail here, though they could not hold
their own in the former. God put enmity between Satan and
the Saints, but it is the Devil that puts enmity between Saints
and Saints. When we hear fearful thundring, and ſee terrible
ſtorms and tempeſts, many people ſay, that ill ſpirits are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
ſurely theſe bluſtering ſtorms of contention are raiſed
and continued from evill ſpirits: But the truth is, all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
in hel could do us no great hurt in dividing us from God
or from one another, were it not for the corruption of our
own hearts: Wherefore as the Lord ſays to <hi>Iſrael, Perditio tua
ex te,</hi> thy deſtruction is from thy ſelf: So may we now ſay of
<hi>England, Diviſio tua ex te,</hi> thy diviſion is from thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes of our diviſions from our ſelves, may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to three heads.</p>
                  <p>1. Dividing principles; ſometimes our diviſions come
down from our heads to our hearts.</p>
                  <p>2. Dividing diſtempers, ſometimes they go up from our
hearts to our heads.</p>
                  <p>3. Dividing practiſes, and theſe come from head and heart,
they foment and encreaſe both.</p>
                  <p>We will begin with dividing principles: Except ſome care
be taken of the head, it will be in vaine to meddle with the
heart, to cry out againſt our heart-diſtempers; the chief cauſe
of many of our diviſions lies here: It is to little purpoſe, to
purge or apply any medicine to the lower parts, when the
diſeaſe comes from diſtillations from the head.</p>

The firſt,
There can be no agreement without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity.</head>
               <p>THis Principle hath a long time cauſed much diviſion in
the Church.<note place="margin">1. Dividing Principle.</note> The right underſtanding wherein the
weakneſſe and falſeneſſe of it lyes, will help much to
Peace, to joyn us ſweetly together.</p>
               <p>In the ſubſtantials of worſhip, Unity is neceſſary; there all
are bound to go by the ſame rule, and to do to the uttermoſt
they are able, the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>But the circumſtantials of worſhip have a two-fold conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:
They are either ſuch, as though but circumſtances
to ſome other worſhip, yet have alſo in themſelves ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
worſhip, ſome ſpirituall efficacie, ſomething in them
to commend our ſervice unto God, or to cauſe ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God with us, or to work us nearer to God, by an
efficacy beyond what they have in them of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
As for inſtance, Time is a circumſtance, but the Lords
day hath a worſhip in it commending our ſervice to God,
and an efficacie to bring God to us, and raiſe us to God:
this not from any naturall efficacie of the time,<note place="margin">What circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> of worſhip muſt have inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and what not.</note> but from
Gods inſtitution. Now in ſuch circumſtances as theſe, there
ought to be uniformity; for theſe have inſtitutions for their
rule, and are not at mans liberty to be altered as he thinks
beſt in prudence; But there are other circumſtances which
are onely naturall or civill, ſubſervient to worſhip in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
or civill way; They are converſant about worſhip, but
have nothing of worſhip in them, but are meerely naturall
or civill helps to it. When we worſhip God, we do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as men as well as worſhippers; hence we have need of
ſome naturall or civill helps. As for inſtance, when we
meet to worſhip God, wee being men as well as Chriſtians,
muſt have a conveniency of place, to keep us from the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104285:12"/>
to know whether to reſort; and of time to know when.</p>
               <p>There muſt be order: Many cannot ſpeak at once to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
modeſt and grave carriage is required of us, as a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of men, meeting about matters of weight. In theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
and other of the like nature, there is no worſhip
at all, there is no ſpirituall efficacie, there are only naturall
or civill helps to us, while we are worſhipping; therefore for
theſe circumſtances, humane prudence is ſufficient to order
them.</p>
               <p>The right underſtanding of this takes away a great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
that many have againſt ſuch as deſire to keep to Divine
Inſtitutions, not onely in Subſtantials, but in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials
of worſhip; they thinke it an unreaſonable thing,
that divine Inſtitution ſhould be required for every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in worſhip; this hath bred a great quarrel in the church:
and well may it be thought unreaſonable, if we required In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
for circumſtances in worſhip, which are but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
or civill helps, and have no worſhip at all in them, for
that indeed were endleſſe, and a meer vanity. Certainly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
are to be required onely in things that are raiſed
beyond what is in them naturally, in tendring my reſpects
to God by them, or expecting to draw my heart nearer to
God, or God nearer to me in the uſe of them. The conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about Uniformity is much encreaſed for want of a right
underſtanding of this difference in the circumſtantialls of
worſhip; did we underſtand one another in this, wee might
ſoon have Peace as concerning this thing.</p>
               <p>In theſe latter ſorts of circumſtances we muſt alſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.
There are ſome that muſt of neceſſity be determined,
as time and place; it is therefore neceſſary, there ſhould be
an uniformity in theſe, in all the members of every ſociety
reſpectively, that they agree to meet in the ſame place, at the
ſame time, naturall neceſſity requires this: but naturall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
requires not the binding of ſeverall Churches to Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in things of this kind. The urging Uniformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the rule in ſuch things, hath in all ages cauſed wofull
diviſions in the Church. <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells of <hi>Victor,</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> about two hundred yeares after Chriſt, broke off com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104285:13"/>
from all the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> for not keeping <hi>Eaſter</hi>
the ſame time he did. The controverſie was not about <hi>Eaſter,</hi>
but onely about uniformity in the time. Never hath there
been greater breaches of unity in the Church, then by violent
urging Uniformity.</p>
               <p>But further; there are other naturall civill circumſtances,
which need not at all be determined; though there be a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and variety in them, yet order and edification is not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hindered. As for inſtance, In hearing the word, one ſtands,
as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was wont conſtantly to do; another ſits; one is
uncovered, another is covered; one hath one kind of garment,
another, another; yet no rules of modeſty or gravity are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
Now if any power ſhould violently urge uniformity in
ſuch like circumſtances, and not leave them as Chriſt hath
done, here they make the neceſſity of uniformity a dividing
principle, upon theſe four grounds.</p>
               <p>1. This is a ſtraitning mens naturall liberties, without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
their reaſon.</p>
               <p>2. This hath been the in-let to almoſt all ſuperſtitions in
the Church; Firſt the plea hath been for decency and order,
then there hath been ſtamped a humane inſtitution to raiſe
things higher.</p>
               <p>3. The urging ſuch things, when there is no reaſon ſeen in
the nature of them; why this rather then that, makes men
fear there is ſome religious reſpect put upon them already.</p>
               <p>4. Here is a ſtretching the power of Authority beyond the
limits of it, which Man naturally is very impatient of, not
knowing how far it may yet further be extended. As for the
practice of Church-Governors, or civill going beyond their
bounds, we ſhall ſpeak to in the third Head.</p>

the varity of the practices of Brethren in ſuch things as wee
are ſpeaking of, tuned with brotherly love one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there will be a ſweet harmony, when violent urging
Uniformity in ſuch things will cauſe a harſh diſcord in the
Churches.</p>
               <p>When the fore-named <hi>Victor</hi> of Rome, with thoſe who
joyned with him, cauſed wofull diviſions in the Church by
ſtanding ſo much upon uniformity, urging there could be no
Peace without it, by it they brake the peace of the Church.
<hi>Iraeneus</hi> and others in the ſame time pleaded for the peace of
the Church, to be procured by yeelding to difference of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in ſuch things, in the name of all the brethren in <hi>France</hi>
under his charge, he writes to <hi>Victor,</hi> and thoſe who joyned
with him, and tells them of the variety of practiſes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Brethren in times before them, which was very neare
the Apoſtles times, who yet were at unity one with another.
They who were Biſhops (ſayes he) before <hi>Soter,</hi> of that Sea
which now thou governeſt, as <hi>Anicetus, Pius, Higinus, Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphorus,
Xixtus,</hi> were at unity with them of other Churches,
although their obſervations were various, and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Anicetus,</hi> varyed in divers things
from him. Although <hi>Polycarpus</hi> had (ſays he) what he did
from <hi>John</hi> the Diſciple of our Lord, with whom he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
yet would he not perſwade <hi>Anicetus</hi> to the ſame things,
but left him to the way of his owne Church, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
lovingly one with another, and parted in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
way. Cannot men walke peaceably in a broad way,
though they do not tread juſt in one anothers ſteps? What
though there be ſome diſtance in their walke, one towards
one ſide, the other towards the other ſide of the way; muſt
they needs fall out, becauſe they are not in the ſame path,
when the way is broad enough? Indeed if they went over a
narrow bridg, they muſt not take that liberty to go abredth;
if they keep not cloſe to one anothers ſteps, if they ſtep at a
diſtance, they may fall into the River. Thus in matters of
divine worſhip, we muſt look to it, that we walk exactly in
the ſame ſteps; if there we preſume to take liberty, wee may
ſoone fall; but in circumſtances of an inferiour nature, there
may be difference without diviſion. We muſt not here take

               <p>THis is a divider indeed. There is a great outcry of this
but what is the ſcope of it?<note place="margin">2. The ſecond dividing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</note> it is to exaſperate mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
againſt the toleration of any thing. Some think there
muſt needs be a neceſſary dependance between tolerating
ſome things conceived errors, and tolerating all things; and
if it were not for the fear of the one, there would not be ſuch
ado about the other. But I hope I ſhall clearly ſhew there is
no ſuch dependence; but as this is a dividing principle, that
all things ſhould be tolerated, ſo the other is as truly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and falſe, that nothing ſhould be tolerated.</p>
               <p>There is nothing makes more ſtirre amongſt us at this day,
then this principle of abſolute liberty in matters of Religion.
Conſcience preſſes me to ſpeak what I ſhall find to be the
mind of God in this thing: The wantonneſſe of mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
their extream boldneſſe about the matters of God, and
Chriſt, is ſuch, as ſhould cauſe our hearts to tremble; ſuch
horrid blaſphemous things are amongſt us, owned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
with ſo much impudence, and their practice ſtrengthned
by this Principle, That there is to be an abſolute liberty in the
things of Religion, that our duty to God, our love to, and
care of the preſervation of Religion, calls us to ſet our ſelves
againſt ſuch a falſe, ſinfull, dangerous diſturbing Principle as
this is.</p>
               <p>This Principle is ſtrengthened by two Poſitions; both
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104285:14"/>
which are dividing as well as the Principle it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Magiſtrates have nothing to do with men in

               <p>Secondly, Conſcience is a tender thing, and muſt have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
nothing muſt be done to men, who plead their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

               <p>Firſt, wee ſhall ſhew the Principle it ſelfe to be a dividing
principle; Then the miſtakes in thoſe two aſſertions, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

               <p>The principle is dividing; For,</p>

Propheſie of the times of the Goſpel, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 3. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of the 12. Chapter, it is prophecyed that thoſe who
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104285:15"/>
pierced Chriſt, ſhould looke upon him, and mourne, &amp;c.
having a ſpirit of grace and ſupplication powred upon them.
Chap. 13. 1. <hi>There ſhall now be opened a fountaine for ſinne and
for uncleanneſſe.</hi> Verſ. 3. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe, that he that takes
upon him to propheſie that his father and his mother that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
him, ſhall ſay unto him, Thou ſhalt not live, for thou
ſpeakeſt lyes in the name of the Lord: And his father and his
mother that begate him, ſhall thruſt him through when he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You muſt underſtand this by that in <hi>Deut.</hi> The meaning is
not, that his father or mother ſhould preſently run a knife in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, but that though they begat him, yet they ſhould be
the means to bring him to condign puniſhment, even the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away his life; thoſe who were the inſtruments of his life,
ſhould now be the inſtruments of his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, It is a dividing principle, becauſe by it the reines
are let looſe to all kind of wantonneſſe, and ſpirit of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the matters of Religion. Men naturally are wanton
in nothing more then in the things of Religion; and corrupt
ſpirits are bent upon, and pleaſed with oppoſition in theſe
things, above any other: for being things ſuppoſed to have
an excellency in them, and above reaſon, and ſo liable to
contradiction from men of corrupt minds, if there be nothing
to reſtrain men from oppoſing one another in them; the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe
and pride of mens hearts will carry them forth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
jarrings, contentions, and diviſions.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, Chriſt hath left ſpirituall meanes to helpe
this.</p>
               <p>It is anſwered, Chriſts ſpirituall meanes are to work in a
ſpirituall way upon the heart to change it, and ſecondarily
upon the outward man; while Chriſts means are working
thus, externall means may keep evill from breaking forth in
the outward man; Chriſt hath not left the outward man at
abſolute liberty to do what it will, till ſpirituall meanes be
made effectuall to the heart, eſpecially conſidering if you
grant this liberty, men may chooſe whether any of thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
means of Chriſt ſhould at all come at them.</p>
               <p>The firſt poſition that upholds this dividing principle: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
have nothing to do in the matters of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:104285:15"/>
It muſt be granted, that a Magiſtrate is not an Officer of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt the Mediator in his Mediatory Kingdome.<note place="margin">A Magiſtrate not an Officer <hi>Regus Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>There is a two-fold government that Chriſt hath:</p>
               <p>1. One as he is God equall with the Father, together with
the Father, ruling heaven and earth.</p>
               <p>2. Another, as he is God and man, Mediator, in a peculiar
Kingdome of his that he hath by way of diſpenſation from the
Father.</p>
               <p>Now the Magiſtrate is an Officer of God, both the Father
and the Son, in the generall government of the world. But
he is not the Officer of Chriſt, in that Kingdome of his that
he hath by way of diſpenſation from the Father, that <hi>Regnum
Mediatorum,</hi> as Divines call it: No, though he be a Chriſtian
Magiſtrate, there are no Officers of that, but ſuch as are by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
inſtitution ſet down in the Word; his Chriſtianity doth
only adde unto him further ability to execute the work of his
Office in a better manner, it adds no new authority to him:
An Infidell Magiſtrate converted to Chriſtian Religion, is
thereby better enabled to performe the duty of his place then
before, but he had the ſame authority before; it was his ſinn,
he did not uſe his Authority now as he is able to do; though
he be a Chriſtian who is a Magiſtrate, yet the power of his
Magiſtracy belongs to another Kingdom, different from that
the ſecond perſon hath as he is Chriſt the Mediator.</p>
               <p>But doth not this then exclude him from the exerciſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
power in the matters of Chriſtian Religion?<note place="margin">Object. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>No,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> for God in the exerciſe of his power governing the
world, hath a ſpeciall ayme at the promoting the Kingdom
of his Sonne Chriſt the Mediator: Therefore Magiſtrates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
this power of God, ought to ayme at theſe ends,
that God himſelfe aymes at in the exerciſe of his own power,
that is, to be uſefull to Chriſts Government in his Church,
and for the good of his Church: God in all his wayes, from
the beginning of the world, hath aymed at the ſetting up his
Son to be King upon his holy Hill, at the promoting of the
glory of him who is God-man: and if his Miniſters doe not
make uſe of their power to this end, when this Kingdome of
his Sonne comes to be revealed to them, he will require it at
their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:104285:16"/>
The power that God inveſted Magiſtrates withall in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion in the Old Teſtament, is ſo full and cleare in
that which God gave to the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that
to name particulars would almoſt make a volume; I find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who write about this ſubject, ſpend moſt of their ſtrength
here, but I wholly forbear mentioning inſtances in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is granted by all that they had power; but the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from thence to the power of Magiſtrates in the times
of the Goſpel, prevails little with thoſe who hold this Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Principle we are now ſpeaking of. For they tell us that
their power was typicall, they in the exerciſe of ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
were types of the Kingly power of Chriſt, for we find glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
promiſes of dominion and ſtability made to Chriſt in
the perſons of many of thoſe Kings.</p>
               <p>2. They tell us, that it is no argument, becauſe Prieſts and
Levites had in time of the Law power in temporall things, in
ordering the affairs of the State; therefore Miniſters ſhould
have civill authority now: So neither is it an argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Magiſtrates had power then in ſpirituall things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Magiſtrates ſhould have the like now.</p>
               <p>3. They tell us that the Church and Common-wealth of
the Jews were mixed in one; hence to be a ſtranger from the
Church is expreſſed by being a ſtranger from the Common-wealth
of <hi>Iſrael, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. and therefore their Magiſtrates
were Church-officers as well as Civill.</p>
               <p>4. That the people of the Jews were brought up in a more
ſervile way then Chriſt would have his Church, in the times
of the Goſpel, brought up in: Compulſion therefore in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion was more sutable to their condition, then it
is to our <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is free.</p>
               <p>5. The whole Church was then bound to be under the
ſame State-government; the Laws of their State were by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
appointment; their Kings were choſen by God; but now
Chriſt chuſes his Church out of all Nations of the earth, and
leaves them to the ſeverall Governments, Lawes, Officers of
ſeverall Nations for their Civill State.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. I confeſſe were there nothing but meerly examples or

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to an examining eye the argument would hardly be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104285:16"/>
or ſatisfactory, only ſo far as there is a common reaſon
and equity in them, and ſo all the judiciall bind now as well
as they did then.</p>
               <p>2. So far as the New Teſtament approves of for the times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of it, what was formerly done in the Old.</p>
               <p>The ſtrength of the argument from the power of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
in the Old Teſtament, lyes in theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is a common reaſon and equity, what ever the
ſtrength of ſuch kind of arguing be from one Spirituall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
to prove another, yet without all queſtion, it is ſtrong
enough from one Civill Ordinance to prove another, though
it be converſant about ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p>It is the Dictate of Nature, that Magiſtrates ſhould have
ſome power in matters of Religion. The generality of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have ever thought it equall. It hath been ever challenged
in all Nations and Common-wealths. The Heathens would
never ſuffer their gods to be blaſphemed, but puniſh ſuch as
were guilty thereof by the power of the Magiſtrate. <hi>Socrates</hi>
was put to death for blaſpheming their multiplicity of gods.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Surely there is a common equity, for there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of it as truly now as there was then. I cannot argue the
being of Spirituall Ordinances from our need of them, not
thus there is ſuch an inſtitution, for the Church hath need of
it; but rather thus, I find it in the Word to be an inſtitution,
and therefore the Church hath need of it. But in naturall or
civill things this way of arguing is ſtrong enough; there is
need of ſuch a help, and therefore we ſhould ſeek to have it.</p>
               <p>Now ſure the need we have of ſuch a power, is exceeding
great, we were in a moſt miſerable condition if we had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
civil power to reſtrain from any kinds of blaſphemies
and ſeducements. The condition of the Jews, O how happy
was it in compariſon of ours, if this were denyed us! for if
any one of theirs did blaſpheme God, or ſeek to ſeduce any
from him, they knew w<hi rend="sup">ht</hi> to do with him, beſides perſwading
him to the contrary; but if any ſhould ſeek to ſeduce the wives
of our boſoms, children of our bodies, friends as dear to us
as our own lives, into thoſe wayes that we think in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
will undo their ſouls to all eternity, yet wee muſt
only deſire them they would not do ſo, we muſt only admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104285:17"/>
and ſeek to convince them, or reprove them, but reſtrain
them we cannot: If the deliverance of us from the pedagogy
of the Law hath brought us into this condition, our burden
is greater in this thing then any that the Law laid upon our
fore-fathers. Hath Chriſt delevered us from one burden to lay
a greater upon us? Muſt we now ſee thoſe who are deareſt to
us drawn into the wayes of eternall deſtruction, and ſtand
and look on, but no way left to help them, or our ſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
wee can perſwade to the contrary? ſurely our condition
is very ſad: Have we not cauſe to ſay, Lord let any burthen of
the Ceremonial Law be laid upon our necks rather then this?
If there were a company of mad men running np and downe
the ſtreets with knives and ſwords in their hands, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to miſchief and kill all they met with, and we muſt doe
nothing to reſtraine them; if we could perſwade them to doe
otherwiſe, well and good: but that is all we can do for help;
what a dangerous thing were this? The caſe is the ſame,
when thoſe who are mad with damnable Hereſies, run from
place to place, ſeeking to draw all they can from the truth;
If we have no means of help but arguments, it is ill with us:
Surely God hath not put his people into ſuch a ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as this is, he hath provided better for his people then
thus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee find in the Record of Scripture mention of
Heathen Magiſtrates, who had nothing but the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to guide them, intereſſing themſelves in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and this the Holy Ghoſt relates in way of commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them for this thing.</p>
               <p>The argument from theſe examples cannot be avoided, as
that which is taken from the practice of the Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi>
We read <hi>Ezra 7. 26. Artaxerxes</hi> interpoſes his power in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, and <hi>Ezra</hi> bleſſes God for it, <hi>Whoſoever will
not doe the Law of thy God, and the Law of the King, let judgement
be executed ſpeedily upon him.</hi> And in the next words, <hi>Ezra</hi>
bleſſed God, who put it in the heart of the King by theſe and
other means, to beautifie his houſe. The making ſuch a Law
was one notable meanes whereby the Houſe of the Lord came
to be beautified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus alſo</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 29. I make a Decree
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104285:17"/>
that every people, nation and language, who ſpeake any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the God of Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego, ſhall be cut
in pieces, and their houſes ſhall be made a dung-hil, &amp;c. <hi>This
the Scripture records as a worke of the Kings repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of Nineveh, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. by the decree of his Princes
and Nobles, proclaims a Faſt, and commands every one to <hi>cry
mightily to God,</hi> and <hi>to turne from his evill way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, let us ſee how the holy Ghoſt juſtifies this power
of the Magiſtrate in the times of the Goſpel: Firſt, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies
of the times of the Goſpel: Secondly, in divers places
in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>For Propheſies, the fore-named place, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 3. cannot
be put off: <hi>Iſa. 49. 23. Kings ſhall be thy nurſing fathers, and
Queens thy nurſing mothers.</hi> The protection of their civil peace
is not ſufficient to give them ſuch a denomination of nurſing
fathers and mothers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſay 60. 10. The ſonnes of ſtrangers ſhall build up thy walls, and
their Kings ſhall miniſter unto thee:</hi> They ſhall not only be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of them, but as Kings they ſhall miniſter to them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by their power: So <hi>Rev. 21. 24. The Kings of the earth ſhall
bring their glory and honour</hi> to the Church: there is ſuch a time
coming. This ſurely is more then meerly to protect their
outward peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the New Teſtament,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. He is thy Miniſter for
thy good. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. Submit your ſelves to every ordinance
of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream,
or unto Governours, which are ſent for the puniſhment of evill
doers, and the praiſe of them that doe well. <hi>Now ſeeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaks thus generally,</hi> For thy good, and for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of evill doers, and praiſe of them that doe well, Non diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guendum
ubi Scriptura non diſtinguit, <hi>Except the nature of the
thing require, why ſhould we diſtinguiſh where the Scripture
doth not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will ſay, The nature of the thing ſpoken of will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that it muſt be reſtrained to thoſe things that belong to
his cogniſance.</p>
               <p>Such a limitation muſt of neceſſity be granted; therefore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104285:18"/>
it is true that the Magiſtrate cannot command every good
thing, nor puniſh every evill; the abſtruſe controverſies in
Religion come not under the cogniſance of a Magiſtrate, as
a Magiſtrate; only ſuch things as are againſt the rules of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
juſtice and equity, and the common light of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
where he is to govern Chriſtians, for he is to enjoyn and
puniſh ſuch things only as if he were not; the community of
people which ſets him up, ought to enjoyn and puniſh, for
he hath his power from them: but of this more in the next
Principle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you ſhall ſay,</hi> But thoſe Scriptures ſpeaking of Civill
Magiſtrates, wee muſt underſtand them to be meant onely of civill
things.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate hath his appellation civil, becauſe the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that he exerciſes is civill, the things that he do are civill;
he cannot do the works of a Church-officer, by all the power
he hath, as adminiſter Sacraments, and the like; but this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not the uſe of his civil power, and the doing of external
acts upon the outward man, ſubſervient to ſpiritual good; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
what he doth, hath not any ſpirituall efficacy in it, for
then it were worſhip. Though he cannot work in a ſpirituall
way upon mans ſoule, by his power, it is not an Ordinance
ſet apart by God to that end, yet he may by the exerciſe of
his power upon the outward man, reſtrain it from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
act of evill, or bring it to an externall good; his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſtill that he exerciſes is civill, yet ordered to the help of
ſpirituall good, either <hi>removendo prohibentia,</hi> or <hi>applicando me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia
externa,</hi> or <hi>cohibenda a malo externo;</hi> removing outward
things that hindered, applying outward means, or keeping
from outward evils. Whatſoever Commandement requires
any duty, requires us to make uſe of all things that may help
us to the performance of that duty; if there be any civil, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
ſpiritual helps, we are bound to make uſe of all. Only
here lies the great doubt, <hi>Whether hath God appointed the uſe of
the Magiſtrates power to be a helpe to the things of Religion? Hath
God made this to be an Ordinance for the ſpirituall good of people?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it is by God an Ordinance for their civill good, is
plaine out of thoſe Scripture before mentioned; <hi>but how doth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104285:18"/>
it appeare that ever God intended it to be an Ordinance for their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
good?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What naturalnes there is in any thing,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> it hath it from God,
for nature is Gods worke, if there be a naturalneſs in it to
work upon the outward man, for the furtherance of ſpiritual
good; this is from God: if I ſhould uſe it to work upon the
inward man expecting a ſpirituall efficacy, then I make it an
ordinance to my ſelf, and ſin againſt God, preſuming to put
more in a creature of his, then it was appointed to. In this
conſiſted the evil of ceremonies, they were uſed in a ſpirituall
way, to work upon the heart of man, by vertue of that inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
that man put upon them, beyond what God in their
natural power ever put into them.</p>
               <p>But how can naturall and externall things be helps to things ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and divine?</p>
               <p>Any mans reaſon,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> yea ſenſe may tell him, that the taking
away externall hindrances, and the putting upon externall
uſe of divers things, may keep from much evill, and further
much good that is ſpirituall and divine; though it cannot
reach to the ſpiritualneſſe and divineneſſe of that good, yet it
reaches to the externall action, without which that divine
and ſpirituall good cannot be. Wherefore ſeeing the
New Teſtament ſets out the power of Magiſtrates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
ſubmiſſion to them in ſuch generall termes; from this
we may draw ſuch a concluſion, Therefore the Lord intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to leave Chriſtians for their ſubjection to Magiſtrates, to
the light of nature, &amp; to the equity of the generall rules that
were in Scripture before time; if God ſhould ſay, Ye are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
ſee you part not with that liberty Chriſt hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for you; we may give this account, Lord we found in thy
word that once thou didſt make uſe of the power of <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi>
in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp; in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> there was
nothing revealed to forbid their power in them; nay Lord,
<hi>Thou toldſt us there, that thou haſt appointed them for our good, and
to be a terrour to evill workes in the generall.</hi> From thence we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
that in our yeelding to their power, it was thy will
we ſhould make uſe of thoſe generall rules in Stripture wee
found before the times of the Goſpel, &amp; of the light of nature.
Being alſo perſwaded it was thy mind we ſhould make uſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104285:19"/>
of all the naturall helps we could for our ſpirituall advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
&amp; we found it recorded in thy Word that thou didſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of the exerciſe of ſuch power in the things of Religion,
even to thoſe who had only the light of nature to guide them
and being the uſe of it reached only to the outward man, we
did not ſee a neceſſity of a ſpeciall inſtitution for this, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what naturalneſs it had in it, to be an externall help was
put into it by thy ſelf, therefore we made uſe of it. God will
accept of this account. Add yet a conſideration or two.</p>
               <p>1. When the Apoſtles were convented before Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
about matters of Religion, we never find that they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for themſelves, You have no power to meddle with us in
the things of Religion, they belong to Jeſus Chriſt only who
is our King, &amp; to that government he hath ſet in his Church;
No, their plea was only the juſtneſs of their cauſe, that what
they profeſſed and preached was the truth of God, they did it
in obedience to God.</p>
               <p>2. If all men be bound to improve all the abilities, gifts,
talents they have for the propagation of the Goſpel, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
are bound to improve thoſe which are peculiar to
them; If a man hath more wiſdom then others, or a greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
or more friends, he is to make uſe of all theſe for helps
to the furtherance of Religion; if then a man hath more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then others, he is to improve that likewiſe, not onely by
countenancing what he conceiveth to be right, but by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means according to the dictates of Reaſon, not forb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

not be medled with.</head>
               <p>CErtainly Conſcience is a very tender thing; and as men
muſt take heed how they offer violence to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
ſo to the conſciences of others; It is ſuch a thing as
is not in ſubjection to any creature in Heaven or Earth, only
to God himſelf. <hi>Gerrard</hi> reports out of the Hiſtories of <hi>France</hi>
of a King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dominatum in conſcientias &amp; animas ſoli Deo relictum.</note> writing to his Nobles, uſed this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>The rule over conſciences and ſoules is left to God alone:</hi> And
of a King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> who was wont frequently to ſay, <hi>That
God had reſerved three things to himſelfe: 1. To make ſomething
of nothing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deum tria ſibi reſervaſſe; ex nihilo aliquid facere, futura ſcire, &amp; conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiis domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</note> 2. To know things future. 3. To rule over conſcience.
<hi>Maximilian</hi> the ſecond uſed to ſay, <hi>There was no tyranny more
intollerable then to ſeeke to rule over conſciences. Henry</hi> the third,
King of <hi>France,</hi> as the laſt pangs of death carried him into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
world, had this ſpeech, <hi>Learn of me that piety is a duty
of man unto God, over which worldly force hath no power;</hi> this
was ſpoken in the ſame Chamber where the Councell was

               <p>But for all this, the Devill muſt not be let alone, though
he be got into mens conſciences, God hath appointed no City
of refuge for him; if he flies to mens conſciences, as <hi>Joab</hi> did
to the horns of the Altar, he muſt be fetched from thence, or
falne upon there. Something may be done to men to keepe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104285:20"/>
them from evill, and to reduce them, notwithſtanding the
plea of their conſcience.</p>
               <p>But what may be done to a man in ſuch a caſe?<note place="margin">What ſhou'd be done to a man that pleads his conſcience.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, any man that pleads his conſcience, may be required
to give an account of his conſcience; it is not enough for him
to ſay, his conſcience puts him upon ſuch a thing, or keeps
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> him from ſuch a thing; he muſt give an account of the grounds
upon which his conſcience goes.</p>
               <p>The world requires us to give an account to every man of
that hope that is in us, if he requires it in a due way; wee are
bound to give no offence neither to the Jew nor Gentile: It
is againſt the light of nature, that men in a ſociety ſhould do
things of which they need give no account to any whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, due enquiry is to be made, whether the Devill
be indeed in the conſcience, it may be you ſhall finde him in
ſome other room of the ſoule, only he pretends to that as his
ſanctuary, hoping to eſcape better there then any where elſe;
if he ſhould be found in a mans will, he thinks he ſhould be
ſoon hunted out with violence, he could not ſcape there;
but he hopes men will deal more tenderly with conſcience;
therefore either thither he will get, or at leaſt he will give it
out he is got in there, hoping you will enquire after him no
further, when it is given out he hath taken refuge there, as a
Malefactor ſearched after; it may be is lurking in ſome houſe
not far from you; but that you may either not ſearch, or ceaſe
ſearching; he cauſes it to be given out, that he is got into
ſome ſtrong Caſtle, or ſome other Countrey where there is
little hope to come at him.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall it be known,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> whether the Devill be in a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
or not? Conſcience is an inward roome, who can ſee into it,
what, or who is there?</p>
               <p>It is a very hard thing to give a judgment,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but theſe notes
may help us much in diſcerning.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, if I ſee a mans owne private intereſt is much engaged
in what he pretends conſcience for, this may be enough to
raiſe ſuſpition, though it can be no determining rule; for a
man may in ſome things have his conſcience put him upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104285:20"/>
that where there is much of his owne intereſt; but this brings
him under much ſuſpition, if the thing be not exceeding clear
to the view of every man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if in the courſe of a mans life, he appears not to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
be much under the command of his conſcience, but can take
liberty as he pleaſes; if indeed a man in the generall courſe of
his life appears to be very conſcientious; we had need take
heed how we meddle with ſuch a man in a way of oppoſition,
except the evill we ſee now in him be very clear and groſſe;
but that man, who in the common courſe of his life, can tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
with his conſcience, hath deprived himſelfe of the benefit
of this plea, as a man may forfeit the benefit of his freedome
in the City by miſdemeanour: ſo the benefit that otherwiſe
might be had of ſuch a plea may be forfeited by ſuch looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when the account a man gives cannot in any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
way be judged ſuch, giving allowance to all his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
as ſhould probably miſ-lead him ſo groſly, as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
he is miſlead. We muſt grant, that thoſe may be reaſons
to one which are not to another; but when they appeare ſo
groſſe, as after all allowances to weakneſſes, they cannot in
any common underſtanding reach to ſuch a concluſion, we
may at leaſt ſuſpect very much, that the evill of this man lies
not in his conſcience, but ſome where elſe; yet we ſhould
not do well to be too haſtly and violent with ſuch men; it may
be a man for a while may be ſo over-powred, that he is not
able to render a rationall account of his wayes, but wait a
while, and deal with him tenderly in love; conſider his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
diſabilities, his temptations, give him all the allowance
you can; if one means prevail not to ſhew him his error, try
another; if at one time you do no good upon him, ſee what
may be done at another; conſider, is it not poſſible, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſuch weak things may appear to the conſcience of a man
that hath ſo many weakneſſes, and lies under ſo many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
to be for the preſent ſuch grounds as he cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſin deny; and if ſo, you had need deale tenderly with ſuch
a man, except the groſſeneſs of the evill requires ſeverity.</p>
               <p>4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. If a man be proud and turbulent in his carriage, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:104285:21"/>
that you may know the Devill is rather in the will then in
the conſcience; though an erroneous conſcience may cauſe
one to hold faſt an errour, yet it does not put upon proud,
ſcornfull, turbulent behaviour: When a man by reaſon of his
conſcience (it may be the weakneſſe of it) differs from his
brethren, hee had need carry himſelf with all humility and
meekneſs, &amp; ſelf-denyal in all other things; he ſhould be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be a ſervant to every man, in what lawfully he may,
that thereby he may ſhew to all, that it is not from any wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
but meerly the tenderneſs of his conſcience, that he
cannot come off to that which his brethren can doe, whom
yet he reverences, and in his carriage towards them, ſhews that
he yet eſteems them his betters; but if a man that is weak, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much beneath others in parts and graces, ſhall carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
high, imperious, contemning and vilifying thoſe who
differ from him, and be contentious with them: There is great
reaſon to think, that the corruption is in the will rather then
any where elſe; if there ſhould be ſome conſcience yet in theſe
men, their heart-diſtempers may juſtly forfeit their right of
pleading their conſciences. Thoſe who oppoſe them, if they
doe it in a Chriſtian way, may juſtifie what they doe before
God; if God ſhould call them to an account, and ſay, why
did you deal ſo with ſuch men who profeſſed they were put
upon what they held and did, by their conſciences; If they can
anſwer thus, Lord thou knoweſt we were willing to have
dealt with them in all tenderneſſe, if we could have ſeen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſneſs
in their carriage; but we ſaw nothing but
ſcornfulneſs, pride, imperiouſneſs, turbulency, conceitednes,
we could ſee nothing of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt acting them
in their way; this their carriage perſwaded us, that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
was got rather into their wills then their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. When a man is not willing to make uſe of meanes to
inform his conſcience, not of thoſe meanes that are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his owne principles, but goes on peremptorily and
ſtoutly: Surely, when we ſee many of our Brethren differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from us, our reſpect to them ſhould gain ſo much at leaſt
from us, that if there by any means left unuſed, for the further
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104285:21"/>
trying our opinions, or informing our judgements, we
ſhould make uſe of that meanes, a conſcientious heart will
doe ſo.</p>
               <p>The ſixt note added, will ſeale up all; when a man by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
or Scripture is ſo put to it, as he muſt either renounce his
errour, or flye from ſome of his own principles, he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deny his principles, then yeeld himſelfe convinced of his
errour; yea, when thoſe principles are of great moment. The
man that doth thus is the man ſpoken of, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 11. that is
<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, condemned of himſelfe, <hi>An Heretick after the
firſt and ſecond admonition reject, becauſe he is ſelfe-condemned;</hi>
wee muſt not reject every man that erres in every little thing,
no not after two or three admonitions, that was a prelatical,
tyrannicall rule, but he muſt be an Heretick, and erring ſo
groſly, as he is ſelf-condemned in his errour, and ſuch a man
ſuffers not for his conſcience, when he is rejected, but for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
againſt his conſcience.</p>
               <p>But who can know when a man is condemned of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?<note place="margin">Object.</note>
the judgement of a mans owne conſcience is a ſecret
thing.</p>
               <p>This is the ſtrength of this hold the Devil gets into,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> he
thinks he gets ſo deep, that you cannot get to it to find him
out, and as for Gods diſpleaſure who knows their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
theſe men will venture that. But by this Scripture, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.
it is clear, that a mans conſcience may be ſo far ſeen into, as
there may be a judgment paſſed upon a man, that he is a ſelf-condemned
man: To what purpoſe otherwiſe ſerves this
Scripture? it is not like this Heretick would acknowledg that
he was ſelf-condemned, but yet the Apoſtle makes this the
ground why he ſhould be rejected; As if he ſhould ſay, You
ſee he wil go againſt his own principles, againſt what his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
tells him is truth, meerly to maintain a wicked Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
that he is infected withall; let him therefore plead what he
will, reject him, for his own conſcience condemns him, and
GOD is greater then his Conſcience, and knowes all
things.</p>
               <p>The third thing that is to be done to a man who pleads his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
conſcience for evill, is, the great ſnare and danger he brings
himſelf into, is to be declared to him, that by giving way to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104285:22"/>
let evill into his <hi>conſcience,</hi> he puts himſelf into ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as whatſoever he doth, he muſt needs ſin againſt God,
ſo long as he holds his errour: Evill gets into the <hi>conſciences</hi>
of many very eaſily, becauſe they think the dictates of their
<hi>conſciences</hi> will be ſufficient to bear them out in what they
doe;<note place="margin">Conſcientia er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronea non obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat.</note> but they are deceived, for an erroneous <hi>conſcience</hi> does
not bind, you ſin notwithſtanding your <hi>conſcience</hi> bids you
do it; and if you goe againſt this erroneous <hi>conſcience,</hi> you
ſinne too; what a miſerable ſnare is this? you had need look
to your ſelves then, and take heed what you let into your <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth thing is, to charge him, and if it be in a matter
of conſequence, to adjure him in the Name of God (who is
the ſearcher of the hearts of men, and will judg them at the
great day accordingly) that he deals plainly and ſincerely,
not to dare to put a pretence upon that which he knows his
<hi>conſcience</hi> cannot juſtifie him in; if there be indeed any conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſneſs
in the man, this will ſtartle him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But it may be this will not prevail, wherefore in the fifth
place, whatſoever a man holds, though his <hi>conſcience</hi> be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo much taken with it, yet if it cannot ſtand with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of godlineſs, but deſtroys it, if this man be in a Chriſtian
ſociety after all means uſed to reduce him, if he ſtill perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veres
in it, he is, notwithſtanding his <hi>conſcience,</hi> to be caſt out
of the ſociety of the Saints; this is not a little matter, if a
man hath any <hi>conſcience</hi> in him, it cannot but be a dreadfull
thing to him: If poyſon be got into a glaſs, and you cannot
waſh it out, the poyſon and glaſs too is to be thrown into the
ſinck: Such a man as this is, with the <hi>conſcience</hi> that he hath,
is to be thrown upon the dung-hill. If a man by his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
cuts himſelf off from the myſticall body of Chriſt, the
Church may cut him off from his viſible, he hath forfeited his
Church-priviledger.</p>

off the wantonneſſe of his ſpirit, and the neglect of meanes:
In times of liberty there is very great wantonneſſe in mens
ſpirits, they ſtand as in an equall ballance to receive truth
or errour; every little thing caſts the ballance in many mens

not be offended though he give him a nip perhaps: but if he

               <p>
                  <hi>One ſtep I think may be gone farther.</hi> Suppoſe a man be not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/>
wanton, but ſerious, and neglect no meanes to informe his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and yet hee cannot yeeld, what ſhall bee done to ſuch a
man?</p>
               <p>Though ſuch a man ſhould be dealt with in much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and love,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> yet in ſuch things as by his weakneſſe he
makes himſelfe leſſe ſerviceable to the Common-wealth, or
Church, then other men, who have more ſtrength; he may
be denyed ſome priviledges and benefits that are granted to
others. I inſtance in that opinion of ſome Anabaptiſts, who
deny the lawfulneſſe of War; ſuppoſe their conſciences after
much ſeriouſneſſe in the uſe of means, cannot be ſatisfied; yet
ſeeing by this error of theirs they are made leſſe uſefull in the
State then others, they ſhould not think it much though they
be denyed many priviledges and accommodations that are
granted to others, who venture their lives for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the State. If a mans body be weak, he cannot help it,
yet by it he is not ſo uſefull as others, why ſhould he think
much that he hath not whatſoever others by ſtrength are able
to attain to? Suppoſe a man ſhould have ſuch a principle in
his conſcience, that the K. hath an abſolute arbitrary power;
though it be his conſcience, yet by it he is diſinabled from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104285:24"/>
imployment and preferment in places of truſt. So for the
Church, ſuppoſe the government of it by Prelats had been
lawfull, (which now we know was not) there had been no
evill in denying to thoſe who in conſcience could not ſubmit
to it, their preferments of Deanries and Prebends, and the

               <p>But leſt what I ſay in this ſhould be abuſed, you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
this denyall of places of profit or honour to men, becauſe
of that which their conſciences will not ſuffer them to yeeld to,
onely ſuch places, as the tenderneſſe of their conſciences in ſuch
a point makes them unfit to manage, if becauſe their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
differ from you in one thing, you will take advantage againſt
them in other things that have no dependance upon that wherein
they differ from you, and make them ſuffer in thoſe things too, you
now (to ſay no worſe) begin to grow neare to a way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
and tyrannie over your brethren, which Chriſt, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
with. Wee accounted it in the Biſhops not neare, but
come up to tyrannie and perſecution, when they would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſuch as could not conforme to their Church-diſcipline and
Ceremonies, not ſo much as to teach children the Grammar, or to
practiſe Phyſicke, or to preach Chriſt in places where there was
no preaching, but people lived in darkeneſſe, periſhing for want of
knowledge. What dependance had theſe things upon their diſcipline
and Ceremonies, ſuppoſing they had been right? <hi>Yes,</hi> they would fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>But ſeeing there was no dependance between their errours,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
(if you wil call them ſo) &amp; theſe things, to deny the Church

               <p>Suppoſe a man differs from his brethren in point of
Church-Diſcipline, muſt not this man have a place in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
therefore? Though he ſees not the reaſon of ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
in the Church, yet God hath endued him with a ſpirit
of volour, and he underſtands what Military Diſcipline
means; muſt he not have a place in a Colledg to teach youth
Logick and Philoſophy? may be not preach Jeſus Chriſt to
poor ignorant creatures? if you feare he will divulge his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,

ſurely ſome other courſe may be taken whereby he
may ſuffer as much as ſuch a fault comes to; but therefore to
deprive Church and State of what abilities God has given
him, which might be very uſefull to them, and that before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

what is to be done to a man that pleads his conſcience in
things which we conceive are not right: I would now ſpeak
a word or two to men who have to deal with their brethrens
conſciences, and then to thoſe who plead their conſciences
for their freedome.</p>

What, this is your conſcience? your conſcience forſooth

at thoſe who are ſo nice-conſcienced, who ſtand upon
ſmall matters; what if at the great day Chriſt ſhall own theſe
to be truly conſcientious, and honour them for obeying the
voyce of their conſciences in ſmall things, for not daring to
offend them in any thing, where wilt thou appear? what is
like to become of thee then? Or if their conſciences be weak,
not rightly inform'd, yet Chriſt expects thou ſhouldſt ſeek
to heal, to ſtrengthen them, not to jeer and ſcorn them;

               <p>In the clearing of this thing, I ſhall not argue for one ſide
or other, I ſhall only ſhew you that there is in effect as much
means to prevent or ſubdue error, hereſie, ſchiſme in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall
way, (which you call by another name) as there
is in that way, other Brethren endeavour to hold forth. I am
not here to plead what is right, what is wrong, but onely to
ſhew you the difference is not great, ſo far as concernes this
thing; what one holds, the ſame the other holds in effect;
if this be done with clearneſs, then the great out-cry againſt
that way, as fomenting diviſions by opening a gap to all kind
of liberty, will I hope be ſtilled, and your hearts in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſatisfied. I confeſſe were it, as many of you are made to
believe, that that way gives liberty, or at leaſt hath no helpe
againſt all errors &amp; hereſies, it muſt be acknowledged it were
a means of moſt fearfull diviſions, and in no caſe to be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
But certainly you will find it far otherwiſe. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
I am now about, (namely, how far Brethren agree in
a matter of ſo great moment, and in that which they are by
ſome thought moſt to diſagree in, and their diſagreement
moſt feared, as a matter of dangerous conſequence) I know
cannot be an unpleaſing argument to you, although we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ignorant that there is a generation of men that are vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when they hear how near their brethren come to them in
way of agreement, it ſerves more for their turns to have the
diſtance wide, they would keep open the wounds, yea widen
them, but God forbid there ſhould be ſuch a ſpirit in you.</p>
               <p>Wherefore for your help in this thing, theſe two things are to be
premiſed.</p>
               <p>1. That the only way the Church hath to keep downe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
or hereſies is ſpirituall; as for other means they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſicall
to the Church; this all acknowledge: as for ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Magiſtrate, if he pleaſes to interpoſe, to that both
they and we muſt yeeld.</p>
               <p>2. The vertue of ſpiritual power works not upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, by its prevailing upon conſcience; therefore ſo
far as men are conſcientious, ſo far it works, and no farther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:104285:26"/>
Now then ſee what difference there is in the Congregationall
way from the Presbyterian, for the prevailing with mens
Conſciences, to reduce to the trueth thoſe who goe aſtray from
it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thoſe in the Congregationall may acknowledg that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
they are bound in conſcience to give account of their ways to
Churches about them, or to any other who ſhall require it;
this is not in an arbitrary way, but as a duty that they owe
to God and man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they acknowledge that Synods of others Miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and Elders about them are an ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt
for the helping the Church againſt errors, ſchiſmes, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</p>

Chriſt admoniſh men or Churches in his name, when they ſee
evils continuing in, or growing upon the Church, and their
admonitions carry with them the authority of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as there ſhall be cauſe, they may declare men or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Churches to be ſubverters of the faith; or otherwiſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the nature of the offence, to ſhame them before all the
Churches about them.</p>
               <p>5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. They may by a ſolemn act in the name of Jeſus Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
refuſe any further communion with them, till they repent.</p>

Chriſt, that theſe erring people or Churches are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into fellowſhip with any the Churches of Chriſt, nor
to have communion with one another in the ordinances of
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now all this being done in Chriſts name, is this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to prevail with conſcience?</p>
               <p>You will ſay, What if they care not for all this?</p>
               <p>

               <p>You will ſay, They may doe all this with more authority then the
Congregationall way will allow.</p>
               <p>We need not contend about the word <hi>Authority:</hi> But, how<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>

If you ſay, private Brethren may admoniſh, and declare in
the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This is more then if any private Brethren ſhould doe the
ſame thing; for a Synod is a ſolemne Ordinance of Chriſt,

               <p>
                  <hi>But our Brethren ſay,</hi> There is one meanes more in their way
then the Congregationall way hath, that is, if the ſixe former will not

thoſe who are for the Presbyteriall, and thoſe who are
for the Congregationall way, in reference to the matter in

with an authority of Chriſt by thoſe former ſix things; for
Hereticall Congregations, or perſons are judged and declared

walke with them alſo: why muſt it needs be now urged with
violence, ſo as to divide elſe? and although we hold not the
ſeventh, yet there is an ingredient in the ſixt, that hath in it
the ſtrength of the ſeventh? For wherein lyes the ſtrength of
the ſeventh above the reſt? is it not in this? that it is the laſt

are rigid, and cauſe diviſions on the other hand; If any thing
be conceived evil, either in opinion or practiſe, if inſtructions

Principle to Churches and States, to mankind. This Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

into their hands, or hope to get it. This muſt needs be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding

about what is good or evill, ſcarce three men agree any long
time in their apprehenſions of ſome things to be evil; if then
nothing that is conceived to be evill muſt be ſuffered, there
muſt needs be continuall oppoſition between man and
man.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This ſubjects the generality of men to ſuffer for many
things which they can ſee no evill in, but are perſwaded is
good; this raiſes an animoſity againſt thoſe by whom they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
though a man can ſubject his body and eſtate to another,
he cannot ſubject his reaſon to another: In the common ways
of juſtice men are puniſhed for thoſe things, which if they be
guilty of, they cannot but acknowledg themſelves to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

And for the fact, they are tryed in ſuch a way, as they cannot
but acknowledg is fit in reaſon to be ſubjected to; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though they ſuffer much, yet they will yeeld it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>But if this Principle prevails, every man almoſt is made ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to puniſhment for thouſands of things that he can ſee no

                  <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> May not men be puniſhed for things that they
ſee no reaſon why they ſhould be puniſhed? for many malefactors may
eaſily eſcape thus; guilt will quickely blind men, they will ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

               <p>It is not what men ſay they ſee no reaſon for,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> or what it
may be they indeed ſee no reaſon for; but what men cannot
ſee reaſon for, though they ſhould bend their underſtandings,
and ſtrength to the uttermoſt; yea, what the generality of
man kind, and of that community of which a man is, cannot
poſſibly ſee reaſon for, it is impoſſible for the generality of
mankind, &amp; the community of any Church or State, though
they ſhould be never ſo diligent to find out what is good, and
what is evill, yet to be able to underſtand every thing that is
evill, to be ſo.</p>
               <p>If you will have laws made againſt all things, that ſuch as
are in authority conceive to be evill, then you muſt give them
power to judge, not only by the rules of common juſtice and
equity, and puniſh for the breach of them, but by the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
that their own raiſed parts ſhall ſuggeſt unto them,
and to puniſh men for not being raiſed to that height of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
themſelves have; but this power is more then is
fit to be given to any men upon earth. This would bring ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
both in State and Church.</p>
               <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">1. The civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates not to puniſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that is evill.</note> from whence is the riſe of all Civill Power that
any man, or ſociety of men, are inveſted with? is it not from
the generality of the men, over whom they have power? Is it
not the power which they themſelves had, and which they
might have kept amongſt themſelves? For who can ſay, that
a <hi>Democracy</hi> is a ſinfull Government in it ſelfe? True, God
eſtabliſhes it upon particular men by his Ordinance, after it is
given to them by the people, but the firſt riſe is from them;
and if ſo, then they ſhould make no law to bring thoſe men
under puniſhment, who gave them their power, but ſuch a
Law as theſe men may poſſibly come to underſtand, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
and juſt, for they act their power: and it muſt be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that they never intended to give a power beyond this.
Thoſe who give power, may limit power; they may give part

the power ſhall be exerciſed, it ſhall goe ſo far, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the utmoſt limits cannot goe beyond theſe rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
which they are capable to underſtand. Hence it is, that
all men in our Law, are tryed <hi>Per pares,</hi> by their Peers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is to be ſuppoſed, that they are to be accounted of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
and to be puniſhed; only ſo as thoſe who are equall
with themſelves, ſhall judg them worthy; and this likewiſe is
the reaſon that Courts are in publique, no man is to be ſhut
out, becauſe all men that will may behold the tryall, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the proceedings of Juſtice againſt offenders: It muſt needs
be ſuppoſed then, that the rules by which the Judges go, muſt
be the rules of common equity and juſtice, that all men may
underſtand; beyond what theſe rules will reach to, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
State is not to puniſh, not every thing that men of
deep judgements and ſtrong parts, may apprehend to be
evill.</p>
               <p>The power of the Church likewiſe extends not to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of every thing, that either may by the Governours
of it, be conceived to be evill, or that is indeed evill.</p>
               <p>As the riſe of the Civil power ſhews, that only ſuch things
are to be puniſhed by it, as are againſt the common rules of
Juſtice and Equity; ſo the riſe of Church power will ſhew,
that only ſuch things as are againſt common rules, ſuch
things as ſome way or other appeare to be againſt conviction,
and are obſtinately perſiſted in, are by Church cenſure to be
puniſhed.</p>
               <p>The riſe of Church power is indeed different from the riſe
of the Civill, yet agrees in this, that it limits the Church, as
the riſe of the Civill doth the Civill power. The power of
Governors in the State ariſes from the people, and they act
their power that the Common-wealth gives to them: But the
Governours of the Church have not their power from the
members of the Church, but from Chriſt; neither do they act
in the name of the Church, but in the name of Chriſt. It is
true, the Members of the Church do deſign ſuch men to ſuch
an Office; but being deſigned, now they are inveſted with the
power of Jeſus Chriſt, they exerciſe his power, and do act in
his name, not in the name of the Church.</p>

You will ſay, ſeeing the Church chooſeth their Officers as well as
the Common-wealth theirs: How doth it appeare, that the Officers
of the Church doe not exerciſe the power of the Church, as well
as the Officers of the Common-wealth, the power of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth?</p>
               <p>Theſe two things ſhew the difference clearly.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>

by their power, but that which the Common-wealth may do
without them, if they were not; they might have kept their
Government in a Democracy, and if they had pleaſed, done
any act of power by a major vote: But it is not ſo in the
Church; if the Church be without Officers, they cannot doe
that which belongs to Officers to do, they can have no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                  </gap>: but if once a man be choſen to be an Officer in the
Church, all that power that ever any in that Office had ſince
Chriſts time, in any Church in all the chriſtian world, or ever
can have to the coming of Chriſt again, falls upon him: If a
man be choſen a Paſtor, he hath as full power as ever any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
had upon the face of the earth, or can have by any Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
power: The Church cannot limit him, and ſay, You
ſhall be a Paſtor for ſuch ends and purpoſes, but no further:
The ſame may be ſaid of the ruling, none upon earth ever
had, or can have more power of ruling, then this man who
is choſen into that Office. It is not thus in the State, all
Kings have not the like power; in ſome Countries Kingly
power reacheth ſo far, in others further, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of the Lawes of the Countries, the agreements between
them and the people: all Dukes, all States, all Parliaments

ſuppoſing the riſe of his ignorance be not ſome wilfull neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect:
But if it be a ſinn committed through wilfulneſſe, or
continued in obſtinately, then ſayes Chriſt, I will have this
man ſmart for ſuch an offence; now comes in the power of
the Church-officers, to doe in the Name of Chriſt what he
would have done: But if they goe further, then they exerciſe
a tyrannicall power, if they will puniſh every thing which
they conceive to be evill, whether committed through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and weakneſſe, or wilfulneſſe and obſtinacy, in this
they take upon them a higher power of puniſhing then Chriſt
(according to the tenor of the Goſpel) exerciſes. For my
part, ſayes Chriſt, I goe but thus far with my power; If I ſee
any of my Church ſin through weakneſſe and ignorance, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to underſtand and do my will, and mourning that
they know no more, they do no better, I wil paſſe by all; but
if any ſhall appear wilfull and obſtinate, I will deale ſeverely
with ſuch a one.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, If men have meanes of knowledge and ſtrength, and
yet continue ignorant and weake, ſhould not ſuch be dealt with as
wilfull and obſtinate?</p>
               <p>No,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſays Chriſt, I do not goe by any ſuch rule, for I have

to convince men, yet I ſee after all meanes I uſe, there
are many, who meerly through their weakneſſe are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
I pitty them, I deal gently with them, I pardon them.
Thoſe then who will go further, they will puniſh for every
evill; and if they uſe means to convince them, and they be
not convinced, they will judge them obſtinate, and proceed
againſt them accordingly; theſe challenge and exerciſe not
the power of Chriſt, but Antichriſt. If Chriſt ſhould deale ſo
with them, as they deal with their brethren, it would go ill
with them; If Chriſt ſhould ſay, whatſoever I ſee evil in you,

I will not ſuffer it in you; if you are ignorant notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that power over your Brethren (and that in Chriſts name)
that you would not have Chriſt exerciſe over you.</p>
               <p>Both the Civill State and Church muſt take us as wee are
faln from that integrity of our firſt creation, not as we came
firſt out of Gods hands: God the Creator may (indeed) pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

ſo, Man muſt deal with his fellow-creatures, as men imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect;

only of heart, but of externall converſation, that God may,
yea God-man our Mediator lookes upon us in a ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,

Firſt, this contending about every difference of opinion, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
urging our Brethren with what we conceive right, in matters
of controverſie, croſſeth the end of Chriſt in his Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of differing gifts to his Church, and humane ſociety, and
his revealing truths in a different way, ſome more darkely,
ſome more clearly; Chriſt could eaſily have given ſuch gifts
to all, or revealed all truths ſo clearly, that every man ſhould
have been able to have ſeen every truth. Surely Chriſt did not
diſperſe gifts, and reveal truths ſo differently, to that end,
that there might be continual matter of ſtrife and contention
in his Church, and in humane ſocieties; not that there ſhould
be provocation to the exerciſe of cruelty one upon another,
but rather that there might be the exerciſe of love, charity,
forbearance, meekneſs, long-ſuffering of one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Chriſt bids us, charges us to be at peace amongſt our
ſelves. If we ſhould ſay, O Lord Jeſus, wouldſt thou have us
be at peace one with another? there are many things in thy
Word, that we and our Brethren have different apprehenſions
of; for though (bleſſed be thy Name) the great neceſſary
things of ſalvation be clearly revealed, yet many other things
are ſo dark to us, that through our weakneſs we cannot all of
us ſee the ſame thing. Now is it thy mind, O bleſſed Saviour,
that one man, who conceives himſelf to underſtand the truth,
(and that it may be rightly) compell another to his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
And doſt thou alſo require, that wee muſt not bring
our judgments to our Brethrens till thy light brings them?
How then is it poſſible that we ſhould be at peace one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother?</p>
               <p>Do not all Divines ſay, There are ſome things in Scripture
wherein the Elephant may ſwimm, ſome things where the

ſtraine Juſtice ſo high, as to make it <hi>ſumma juſtitia,</hi> which
is the degeneration of it: As Phyſitians ſay of the uttermoſt

it up to the higheſt; for it is adminiſtred by men full of

               <p>3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. If men goe upon this principle, they will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of oppoſing truth as well as falſhood, and compelling to
falſhood as well as to truth; for in matters doubtful &amp; contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
amongſt good and peaceable men, it is not eaſie to have
any ſuch grounded confidence, as to be out of all danger of
miſtake; there is more confidence needfull in a thing that we
impoſe upon others, then in what we practice our ſelves; If a
thing be to us rather true then otherwiſe, we may lawfully do
it; but this is not enough to be a ground for the impoſing it
upon others, who cannot ſee it to be a truth; in ſuch a caſe we
had need be very ſure. The weak driſlings of our probabilities,
gueſſes, &amp; opinions, are not enough to cauſe the ſtream of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
mans conſcience to ſtop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea to turne its courſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way; eſpecially conſidering, that in ſuch things we have
oftentimes miſgiving thoughts our ſelves; yea, and not long
ſince we were confident, that what wee now condemne was
true; and what we now are ready to enjoyn others, we then
did as confidently condemn. There muſt be great care taken,
that when we ſeek to pluck up tares, wee plucke not up the
wheat alſo; this may be underſtood of things, of truths and
falſhoods, as wel as of perſons; we may be miſtaken in the one
as well as in the other. <hi>Pluck not up the tares.</hi> Chriſt does not
ſorbid caſting out any wicked men from the Church; but as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104285:34"/>
                  <hi>Hierome</hi> hath it, in thoſe Countries tares were very like the
wheat; therfore take heed, ſays Chriſt, what you do in pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up; when you have to deale with men whoſe condition is
any way doubtful, be ſure they be hypocrites, or elſe meddle
not with them, do not pluck them up upon every ſurmiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you think they are not right, for then you may pluck up
a wheat as well as a tare, he may prove to be a godly man;
therefore you had better let tares grow; If you do but thinke
that ſuch men are not right, you were better let them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in the Church, then by venturing upon them, to be in
danger to pluck up the wheat.</p>
               <p>Thus in reſpect of things good or evill, there are ſome
things apparently evill, they are rather thiſtles and bryers,
then tares, we may freely pluck up them; but other things,
though perhaps they may prove evil, yet they have ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to good, ſo as you can hardly diſcern whether they be
good or evill. Now ſaith Chriſt, take heed what you do then,
do not out of eagerneſs oppoſe all evill, to get out every tare,
pluck out ſome wheat too; what if that you oppoſe with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
as evill, prove to be good? you had better let forty
tares ſtand, then pluck up one wheat.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If men take this power upon them, to compell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
men to do whatſoever they conceive good, and to deny or
forbear whatſoever they conceive evil, they take more power
upon them then ever the Apoſtles took. The government of
the Saints under the Apoſtles, was a great deale more milde,
ſweet, gentle then this. The rule the Apoſtles went by, <hi>Phil.</hi>
3. 15. was, <hi>Let therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded;
and if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveale even
this unto you; nevertheleſſe, whereunto wee have already attained,
let us walke.</hi> If any ſhould be otherwiſe minded then I or the

This rule, <hi>Zanchy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> would repeat a thouſand
time; and <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> hath a good note upon this place, he
does not ſay, God will bring them to it, if they be otherwiſe
minded, but God wil reveal it, noting the love and goodneſs
of God to thoſe who are otherwiſe minded, excuſing them
that it was not through wickedneſs, but for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104285:35"/>
that they did otherwiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. where the Apoſtles and
Elders were met together, the furtheſt they would take upon
themſelves, was to lay no other burden but thoſe neceſſary
things. The falſe teachers put a yoke upon them, which was
ſuch a burthen, that neither they nor their fore-fathers could
bear, <hi>v.</hi> 10. yet it was no juridicall authority that theſe had
over them; ſurely the yoke they put upon them, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all was but doctrinall: But for us, ſay the Apoſtles,
we finding what the mind of the Holy Ghoſt is, dare not yoke
you as they did; all that we burden you with, is theſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
things, no Church-officers, no Synod can go further then
this, but certainly every matter in controverſie amongſt godly
and peaceable men cannot be conceived to be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. is a very uſefull place for this, <hi>Him that is weak

him, though he underſtands not all you do; do not trouble
him, neither with nor for doubtfull things: <hi>One believeth he
may eate all things, another who is weake eateth herbes; let not
him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not; neither let him that
eateth not, judge him that eateth,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>One man eſteemeth one
day above another, another eſteemeth every day alike; let every man
be fully perſwaded in his owne minde.</hi> Upon this he gives gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
rules, to doe all to the glory of God; all theſe people
were not in the right, for a man not to eate fleſh out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
when the thing was not forbidden, certainly was a
ſin; or to make conſcience of a holy day, which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not, was a ſinne: Now the Apoſtle did not come with his
authority, and ſay, I will make you leave off keeping ſuch
days, or you ſhall eate, or to abſtain thus as you do, is evill,
and it muſt not be ſuffered in you. No, the Apoſtle lays no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall
authority upon them, but tells them, That <hi>every
man muſt be fully perſwaded in his own mind, in what he doth; and
who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? the Lord hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him.</hi> And yet the Governors of the Churches in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times might upon much ſtronger grounds have ſtood
upon ſuch a principle, then any Governours of the Church
now can; there was leſſe reaſon why they ſhould ſuffer any
difference in opinion or practice amongſt them, then why we
ſhould ſuffer differences amongſt us; for they had men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104285:35"/>
them immediately inſpired, who could dictate the
mind of Chriſt infallibly, they could tell them the certaine
meaning of any Scripture. The burden of being under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of ſuch men in points of differences, had not
been ſo great as ſubjection to any Governors now in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
would be; our differences are uſually about the meaning
of ſuch or ſuch Scriptures, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> both ſides think they have
the right, &amp; profeſs one to another, as in the preſence of God
the ſearcher of all hearts, that if they could but ſee the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſuch a Scripture to be ſo as their brethren believe it is,
they would ſoon agree: and yet though there were in thoſe
Primitive times ſuch meanes of reconciling differences more
then we have, yet there was much mutual toleration amongſt
them; they uſed no compulſive violence to force thoſe who
through weakneſs differed from them, to come up to their
judgments or practice. Yes, It is alſo more tolerable in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
not to tolerate any difference in opinion or practice,
becauſe Firſt, they believe they have an infallible Judg to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
all Controverſies. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. They hold implicite faith in the
judgment of their Clergie, to be ſufficient warrant to juſtifie
the belief or practice of the people, or of any particular man,
and yet they ſuffer differences in opinions and practices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them; They have their ſeverall orders of their Monks,
Prieſts, Friars, Jeſuites, they differ very much one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and yet agreeing in the root, they are ſuffered, ſuppoſing
thoſe two helps to union; they have an infallible Judg, and
implicite faith; wee have cauſe either to admire at their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
in their mutuall bearing one with another, or at
the diſquietneſs, the rigidneſs of ſpirits amongſt us, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear with far leſſer things in their brethren differing from
them; for we profeſſe, we know no ſuch externall in fallible
Judg, upon whom we may depend; neither dare we warrant
an implicite faith. We teach men, that every man muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
in his own heart, muſt ſee the rule of his own actions,
muſt give an account of his own way to God: now what can
men that have the moſt gracious &amp; peaceable ſpirits, you can

their brethren believe or do, they muſt ſee the authority of the
Word to ground their faith or actions; and for the preſent,

may ſeem to be great, but either you or your poſterity hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may ſee cauſe to bleſſe God for that light hath been, or

principle, the governors of the Churches muſt ſuppreſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they conceive not to be right, to what purpoſe ſhould
ſhould there be arguing and diſcuſſing of ſeverall judgements
and ſeverall ways?</p>
               <p>You will ſay, Thoſe who are the Governours, they, or thoſe whom
they call to conſult with, may argue and diſcuſſe, but not others.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, This lays a great temptation to idleneſs and pride
before the guides of the Church: Men are naturally ſubject to
ſloth, and may not this principle ſuggeſt ſuch a temptation as
this? What need we take care or pains to ſearch into truths, to
be able to convince gain-ſayers, to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Scripture &amp; Reaſon, ſeeing we have power to compel men
to yeeld to us? And men who can do leaſt by Reaſon and
Scripture, are many times ſtrongeſt in their violence this way,
this ſtrength muſt come in to make up their other weakneſſe.
But it may be <hi>Conſcience</hi> will not let them compell men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently;
it will tell them they muſt ſeek firſt to convince men:
but becauſe the ſeeking to ſatisfie other mens conſciences in
things differing from us, is a troubleſom work, the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that this principle preſents, may at leaſt prevail thus far,
that ſeeing beſides means of conviction by arguing they have
another help at hand to keep down error, namely, compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory
violence, making men who differ from them, to ſuffer
for thoſe things; therefore not to trouble themſelves very
much in the way of ſeeking to convince, but for their owne
eaſe to rid their hands of ſuch a burthenſom work, to caſt
the trouble, and lay heavy burdens upon their brethren, this
is eaſie for them to do, though hard for their brethren to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
But the Tables may turn one day, wherein the ſufferers
ſhall have the greateſt eaſe, &amp; the inflicters the ſoreſt burthen.
But God forbid that their brethren ſhould lay it upon them,
though it were put into their power to do it.</p>
               <p>The temptation to pride is not leſs, neither are mens hearts
leſſe prone to this. If it prevails, what domineering is there
like to be of one over another, yea of ſome few over many? If
they judg in things never ſo doubtful, all muſt yeeld, at leaſt
for their profeſſion and practice. This is a great power to be
given to men over men in matters of faith and godlineſs. This
is Lording it over Gods inheritance. It is obſervable, when
the <hi>Church</hi> was in the loweſt condition, this power was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;
the power of making Canons in doubtful things to bind
under penalties: And when this power was loweſt, as in the
Primitive times, then the Church was higheſt.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, This will be a means to bring groſſe ignorance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
upon the face of the Churches &amp; of the world: For, firſt, if
men ſhall not be ſuffered to profeſs or practice otherwiſe then
Governors in Church or State ſhall determine, they will not
take pains to find out the truth themſelves, but rather take
things implicitely, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the eaſieſt way; they wil think it to
little purpoſe to take pains in examining things, when after
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104285:37"/>
all is done, they muſt be bound up at leaſt in their profeſſion
and practice, to what either is or ſhall be determined by thoſe
who have power of rule in their hands.</p>
               <p>Our late Prelates deſigne was to bring in ignorance, that
they might with the more freedom rule over us as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and in nothing did they drive on this deſign more, then
in the practice of this power, which they took to themſelves
to command things doubtful and controverſall, and by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to urge their commands upon people: by which, had
their power continued, groſs ignorance would ſoon have bin
ſpread over the face of the land. From whence hath come the
groſs ignorance of Popery, but from the prevailing of this
principle? By which the people have been brought in ſuch
ſubjection under their guides, that they have loſt their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
in the matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it be ſaid,</hi> But wee will take care that thoſe men who ſhall be
conſulted withall, and thoſe men who ſhall have power in their hands
to determine, ſhall be wiſe, underſtanding, godly men, and then the
danger will not be ſo great.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe thoſe men who for the preſent have ſuch power,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
have attained to the higheſt meaſure of of knowledg and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
that can be imagined to be in any men upon the earth,
yet the people are under this temptation, to neglect the gett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of knowledg themſelves; and it may be the rather, becauſe
thoſe who are appointed to determine things, are ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and ſo conſcientious; now theſe people growing ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant;
when theſe knowing and godly men who are now in
place, ſhall be gone, who ſhall chooſe other in their places? I
ſuppoſe it to be the opinion of moſt of you, and of the godly
in the Kingdom, and in all Reformed Churches, that either
the body of the Church, the people muſt chooſe their Officers,
or at leaſt, that none muſt be put upon them without their
conſent. Well then, if the people through the prevailing of
the former temptations grow ignorant, is it not like they wil
chuſe ſuch guiders and leaders as themſelves are? or if they
ſhall not chuſe, yet their negative voyce will have ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
into the choiſe, as it is very probable, that in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or two, blind guides will be brought in, and ſo the
blind leading the blind. And when by this ignorance hath
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104285:37"/>
prevailed and gotten head in the Church, there is almoſt an
impoſſibility ever to get it out again; this brings men into
the dark, and locks and bolts the doors upon them.</p>
               <p>Hence men by pleading for this principle, may bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their poſterity into greater bondage then they are
aware; for although now while they have the power in their
own hands, it may be well with them; yet hereafter others
may have the power, and then it may prove ill enough; they
may then complain of what they now plead for; though now
the guides of the Church may be good and holy, yet they may
live to ſee ſuch a change, or at leaſt their poſterity, that ſuch a
principle acted by ſuch men as they may be under, may wring
them; yea, it is the more ſtrange, that men ſhould plead ſo
much for this now, when as the ſoares of their neckes, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the bondage under it a while ſince, are ſcarce yet
healed.</p>
               <p>Eightly, there is yet a further danger in this, not only that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
men will neglect truth, but there will be a ſtrong temptation
to reſiſt and reject truth; if God begins to dart in any light
into a mans ſpirit, that appears to croſſe what hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
of for opinion or practice under a penalty; the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of a mans heart will entice him to turne his minde
from that light, not to let it into conſcience or heart, leſt it
prevailing, ſhould put him upon ſuch ways wherein he is like
to ſuffer. This hath been common in former times; many
have hid their eyes from thoſe truths that would have kept
them from enformity, becauſe they fore-ſaw what ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
would follow, if their conſciences ſhould not ſuffer
them to conform.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay: This ſuppoſes that ſome things will be urged that
is contrary to truth, which is uncharitable to ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>Although in matters fundamentall,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> there is no feare that
godly able men wil erre, yet let charity be ſtretched to the ful
latitude
of it, and reverence of men in place raiſed to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
height; yet if they will meddle with ſuch things as
are doubtful and controverſal amongſt godly and peaceable
men, and force them upon others; that confidence of theirs
that ſhall put them out of feare of erring, ſhall be to me a
ground of great fear, that they will erre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104285:38"/>
But ſome will acknowledge, that ſome liberty ſhould be granted
in things thus doubtfull and controverſall, to men who are indeed
conſcientious, godly and peaceable men; but if this be yeelded too,
then men who are not conſcientious, but of turbulent and corrupt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
will abuſe it.</p>
               <p>We have given rules to find out thoſe who onely pretend
conſcience,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and if by thoſe, or the like, it does not appeare,
but that men are indeed conſcientious in their way, we ſhould
judg charitably of them; you think much if thoſe be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to communion with Chriſt and his Saints, when they
profeſſe godlineſſe in word and life, and nothing appears to
the contrary; why then ſhould you think much to tolerate
thoſe as conſcientious, who profeſſe it in words and life, and
nothing appears to the contrary.</p>

the Church ſhould bear withall in men, continuing them ſtill

ſhould bear with in men, continuing them in the Kingdome

reaches further then the charge of the Church: That he is to
be more exact in his overſight of theſe things, then the Church
is to be; for what ever the power of the Magiſtrate be in theſe
things, yet to the Church eſpecially are the Oracles, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
the Truths of God committed. The charge of the
ſpirituall eſtate of men eſpecially belongs to the Church:
Now the Church is to beare with men in their infirmities,
though they be ignorant of many things, yea after means uſed
for information. No Church muſt caſt off any from commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

in the Congregational Churches, and a Covenant either
explicite or implicite, I think all acknowledg: that is, there
muſt be ſome agreement to joyne thoſe together in a body,
who formerly were not joyned, to make them to be of ſuch a
ſociety, to have power in it with others for the choiſe of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in this Congregation, and to be under the care &amp; charge
of thoſe Officers more then Members of another congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
what ſhall joyn them, if not at leaſt ſome mutuall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to joyn in one body for ſuch ſpirituall ends as Chriſt
hath appointed this body for, the very nature of a ſociety
that is embodyed, carries this with it; and any farther then
this I know none requires as neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:104285:40"/>
Indeed the more explicite this agreement is, the more is the
edification. Surely there is no Chriſtian but will acknowledg
that the more one Chriſtian opens his heart to another, and
binds himſelf to walk in the ways of Chriſt with another, the
more comfortable it is, and helps to edification: and upon
this ground doe the Congregationall Churches practice
this.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe any godly man ſhall come and deſire to joyn with
any of them, but withall tell them, that for his part he yet
cannot be convinced by any thing he can find in Scripture
that this way of convenanting is required; if the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſatisfie ſuch a man (being godly) in their practiſe, yet
deſire to know of him whether hee be willing to joyn with
them in all the ordinances of Chriſt, ſo farre as he knows, a
meere affirmative to this is a covenant ſufficient to joyne him
with them. The more fully he expreſſeth this to them, it
would be the more acceptable. Now then why is it that there
is ſuch a noiſe every where in exclamations againſt Church-covenant,
when it is nothing but this, which how any graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
heart upon due conſideration can be againſt, I cannot ſee.
And this is not only our preſent opinion, but that which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince we knew any thing in that way, upon all occaſions,
we have held forth.</p>
               <p>But what do you ſay to the other; If a man who you believe is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet not being convinced of your way of Government, but rather
thinks the Presbyteriall Government to be the way of Chriſt; would
you receive ſuch a man into communion with you?</p>
               <p>If any godly man whoſe conſcience is not ſatisfied in that
way of Government,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> yet is ſo caſt by Providence as he cannot
joyne with thoſe Churches where there is that Government
he thinks to be Chriſts; and becauſe hee is deſirous to enjoy
what ordinances of Chriſt he can, therefore tenders himſelf to
one of theſe Congregationall Churches: Such a man ſhould
be received to theſe Ordinances he ſees to be Chriſts, if there be
nothing elſe againſt him, but meerly becauſe after all due
means, yet through weakneſſe he cannot ſee Chriſts minde in
ſome other ordinance. Chriſt doth not lay ſo much upon
the ordinance of Government, as to exclude all his Saints all
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104285:40"/>
their days from all other Church-ordinances, if through
weakneſs they cannot be convinced of that.</p>
               <p>Now let one who is in a Congregational way, and connot
ſee Chriſts mind in the Presbyterial Government, yet come
to one of thoſe Churches, and ſay, he would gladly in all his
ways ſee the mind of Chriſt, and enjoy all his ordinances, but
he cannot ſee that a Miniſter who takes only the charge to
feed by Word and Sacraments one Congregation, yet ſhould
with others have the charge of ruling an hundred or more;
and till he be convinced otherwiſe, he cannot in his practice
acknowledg that Government to be Chriſts, would you yet
receive ſuch a one to communion with you in all other
Church-ordinances? If you would, I make no queſtion then
but if we well underſtood one another, and were of quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
we might live together in peace.</p>

good fiſhing in troubled waters.</hi> The diviſions of the times are
our advantages. Some mens ends are beſt ſerved, when church

                  </gap> juſt it were that ſuch a man ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
to evil, and that his name ſhould be blotted out from
under heaven.</p>
               <p>But if things were ſetled in Church and State, ſome men ſhould
not have ſuch liberties as now they have, therefore they are willing
enough to have our differences continued, their plot is to lengthen
them out.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That which thou calleſt ſeeking to lengthen out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
it may be God now accounts, and will another day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
call ſeeking after the neareſt union with himſelfe, and the
firmeſt union of his Saints.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the liberties theſe men ſeek for, are either evill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
or good; If evill, oh how dearly do they buy that which is
evill, with bringing the guilt of all that evil that comes from
our diviſions upon themſelves; you need not wiſh any enemy
more evil upon his head then this; certainly ſuch a man hath
load enough upon him.</p>
               <p>But if thoſe liberties they ſeek be good, or but ſuppoſed by
them to be ſo, why then ſhould they feare a right ſetling of
things? what ever is good, can be no enemy unto good. That
Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3. is enough to keep their hearts from
fearing, the right ordered power of authority, eſpecially from
fearing it ſo farre, as by the feare of it, to be driven into ſuch
a deſperate guilt of wickedneſſe as this is, to deſire or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the continuance of ſuch publique miſchiefe for their
own ends. <hi>Rulers,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>are not a terrour to good works,
but to evil; wilt thou then not be afraid of their power? doe that which
is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame.</hi> Surely then the
power was as formidable to any thing a chriſtian heart could
ſuppoſe good, as now any power is like to be that we have
to deale with.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is a ſign of a very poor, low, unworthy ſpirit,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:104285:42"/>
to think that any in whom thou haſt any perſwaſion there is
any feare of God, or intereſt in Chriſt, ſhould have no higher
thoughts for their ſupport and encouragement in what they
conceive good according to the mind of Chriſt, but ſuch as
the hopes or deſires of continuance of ſuch wofull evils in the
diviſions of Church and State raiſeth in them, if they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Chriſt took no more care of them then ſo, but
left them to ſuch miſerable ſupports as theſe are, their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were ſad indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. If ſuch baſeneſſe of ſpirit as this is, were ruling in
them, which hath in it the malignity of all the dregs of an
evil ſpirit, ſurely you would find it working in them in ſome
other thing, ſave only in that wherein they differ from you.
For certainly it is impoſſible but that man that is ſo left of
God to ſuch dregs of evill, muſt needs break out to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vile evils in a little time. It were ſtrange if ſuch horrid
wickedneſſe of a mans heart ſhould break out in nothing elſe.
The Lord therefore be Judg between his ſervants and thoſe
men, yea thoſe men profeſſing godlineſſe, who have ſuch hard
thoughts of them; and the Lord convince them of all their
hard ſpeeches, and hard writings in this thing.</p>

               <p>THis hath the greater ſtrength, becauſe it comes under a
ſhew of exact godlineſſe: I do not mean an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ſhew, but an appearance to mens conſciences.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It is very dividing: For, firſt, if while many things lye in
mens owne thoughts, they cauſe much ſtrife within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
their reaſonings are very divers: Though they have
all the ſome tincture from the ſame affections, and are ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſame ends then when theſe things come abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others, who have not the ſame reaſonings, nor the ſame
affections, to give them ſuch a tincture, but reaſonings and
affections running quite another way, nor the ſame ends to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104285:42"/>
ſway them, but quite different to poyſe them a croſs way,
there muſt needs be much ſtrife, ſuch diviſions as will be hard
to reconcile. If men ſometimes can hardly prevail with their
own thoughts to agree, notwithſtanding the ſway of their
own affections and ends; how are they like to agree with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whoſe affections and ends are ſo various from theirs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if men doe preſently profeſſe and practice what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
they conceive to be right, they muſt neceſſarily profeſſe and
recant, recant and profeſſe; for in many things, what they
apprehend to be true at one time, they ſuſpect, yea ſee cauſe to
deny at another; and what confuſion &amp; diſorder would there
be in matters of Religion, if continually by ſome or other
there ſhould be profeſſion of things as true and good, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the ſame things preſently into queſtion, yea within a
while denying and renouncing them? And if not ſo, then</p>
               <p>3. If a man hath once made profeſſion of what he conceives <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to be a truth, differing from others, if it proves to be a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion,
there lies a great temptation upon him to
ſtand out in it, to ſtrive to make it out to the utmoſt; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more contrary to a mans nature, then to acknowledg
himſelf to be miſtaken in his underſtanding, and to lye down
in the ſhame of raſhneſſe and inconſiderateneſſe in his actions;
therefore whatſoever mens own thoughts be within, in their
own ſpirits, they had need take heed what they doe, when
they come to make open profeſſion, and practice what they
apprehend, and engage themſelves thereby to maintaine;
there are not many who attaine to <hi>Auguſtines</hi> ſelf denyall, to
publiſh retractations to all the world. Now if a man through
the ſtrength of this temptation, ſhall ſtill retaine what he
hath made profeſſion of, and others ſhall ſee his weakeneſſe,
joyned with wilfulneſſe; they muſt oppoſe him in it, and ſo
contention and diviſion is like to riſe higher and higher. In
regard therefore of the great uſefulneſſe of this point, and the
difficulty of the right underſtanding it, I ſhall endeavour to
ſpeak to it under theſe three Heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to ſhew wherein Profeſſion is neceſſary.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, wherein men may keep in, what they think they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
underſtand to be truth, ſo as not to profeſſe or practiſe it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhall propound ſome rules of Direction, to ſhew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:104285:43"/>
in what manner a man ſhould make profeſſion of what he
conceives to be truth, though it be different from his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>For the firſt. Certainly profeſſion in ſome things is very
neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Rom. 10. 10. With the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſſe,
and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation. <hi>Confeſſion

be ſaved. Auguſtine <hi>in one of his Sermons</hi> De Tempore, <hi>ſayes,</hi>
Wee cannot be ſaved, except wee profeſſe our faith outwardly for

               <p>Fiftly, when my profeſſion at this time in this thing is like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
to hinder a more uſeful profeſſion at another time in another
thing. <hi>Prov. 29. 11. A foole uttereth all his mind, he that is wiſe
keeps it in till afterward.</hi> It was the wiſdome of <hi>Paul</hi> when he
was at <hi>Athens,</hi> not preſently to break out againſt their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, when our profeſſion will cauſe publick diſturbance,
and that to the godly, the diſturbance of mens corruptions
who will oppoſe out of malice, is not much to be regarded.
When it was told Chriſt the Phariſees were offended, he cared
not for it, but he made a great matter of the offence of any of
his little ones. When men who love the truth as well as wee,
ſhall not only be againſt what we conceive truth, but ſhall be
offended, and that generally at it; if we have diſcharged our
own conſciences by declaring as we are called to it what we
conceive the mind of God, we ſhould ſit down quietly, and
not continue in a way of publique offence and diſturbance to
the Saints. The rule of the Apoſtle will come in here, <hi>Let
the ſpirit of the Prophets be ſubjects to the Prophets:</hi> wee ſhould
wait till God will ſome other way, or at ſome other time
have that prevaile in their hearts and conſciences of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which we conceive to be truth, and they are now ſo much
offended at. There could never be peace continued in the
Church, if every man muſt continually, upon all occaſions,
have liberty openly to make profeſſion of what he apprehends
to be a truth; never have done with it, though the Church,
which is faithfull, and deſires unfeignedly to honour Chriſt
and his truth, be never ſo much againſt it.</p>
               <p>In divers of theſe caſes the conſideration of that Text, <hi>Eccl.</hi>

other things this is included in the ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt;
when you apprehend a thing to be a truth, do not think that
you are bound all times, upon all occaſions, to the utmoſt,

yet there may be mixture of your own ſpirit alſo; you may
ſtretch beyond the rule; this is to be over-righteous, to think
out of a zeal to God and his truth, to goe beyond what God
requires.</p>
               <p>It is true, at no time, upon no occaſion, though thy life, and
all the lives in the world lay upon it, thou muſt not deny any
the leaſt truth, but there may be a time when God doth not
require of thee to make profeſſion of every thing thou belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
to be a truth.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, This tends to looſneſs, to lukewarmneſs, to
time-ſerving; men pretending and pleading diſcretion, grow
looſe and remiſſe, and ſo by degrees fall off from the truth.</p>

                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. Let men take heed of that too; <hi>Be not over-much

goe beyond the rule, ſo take heed you fall not off from it; ſo
you may grow wicked and fooliſh, yea very wicked, over-wicked,
God will meet with you there too: Wherefore <hi>verſ.
18. It is good thou ſhouldſt take hold of this, yea alſo from this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw

and it ſhall likewiſe keep thee from bringing miſery upon thy

time-ſerving. The fear of God will ballaſt thy ſoul even, it
will carry thee on in a way that ſhall be good in the eyes of
the Lord, and of his Saints.</p>
               <p>There is a natural boldnes, and a mixed zeal in many who
are godly, that carries them on in thoſe ways that cauſes great
diſturbance to others, and brings themſelves into great ſtraits
and ſnares; and theſe men are very ready to cenſure others of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104285:50"/>
neſſe and looſeneſſe, who do not as themſelves do; but this
Scripture reproves them, ſhewing that it is not through fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

not as they do, but the fear of God in a right way ballaſting
their ſpirits; God will own his fear to be in their hearts, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
them aright, when thy diſorderly, mixed zeale ſhall
receive rebuke from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But doth not Chriſt ſay,<note place="margin">Object.</note> Hee came into the world to witneſſe to the
truth, and is not every truth more worth then our lives?</p>
               <p>That man who in the former five caſes wherein profeſſion

that truth is indeed precious to him, and gives that teſtimony

what he conceives to be the mind of God, though he
ſhall not either in words or practice continually hold forth

               <p>3. The truth is maintained, by forbearing that practice
which thoſe opinions of men that are contrary to the truth,

ground do that which my conſcience ſayes is in it ſelfe ſin, in

what ever good I conceive may be done by it; but a thing in

at this time it is my duty to forbear it, ſo that in not doing
it I cannot be charged of a ſin of omiſſion, of not living ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, we muſt be wel grounded in fundamentals, before we

have laid out the firſt of their ſtrength in Controverſies,
but that they have vaniſhed &amp; come to nothing in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.

It is very pleaſing to the fleſh, to convey ſuch things to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to be the firſt that ſhall bring to others, things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they underſtood not, whatſoever the things be. As there
is much wickedneſs in raiſing up old errors, as if they were
new truths; ſo there is much vanity in bringing forth old
truths in novell and affected phraſes, as if men deſired to be
thought to find out ſome new thing that yet hath not been, or
is very little known in the world, when indeed upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
when it is uncloathed of its new expreſſions, it proves
to be the ſame old truth, that ordinarily hath been known &amp;
taught, and ſo the man appears to be no knowing man, more
then ordinary. Take heed of this vanity of ſpirit in the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth of truth, eſpecially when in publike you ſpeak of
Gods truths, ſpeak of them with reverence of the name of the
great God, as the Oracles of God, clearly, plainly, not in
obſcure, uncouth, unknown expreſſions, as the Oracles of the
Idols were wont to be delivered in.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Whatſoever is differing from others who are godly, is
not to be held forth and profeſſed without ſerious examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
we may venture more ſuddenly upon thoſe things which
are generally received of the Saints; but if they be differing,
then we had need examine them over and over again, with a
jealous eye over our own hearts, and to take heed to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
&amp; how we behave our ſelves in ſuch things wherein we
are like to go away ſo much differing from ſo many of our
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104285:51"/>
godly, able brethren. Wee muſt take heed of publiſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch things rawly, undigeſtedly, leſt we wrong the truth
of God, and make the profeſſion of it become ridiculous. If
the thing be true to day, it will be true to morrow.</p>
               <p>4. We muſt not think it enough boldly to aſſert things, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
according to the rule of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. we muſt give
an account, 1. <hi>with meekneſs;</hi> we muſt not do it in a paſſionate,
froward way, not with our affections hurrying and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
not after a contentious manner, as if we deſired victory
rather then truth; but with quietneſſe and compoſedneſſe of
ſpirit. We muſt not think it much to bear contradiction from
others, yea though it ſhould ariſe to contemptuous carriage
againſt us, <hi>and with fear,</hi> that is, either in reſpect of our ſelves
who make the profeſſion, or in reſpect of thoſe before whom
we make it. For our ſelves, we muſt not do it in a conceited
way, not in a high, arrogant way, with fooliſh confidence in
our ſelves, in our own apprehenſions and abilities, but <hi>with
feare,</hi> manifeſting our ſenſibleneſs of our own weakneſs, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and nothingnes: 2. In reſpect of thoſe before whom the
profeſſion is made. We muſt manifeſt our due, reverent eſteem
of them; no unbeſeeming behaviour, no ſcornfulneſs, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
contempt, if it before <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> eſpecially then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they are in regard of their perſons, yet reverentiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
ought to be given to them in reſpect of their places;
and if they be men of worth, learning, graces, publike uſe in
the Church or State, that reſpect that is due to their worth,
is to be manifeſted alſo in our carriage towards them. Grace
teacheth no man to be unmannerly, rude, ſcornfull, furious,
or fooliſh.</p>
               <p>5. If you would make profeſſion or practice any thing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
from others who are godly and judicious, you ſhould
firſt acquaint thoſe who are moſt able, with what you intend,
and not go to youths, &amp; women, and weak ones firſt, ſeeking
to promote what you apprehend, by poſſeſſing your hearts
firſt with it, and to get them to be a party for you; this is not
the way of God. If God hath revealed ſome new thing to you,
you have ſome new light that is not yet made known to your
Brethren, which not only by profane men, but I fear by ſome
who are godly, is in a profane manner ſcorned at; and it were
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104285:52"/>
wel if none of thoſe who pretend it, did not give ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
were not the temptation to the deſpiſing of that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
yet you ſhould firſt goe to thoſe who are moſt able to
judg, acquaint them with what apprehenſions you have, and
ſee whether they cannot make it appeare to you that you are
miſtaken; if not, they may confirm you in the truth, that
you may go on in it with the more confidence.</p>
               <p>If Churches were ſetled as they ought, I ſhould think it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

their Relations, of their publique Intereſts, therefore certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it muſt needs be a <hi>dividing Principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some men whoſe calling is only to a private employment,
yet having ſome gifts, and having uſed ſometimes in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
to take a Scripture, and ſpeak ſomething out of it; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this they think it is a better thing to be exerciſed in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Gods word, then to fit in a ſhop all day, at ſome meane
worke, or ſelling out wares, therefore they thinke they are
bound to give over their <hi>Callings,</hi> which they look at as too
low, mean things, and be Preachers of the Word, not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe due ways that Chriſt would have men come into
ſuch an employment by. Although I do not think, but that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104285:52"/>
Tradeſmen, who have good knowledg in the Scripture, and
are gifted by God to ſpeak the Word to people for their edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
when there is a want of able men, who have been all
their lives preparing for ſuch a work, and are ſet apart for it,
rather then people ſhould continue in ignorance, and ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
(if thoſe who are able and fit to judg, ſhal judg them meet
for ſuch a work) they may be employd to make <hi>Chriſt</hi> known
to them; yet for every man that takes himſelf to be a gifted
man, and it may be is ſo judged, by ſome who are willing to
flatter him, to take upon him of himſelfe, or by the advice of
two or three of his friends, to leave his other employment for
the work of the Miniſtry, becauſe that is a more noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
work; this is not a way of God, but a way of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and diſorder.</p>
               <p>Again, it is in it ſelfe a better thing to enjoy a Miniſtry of
the moſt eminent gifts and graces, then one of lower; but if
this ſhould be made a rule, that a man who is under a Paſtor,
who is faithfull, and in ſome good meaſure gifted, upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans coming into the Countrey that is more eminent,
he ſhould forſake his Paſtor, and joyn to the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this ſtill a more eminent man comes, he ſhould leave the
former and joyn to him; and by the ſame Law, a Paſtor who
hath a good people, yet if others be more likely to receive
more good, he may leave his own people, and goe to them,
what confuſion and diſorder would there be continually in
the Church? Men muſt conſider, not only what the thing is
in its own nature, but what it is to them, how it ſtands in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to their relations. If you be joyned to a Paſtor, ſo as
you believe he is ſet over you by Chriſt, to be a Paſtor to you
(not becauſe the Biſhop hath ſent one, or an old Uſurer dyes,
and leaves the Patronage of a living to ſome Oſtler or Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wench
in an Alehouſe, and he or ſhe ſhall ſend one by vertue
of their right to the patronage, this cannot tie a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to depend upon him for the ordinances of Chriſt all his
days, in caſe he cannot remove his dwelling, but if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but look upon the man as the Paſtor that Chriſt hath ſet
over you.) Though this man hath meaner gifts then others;
and it would be more comfortable to you to have another
Paſtor; yet this is not enough to cauſe you to diſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt hath ſet over you; and if people may not leave their
Paſtors, becauſe others have more eminent gifts, then ſurely
Paſtors muſt not leave their people, becauſe others have more

               <p>To inſtance yet further, that you may ſee how this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
diſturbs mens ſpirits: Many being in the works of their
Calling, have ſome thoughts come into their mind, that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is a better work, more noble and ſpirituall then to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
as they are; therefore they muſt needs preſently leave
their worke, and go toe prayer: How many have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
with temptations this way, by which their lives have
been made very uncomfortable? Prayer in it ſelfe is better,
but is it better at this time for me, all things conſidered? am
not I about that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God hath called me to do? By this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
many decive and trouble themſelves, in reſpect of their
ſouls; as ſome by a conceit of the like nature, deceive &amp; bring
great trouble to themſelves in reſpect of their bodies; ſome
who have ſickly bodies, their fleſh is decayed, they think ſuch
and ſuch things have moſt nouriſhment in them, ſuch things
are hot, and full of ſpirits, and juyce, therefore they will eate
and drink altogether ſuch things, leaving their ordinary dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et;
by this means th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y many times overthrow their bodies:
for though a man wants fleſh, yet the way for him to have it,
it may be is not to take nouriſhing things, but purging; and
though he be troubled with faintneſs, it may be the way to get
good ſpirits, is by eating ordinary dyet, and cooling his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that ſo ſome diſtemper may be cured, and he may get his
veyns filled with good blood, and ſpirits got from it, rather
then by drinking hot waters that are full of ſpirits, which
perhaps burns his heart, and dries his body, that there is no
good blood generated from his dyet.</p>
               <p>It is not enough therefore to ſay the thing is in it ſelfe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but is it better in all the references I have, and it hath? is
it better in regard of others, in regard of the publique, for the
helping me in all my relations? May it not help one way,
and hinder many ways? If a Phyſitian ſhould come to a man,
and ſee his diſeaſe is hot, and ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him by giving him water, the man may like it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104285:54"/>
why is it not better to be cool, then ſo burning hot? but
thus the Phyſitian diſcovers his folly, and the Patient loſes
his life. A Phyſitian in preſcribing ſome phyſick had need have
forty conſiderations in his head at once, how one part ſtands
affected to the other, of what yeers the man is, of what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
how long the diſeaſe bath been upon him, what was
laſt done to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it ſhould be in the duties of Religion,
a Chriſtian who deſires to walk orderly, to beautifie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
his profeſſion to enjoy communion with God, &amp; peace
in his own ſoul, and be uſeful to the publique, had need have
his wits about him, not preſently to fall upon a work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is now preſented as good to him in a ſingle conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he muſt compare one thing with another, and ſee what it
is in all its references; or otherwiſe he will but enterfeir, hee
will but hack and hew, and bungle, and diſturb himſelfe and
others in the ways of Religion, he will make Religion tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

whatſoever they have conceived to be better then other,
they have preſently followed it with all eagerneſſe, never
conſidering circumſtances, references, or conſequences, but

did it raiſe againſt men who were moſt conſcientious? the

perſecuting thoſe who would not yeeld to the judgment of
others, who had the repute of learning and piety; and thoſe
who were conſcientious, could not yeeld to their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
not ſeeing the truth of God in them, and this made
the ſtir. VVhile men appear obſtinate, by the rule of Chriſt
we are not to bear with them; and this Principle ſets thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of godly peaceable men in the ſeat of the obſtinate, theſe
cannot in conſcience yeeld, and others cannot but in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
oppoſe them; what reconciliation then can there be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped?
either men muſt captivate their conſciences, cauſe them
in a ſordid way to bow down to ſlavery, or elſe there muſt

               <p>I confeſſe ſuch a Principle as this is would make for union
amongſt thoſe who either think they need not, or through
careleſneſſe regard not to ſearth out truth, but with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
faith take in all that ſhall be impoſed upon them, who
think ignorance of Gods mind and conſcience ſlavery, to be
no great evil; this is never urged with violence, but either by
thoſe who have given up their conſciences to be ſerviceable
to the eaſe and content of the fleſh, or thoſe who have, or hope
to have power in their hands, to bring others in ſubjection
to them.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the right informing our judgments in this, may
much conduce to peace, I ſhall endeavour, 1. To ſhew you
what due reſpect is to be given to mens judgments who are
learned and godly. 2. Yet not ſo much as to make their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the rule to judg men obſtinate, if they differ from
them. 3. VVhat then ſhould be the rule? by what ſhould we
judg a man to be obſtiate?</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Certainly much reſpect is to be given to the
learning and godlineſſe of men. There is a great deluſion in
many mens hearts,<note place="margin">What reſpect is to be given to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned holy men.</note> that makes them thinke it to be halfe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
to give any reſpect to Learning; although the abuſe of
Learning hath done much evill, againſt that much hath been
and may be ſaid; but I dare avow this, that never ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world could a man be found to ſpeak againſt

earning but an ignorant man; neither is it like, nay I may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
it is impoſſible that any but ſuch will be found to the end
of the world: Learning hath ſo much of God in it, that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had nor will have any enemy but ignorance.</p>

                  </gap>, Be in
them. And when we ſee grace added to Learning, it ſhould
adde much to our eſteem of ſuch a man; it is the orient pearl
in the gold ring, it is a great teſtimony to a way, that it is
the way of good men, <hi>Prov. 2. 20. That thou maiſt walke in the
way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</hi> The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and counſell of ſuch is to be received with very great
reſpect, eſpecially if the eminencie of their grace appears in
the tenderneſs of their ſpirits, that we may ſee much of the
feare of God in them. <hi>Ezra 10. 3. Now let us make a covenant,
according to the counſell of my Lord, and of thoſe that tremble at
the commandement of our God.</hi> And when not only ſome few
godly men are of this mind, but when it is that which God
hath ſealed in the hearts of the Saints generally, very high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

indeed account it their honour to force men to be of their

of men, Bow down before us. A gracious ſpirit abhors the
thought of ſuch a tyranny. This to high raiſing reſpects due
to learned, holy men, hath been very hurtfull in the Church,
prejudicial to the ſouls of men, but eſpecially to the honour
of Chriſt. I will give you an inſtance. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was no novice,
yet how dangerouſly he was taken with this, will appear by
a ſtrange expreſſion of his, in an Epiſtle hee wrote to one
<hi>Bilibaldus: How far the authority of the Church prevails with others,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104285:56"/>
I know not; but with mee it hath that power, that I could be of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
with Arrians and Pelagians, if the Church did but allow that
which they taught.</hi> This you will ſay is a ſtrange expreſſion, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from a learned man, and one too, not addicted to the
Church that then was in that exceſs as others were; how then
did this conceit prevail with men more weak, who gave up
their conſciences to others through their blind ſuperſtition?</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſecondly, though great reſpect is to be given to
men holy and learned, yet not ſuch, that a man muſt be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
obſtinate, if hee ſubmit not to their judgments and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.
For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, if a man ſhould believe or do any thing before he ſees <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
ſome other grounds beſides their judgments or examples,
though the thing were in it ſelfe never ſo good, yet it would
be ſin to him. If indeed this were enough to anſwer Chriſt,
<hi>Lord, I am a poore weake man, I cannot find out thy truths my ſelf,
therefore I ſeeing learned godly men to be of ſuch a judgement, and
doing ſuch things, I thought it too much preſumption for mee to differ
from them, therefore I alſo believed it to be true, and practiſed
accordingly.</hi> This were an eaſie way for people to agree, and
it might well be judged obſtinacy to gainſay. But this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Chriſt will not take, for he tells us, <hi>Whatſoever is not of
faith, is ſinne,</hi> and the judgments and practices of godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men, he never made to be the rule of faith.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. If God in revealing his mind to men, alwayes did it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
according to the proportion of their gifts and graces, then it
were too much boldneſſe for any to differ from thoſe who are
moſt eminent; but experience tels us it is otherwiſe, as God
cauſeth his rain to fall upon one field, and not upon another;
and as the wind blows where it liſts, ſo are the workings of
the Spirit of God upon men. Although hee reveales to all
his Saints whatſoever is abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, yet
for other truths, a man of eminent parts ſhall know one, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
of weaker ſhall know another. <hi>David</hi> was a man as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
for parts, &amp; was filled with the Spirit of God as much
as <hi>Nathan,</hi> both in regard of Propheſie and godlineſs; yet
ſometimes that was revealed to <hi>Nathan,</hi> which was kept hid
from <hi>David.</hi> When the Book of the Law was found, and read
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104285:57"/>
before <hi>Joſiah,</hi> they ſend to <hi>Huldah</hi> the Propheteſſe, yet there
were Prophets in the Land at that time.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, Is it not more likely that men of learning and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
ſhould know what is right, and what is not, better then others?</p>
               <p>True,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> it is more likely they ſhould; but God many times
doth things which we think are not likely; that which is the
moſt unlikely to us, God many times chooſeth as beſt to ſerve
his ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, If there were no other reaſon why a man of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
parts ſhould differ from other, then becauſe he is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of his parts, thinks himſelfe more able to underſtand then
thoſe who are far his betters, then there would be more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to deale ſeverely with him: But being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>here may be this
reaſon; why men who are weak, yet differ from thoſe who are
eminent, Chriſt hath laid this charge upon them, that they
muſt not believe or practice any thing in the matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but what they ſhall ſee ground for out of his word. If
a man ſhall be jealous of himſelf, fearing leſt his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
ſhould miſlead him; and in the uſe of all meanes he
can, ſeeks to God, and yet cannnot ſee from Scripture the
ground of thoſe things learned and godly men have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and having received ſuch a charge from Chriſt not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his judgment or practice, till in the uſe of theſe meanes he
ſhould receive further light from him; what would you have
this man do? If he yeelds to you, he ſins againſt the charge of
Chriſt and his own conſcience; if he doth not, either now or
after ſuch a time you prefixe him, alter his judgment and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
you judg him obſtinate, and in the name of Chriſt deale
with him as ſuch; do not you by this make that bond that
Chriſt hath laid upon him (to do all he doth from a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the more learning, the more godlineſs men have,
the more pains they take in finding out the truth; there is the
leſſe ground to judg thoſe obſtinate, who differ from them,
becauſe they differ.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, How can that be? For if men be very learned and
godly, and take much pains to finde out the truth, there is the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
we ſhould believe their judgements more then our owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:104285:57"/>
We muſt indeed honour them,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> then, the more; but yet the
exquiſiteneſſe of their learning, the eminency of their godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the induſtry of their labours, for the finding out of truth,
may excuſe thoſe from obſtinacy who cannot ſee into the
ground from the word, of all that they are able to ſee; for is
it not more then probable, that men who are weak and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
beneath them, ſhould through meer weakneſs be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſee the rule of Scripture in thoſe things which they
have got the ſight of, by the help of their great learning, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſ,
and indefatigable labours? Can it be, that men who
have not attained to that eminencie, who are not able to take
ſo much pains in ſearching, that they (though they have their
help added) ſhould be able to attain to what theſe men ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
and induſtrious have attained to? Can they in a few
months come to ſee that which they have been ſtudying, and
debating one with another divers years before they could ſee
it, can they be ſatisfied in their conſciences of the mind of
Chriſt, when theſe eminent men, for a long time could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſatisfie one another? yea, it may be after all the helpe of
their learning, godlineſs, and painfull labours, they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many things but as probable, as more likely to be ſo then
otherwiſe, they have not a <hi>Plerophory</hi> in their own hearts; and
ſhall thoſe who doe not ſee ground enough for the foot of
Faith to ſettle upon, be judged, and dealt with as obſtinate?
Becauſe they yet are not of their mind, (God forbid.)</p>
               <p>Fifthly, there is much danger in making this to be the rule; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
for if to go againſt the judgment of godly and learned men be
obſtinacy now, ere long it may come to this, that to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe in place, who have power in their hand, ſhall be
obſtinacy, whatſoever they be; for who dare queſtion their
learning and piety? Whatſoever miſcarriages theſe ſhal be in
after ages in bringing men unlearned &amp; ungodly into place;
yet thoſe muſt be judged as gulty of obſtinacy who are not of
the ſame judgment they ſhall be of, and into what a caſe then
have we brought our ſelves.</p>
               <p>If you ſhall ſay, True, our caſe would be ſadde, but we muſt
venture it, there is no helpe, better an inconvenience then a
miſchiefe.</p>

                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:104285:58"/>
In civil things this indeed muſt be ventured, for there we are
not bound to underſtand the reaſon and ground of all things;
but if nothing appeare to be contrary to the rules of juſtice
and piety, we are to ſubmit; but in the matters of Religion
it is otherwiſe, we muſt underſtand the ground of all from the
word; therefore thoſe who ſhall lay downe ſuch a poſition,
that we may deal with theſe men as obſtinate, by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Chriſt, who after two or three admonitions ſhal not
be of the ſame judgment, and do the ſame things that learned

againſt their owne light.</head>
               <p>THis is a worſe, a more dividing Principle then the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
it is worſe to make our judgments the rule of other
mens actions, then other mens judgements the rule of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
This makes men who differ, to have exceeding hard
thoughts one of another, it cauſeth a mighty ſpirit to riſe in
them one againſt another. A man cannot judg worſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then this, that he goes againſt his owne light. Of all
things conſcientious men knows not how to bear this; yet
how ordinarily will men who are weak, judg thoſe that are
ſtrong, becauſe they cannot ſee into the reaſons of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
therefore thoſe that do them, muſt needs do them againſt
their own light: If they ſee another mans garb, and manner
of converſe, and way, to be differing from their owne, they
preſently judge him ſinning againſt his own conſcience, to be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104285:59"/>
acted by by-ends to doe what he does meerly out of cunning
and craftineſſe; This is from the pride and ſowrneſſe of mens
ſpirits. This is farre enough for you to goe in judging your
brother, were I in his condition, ſhould I doe as hee doth, I
ſhould goe againſt my light, I ſhould act by by-ends; but
therefore to conclude that he goes againſt his light, and acts
by by-ends, is very ſinfull. Many carnall men thinke, if they
ſhould make ſuch a ſhew of Religion; if they ſhould doe ſuch
things as ſuch and ſuch men do, it would be hypocriſie in
them, and they judge truly, becauſe their Principle would
not beare out their practice; but therefore to judge all that
do ſuch things to be hypocrites, we account to be a very
wicked thing. If thou hadſt any ſpirit of humility or wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in thee, thou wouldſt rather think, it may be hee ſees
what I do not, I am to look to mine own heart and wayes,
by what principles I goe my ſelf: Men who are weake, and
can ſee but a little way into things, muſt take heed they cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
not others, who know how to manage buſineſſes better
then themſelves; ſome may do that acceptable to God, that
thou couldſt not doe without an evill conſcience: The ſame
honeſty and ſincerity may continue in a man, though in true
wiſdome and diſcretion he applies himſelf diverſly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as occaſions are divers; as the hand remaines the ſame,
whether cloſed into a fiſt, or extended abroad, or bended this

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, we are bound to give the beſt interpretation upon our

to that which may any way be conceived or hoped to
have any goodneſſe in it; we muſt rather wrong our ſelves by

               <p>

guide us in naturall things and civill affaires, and may as well
ſuffice us in ſpirituall and Church-affaires.</head>
                  <p>A Great part of our diviſions about Church-affairs comes
from this Principle: <hi>If God would help us with right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions

                        </gap>is, our diviſions would in a great meaſure vaniſh.</hi>
Thoſe whoſe conſciences are taken with a contrary princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>namely,</hi> that there muſt be inſtitutions for all things that
are properly Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall, they cannot yeeld
to any ſuch thing, till they ſee the ſtamp on, an inſtitution
upon it: Others who think becauſe Prudence is enough to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
civill affairs, there needs no inſtitution for theſe things,
they think ſuch as ſtand for them to be too rigid and ſtiffe in
their way.</p>
                  <p>It divides alſo upon this ground: In the corrupt eſtate of
the Church (ſuch as ours yet is) if we binde to inſtitutions,
we ſhall be ſorely pinched with many things that will be very
troubleſom to us, but if we go according to the rules of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
prudence, we may decline, or alter what would pinch, &amp;
take up what may be commodious for us: Hence the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is very deſirable, if it can be maintained, men will ſtrive
hard before they wil loſe it; and on the other ſide, God is loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
at as a jealous God, who will not ſuffer a mans wiſdome
to ſhare with him in the things of his worſhip, which are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and holy, to appoint and leave out as may be moſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104285:60"/>
commodious for the freedome of them from trouble, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they dare not yield to any Ordinance that is beyond ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
but upon ſome inſtitution of Chriſt in his Word, and
this divides.</p>
                  <p>Now for your help in this: As God hath given two lights
to the world, the Sunne, the grater to rule the day; and the
Moone, the leſſer, to rule the night: So he hath given two
Lights to man, to guide his courſe; the Scriptures the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to guide man, eſpecially in his ſpirituall condition, in
thoſe more immediate references he hath to God, for his
worſhip and enjoyment of communion with him: The other
the leſs, the light of Reaſon, to be his guide in naturall and
civill things, in the ordering his life for his naturall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
good; and though it is true, Religion makes uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and we have help from the Scriptures in our natural and
civill affairs, yet theſe two lights have their diſtinct ſpeciall
uſe, according to thoſe diſtinct conditions of man.</p>
                  <p>When I ſay,<note place="margin">What are thoſe things we muſt have inſtitutions for.</note> we muſt have Scripture, and in it inſtitutions
for thoſe things which are ſpirituall, and properly Church-affairs,
I mean whatſoever is made uſe of for the drawing my
ſoule neerer to God, or God neerer to me; or for the tendring
up my Homage to God, beyond what it hath in the nature of
the thing, put into it by God; for that I muſt have an inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I muſt not frame any ſuch thing to my ſelf; If I make uſe
of any thing of mine own, for ſuch an end that I may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God by, or that God might convey ſome ſpirituall effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to me in the uſe of it, becauſe it is a thing that I thinke as
fit for ſuch an end, as other Ordinances I find in the Word,
and yet have not an inſtitution for it; in this I ſinne againſt
Chriſt the Lord, who alone hath power to ſet apart the uſe of
what he pleaſeth, for the tendring up homage to God, or the
conveighing of any ſpirituall efficacy from God into the
hearts of his ſervants.</p>
                  <p>Mans naturall and civill good is not ſo high, but reaſon
and prudence will reach them; but for ſuch things as theſe are,
all the reaſon &amp; prudence in the world lies too low, they can
not without ſinfull preſumption attempt the putting any
thing of their own in the place of theſe: Therefore there can
be no other officers in the church, to act by any ſpiritual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104285:60"/>
then what we find in the Word; no new Ordinances, no
new Courts erected, no kind of authority, no extent of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
any further then we find in Scripture: The proof is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
all Church Ordinances are for ſpiritual ends, to work
by a ſpirituall efficacy, beyond what is naturall or civill; and
the efficacy of the power of government conſiſts much in
thoſe who govern; if they have not their Charter to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
their power and the extent of it, it loſes its efficacie,
though it be otherwiſe managed with never ſo much wiſdom
and juſtice; the ſame act that is an act of Juſtice in one, is
murther in another; yea, the ſame mans act done within ſuch
limits is an act of Juſtice, and if done beyond thoſe limits, it
is murther.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, Surely there is uſe of reaſon and prudence in
matters ſpirituall; how far may their uſe extend?</p>
                  <p>To the doing of theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> by reaſon I may compare inſtitutions, and argue

                     </gap>k, by others which are more apparent.
Though the thing that I gather be not <hi>terminis</hi> in Scripture,
yet if I gather by neceſſary conſequence from an inſtitution,
one or more, it hath the force of an inſtitution in it: If I make
Reaſon to be the <hi>Baſis,</hi> the ground of my conſequence, it wil
never riſe up to that height as to raiſe an inſtitution; but if I
make ſome other inſtitution the <hi>Baſis</hi> of my conſequence, then
it may.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when I have found out an inſtitution, then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
&amp; prudence comes in to help to manage this in a fit and
com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly way, applying it to fit perſons and times, making uſe
of fit ſeaſons, due order, and whatſoever naturall or civill
conveniences may further the due adminiſtration of it. The
Prelates abuſed that Scripture, <hi>Let all things be done decently
and in order;</hi> for they joyned inſtitutions of their own to
Gods, to make them decent and orderly: But that Scripture
only ſhews you when you have an inſtitution of Chriſt, you
are to apply by the uſe of reaſon and prudence, what natural
or civill helps you can, for the better managing this inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his.</p>
                  <p>From hence we have an anſwer to that Objection is made
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104285:61"/>
againſt many things done by thoſe who are in a Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
way; what inſtitution have they for many things they
do? what for their Covenant? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Though there be no Text of Scripture holds forth this <hi>in

and this Paſtor upon this people in a peculiar relation;
they may do ſome acts of power over one another in their
Congregation, which they cannot do over others in another
Congregation: Now then it follows, they being a body, muſt
needs have ſomething to joyne them together; and the leaſt
thing that can be to joyn them, is the manifeſtation of their
aſſent to joyn for thoſe ends for which Chriſt hath appointed
ſuch a body; and what is their Covenant, but this? Onely
ſome manifeſt their aſſent more largely, ſome more briefly; I
know nothing more is required, but to manifeſt their aſſent
to joyn with that body, to ſet up all the Ordinances of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſo far as they know.</p>
                  <p>If there be any other thing done in their Churches where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

do not look our oppoſition to them having ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
in it, ſo formidable as they would if we were all but
one in our way of oppoſing them; But ſtil we are all ſhouting

                     <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 2. we read of the Saints ſtanding upon a ſea of
glaſſe, which had fire mingled with it. Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
this ſea of glaſs, the doctrine of the Goſpel, more clear,
more tranſparent then the doctrine of the Law, which, he
ſayes, was reſembled by the ſea of braſſe that <hi>Solomon</hi> made;
But there is fire mingled in this ſea of glaſſe, that is, ſaith hee,
There are contentions &amp; diviſions in the Church, where this
doctrine of the Goſpel is taught: But yet mark what follows,
<hi>They got the victory over the beaſt, and over his image, and over his
marke, and over the number of his name, and had the harps of God
in their hands, and ſang the ſong of Moſes, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men who are in a crowd, tread one upon another, yet they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104285:62"/>
all make to the ſame door, they would all go the ſame way:
Godly people are divided in their opinions and wayes, but
they are united in Chriſt; though they may be divided from
ſuch a particular ſociety, yet they are not divided from the
Church; it is with the Saints here, as with the boughs of trees
in time of a ſtorm; you ſhall ſee the boughs one beat upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
as if they would beat one another to pieces, as if Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were fighting, but this is but while the wind, while the
tempeſt laſts; ſtay a while and you ſhal ſee every bough ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in its own order and comelineſs, why? becauſe they are
all united in one root; if any bough be rotten, the ſtorme
breaks it off, but the ſound boughs come into their former
place. Theſe times of division may break off men whoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
were before unſound, they will never come in to joyne
with the Saints again ſo as they ſeemed to doe in former
times: but within a while when this guſt is over, others may
come in and ſhew themſelves to be all united in, and receive
ſap from the ſame root.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Whence are wars? even from your luſts.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not
here condemn wars ſimply, this was the error of the old <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees,</hi>
raiſed up again by ſome amongſt us; eſpecially as the
Wars are looked upon under that notion, raiſed for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They ſeek to weaken our hands in theſe wars, by telling
young people who have newly given their names to Chriſt,
and therefore deſire to be guided by the Word in all they do,
whom God hath uſed under himſelf to be the ſtrength of theſe
wars, that they have no warrant to fight for Religion. To
whom our Anſwer is, that we have a Civill right to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peaceable profeſſion and practice of our Religion; wee
have the Laws of the Land for it, and for the maintenance of
this right wee fight. There can be no reaſon given why our
civil right we have to our Religion, may not as wel be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the ſword, as our civill right to our houſes and
lands. This anſwers all objections againſt the maintenance
of Religion by the ſword, from the practice of the Chriſtians
in the Primitive times, who never ſought to maintain Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thus. We ſay their caſe was not the ſame with ours; they
never had any civill right to the profeſſion and practice of
Religion in the Countreys where they lived, as we have.</p>
               <p>The wars meant in this Text are contentions, jars, diviſions
amongſt Chriſtians; though they did not take up the ſword
one againſt another, yet there were many quarrells, jarrs,
and diviſions amongſt them, theſe came from their luſts. The
luſts of mens hearts are very quarrelſom. Storms and tempeſts
are here below in this impure muddy part of the world, in
the higher part all is ſerene, calm, and clear. 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 3. For

                  <hi>Ye walke as men,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, yee ſhould not walk as
men, ye ſhould walk as it becomes thoſe whoſe condition is
raiſed above the condition of men, as it becomes Chriſtians
the redeemed ones of the Lord; you ſay, <hi>Can fleſh and blood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
this? Can any man living beare this?</hi> what if flesſh and blood,
what if a man cannot? A Chriſtian may, a member of Jeſus
Chriſt who is God-man, may. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to the people of <hi>Antioch,</hi> brings in Gods gracious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with <hi>Cain,</hi> as an example for them to imitate, in their

               </p>
               <p>The Scripture ſayes, <hi>The Saints are made partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature;</hi> therefore do not ſay, We are but men. You muſt
not walk as men, but as thoſe who are endued with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature. It is a great charge that the holy Ghoſt layes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they walked but as men; yet many
come ſhort of the lives of men: they rather walk as doggs, as
tygers, as wolves. <hi>Gal. 5. 20. The fruits of the fleſh are hatred,
variance, emulation, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, hereſies, envyings.</hi> All
theſe are the cauſes or workings of diviſions: Surely our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
are the fruits of the fleſh. We ſee it in nature, the more
ſpiritual any thing is, the more it unites; and the more groſs
the ſubſtance of any thing is, the leſſe it unites; the beames of
the Sun are of a kind of ſpirituall nature, therefore thouſands
of them will unite <hi>in puncto,</hi> but it is not ſo in other things;
ſpiritual hearts in this are like the Sun beams, though thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of them live together, they will unite in one ſo long as
they continue ſpiritual. The three thouſand Converts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.
joyned with one accord, with one ſingle heart: We find it now
by experience, ſo long as there be but a few in a Church, they
agree well, but uſually when they come to be numerous, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions
riſe amongſt them; this is an argument that the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104285:63"/>
hearts of men are not ſpiritual, ſtill much fleſh remains. Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
water aſcending to the Heavens, is ſweetned, it comes
down ſweet from thence; thus thoſe things which have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which have an aptneſſe to breed diviſions, yet ſpirituall
heavenly hearts having to do with them, they turn the nature
of them, they work ſpirituall advantage out of them.</p>
               <p>The higher fire aſcends, the more it unites; the flame that is
broad at the bottom, as it growes high, unites to be as the
point of a needle. When the hearts of Chriſtians keep below,
and have a great deal of ſmoak amongſt them, they do not ſo
unite; but when they can get up high, O what cloſe, ſingle-hearted
union is there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Mens luſts weaken their ſpirits, ſo as they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to heare any thing that comes croſſe to them; women;
children,<note place="margin">Omne invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum natura querulum.</note> ſick people, who are weakeſt, fall out moſt with one

               <p>Fourthly, in mens luſts there is confuſion, they cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
be kept in order, therefore they muſt needs cauſe diſturbance,
not onely in mens owne ſpirits, but to all that have to deale
with men acted by them; where there is confuſion, there
cannot be union; when there is right order in an army, though
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104285:64"/>
the men be never ſo numerous, never ſo differing in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
yet if they keep their ranks, they are all but one; but
if put to a rout and confuſion, then the bond of unity is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> In mens luſts there are contradictions; no vertue is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

contradictions in them. Mens luſts oppoſe and fight againſt
one another in mens hearts; no marvail then when there are
ſuch ſtirs within, though they break forth into quarrels and
contentions without: If a man be quarrelſom in his family,
no wonder if when he comes abroad, he quarrels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends

               <p>

Mens luſts are boiſterous and unruly, eſpecyally when they
have been acting a while; at the firſt venting they ſeem to be
fair, but after a while they grow outragious: violent and
boiſterous diſpoſitions are unfit for ſociety.</p>
               <p>You ſhall find in experience men who ſeem to be of weake
ſpirits, of ſoftly tempers, very remiſſe in what they do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
yet let the luſts of theſe men be engaged in any cauſe,
to any ſide, O how violent and impetuous will they be! they
care not what they ſay or do, they will divide from God,
from the publique, from their deareſt friends, from their nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
relations, from what themſelves have made profeſſion of

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7ly. In the luſts of mens hearts there is an antipathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, againſt his wayes, purity of his Ordinances, his
Saints. <hi>Gen. 3. 15. I will put enmity between thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
between thy ſeed and her ſeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Antipathy the oppoſition is,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. In the nature of the things, therefore its deeply rooted,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104285:64"/>
it comes not in accidentally; you may find two ſheep fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon ſome accident, but the natures are not oppoſite, like
the Wolfe and the Sheep.</p>
               <p>2. The cauſe of this oppoſition is ſecret; wicked men have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
their ſpirits riſe againſt the godly, but they are not able to ſay
why: The husband loved his wife while ſhe was carnall, now
God hath turned her heart ſhe is more obedient then ever, ſhe
ſeeks to give him content in all things more then before, ſhe
is more uſefull to him in all occaſions, more faithfull, every
way more lovely then before, only ſhe is godly now, and was
not ſo before; but his heart is now quite off from her, he
dares not ſay that it is for her godlineſſe, if he hath any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
himſelf, but ſo it is that now he looks upon her with
an evil eye, &amp; an eſtranged heart: So a wicked Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who loved their child exceedingly, before God was
pleaſed to work upon him, yet now the child is more dutiful
then he was, but the heart of the father or mother is taken off
from him, can hardly endure him, ready to take any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt him, their countenances are lowring and ſadd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, they can give no reaſon for this their change, but
as they were wont to ſay of Chriſtians, Such a man is a good
man, but he is a Chriſtian. <hi>Bonus vir Caius Seius ſed Chriſtianus,
non amo te,</hi> I love you not, but I can give no reaſon; <hi>Hoc tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
poſſum dicere, Non amo te,</hi> all that I can ſay is this, that I
do not love you.</p>
               <p>3. It is a ſetled, conſtant oppoſition: This hath been in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
generations the great cauſe of diviſion between the men of the
world, and the Saints, and ſtill it continues the ſame; you may
ſee the ſame ſpirit of the old oppoſers of godlineſſe and godly
men, working in our days; the names of things may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but the ſame kind of men for the ſame things are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and hated now in the ſame manner as in former gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>4. It is very ſtrong, ungodly men are exceedingly imbitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
againſt the Saints. <hi>Ezek. 26. 6. Becauſe thou haſt clapped
thine hands, and ſtamped with the feet, and rejoyced in heart, with
all thy deſpight againſt the Land of Iſrael:</hi> This ſpirit of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

there are between thoſe who are the ſeed of Chriſt, but
the great ſtirs in the Kingdom come from the evill ſpirit there
is in the ſeed of the Serpent againſt the godly in the Land. In
the beginning of the Parliament, when mens liberties and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
being involved in one, there was good agreement, all
men rejoyced, generally the countenances of thoſe who were

oppoſite to the power of godlineſſe, ſaw how the godly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them rejoyced, how their heads were lifted up, how
their hearts were filled with hopes of good dayes, wherein
Religion ſhould be countenanced and honoured; that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
that was in their hearts againſt the ways of God, boy-led
in them; though they were glad that they ſhould be freed
from ſome burdens, yet to ſee thoſe whom they hated in their
hearts, to rejoyce ſo much, they could not beare, but their
ſpirit roſe againſt them, and in oppoſition to them they have
raiſed theſe ſtirs, they have made theſe woful diſtractions that

becauſe God requires every man according to his place
to make oppoſition againſt them; the cauſe of the ſtrife lyes
not in thoſe who oppoſe them, they do but their duty; but
in in thoſe who nouriſh ſuch luſts within them; yet we finde
it ordinarily, that thoſe who are moſt corrupt will cry out
againſt thoſe who oppoſe them in their wicked wayes, as the
cauſe of ſtrife and diviſions, as if they were the troublers of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> whereas indeed themſelves, the wicked luſts of their
own hearts are the troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thoſe who oppoſe their
luſts deſire all good to their perſons. I remember <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in
his Book about the unity of the Church hath this paſſage, <hi>The
Son doth more grievouſly perſecute his father by living naughtily,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104285:65"/>
then the father him by chaſtiſing him duely. Sarahs Maid did more
trouble her by her wicked pride, then ſhee her Maid by her deſerved
correction.</hi> Thoſe men who are moſt faulty, are the men who
are to be charged to be the greateſt troublers in Church and
State.</p>
               <p>Thus in the generall, mens luſts are the cauſe of diviſions;
but let us enquire into the particular luſts of men, which wee
may alſo charge: Wee ſhall find theſe dividing diſtempers to
be as many as the dividing Principles: As the Philoſopher
ſpeaks of four Cardinall vertues, ſo the firſt four that I ſhall
name I may call the four Cardinall vices, theſe are <hi>Pride, Self-love,
Envy, Paſſion</hi> or <hi>Frowardneſſe;</hi> All the other diſtempers
that cauſe diviſions, have the poyſon of theſe four at the root
of them. Theſe are the Chariot wheels of the Furies, or the
four horſes that drawes them up and down hurrying from
place to place.</p>

the great incendiary in the ſoule of man, in families, in
Townes, Cities, in all ſocieties, in Church and State: This

cauſe of all contentions, becauſe it is the chief; though
there be many in a ryot, the whole uſually is laid upon the
ring-leaders. Pride is the ring-leader to all ryots, diviſions,
diſturbances amongſt us. <hi>Prov. 21. 24. Proud and haughty
ſcorner is his name who dealeth in proud wrath.</hi> Pride may be well
indicted for the great common Barrettor in all Towns,
and Cities, and Kingdomes, it makes wofull troubles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it comes. Mathematicians make this a rule to know
when a thing is exactly round, and when it is exactly

that are blown up with wind, ſpurt one from another,
they will not cloſe, but if you prick them, and ſo let out the
wind, you may pack a thouſand in a little room. Wee finde
this by experience, when God gives us moſt ſucceſſe in our
Armies, then are we moſt divided, then every man begins to
look high, and to be ſharking for himſelf; and when the Lord
diſcountenances our Armies, and brings us low, then we
think and ſpeak ways of Accommodation, then we bewaile
our diviſions with ſome brokenneſs of ſpirit: As it is with
Souldiers when they are fighting againſt the common adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
then they can agree well enough; but when they come to
divide the ſpoile, or be put into their Garriſons, then they
fall out: When we lye under the danger of the ſame common
calamity, then we can agree; but when we come to ſhare for
our ſelves, then our ſpirits ſwell one againſt another.</p>
               <p>We read in Scripture of the <hi>Mannah</hi> that God gave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
ſuch was the nature of it that the heat of the Sun melted
it. You wil ſay, <hi>How could it then endure the heat of the oven?</hi>
for they baked it in the oven; yet ſo it was, of a ſtrange kind
of nature, that it could bear the heat of the oven, and not the
heat of the ſun. Even of ſuch a temper are our hearts; the heat
of the ſunne of proſperity diſſolves us, cauſes us to runn one
from another, but the heate of the fire of affliction bakes us,
brings us, and ſettles us together; it makes us to be one, it
takes away our rawneſſe, it conſumes many of our ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
and ſo compoſes our ſpirits into one.</p>
               <p>The ſtupidneſs of our hearts is ſuch, as we do not make our
brethrens caſe, who ſuffer the rage of theſe wars, our owne;
But we for the preſent having ſome more liberty then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we are lifted up, and in the pride of our hearts puſh at our
brethren, and ſmite our fellow-ſervants: If the dogges be at a
little diſtance from us, though we even heare the cryes of our
brethren who are worried by them, yet we fooliſhly bleſſe our
ſelves in our preſent eaſe, enjoyments, and hopes, as if our
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104285:66"/>
fleſh muſt be ſpared, our eſtates, our liberties and enjoyments
muſt be continued, yea raiſed, whatſoever becomes of others.
Oh ſinfull vaine ſpirits, befooled and hardned with their
pride!</p>
               <p>But what are the ſeverall workings of pride that make ſuch
a ſtir in the world?<note place="margin">The ſeverall workings of pride cauſing diviſions.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, A proud man thinks himſelf too great to be croſſed,
Shall I beare this? I will make you know what it is to doe
ſuch things againſt me;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> he thinks it a great diſhonour to him
to beare any thing, therefore he muſt needs quarrel and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
if it be but to ſhew what a man of ſpirit he is, or to ſhew
that he is a man of ſuch worth, as whatſoever others beare,
yet it is not fit for him to bear it; it is but reaſon that ſuch a
man as he ſhould make men who will preſume to croſſe him,
to yeeld to him, to ſtoop under him. Now when one proud
man thinks it a diſhonour for him to put up wrongs from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
who it may be is as proud as himſelf, and he thinks it
a diſhonor for him to put up wrong, what peace can there be?
ſome wrongs muſt be put up, but proud men will never agree
who ſhall begin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe his ſpirit ſwells ſo big, he thinks every
thing that croſſeth him to be very great; his ſufferings are
great to him according to what great thoughts he hath of
himſelf, according to the excellency or meanneſſe of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
So are his ſufferings to be reckoned, ſufferings of a man
in eminency are judged according to his eminency and place;
if a mean man ſuffer the ſame things, they are not accounted
ſo great; now whether a man be great really, or in his owne
apprehenſion, its all one in regard of his eſteem of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
he thinks himſelfe therefore intollerable, becauſe they
are againſt himſelf.</p>

made him thus to aggravate the offence, but meerly the pride
of his heart? he thought that any thing croſs to his command
was a moſt hainous offence, a thing moſt horrid in the very

Pride ever aggravates any thing done againſt its owne mind.

to keep all things in union is for every man to keep within
his bounds, the ſwelling beyond tends to the breaking all in
pieces. <hi>Hab. 2. 5. He is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who
enlargeth his deſire as hell, and cannot be ſatisfied.</hi> If any humour
of the body goeth beyond its bounds, it brings much trouble
to it, the health and peace of the body conſiſts in the keeping

Proverb, Lime and ſtone will make a wall, if one be hand, yet
if the other be yeelding, there may be joyning, and good may

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Pride cauſes men to deſpiſe the perſons, actions, and
ſufferings of others, nothing is more unſufferable to a mans
ſpirit then to be vilified. A proud man deſpiſes what others
do, and others what he does, every man next to his perſon,
deſires the honour of his actions. If theſe two be contemned,
his ſufferings will likewiſe be contemned by the proud: This
alſo goes very neer to a man; one man thinks what another
man ſuffers is nothing, no matter what becomes of him; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thinks his ſuffering's nothing, and no matter what

6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Pride cauſes every man to deſire to be taken notice of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
to have an eminency in ſome thing or other; if he cannot be
eminent on one ſide, he will get to the other; he muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of one way or other: when he is in a good and
peaceable way, God makes ſome uſe of him; yet becauſe he is
not obſerved, and looked upon as eminent, he will rather
turn to ſome other way, to contend, ſtrive, to oppoſe, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, that he may be taken notice of to be ſome body,
that he may not goe out of the world without ſome noyſe:
<hi>What, ſhall ſuch a man as I? of ſuch parts, ſuch approved abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ſo endued by God to doe ſome eminent ſervice, be laid aſide,

               <p>7. A proud man would have others under him; and others
being proud too, would have him under them; he would
have others yield to him, and others would have him yield to
them, where will the agreement then begin? What is that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
which hath rent and torne the world in all ages, that hath
brought woful diſtractions, perplexities, confuſions, miſeries

ſeeking to bring one under another? Thoſe waſting Wars of
the <hi>Romans</hi> between <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius, Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> were
they not from hence? It is hard for men in great places, and
of great ſpirits, to accord long. <hi>Melancthon</hi> in his Comment
upon <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 10. ſays concerning ſuch men, there was wont
to be this Proverb, <hi>Duo montes non miſcentur,</hi> Two mountains
will not mixe together.</p>
               <p>8ly. A proud man makes his will to be the rule of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
and would have it to be the rule of other mens too, and

mean and low, a proud man will ſeek to put it upon others,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
and others who are proud will ſeek to put it upon him, and if
it be a work of credit, then he ſeeks it to himſelf, and others

               <p>13. If there be any good ſucceſſe in any thing, then pride <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/>
makes one man attribute it to himſelfe, and another man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
it to himſelf; and if the ſucceſſe be ill, then one puts
it off from himſelf, and and another from himſelf, and thus
quarrels and contentions are raiſed and fomented.</p>
               <p>14. One proud man thinks himſelf the only worthy man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/>
to have his counſel followed, and his deſires ſatisfied, and the
other he thinks himſelf the man that ſhould have his counſell
followed, and his deſires ſatisfied, and thus men ſtruggle and
oppoſe one another.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, one proud man is very diſcerning in the diſcovery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/>
of pride in another; and though he entertains it in his owne

Angel, they paint him black like themſelves; and when they
paint the Devil, they paint him white, as much different from
themſelves as they can: Thus men acted by Selfe, the fouleſt,
blackeſt opinon, yet if ſutable to their judgments, they wil ſet
out like Angels with the faireſt gloſſes that may be; and that
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is truth, if diſagreeing from them, they will paint it out
in the fouleſt manner that can be; they labor ſo to beſmear it,
that if it be poſſible it ſhall looke like a Devil. If a ſelfiſh man
be conſcious of not having that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is commendable, he will
not believe that others hath it: As <hi>Nero</hi> being abominably fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,

whatſoever evil he doth, he thinks all men if they had the like

they only take into themſelves, conſume thinge, and

are no way uſeful to any thing elſe. When any thing doth but
ſmell of Self, it begins to be loathed, let a man have never ſuch
excellent parts, do never ſuch excellent things, yet if Self ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
the lovelineſs and glory of all is gone; therefore thoſe
men that act ſelfe, they had need be very cunning, to keep in
and hide it; herein appears what a vile thing Selfe is, that
though in truth it acts all, and receives the incomes of all,
yet it dares not appeare, but lies ſculking under all the covers
it can; how vile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is this ſelfe, for which all muſt be done,
which thou makeſt thy God, yet cannot in the leaſt appeare,
but is odious and abominable to every one? yea it is conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

the acting of it is very miſchievous to all humane Societies.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, There is this wickedneſſe in ſelf-love, that even <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
thoſe things that men acknowledge to be right and good in

if what they will grant and commend to be good, yet when
it falls croſſe to them, they will oppoſe and contend againſt?
Thus <hi>Acts 26. 7. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which promiſe our twelve Tribes inſtantly

and yet in malice to me they accuſe me of this; or if not ſo,
yet they are willing that I ſhould ſink in this cauſe: Juſt as
many Miniſters were wont in their Pulpits to commend high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the wayes of Religion, to exhort men to grow up in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
to be carefull of all their wayes; but when ſome of
their Pariſhioners did but practice in the particular, what
themſelves had commended to them in the generall, they
would hate them, and perſecute them for it. God deliver us
from ſuch a ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Selfe cauſes men who are in publique employment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
to keepe up their private jarres and grudges, to interrupt the
publike, they will croſſe one another in their work for the
publike; let that ſuffer, ſo they may let one another feel of
their private grudges: In this Chriſtians are beneath Heathens.
I have read of <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> who had many jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104285:73"/>

work of the Common-wealth, in an Embaſſage, as they went

our worke for the Common-wealth, we may then examine them.</hi> It
were happy with us, if all men in publique employment in
this Land would from their hearts ſpeak thus to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

do, to indulge themſelves in them, but to be quick-ſighted
and ſevere in the diſcovering and oppoſing thoſe evils there
are in others, and this cauſes many breaches and fallings out.
We may apply that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. Love covereth a
multitude of faults</hi> to ſelfe-love. Selfiſh men ſee little evill in
themſelves, al is ever well with them whatſoever others do;
and the more they cocker themſelves, the more ſevere they are
to others; but Chriſt would have the quite contrary, ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to our ſelves, but indulgence to others; thoſe that are ſo,
are the moſt peaceable men. <hi>Mat. 18. 8. If thy hand or foote of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

thee, plucke it out.</hi> We muſt deale ſeverely with our ſelves in
thoſe things that are as neer and dear to us as our hands and
eyes; but <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. When Chriſt gives order how we are to
deale with our Brethren, he then requires more moderation;
<hi>If thy Brother offends thee, goe and tell him his fault between
thee and him alone;</hi> If he will not hear thee, then take with
thee one or two more, and ſee what thou ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that way; yea, and after that tell the Church, not preſently
cut him off, or caſt him away, as you muſt do when your
hand or eye offends you; If men have any indulgence, let it
be exerciſed towards their Brethren; if they have any ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
let them exerciſe that againſt themſelves. I remember I
have read of <hi>Pliny,</hi> that he ſays of himſelf, <hi>That he ſo paſſed by

               <p>None at all, onely that principle of Selfe was not ſo fully

ſtrange, and at laſt quite fell off from one another, from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
love and friendſhip, and then every little thing cauſed
grudgings between them.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Self ſets mens wits on work in all cunning craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
to fetch others about to their own ends, and this goes
as much againſt a mans ſpirit as any thing: When he comes
to diſcern it, no man can abide to be circumvented, to be as
it were rid upon, to be made ſerviceable only to another mans
ends: the more cunning there is in it, the more odious and
abominable it is to a mans ſpirit, when it comes once to be
perceived, a man cannot bear it. Crooked windings are the
goings of the Serpent: But if a man ſhall not onely ſeek to
make uſe of another to ſerve his own turne by him, but after
he hath done that, then to caſt him off to ſhift for himſelfe;
this is ſo provoking a thing, as it make breaches irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>10. When one is for Self in his wayes, he teaches another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
to be ſo in his; As a man by converſing with the froward,
learns to be froward: ſo many who have heretofore had plain
hearts, full of love &amp; ſweetnes, yet by being acquainted much
with ſelfiſh politique men, learn to be ſo too; I ſee how he
hooks in himſelfe in every thing, fetches about this way and
that way, but ſtill gets it to come to ſelfe; I perceived it not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104285:74"/>
at my firſt acquaintance with him, and then my heart was let
out to him fully, but now I ſee every man is for himſelf, and
why ſhould not I be ſo too? and what then is like to become
of the publique?</p>
               <p>Surely this ſelfiſhneſſe is very vile in the eyes of God; God
hath made us members of a community, the Univerſe is
maintained by union, therefore the creatures will venture
the deſtroying themſelves in going contrary to their natures,
rather then there ſhould not be union in the world; that
which they do in a natural way, we ſhould do by the ſtrength
of reaſon, much more by grace. Philoſophers ſay there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a vacuity in the world; The world could not ſtand,
but would be diſſolved, if every part were not filled, becauſe
Nature ſubſiſts by being one; if there were the leaſt vacuity,
then all things ſhould not be joyned in one, there would not
be a contiguity of one part with another. This is the reaſon
that water will aſcend when the ayre is drawn out of a pipe,
to fill it; this is to prevent diviſion in nature; O that we had
but ſo much naturalneſſe in us, that when we ſee there is like
to be any breach of union, we would be willing to lay down
our ſelf-ends, to venture our ſelves, to be any thing in the
world that is not ſin, that we may help to a joyning: O foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
heart, that in ſuch a time as this art ſelfiſh, when the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

every Mariner ſhould be buſie about his own Cabbin, dreſſing

               <p>This is a very ſhamefull diſtemper, ſome men will upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
confeſſe they fear other men, and others that they love
not other men, or that they contemn others, but no man will
acknowledge that he envies others, there is too much ſhame in
this, to be owned by any. The impiety and wickedneſſe is not
leſſe, it is a monſtrous wickedneſſe for a man to complaine of
God, that he made the world no better; and yet ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
there is in ſome mens hearts, but what is it then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of, and quarrel with God, that he hath made the
World, or any part of it ſo well? This the envious man
doth.</p>
               <p>An envious man cannot endure to ſee others better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
or to have more reſpect then himſelf. It is reported of
<hi>Licinius</hi> an intimate familiar with <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, who
alſo married his ſiſter, but fell off to be a deſperate enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Chriſtians, alledging this to be the reaſon, becauſe in
their Aſſemblies they prayed for <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and not for him.
Envious men, whether they deſerve reſpect or no, yet if others
have it, and not themſelves, they rage, and are mad.</p>
               <p>There is no vice but hath ſome kind of oppoſition to ſome
other, as covetouſneſſe to prodigality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Envy only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
that which is good, and all good, therefore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it but evil, and an univerſal evil. <hi>Gulielmus Pariſienſis</hi>
brings in <hi>Gregory,</hi> ſaying, That all the poyſon in the old
Serpent is in this ſinne, as if it had emptied it ſelfe of its
poyſon, and vomited it in this ſinne, ſo much venome there
is in it.</p>
               <p>Is it not a very evill thing, that in mens oppoſition againſt
what they ſee others deſire, they ſhould give this reaſon why
it ſhould not be ſuffered,<note place="margin">Nemo exiſtimet Bonos de Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia poſſe diſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere: triticum non rapit ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. <hi>Cipr. de unitat. eccleſ.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe if it be, the greater part of the

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly, what can have that power to take off the ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of mens ſpirits like mercy; the mercy of a God? ſurely
if any thing poſſibly can ſweeten them, that muſt needs do it.
We read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 11, 12, 13. a notable experiment of the
efficacy of mercy to ſweeten mens hearts. After <hi>Saul</hi> had ſlain
the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> ſome of the boſterous ſpirits would have had
him to have ſlain thoſe who formerly had rejected him; but
mark <hi>Sauls</hi> anſwer, <hi>ver. 13. There ſhall not a man be put to death
this day:</hi> Why? <hi>For this day the Lord hath wrought ſalvation in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
Though <hi>Saul</hi> at another time was a man of a harſh and
cruell ſpirit, yet now mercy ſweetens him; that which he was
one day by the ſenſe of mercy, that ſhould we be not only in
the day of our Thankſgiving, but in the courſe of our lives.
When ſalvation came to the houſe of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> O what a ſweet
temper was he in! <hi>Behold, halfe of my goods I give to the poore,
and if I have wronged any one, I reſtore foure-fold.</hi> Salvation is
this day come to the Kingdome, O that all we had hearts to
ſay, If wee have wronged any, wee will reſtore; if wee have
wronged any in their names, by word, or writing, any way,
we will reſtore: Mercy and love calls for mercy and love; if
we were in a right tune, there would be a ſympathy between
the bowels of God and ours; as in two Lures, if the ſtring in
one be wound up to be anſwerable to the other, if you then
ſtrike one ſtring, the other will move though lying at a diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
Now Gods love, Gods bowels move, let our love, our

to call off one another, ſeeing our diviſions from God hath
not provoked him to caſt us off?</p>
                  <p>11. Is it not in our deſires, that this great Victory might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
be purſued, that it might not be loſt, as others (in great part)
have been? Surely it cannot be purſued better, then to take
this advantage of it, to unite our ſelves more together then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we have done. This would ſtrike as great a terror into the
hearts of our Adverſaries as the victory hath done.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we had need take heed of breaches, leſt God ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
be provoked to change his adminiſtrations toward us; if there
be ſo much choller in the ſtomack, that ſweet meats are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into choller, it were juſt with God to come with bitter
and ſowr pils to purge out our choller. We read <hi>Jude, ver.</hi> 5.
The Lord ſaved the people out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
he deſtroyed them that believed not; the Lord hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us a great ſalvation from our Enemies, who would have
brought us into Egyptian bondage. We have been ſinging the
ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we have been praiſing God according to that,
<hi>Apoc.</hi> 15. 3. but let us take heed that yet God be not provoked
againſt us, for we are not out of all danger; as they by not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
ſo we by not agreeing, but contending and quarrell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſervant to whom 10000. talents were given, tooke it, that he
ſhould preſently go to his fellow-ſervant who ought him but
a hundred pence, <hi>and lay hands on him, and take him by the throat,</hi>
and ſay, <hi>Pay that thou oweſt, and cast him into priſon,</hi> Mat. 18. 28.
If men be not mollified by this mercy, they will be hardened,
they will uſe their brethren worſe then they did before, the
rather, becauſe they would declare to all the world, that
they make no ſuch interpretation of this mercy, as that God
would have them have further tender regard towards, to ſeek
union and peace with, to beare with or yeeld unto their
Brethren more then before; it is not unlikely but temptation
may be ſuggeſted to do ſome act the more againſt them, either
now or within a while, to wipe away any conceit of any ſuch
an interpretation of this gracious work of God for us. But
thoſe who are of gracious &amp; peaceable ſpirits, ſhould take the

good, and ſeek to mollifie their ſpirits, to know what it is
they have one againſt another, what prejudices, what hard
thoughts have been entertained by them, and by all meanes
they are able to remove them, that ſo we loving &amp; delighting
in one another, the Lord may love us, and delight in us, nad

any yeeldableneſs to others; no, that is but lightneſſe and
weaknes in men, they are of a more ſtaid and ſtrong temper
then to do ſo: Theſe men by their wiſdome do very much ſinn
againſt the wiſdome of the holy Ghoſt in this Scripture; yea,
and againſt the example of Jeſus Chriſt, who as in his whole

and here is ſet forth unto us to be one who pleaſed not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

are carried: Where there is much will, though the thing be
little about which men contend, yet the oppoſition may be
great; as a little ſtone thrown with a ſtrong arme, may take
deep impreſſion. It is a dangerous thing to have mens wills
ingaged in matters of difference, it is eaſier to deal with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
mens reaſons, then with one mans will: A man of a wilfull
ſtout ſpirit, ſtands as a ſtake in the midſt of a ſteam, lets all
paſſe by him, but he ſtands where he was; What hope can
there be of union, where there will be no yielding? one mans

will raiſeth anothers, ſet will to will they may daſh one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

A wilful man thinks it is beneath a wiſe man to alter his way;
yea, it may be he thinks it a diſhonour to the truth, that both
he, his profeſſion, and the honour of God ſhall ſuffer by it;
when a ſtubborn ſelf-willednes is taken for a right conſtancy
and ſetledneſſe, it is very ſtrong in men; but let us take heed
of this, it is no matter though we go back from our former
aſſertions, ſo long as we go forward to the truth. <hi>Luther</hi> was
called an Apoſtate; I am ſo, ſays he, but it is from errour to
truth. Many times ſtoutneſſe of ſpirit comes from weakeneſſe
rather then ſtrength; there is not always the greateſt ſtrength
of judgment where there is the greateſt ſtrength of will: As a
mans judgment that is without prejudice is very ſtrong, ſo a
mans prejudice that is without judgment is as ſtrong: The
dulleſt horſes are not always the moſt eaſily reigned. <hi>I know
and am perſwaded,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 14. many men are
perſwaded before they know; thoſe who are perſwaded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they know, wil not be perſwaded to know. Mens wills
will not ſuffer their underſtandings to conſider; if they doe
conſider, they will not ſuffer them to be convinced; if they
be convinced, they will not ſuffer them to acknowledge that
they are convinced.</p>
                  <p>It is diſhoneſt for a man not to give in his Bond when the
debt is paid; ſo for a man not to acknowledg himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
but ſtand out againſt the truth, though his conſcience
tels him it is made clear to him. Let men lay down their wils,
and there will be no hell, ſayes <hi>Bernard:</hi> So ſay I,<note place="margin">Ceſſet propria voluntas, &amp; non erit infernum. <hi>Bern. ſer. 3. de Reſur.</hi>

mens wills, and contentions will ceaſe. <hi>Scaliger</hi> tels us, the
nature of ſome kind of Amber is ſuch, that it will draw to it

of their corrupt wills, are grown headſtrong, will not be
drawn by that which draws others.</p>
                  <p>But this charging men of wilfulneſs is preſently catched
hold of, in an abuſive way; if men wil not yeeld to what ſome
conceive to be right, preſently they are charged with wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſtubbornneſſe, they do not ſee becauſe they will not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104285:82"/>
ſee; they are not convinced, becauſe they will not. We who
differ ſo much from others in things that others thinke to be
clear, ſhould take heed how we charge others of wilfulneſſe
who differ from us: As it is diſhoneſt not to give in the bond
when the debt is paid, ſo it is a cheat to require the bond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the debt be ſatisfied: Men may think, and give out, they
have done enough to convince men, when indeed upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
it will be found to be nothing, or far ſhort of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
the reaſons that are againſt it if they were their own.
But when a man may have peace in his conſcience, that what
he holds or does, is not through wilfulneſſe, but conſtancy of

are ſuſpitious of every one; but as for thoſe who ſuffer
cauſeleſly, in this thing let them be of good comfort, God
will reward them good for what evill they ſuffer. Wee read
<hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 28. that if a man were jealous of his wife, ſo that he
brought her to the tryall by drinking the water of jealouſie;
if ſhe were clear, ſhe ſhould not onely be freed from hurt by
that water, but ſhe ſhould conceive ſeed, if ſhe went barren be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Lord would recompence her ſorrow and trouble ſhee
ſuffered by her husbands ſuſpition of her. And <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi>
upon the place, ſays, the <hi>Jewes</hi> had a tradition, not only that
ſhe ſhould conceive, but it ſhould be a man-child; if ſhee had
any diſeaſe, ſhe ſhould be freed; and if ſhe brought forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

20. Debates, envyings, wraths, ſtrifes, whiſperings.</hi> Many of
fidling, paltry diſpoſitions, goe up and down whiſpering, they
ſpeak very ſecretly to you, you muſt tell no body by any means,
and yet themſelves tell it to a ſecond, a third, a tenth, and any
one they meet with, with whom they deſire to ingratiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and to every body they ſpeak, yet ſtill they muſt tell no
body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they doe not love to be brought forth as the authors,
they tell you as a friend, what they heare; and thus carrying
tales up and downe in a ſecret way, they doe what in them lyes
to blaſt the names of their Brethren; jealouſies, ſuſpitions,
envyings, diſpleaſure, anger is raiſed, and the parties againſt
whom all this is, wonder what is the matter, they being no
wayes conſcious to themſelves of any miſcarriage towards
ſuch from whom they finde ſuch ſtrange carriage; at laſt
ſome nibling whiſpering Mouſe is found to be the cauſe
of all.</p>
               <p>Theſe whiſpering Tale-bearers have ſuch an art, as to cauſe
what they thus ſpeak in ſecret to ſinke very deeply into mens
hearts: They profeſſe themſelves very ſorry for what they tell
you, but it is too true, and with a deep ſigh they miſchiefe their

Neighbour; <hi>Et ſic cum vultu maeſto procedit maledictio, Bern.</hi>
But let men take heede of them, for they ſtrike, they wound
them as much, if not more, then they doe thoſe againſt whom
they ſpeak, for they know nothing of it; and though they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
yet they doe not ſinne; but you may not only be troubled,
and that cauſeleſly (it may be) and for nothing loſe the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of your love to your friend, and the enjoyment of his to
you; but withall, you may entertain ſinne into your heart, and
ſo be wounded. <hi>Prov. 18. 8. The words of a tale-bearer are as
wounds, and they goe downe into the innermoſt parts of the belly,
beware therefore of ſuch.</hi> Prov. 20. 19. <hi>He that goeth about
as a tale-bearer revealeth ſecrets, therefore meddle not with him
that flattereth with his lippes.</hi> Hee may come glavering, and
fawning, and ſmiling to you, as if he accounted you a ſpeciall
friend, and therefore would not tell every body; but meddle
not with him; if you ſhall hug and embrace him, you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a wound even in the innermoſt parts of the belly. <hi>Prov.

the beauty of their friendſhip darkened, and the

               <p>Whiſpering tale-bearing tongues is the cauſe of ſtrife, take
heed of it: And ſo is a cenſuring tongue: I can compare
this to nothing better then to a candle, whoſe tallow is mixed
with brine, as ſoone as you light it, it ſpits up and down the
roome: Thus many have ſalt brine in their ſpirits, which
when they get a little knowledge, they ſpit here and there in
hard and bitter cenſures, which are exceedingly provoking to
the ſpirits of men; though the cenſures ſhould prove true, yet the
mixture of ſo much ſalt brine in them, cannot but exaſperate &amp;
cauſe mens hearts to fret; but much more if they prove to be

this be a raging tongue, <hi>Hoſ. 7. 16. Their Princes ſhall fall by

times they riſe ſo high, that great men, yea Princes come to
fall by the ſword. There is a ſtory in the <hi>Tripartite Hiſtory</hi> of a
Chriſtian who profeſſed he had beene ſeven and thirty yeares

                  <p>WHen men have got a little knowledge, they thinke it a
fine thing to be arguing and diſputing in matters of
Religion: unneceſſary diſputes are their neceſſary practice,
for otherwiſe they ſhall be accounted as no body, if they
have not ſomething to object againſt almoſt every thing, but
in this way of theirs, they ſhall bee accounted knowing
men, men who have an inſight into things, who underſtand
more then ordinary men doe: hence they turne all their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
into diſputes, and by them they grow giddie. Wine is good
when it goes to the heart to cheere it, but when it fumes all up
into the head, it makes it giddy. Knowledge is good when the
ſtrength of it gets to the heart to comfort it, there to breed
good ſpirits, for the ſtrengthning it in the waies of holineſſe; but
when it flies up all into the head, it fills it with thouſands of
phanſies; it cauſes pride and giddineſſe. Diſputes draw the beſt
ſpirits from the heart, by which it weakens it. It is a very ill
ſigne in a man to have a contradicting ſpirit, to get into a veine
of diſputing againſt any thing, though it be good. I have read
of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> that he told his friends that <hi>Julian</hi> would
prove to be a notorious wicked man, he gave this reaſon, Becauſe
be tooke ſuch delight in diſputing againſt that which was good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Diſputes are ſeldome without much heart-diſtemper; if they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104285:87"/>
continue long, they cauſe ſnarling one at another; and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
though thoſe who ſnarle ſo often, doe bite at laſt. A man
ſhews moſt parts in the matter of truth, but moſt grace in the
manner of handling it with reverence, holineſſe and modeſty.
<hi>Rom. 14. 1. Receive not the weake in faith to doubtfull diſputations.</hi>
Here is a direct injunction againſt thoſe diſputes I am ſpeaking
of. Let no man ſay every truth is precious, the leaſt truth is more
worth then our lives, we muſt contend for every truth.</p>
                  <p>The leaſt truth is ſo precious,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that we muſt rather loſe our
lives, then deny it; you muſt doe and ſuffer much to maintaine
truth, but this in an orderly way.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you muſt be grounded in the maine Fundamentalls of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Religion; you muſt be ſtrong in the faith, and after that labour
to edifie your ſelves in all the truths of God, ſo as one may be
helpfull to another. It is not for every one who hath but little
time, little knowledge, little meanes, little ſtrength, to tyre out
himſelfe and others in doubtfull diſputes. The Scripture is ſo
much againſt this, as nothing can be more. 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 4. Which
miniſter queſtions rather then edifying.</hi> To aske and diſcourſe
of queſtions about the great things that concerne thy ſoule, thy
eternall eſtate, how thou maiſt live further to the honour of
God, is good, when you meet together; to confer one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
what God hath done for your ſoules, to tell each other
the experiences of your owne hearts, and Gods dealings with
you, what temptations ye meet with, and how God helps you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them; ſuch things as theſe would edifie. But when your
queſtions are about things that you are never like to underſtand,
and if you did underſtand, they little concerne you, they would
not be helpfull to you one whit in the wayes of godlineſſe, theſe
the holy Ghoſt would not have you ſpend your time in. <hi>Eccleſ.
7. 29. Man was made upright and he hath found out to himſelfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inventions, Miſcuerit ſe infinitis queſtionibus,</hi> ſo the old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
reads it, he hath mingled himſelfe in infinite queſtions. If
we had but that great queſtion more amongſt us, <hi>What ſhall wee
doe to be ſaved?</hi> it would cauſe many unprofitable queſtions to
vaniſh. Never ſuch ignorance came upon the Chriſtian world,
as in that age when the Schoolmen were in the higheſt eſteeme;
all Religion then was turned into Queſtions, both the myſtery
and the power of godlineſſe was loſt. The things of Religion
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104285:88"/>
are rather to be beleeved then diſputed. We beleeve Fiſhermen,
not Logitians,<note place="margin">Credimus piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoribus, non Dialecticis. <hi>Ambr.</hi>
                     </note> ſayes <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> The Devill at this day ſeekes to
darken the glory of Religion this way; he ſees that in regard ſo
much light hath broke forth, he cannot get men preſently off it
by prophaneneſs, therefore he labours to eat out the ſtrength
of it by buſying them, and getting them to delight in multitudes
of queſtions, and that about things of leſſer concernment.</p>
                  <p>1 Tim. 6. 4. Hee is proud, and knoweth nothing, but doting
about queſtions, and ſtrife of words, whereof commeth envie,
strife, railings, evill ſurmiſes, perverſe disputings of men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
mindes, and destitute of the truth. <hi>Theſe men conceit they
have more knowledge then other men, but the holy Ghoſt ſaies
they know nothing; they cry out much of the truth, and they
contend for the truth, but the holy Ghoſt ſaies they are deſtitute
of the truth.</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 22, 23. Follow charity, peace, but fooliſh
and unlearned queſtions avoid, knowing that they doe gender ſtrifes,
but the ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive. <hi>And</hi> Titus 3. 8. 9.
This is a faithfull ſaying, theſe things I will that thou affirme
conſtantly, that they which have beleeved in God, might be carefull
to maintaine good workes; theſe things are good and profitable
unto men, but avoid fooliſh questions, and Genealogies, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ſtrivings about the Law, for they are unprofitable and
vaine.</p>
                  <p>The queſtion about the Law, whether a man be juſtified by
it, or by free grace in Chriſt, this is not one of thoſe fooliſh
queſtions and needleſſe ſtrivings, this is a great queſtion, this
we are to contend for, our life is in it, but there are other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
about the Law, which cauſe ſtriving rather then edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as whether the Law be a rule for our lives, as it was given
by <hi>Moſes;</hi> That we are bound to doe what is required in the
Law, this is generally acknowledged, as to love God, not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
Images, &amp;c. but whether we be bound to doe it as it was
the Law delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> upon Mount Sina, this queſtion
troubles many mens heads; that we are bound to doe the ſame
things as they are delivered by Chriſt in the hand of that Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
is acknowledged by any that underſtand themſelves in
any meaſure. Now then let theſe two things be granted about
the Law; Firſt, that we are not juſtified by it, but by the free
grace of God in Chriſt: Secondly, that what duties of holineſs
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104285:88"/>
are ſet downe in the Law, we are bound to them by the moſt
ſtrong obligations: what neede we contend further about the
Law? Let us be eſtabliſhed in theſe two, and it will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for our edifying; It is like when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle
to <hi>Titus,</hi> the heads of the people were troubled about ſome ſuch
kinde of queſtions about the Law, as are amongſt us; therefore
ſayes he, <hi>Avoid fooliſh queſtions, and ſtrivings about the Law.</hi>
But now the queſtions about the Law are driven on to ſuch a
dangerous iſſue, that we have cauſe not onely to be carefull to
avoid them, but even to tremble at the thought of them. It
is now accounted a legall thing againſt the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
to confeſſe ſin, to be humbled for ſin, to make conſcience
of duty, or to be troubled in conſcience for neglect of it; No,
they thank God they are delivered from ſuch things, in reſpect
of God, whether they ſin or not it is all one: yea theſe things
prevaile with thoſe who have beene forward in profeſſion of
Religion, who ſeemed to walke ſtrictly, now are growne looſe.
That ſaith is eaſily wrought, which teacheth men to beleeve
well of themſelves, though their lives be ill. There is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
change in mens ſpirits now from that which was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
Times have been when any opinion that tended to looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
was preſently diſtaſted as unfavoury, and rejected by ſuch,
who made profeſſion of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sleidan</hi> in the tenth book of his Commentaries, ſayes, The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
that ſought to doe miſchiefe at <hi>Munſter</hi> was not a skilfull
Devill, but rude and ſimple, becauſe he ſought to prevaile by
tempting men to looſeneſſe; whereas, ſayes he, if he had beene
a cunning Devill, he would rather have deceived by abſtaining
from fleſh, by abhorring Matrimony, by ſhewes of wonderfull
lowlineſſe of minde, &amp;c. he might ſooner have taken men this
way; but truly now the moſt cunning Devill ſees it to be the
beſt way to attaine his ends, to raiſe up and foment opinions
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>end to the liberty of the fleſh, ſo be it he can carry them
on under the colour of magnifying free grace; he findes that
theſe things are exceeding ſuitable to mens ſpirits in theſe times,
that they are taken in by ſuch who formerly appeared ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious,
that hee feared hee ſhould never have beene able
to have prevailed with them; hee never found a way like to
this to prevaile with ſuch men; yea, never a way like to this to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104285:89"/>
choake the Word, when it firſt begins to worke upon the heart;
he hath blaſted more young ſeeming converts this way, then
ever hee did by any way ſince he was a Devill: Heretofore the
way was to ſtirre up others to deride them for following the
Word, and for praying; now he hath a way worth two of that,
to make them to deride others for their conſcienciouſneſſe in
following the Word and praying, and this ſtrengthened with a
high perſwaſion, that hereby they are the great magnifiers of the
free grace of God in the Goſpel, the only men who underſtand
the Goſpel way. This Devill now lookes upon himſelfe and
his fellowes as ſimple and fooliſh in all their former devices,
here is an experiment beyond them all, ſeeing this Chriſt muſt
needes be magnified, hee will magnifie him too; ſeeing the
Goſpel muſt goe on, hee will put it on too, hee will finde out a
device here, to ſtrike at the practiſe, power, life of godlineſſe,
in a more ſecret and prevailing way then ever formerly was
done; it is like in this generation the former principles of
godlineſſe will not be got out; but if this way prevails ſtill
in proportion to what it hath done, in a generation or two it is
like to bring generall prophaneneſſe and licentiouſneſſe upon
the face of the Chriſtian world more then any way of Satan ever
did ſince the world began, for here is a way to be looſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
and to ſatisfie Conſcience too.</p>

the body growes into diſtemper preſently; we may be all
uſefull in our places, if we keepe to them, contenting our ſelves
with the improvements of our talents in them; thus both our

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104285:89"/>
and kept in that proportion God would have it, it was very
good; but when men muſt have more, and keep it longer then
God would have them, then it breeds worms. Thus it will be
in all that we have, or doe; let us keepe our proportion God ſets
us, and all will be well; but if we thinke to provide better for
our ſelves by going beyond our meaſure, wormes are preſently
bred in all.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially where men will not keepe within their bounds
in their power over others; for what is all our conteſtation at
this time? it is not about mens ſtretching their power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their line both in State and Church? From whence are
our State-diviſions, our Warres, but becauſe Princes have been
perſwaded their power was boundleſſe? at leaſt not to be kept
within thoſe bounds the State ſayes it ought to bee. They think
there is ſuch a diſtance between them and others, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
liberties, lives of all men within their country lie at their
mercy; not conſidering how they come to be raiſed ſo high:
that what they have above others, is given to them by thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
whom they are. No man inheriteth more then was given to
his forefathers, and ſo to him, whereby they might ſee that they
are not limited onely by the lawes of God, but by the lawes of
men alſo, namely, The agreement between them and the people
when they are raiſed to ſuch dignities. There is nothing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
their right more then the pleading it by conqueſt; Princes
have little cauſe to thank thoſe who plead their right that way.
The ſureſt foundation for Princes to ſet their feet on, is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
between the people and them, or their progenitors;
but if they will goe beyond this agreement, what ſtirres, what
wofull diſturbances doe they make!</p>
               <p>Secondly, if either they, or any Governours of the State, ſhall
inſtead of being helpfull to the government of the Church,
take it all from it into their owne hands, in this they goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
thoſe bounds Chriſt would have them; it is by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
power that the Governours of the Church have the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
exerciſe of what power Chriſt hath given them, but they
have not their power from them. Civill authority cannot put
any ſpirituall power into a man, or company of men, which
they had not before; it can onely protect, encourage, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the exerciſe of that power that CHRIST hath given.

they might not thinke Diſcipline a ſmall thing, he ſayes, that
thoſe Churches cannot be ſaid to profeſſe the Goſpell truly nor

not to be the leaſt part of Chriſtian Religion, but muſt know
that the Goſpel is neglected by ſuch as ſhall put off from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

It pertaineth to the whole Church to admit one into her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
therefore to the whole Church to caſt one out of her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
<hi>And a page or two after,</hi> The Apostle writing to the
whole Church of Corinth will have them being gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to deliver that inceſtuous perſon to Satan, therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular Church or Congregation hath power to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.
<hi>There they give many arguments to prove, that the
Apoſtle would not excommunicate by his owne authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but by the authority of the Church, and that collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken, (ſo they ſay) not the Miniſters or Elders of the
Church onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let no man ſay, this was the judgement but of one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104285:91"/>
for at the beginning of this Parliament, my ſelfe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a reverend Brother, asked Maſter <hi>Henderſon,</hi> two or
three of the Miniſters of <hi>Scotland</hi> being with him, Whether we
might not take that Book as the judgement of the moſt godly
and able of the Miniſters of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the matters of Church-diſcipline?
They anſwered, we might.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way of going beyond their limits, is their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
their power to more Congregations then Chriſt hath
given them charge of. The chiefe Church-controverſie at this
day is about this extent; I ſhall onely ſhew you where the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
lyes betweene one and the other in it. The Queſtion is
this, Whether one that is ſet by Chriſt to take charge of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Congregation, as a Paſtor to feed them, by Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Rule, may keep the Paſtorall charge he hath for
Word and Sacraments to one Congregation, but his charge for
Rule ſhall extend together with others to an hundred Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
or more.</p>
               <p>Some ſay that no Miniſter can have the charge of ruling over
people in a large extent then his charge over them for Word
and Sacraments reaches; they thinke that thoſe people that can
ſay to a Miniſter, That charge that Chriſt hath given you for
Word and Sacraments, extends not to take care of our ſoules to
feed them, therefore you have no charge of our ſouls for ruling;
if you thinke you may, preach or adminiſter Sacraments in an
accidentall arbitrary way onely, not as chalenging power over
us for this, or looking upon us as thoſe committed to you, for
whom you are to anſwer; then at the fartheſt you may exerciſe
rule over us but in this way.</p>
               <p>But others hold this, That a Miniſter may anſwer to this
people thus, I confeſſe I have indeed onely ſuch a particular
Congregation to be my flock, and although I being deſired to
help ſometimes in another to preach or adminiſter Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet I doe it not as having the charge of their ſoules as
being Paſtor to them: But as for that ruling power that Chriſt
hath given me, I conceive by joyning of it with others, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to hundreds of Congregations, or more, according as
our aſſociation ſhall be, ſo as we have not onely liberty to be
helpfull to thoſe who have the ſpeciall charge of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations;
but we have the ſupreame ruling power in our hands,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104285:91"/>
to challenge in the Name of Chriſt, to exerciſe over theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
as we ſhall ſee cauſe. I ſay, the ſupreme power
above what your Miniſters or Elders in your particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
have; for though theſe Miniſters and Elders of
yours be admitted to be members of our Court, yet if they all
ſhould be of a contrary minde from us, in ſome matter that
concernes your Congregation, we yet will judge and determine,
we will cenſure and exerciſe all kinde of Eccleſiaſticall Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in that congregation, as we ſee cauſe, though it may be
not one of us ever ſaw any of the faces of any of the men of your
congregation before. Here, I ſay, lyes the great dividing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
which is right, which is wrong is not my worke to
ſhew; all I am to doe, is but to ſhew you what the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
is, about which there is ſo much diſpute.</p>
               <p>And though I determine not the caſe either way, yet I ſhall
leave two conſiderations to help you in your thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the extent of power of Juriſdiction muſt be by inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
as well as the power it ſelfe; all juridicall power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
either in State or Church receives limits or extent from
the ſame authority it firſt had its riſe, this is impoſſible to be
denyed: If a man by a Charter be made a Mayor of a Towne,
he cannot therefore challenge the power of a Mayor whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he comes, except the authority that firſt gave him his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhall alſo extend it. Now the Charter by which any Church-Officer
is inveſted with power, is the Word, therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtreighten or enlarge the power of a Miniſter otherwiſe
then we find it in the Word; for Civill power it may be ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or enlarged, as the Governours of State ſhall ſee cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Charter is from man, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, man naturally is of nothing more impatient then to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
have Juriſdiction challenged over him, except hee ſees the
claime to be right; and in the point of ſpirituall juriſdiction,
man is the moſt tender of all, becauſe in that men come in the
Name of Chriſt to him, challenging authority to exerciſe the
power of Chriſt over him, not over the outward man ſo much
as over his ſoule, to deliver it up to Satan. Surely there had
need be ſhewne a cleare and full Charter, that any men have,
that gives them ſuch a power as this, that men in conſcience
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104285:92"/>
ſhall be bound to ſubmit to. Now then here lyes the diviſion,
on ſayes his Charter does extend ſo farre; the other ſayes, hee
does not finde it ſo in the reading of it.</p>
               <p>There is yet a further conſideration of the ſtretching either
Civill or Eccleſiaſticall authority beyond their bounds, which
hath been, and may be the cauſe of much diviſion; that is, their
challenging and excerciſing power in things indifferent, beyond
what God hath given them; for the opening of which we muſt
know:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, no man either in State or Church, hath any authority
given him by God, to command any thing meerely becauſe hee
will; eſpecially, when the things concerne the worſhip of God.
Our Brethren of</hi> Scotland <hi>in their diſpute againſt Engliſh Popiſh
Ceremonies,</hi> part 3. chap. 8. pag. 127. <hi>have this paſſage,</hi> Princes
have enjoyned things pertaining to the worſhip of God, but thoſe
things were the very ſame which Gods written Word had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
commanded; when Princes went beyond theſe limits and
bounds, they tooke upon them to judge and command more then
God hath put within the compaſſe of their power: <hi>And pag. 136.
of the ſame Booke they ſay,</hi> The Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
us to be the ſervants of men, that is, to doe things for which
wee have no other warrant beſide the pleaſure and will of men.
<hi>This was the Doctrine in</hi> Tertullians <hi>time,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iniquam excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetis dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem, ſi ideo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis licere quia vultis, non quia debuit non licere, <hi>Tertul. Apol. adverſ. Gentes.</hi>
                  </note> You exerciſe,
<hi>ſayes he,</hi> an unjuſt dominion over others, if you deny a thing
may bee done, becauſe you will, not becauſe it ought not to bee
done.</p>
               <p>It is onely the Prerogative of God, of Jeſus Chriſt, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a thing becauſe they will.</p>
               <p>God hath appointed Civill Governours to be his Miniſters
for our good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. Thoſe things onely which they can doe
in Gods Name as his Miniſters, and are for the good of a State,
are the object about which their power is to be exerciſed; they
are not to require a thing becauſe there is nothing againſt it,
but becauſe this thing is for God: And Church-governours
are to require onely ſuch things as Chriſt requires, all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of their power ought to be in the Name of Chriſt, hence
not becauſe they will, or becauſe nothing can be ſaid to the
contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In all they require of us, they muſt be able to ſay as</hi> Paul,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104285:92"/>
1 Cor. 14. 38. <hi>giving rules about order and decencie,</hi> If any man
thinke himſelfe to be a Prophet, or ſpirituall, let him acknowledge that
the things that I write unto you are the Commandements of the
Lord.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, But are Governours alwayes bound to ſhew
a reaſon of their will, to thoſe who are under them; or may
not they obey except they know ſome good in the thing,
beſides their doing the will of thoſe who doe command
them?</p>
               <p>Though no Governours may command but upon reaſon,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> yet
the Governours of State need not alwayes diſcover the reaſons
of their commands.</p>
               <p>Wee may give up our Civill liberties ſo farre as to be bound
to yeeld to our Governours commands, if wee ſee nothing
againſt what they command, but have cauſe to ſuppoſe that they
ſee ſome reaſon that we do not, which is not fit to make known
to us. This is grounded upon this reaſon, that there are <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana
imperii,</hi> myſteries of State that are not fit for every man
to know, the ſecrecie of them conduces moſt to the good of
the State: But it is otherwiſe in the matters of the Church,
which are ſpirituall, there are no ſuch myſteries in the Church,
wherein any members of it can be required to be active, but it
concernes them to underſtand as well as to doe. All the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Church as ſuch muſt be done for ſpirituall edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
now a man cannot doe a thing for the edifying his ſoule,
or the ſoule of another, but he muſt underſtand his action and
the rule of it; he muſt ſee it required by the Word, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he cannot expect any ſpirituall efficacy in what he does;
I may doe a thing for a civill good, wherein I may truſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans reaſon, and this may be ſufficient to attaine my end,
the procuring of ſome good meerly civill, but this will never
be able to reach to a ſpirituall good, I muſt ſee the reaſon, the
ground, the rule of the action my ſelfe; I muſt judge by the
Word, that this action at this time cloathed with all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
is by Chriſt ſitted for ſuch a ſpirituall good that I
aime at.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if things meerely indifferent be enjoyned, then is
Chriſtian liberty violated. No, ſay ſome, Chriſtian liberty is in
the conſcience, ſo long as a man keepes his conſcience free,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:104285:93"/>
the thing may be ſtill indifferent to him in regard of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
though his practiſe be determined, and ſo Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
is preſerved. This is the put off that the Prelaticall party
made uſe of againſt our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> many yeeres ſince,
when they pleaded that by their uſurpation Chriſtian liberty
was taken from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To that anſwer of the Prelates, they thus reply:</hi> When the
authority of the Churches conſtitution is obtruded to binde and
reſtraine the practice of Chriſtians in things indifferent,<note place="margin">Diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Engliſh Popiſh ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, p. 1. cap. 3. pag. 6, 7.</note> they are
bereaved of thir liberty, as well as if an opinion of neceſſity were
borne in upon their conſciences. <hi>They urge that place,</hi> Coloſ. 2.
21. <hi>where the Apoſtle gives inſtances, ſay they, of ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ordinances as take away Chriſtian liberty; he ſaith not,</hi>
you muſt thinke that you may not touch, but touch not; <hi>you muſt
not practiſe, not be ſubject to ſuch Ordinances; telling us;</hi> That
when the practice is reſtrained form touching, taſting, handling,
by the ordinance of men, then is Chriſtian liberty spoiled, though
conſcience be left free; if the outward man be brought in bondage,
this makes up ſpirituall thraldome (<hi>ſay they</hi>) though there bee no
more.</p>
               <p>And further, the Apoſtle gives theſe two Arguments againſt
theſe things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſayes he, they periſh in the uſe; that is, there is no
good comes of them.</p>
               <p>It may be you will ſay, What hurt is there in them? That is
not enough, ſayes the Apoſtle, to juſtifie them, though there
ſhould be no hurt in them, yet ſeeing they periſh in the uſe,
ſeeing there comes no good by them, you muſt not doe them:
But what if they ſhall be commanded by authority? may wee
not doe them then? No, ſayes the Apoſtle, that is another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
againſt them; they are after the commandements and
doctrine of men; if it be a meere ordinance of man, and there
be no other reaſon in the thing, but becauſe man enjoynes it in
the Church, you are not to doe it. Yea, in ſome reſpect we have
not ſo much liberty in things indifferent, if they be enjoyned by
men, as we had before. This is thought to be a very ſtrange aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
by ſome; but conſider this one thing, and it will not
appear ſo: Though I might doe ſuch a thing before, yet if man
ſhall take upon him this authority to command, meerly becauſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104285:93"/>
of his will and pleaſure, if I now obey I am in danger to edifie
him, to ſtrengthen him in his ſinne; he challenges this authority,
and I ſeeme to yeeld it to him, certainly he is ſtrengthned in it
by my ſubjection, except I doe this at leaſt profeſſe againſt any
ſuch authority of man granted by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But ſay ſome, If you take from Governours power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
things indifferent, you take away all their power; for
things neceſſary are required without them, and things ſinfull
they may not command.</p>
               <p>Surely this conceit comes rather from tradition then from due
conſideration;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> for it is not power enough to ſee to the keeping
of the commands of God, that the Ordinances be kept pure, that
there be juſtice between man and man, to reward thoſe which
doe well, and to puniſh the evill doers.</p>
               <p>Yet thus farre muſt be granted to the Officers of the Church,
they have authority from Chriſt to declare <hi>dogmatically,</hi> when a
thing in it ſelfe indifferent, yet by reaſon of ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
comes to be a duty, and this is to be regarded more then the
declaration of any private brother or brethren, for they doe it
by way of office in the name of Chriſt. This we finde <hi>Acts</hi> 15.
the Apoſtles and Elders ſent their Decrees, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
their <hi>dogmaticall determinations</hi> about ſome things in themſelves
indifferent, but as cloathed with thoſe circumſtances they call
them things neceſſary; they determine them to be done from
the reaſon of the things, not from their authority; thoſe things
were duties before they decreed them, and had been, had they
never decreed them. Even forbearing the eating of blood was
a duty in caſe of offence, though their decree had never been,
and otherwiſe it was no duty, notwithſtanding their Decree, for
afterward <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, that whatſoever is ſold in the ſhambles,
they might eate of it, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake,
and every creature of God is good, if it be received with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.
Thus we have ſeen what the bounds are which God
hath ſet to men in authority, or at leaſt the controverſie about
them: Let them be carefull to keep within their bounds, as they
are ſet to keep others within theirs: by this, Church and State,
may enjoy much peace.</p>

he quotes,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 23. Ye are bought with a price, bee not ye
ſervants of men. Although (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) we were perſwaded that
we could communicate with ſuch a Church, without evident danger
of damnation, yet inaſmuch as we cannot communicate with it upon
any better termes, then legall ſervants or bondſlaves doe with their
Maſters, we are bound in conſcience and religious diſcretion, when
lawfull occaſions and opportunities ore offered, to uſe our liberty, and
to ſeeke our freedome rather then to live in bondage.</p>
               <p>This doctrine was allowed of in the Biſhops times. Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon theſe two grounds there be a withdrawing from a
Church, Chriſt does no where require his people to live without
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:104285:94"/>
Ordinances all their dayes, rather then they ſhould joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
together into another body.</p>
               <p>Secondly, yet where theſe cauſes are not, but men may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
without ſinne, profeſſing the truth, and enjoy all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
as the freemen of Chriſt. Men muſt not ſeperate from
a Church, though there be corruption in it, to gather into a new
Church which may be more pure, and in ſome reſpects more
comfortable. Firſt, becauſe we never finde the Saints in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſeperating or raiſing Churches in ſuch a caſe: and ſecondly,
There would be no continuance in Church fellowſhip, if this
were admitted: for what Church is ſo pure, and hath all things
ſo comfortable, but within a while another Church will be more
pure, and ſome things will be more comfortable there? The
generall peace of the Church ſhould be more regarded by us,
then ſome comfortable accommodations to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Although you cannot for the preſent communicate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
with the Church, in which you are, without ſinne, or bondage,
yet you are not preſently to withdraw, to gather into another,
or to joyne with another, you are bound to give ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the Church, as to continue with much long-ſuffering, to
ſeeke the good of that Church, to remove the ſinne that is upon
it, with all good meanes you can. You muſt beare much with a
brother, much more with a Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If things were in that ordered and ſettled way, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
they ought, there ought to be no gathering of any new Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
without conſulting and adviſing with neighbour Churches,
Chriſt would have all Churches unite themſelves, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
one with another, being all of the ſame body of Chriſt:
If then there be to be raiſed a new Siſter Church, that expects
and is to deſire the benefit of Communion with the reſt, there is
all the reaſon in the world that the helpe, advice, and aſſiſtance
of the other Churches ſhould be made uſe of in the raiſing and
ordering this Church that they are thus to owne in the way of
communion with them to whom they are to give the right hand
of fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, All beleevers who live in a place together, ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
ſo far as they can, joyne into one Church, though they be of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
judgements and tempers, what ever things they differ in,
yet if they may ſtand with grace they can have no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104285:95"/>
from the examples of any of the Churches, we read of in
Scripture, for them to divide themſelves into little pieces. The
way of Chriſt all along in Scripture is, that all the Saints in ſuch
a place, who are not more then can joyne in one, ſhould joyne
together and make but one Church; certainly this is more for
the honour of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body then the diviſion of Saints in the
ſame place into ſeverall little ſocieties, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtands much upon
the union of his Saints in one, in all wayes, by all meanes that
may be.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, as things are yet with us, there is no ſuch great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that outcry there is amongſt us againſt gathering
of Churches as ſo great a dividing practice as many ſeeme to
make it.</p>
               <p>How can this practiſe be ſo very offenſive, when almoſt all
of you thinke it lawfull for a man for any commodiouſneſſe to
remove from that Church of which now he is, to joyne with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
ſobeit he will remove his dwelling?</p>
               <p>But theſe do not ſet up new Churches.</p>
               <p>If a company of men who have eſtates,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſhould not be ſatisfied
with that Miniſtery that belongs to that company that now
they are joyned with, and ſhould buy a piece of ground cloſe
to the place where they were, and build upon it, and have
leave of the State to make a new Pariſh of thoſe dwellings they
build; who would blame them for gathering a Church thus?
Hence it is apparent, that withdrawing from our Churches, and
gathering other, is not according to the judgements of our
Brethren againſt any Church Principle; the offence that is,
is onely againſt ſome civill conſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this thing in effect hath been ordinarily practiced
heretofore without any offence to the godly; yea, and is ſtill
practiced without any complaint: Hath it not beene and is it
not ſtill ordinary for many not to communicate in the Pariſhes
where they live? nor commonly to heare there, but from all
parts of the City to come to ſome Pariſhes where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the beſt Miniſters to be, and there to heare and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
and this in a conſtant way, and that with allowance to
the maintenance of ſuch Miniſters? yea, and thus the Husband
goes one way, and the Wife another, and yet none offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
it may be the Gentleman can content himſelfe with his
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104285:95"/>
Pariſh-Church, but his wife or Lady is not ſatisfied, but muſt go
elſewhere.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, But this was in a time when things were in great
confuſion, not ſo reformed as now they are, and we hope may
further be.</p>
               <p>Then it is not howſoever ſimply unlawfull.<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. It continues ſo ſtill in many places of this City.</p>
               <p>3. When you have reformed further, it may be mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
will bee further ſatisfied; you may reforme ſo farre
as you may prevent much of what you now complaine ſo
much of.</p>
               <p>But though they came for their preſent reliefe, yet they did
not binde themſelves one to another by Covenant, ſo as men
now doe.</p>
               <p>If thoſe who came conſtantly to your Miniſtry and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had profeſſed their willingneſſe to joyne with you in all
the Ordinances of Chriſt ſo farre as they knew,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and to walke
accordingly, you might the more comfortably have adminiſtred
ordinances to them, but offenſive to you it could not have been.</p>
               <p>But their Covenant bindes them ſo,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that they cannot returne
back againe, whatſoever reformation there be.</p>
               <p>Doe you pray for and endeavour the putting on Reformation
to the uttermoſt,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and then ſee what they will doe; they have
not yet declared themſelves, that they hold themſelves ſo joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any Covenant, that they may not joyne with you; that
what releife they have had for the preſent time, or what agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there hath been amongſt themſelves, ſhould hinder them
from falling into that way all along held forth in Scripture;
namely, for all the Saints that live together, to joyne in one, ſo
farre as poſſible they can.</p>
               <p>But theſe who gather Churches thus, looke upon all others
who are not in that way as Heathens; and what diviſion muſt
this needs make?</p>
               <p>If this were ſo,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> it were a ſad dividing practice indeed; wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men cannot endure to be thus judged of, to be caſt out as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of Church-fellowſhip, much leſſe can the Saints bee
able to beare it, it muſt needes go neerer to their hearts. <hi>Aben
Ezra</hi> ſayes, the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> burnt the bookes of
the Law, becauſe of that place, <hi>Deut. 23. 3. An Ammonite or
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:104285:96"/>
Moabite ſhall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord, even
to their tenth Generation.</hi> If an <hi>Ammonite</hi> or <hi>Moabite</hi> cannot
beare the being ſhut out of the Congregation of the Lord,<note place="margin">Mald. in Lam. 1, 2.</note> how
can the Saints beare it? But God knows, and our Brethren may
know, I hope they ſhall know, that the thing is not ſo: O no,
they looke upon you as the precious Saints of God, their deare
Brethren in Jeſus Chriſt, they bleſſe God for the graces they ſee
in you, and rejoice in the hope of living eternally in Heaven
with you.</p>
               <p>But why then will they not admit them to their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</p>
               <p>In all worſhip that belongs to Saints,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> as Saints they joyfully
joyne with them; but they thinke there is ſome that belongs
to Saints as gathered in a Society under Officers, which cannot
be performed orderly but in that way; and they think it unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
that any ſhould have the benefit of the priviledges of
the Church, and be under no power, no diſcipline of any Church;
that they ſhould pick and chooſe Ordinances, and yet live at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
ſo that if they walke diſorderly, no Church hath any
power to call them to an account. Suppoſe this to be a reaſon
why they admit not of ſome, this is another thing then the
judging of them to be Heathens.</p>
               <p>Let me ſay further, I know none of theſe congregated Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
either here or in other parts, that ever refuſed any who
appeared to be godly, from communicating with them, if they
did but acknowledge themſelves to be members of any Church
elſewhere, though that Church were in a differing way from it
in reſpect of government.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, What need that?</p>
               <p>If it be to prevent looſeneſſe in men who will be under no
government,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> if it be becauſe they judge Sacramentall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be a Church-Ordinance; or if it ſhould be through a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
yet howſoever this muſt not be judged to be the cauſe
that they judge all, that doe not joyne with them to be as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this is the moſt uncharitable interpretation that can be.</p>

               <p>THis is an old continued practice of the Devill, he hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much by it, and therefore is loath to leave it: The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
of old were called <hi>Cornelians, Cyrillians,</hi> by the followers
of <hi>Novatus</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nullum crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis nomen niſi nominis crimen. <hi>Tertul. Apo.</hi>

               <p>And among other that of <hi>Schiſmaticke</hi> is not onely a chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing,
but a ſtigmatizing name, whereby of old and lately
many have had a brand of reproach upon them, which upon
examination will be found to be as it is applyed by many, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a ſcaring word, taken up by ſuch who underſtand lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
what Schiſme is; I ſhall therefore endeavour to open this
briefly. The word Schiſme comes of the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to rend,
from thence <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Sciſura,</hi> a rent; It is amongſt Divines
a <hi>Tecnologicall</hi> terme. Schiſme in the Church, is much like to
what Sedition is in the State: When the Church grew up to
the ſtate and outward glory of an earthly Kingdome, much uſe
was made of this terme, as a brand upon thoſe who would not
ſubject to the yoakes of them who loved preheminence in the
Church.</p>
               <p>But the true nature of Schiſme is this, An uncharitable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
raſh, violent breaking from union with the Church, or the
Members of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:104285:99"/>
The Church is that from which the rent is: Hereſie divides
from the head, Schiſme from the body, Apoſtacy from both. This
rent is either from the whole Church, or ſome part, if from the
whole, it is <hi>Donatiſme: Donatus</hi> denyed any to be of the body
of Chriſt, to be beleevers, to be ſuch as could be ſaved, except
that company that joyned with him, and with thoſe in his way.
This is clear from the whole diſcourſe of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt him,
in that Tract <hi>De unitate Eccleſiae.</hi> Wherefore thoſe who cenſure
ſuch as deny communion with ſome particular Congregations,
as Donatiſts, diſcover either ignorance or malice, if not both.
Yet Schiſme may be, though the rent be but from ſome part
of the Church, but this muſt needs ſuppoſe union with that
part: now there may be a twofold union with the ſeverall parts
of the Church, either that which all who are to be accounted
Chriſtians have with them as they are of the ſame body Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
or that which is by agreement to grow up together into a
ſpeciall fellowſhip. The rending from any of theſe unions in
ſuch a way as before was mentioned, is Schiſme. If we ſeperate
from, or refuſe that communion with ſuch as are to be accounted
Chriſtians, that is due to all Chriſtians, this is the more groſſe
Schiſme. Or if we thus breake off that communion which is by
ſpeciall agreement, which may be either when Chriſtians joyne
together in a private way for mutuall edification and comfort:
or when they ſo joyn together as to make up a diſtinct ſpirituall
corporation, to ſet up the publick ordinances of Chriſt, which
the Scripture calls a Church: Now though there may be Schiſme
in the breaking the former, yet the cenſure of Schiſme is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
applyed to the undue breaking off communion in the latter.</p>
               <p>Now this implyes an union by a Church agreement; where
there never was ſuch an agreement, there cannot be the guilt of
this Schiſme. Although they who dwell within ſuch a perambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
ſuch a compaſſe of ground, ſhould not joyne in ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
with ſome within that compaſſe, whatſoever offence
there may be againſt ſome civill conſtitution, yet the guilt of
Schiſme they doe not contract upon themſelves, for that union
they never had cannot be broke.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, Yes, they are Schiſmaticks, though they
were never ſo united, becauſe they were bound to unite thus, and
they have not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:104285:99"/>
It muſt be granted that CHRIST by what he ordered
the Apoſtles to doe,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> would have all Chriſtians dwelling
together, ſo far as they can, to unite into a body, but there is no
ſuch order of Chriſt, that all that dwell on the one ſide of the
ſtreet ſhould be of one body, and all on the other of another bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
if they be more then can joyn into one ſpirituall corporation,
they are bound to joyne into ſeverall, ſo as they may beſt, to
their own and other Churches edification, and if they ſhould fail
in this, not joyning in the beſt way that poſſible might be, their
ſin is againſt that edification that Chriſt requires, but not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſin of Schiſme. Who ever they were that bounded Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
ſurely they did not ſo bound them to the greateſt edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church that poſſible might be, and yet who will ſay
they were therefore Schiſmaticks? But ſuppoſe you have joyned
with any company of Saints in a ſpirituall corporation, if you
now ſhall uncharitably, unjuſtly, raſhly, and violently break from
communion with them, then you contract the guilt of Schiſme
upon you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ſepartion muſt be from want of charity. By faith
eſpecially we are united to Chriſt our head, and by charity to one
another. If a man appeares departing from any fundamentall
Article of our faith which joyned him to his Head, he is to bee
judged an Heretick. So by his appearing to depart from that love
by which he was joyned in communion with the members,<note place="margin">Schiſmatis peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum ſpeciale vitium eſt, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritati oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. <hi>Aquin. 2. 2 q. 29. Art. 1. concluſ.</hi>
                  </note> he is
to be judged a Schiſmatick. If his departure proceeds from his
love of God, his love to his Saints, and his owne ſoule, yea his
love to that very Church from whence he departs, as ſometimes
it may, witneſſing in a gratious way againſt evill in it, he is farre
from the guilt of Schiſme.<note place="margin">Schiſmatici diſciſſionibus iniquis a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna charitate diſſiliunt. <hi>Aug. lib de Fide &amp; Symbolo, cap.</hi> 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If you ſay, love is a ſecret thing, we cannot judge of what is
in the heart.</p>
               <p>We cannot judge of it while it is in the heart, but when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
we may. You may know whether this or other principles
act men or no by their behaviour in their breaking off commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

appear, and carry them beyond thoſe principles themſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, If the cauſe of leaving communion be juſt, then thoſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104285:100"/>
who give this cauſe are the Schiſmaticks, not thoſe who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
upon it. Thus the Governours of the Church may be the
Schiſmaticks, and a private member withdrawing may be free.

               <p>If Governours ſhall enjoyne any thing upon the Church, or
any member, that is ſinne, or if they ſhall mingle evill in the
publick worſhip, ſo that there can be no joyning with their
worſhip, but there muſt be likewiſe a joyning with ſinne, in this
caſe if any withdraw from them,<note place="margin">Culpam ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matis non debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re conferri in eos qui deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores deſerunt, ſed in ipſos de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertores qui Chriſtum &amp; antiquam fidem deſerum erant, <hi>Voet. deſper. cauſa papatus, lib. 3. ſect.</hi> 3.</note> they are the Schiſmaticks, not

forſake ſuch as have forſaken Chriſt and the ancient faith; but
upon thoſe who have thus forſaken Chriſt and his truth.</p>
               <p>When the ſecond Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> ſet up Image-worſhip,
many thouſands could not yeeld to it, but were forced to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
who was the Schiſmaticall party there, but the Synod
and thoſe who joyned with it?</p>
               <p>Yea further, if they impoſe that which is not neceſſary,
(though in it ſelfe not ſinful) and will not beare with the
weakneſſes of ſuch as thinke it to be evill; if upon that they be
forced to withdraw; in this the Governours are the Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
alſo; the cauſe of the rent is in them, they ought in ſuch
things to beare the weakneſſes of their Brethren, and not impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
to require of them thoſe things that there is no neceſſity
of. If ſuch things be ſinne to their Brethrens conſciences, if
they will ſtand upon it to enjoyne them, they lay a neceſſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to withdraw from them. God will not lay the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
of Schiſme thus, Such a one departed from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of ſuch a Church, becauſe he would not doe what was
lawfull to be done; but thus, You impoſed that upon your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which there was no neceſſity of, and would not forbeare
him in what I would have you forbeare him, but cauſed him by
your imperiouſneſſe and ſtiffeneſſe, to depart from communion
with you. It is true, ſayes God, the thing might have been done,
but it was not neceſſary, it was out of conſcience to me that
they forbore, the weakneſſe is theirs, but the Schiſme is yours.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This hath beene generally received (though it be very falſe)
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104285:100"/>
that if a man departs from a Church becauſe he refuſeth to joyn
with it in that which is not in it ſelfe evill, that this mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
is Schiſmaticall: Certainly no; Grant there is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in his conſcience, and ſo a ſinne, he ſhould informe his
conſcience better, but cannot; and this inability is not without
ſinne, yet this ariſes not to that height of ſinne, as to make that
(which (ſuppoſing him to be in this condition) is better for
him to doe then not to doe) to become Schiſme; eſpecially if he
be willing to hold communion with that Church ſtill in all acts
of worſhip, wherein he can joyne without ſinning againſt his
conſcience, and continues brotherly love to them as Saints in
all the expreſſions thereof, as he is able.</p>
               <p>The firſt great Schiſme in the Church, that was cauſed by the
Governours of it, was that which <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
thoſe who joyned with him cauſed, by that imperious way of
enjoyning <hi>Easter</hi> to be kept at ſuch a time which you have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>pag.</hi> 15, 16, 17. The ſtory of which you have in
<hi>Euſebius, lib. 5. cap.</hi> 23. Thoſe who denyed not the lawfulneſſe
of keeping <hi>Easter,</hi> yet have generally accuſed <hi>Victor,</hi> and ſuch
who ſo violently urged this upon the Churches as the cauſe of
the Schiſme, not ſuch who did not conforme to what was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
them, becauſe the thing was not neceſſary, and there
ſhould have beene a forbearance in it: No Governour ought
to urge ſuch unneceſſary things which are but under ſuſpition by
tender conſciences, if they do, the Schiſme is juſtly charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where a man cannot have his ſoule edified in ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Ordinances and truths of great moment, which that Church
whereof he now is ſhall deny, and is in great danger of being
ſeduced to evill, he may depart from that Church to another,
if he does it orderly, and not be guilty at all of Schiſme, love
to God and his owne ſoule is the cauſe of this, not want of love
to his Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a good ſpeech I finde</hi> Chillingworth <hi>hath, what the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the man was I know not, but in that Treatiſe of his,</hi> The
Religion of Proteſtants a ſafe way, Cap. 5. Part. 1. Sect. 61. <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
that plea of his adverſary againſt Proteſtants, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with a Church not erring in fundamentals, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of erring in other matters, muſt not be forſaken, he hath
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104285:101"/>
this excellent ſaying:</hi> If I did not finde in my ſelfe a love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of all profitable truth; if I did not put away idleneſſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
and worldly affections, and ſo examine to the bottome all my
opinions of divine matters, being prepared in minde to follow God,
and God onely which way ſoever he ſhall lead me; if I did not hope
that I either doe or endeavour to doe theſe things, certainely I ſhould
have little hope of obtaining ſalvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When I conſider of theſe cauſes of departing from a particular

does not conſtitute the species, ſo in morall, not that which is
beſide the intention for that is accidentall: therefore, <hi>ſayes he,</hi> the
ſin of Schiſme is in that it intends to ſeparate from that unity which
charity makes, and therefore Schiſmaticks are properly thoſe who of
their own accord and intention doe ſeparate themſelves from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Church.</p>
               <p>The next thing conſiderable in the deſcription of Schiſme; is
the raſhneſſe of the ſeparation: though the cauſe of ſeparating
be juſt, yet the manner of it may be ſchiſmaticall, if done raſhly
or violently. Thoſe who are joyned in communion with others,
when they differ from thoſe with whom they have communion,
they are bound to examine, try, to make uſe of all meanes they
can to ſatisfie their conſciences in things they ſcruple: and if
they cannot, yet before they breake off communion they are
bound to ſeek by all means they can for a redreſs of thoſe things
which after moſt ſerious examination appeare evill to them,
they are bound to wait with much forbearance, and longſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And at laſt if there be a neceſſity of departing, they muſt
not rend away with violence, but ſhew themſelves willing and
ready in the ſpirit of love and meekneſſe to open their cauſe, to
ſhew their reaſons to the Church why they cannot continue in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104285:101"/>
that communion with them they formerly had, and deſire that
they may peaceably and lovingly depart, ſeeing they cannot
with peace of their conſcience and love to their ſoules continue
with them, and that they may joyne with ſome other Church,
where they may enjoy peace and further edification.</p>
               <p>Surely here is no Schiſme, this is no rending away, here is
no violence uſed, here is onely a loving and peaceable ſeceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
notwithſtanding this, were it not the pride, envy and
frowardneſſe of mens ſpirits, much love and peace might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
amongſt Chriſtians and Churches: True indeed, if men
can beare no contradiction, no kinde of blame of their wayes,
there muſt needs be trouble; but then thoſe who doe contradict
or blame, though they be in the wrong, yet if it be through
weakneſſe, and carryed with meekneſſe, they are not ſo much
the cauſe of the trouble, as thoſe who cannot beare this
weakneſſe of their Brethren without frowardneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
               <p>There are other names of diviſion; the name of <hi>Puritan,</hi> what
a divider hath it been? but that ſeeing it ſelf ready to dye, divided
it ſelf into two, <hi>Round head</hi> and <hi>Independent;</hi> theſe are now the
opprobrious, diſcriminating, ſcornfull names of diviſion amongſt
us: For the firſt, there is ſo much folly and abſurdity in it, that
ſurely it will ſoone vaniſh of it ſelfe if you contemne it; it is
too low and contemptible for a Pulpit, or a Pen to meddle with:
But the other carries in the face of it an open defiance to all kind
of government, a monſtrous kind of liberty for men to live as
they liſt, and to be accountable to none, whatſoever they hold
or doe: Certainly ſuch kinde of people as theſe, are not to be
ſuffered; ſhall I ſay in any Chriſtian ſociety? no not in any
humane ſociety; if there be any ſuch people as theſe, they are
one of the moſt monſtrous kinde of people that ever lived upon
the face of the earth: How many runne away with the word,
and cry out of men and their wayes under this name which
they know not? How farre thoſe who are for the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
way, are from ſuch an uncontroulable liberty, hath
beene ſhewne, <hi>Chap. 7. Pag.</hi> 41. I ſhall adde this one
thing, of all kinde of governments in the Church, that which
hath this name faſtened upon it is moſt oppoſite to the name of
any in that ſenſe it is ordinarily taken, for there is no Church-government
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104285:102"/>
that holds forth more means to reduce from
errour, or any miſcarriage, then this doth; examine it with the
Prelaticall or Presbyteriall Government, and you ſhall find it;
for firſt, in the Prelaticall Government, if once the Prelates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
any caſe, you muſt there reſt, there is no Church helpe
for you, except you will ſay it is in a Convocation, where we
know they ruled both in the choyce of members, and ordering
all things as they liſt. In the Presbyteriall way, if ſo many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated
Elders determine any caſe, it muſt in them receive the
finall determination, you muſt reſt in it, although the greater
part of the Churches, and the greater number of Elders in a
Kingdome ſhould be of another minde; for if you riſe to a
Nationall Aſſembly, there are not the twentieth part of Elders
of the Kingdome in it: But thoſe who men call Independents
ſay, that if any thing be done by them that is offenſive, not only
thoſe aſſociated Elders, but all or any Elders or Churches
whatſoever may require account, may in the name of Chriſt
doe all in effect, for the reducing of them, that thoſe aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Elders can doe, ſtill remembring that Church-power in one
or the other, goes no further then mens conſciences; if men
wil not conſcientiouſly regard what is done to reduce them from
evill, there is no help within the Church, but to appeale to
CHRIST; as for the externall helpe by the Magiſtrate, that
concernes not the controverſie about Church-government, and
yet for ſubjection to that Ordinance of God, the principles and
profeſſion of thoſe you call Independents leave as much to the

as go or ſend to him, to ſee if upon a ſerious and quiet examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Religion was in the world; never did ſo many withdraw
from hearing even thoſe by whom they acknowledge God hath
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104285:104"/>
ſpoken to their hearts and that before they have gone to them,
to impart what it is that ſcruples them, to try whether they may
not get ſome ſatisfaction. Certainly if you have no neede of the
Word, the Word hath no neede of you. You may eaſily expreſs
your diſcontents one to another; you may eaſily ſay you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
you will never heare ſuch an one any more, but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſo eaſily anſwer this to Jeſus Chriſt. When your weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

Heretofore you would have been glad of that, which now you
ſleight and reject; this is not from more light or ſtrength that
you have now which you had not then, but from more vanity,
pride, and wantonneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Others deny hearing, not from ſuch a diſtempered ſpirit, but
out of tenderneſſe, becauſe they think the Miniſter is no true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of Chriſt, becauſe he had no true call, becauſe he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by the Prelats, &amp;c. I confeſſe though for mine own part
I never yet doubted of the lawfulneſſe of the call of many of
the Miniſters of the pariſhionall congregations in <hi>England,</hi>
though they had ſomething ſuperadded which was ſinfull, yet
it did not nullifie what call they had by the Church, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, amongſt whom they exerciſed their Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
yet I doe not thinke it the ſhorteſt way to convince thoſe
which refuſe to heare, to ſtand to prove to them the lawfulneſſe
of the call of thoſe Miniſters whom they refuſe to heare, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make it out to them, that though their call be not right
to the Miniſtery, yet they have not ſufficient ground of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
from hearing them. For they hold it is lawfull for a
man to preach the Word as a gifted man, and that theſe men
from whom they withdraw are gifted and faithfull, and preach
excellent truths they deny not.</p>
                  <p>But they will ſay, If they did this as gifted men, it were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matter, but they preach by vertue of their call.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer to that is, if they be acted by that principle, and
therein miſtake, this is their perſonall ſinne, not the ſin of thoſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104285:105"/>
who joyne with them in a good thing, which they doe upon
an ill ground. When I joyne with a man in an action, I am to
look to the action, and to the principle that I goe upon, but let
him with whom I joyne look to the principle that he goes
upon.</p>
                  <p>Your hearing a man doth no way juſtifie his call to the office
of the Miniſtery.</p>
                  <p>If a man doth a thing that he may doe by vertue of two rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or either of them, it may be he thinks he ſtands in one of
thoſe relations which indeed he doth not, yet he doth the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by vertue of it in his owne thoughts, in this he ſinnes; but
there is another relation wherein he ſtands, that is enough to
warrant the action that he doth to be lawfull. Now though he
doth not intend the acting by this relation, the action may be
ſinne to him, but not at all ſinne to thoſe who joyne with him
in it. If he will goe upon a falſe ground, when he may goe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a true, let him looke to it. I will joyne with him in that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as warranted for him to doe by vertue of his ſecond relation,
which it may be he will not owne himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Take an inſtance in ſome other thing, and the caſe perhaps
will be more cleare.</p>
                  <p>Giving almes is a worke that a man may doe either by vertue
of Church office, as a Deacon, or as a Chriſtian whom God
hath bleſſed in his eſtate, or betruſted with the diſtribution of
what others betruſt him with. Now ſuppoſe a man is in the place
of a Deacon, he thinks himſelf to be in that office by a right call
into it, and he gives out the almes of his Church by vertue of his
call; but I am perſwaded his call to that office is not right, he is
not a true Deacon; yet if I be in want, I knowing that both he &amp;
thoſe who have given him money to diſpoſe, may and ought to
diſtribute to thoſe that are in need, by vertue of another rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as men, as Chriſtians, enabled by God, ſurely then I may
receive almes from him lawfully, though his principle by which
he gives them me is ſinne to him. I may communicate with him
in this thing, though he acts by vertue of that office that he had
no true call unto; why may I not as well communicate with a
man in his gifts, though he acts thus ſinfully himſelfe?</p>

                  <p>Practiſing revenge is the way to continue diviſions to the end

and therefore they offend me againe, mee againe, and I them,

therefore I will deny them, and therefore they will deny mee;
ſo theſe unkindneſſes run on endleſly; diviſions will have a line

of men?</p>

               <p>Firſt, the quiet, comfort, ſweetneſſe of our ſpirits is
hindered by diviſions: They put the ſpirit out of tune;
men who heretofore have had ſweet ſpirit full of ingenuity,
ſince they have intereſſed themſelves in theſe Diviſions, have
loſt their ſweetneſſe, their ingenuity is gone. When the Bee
ſtings, ſhe leaves her ſting behinde her, and never gathers
Honey more; men by ſtinging one another, doe not loſe
their ſtings, but they loſe their honey, they are never like to
have that ſweetneſſe in their hearts, that heretofore they had,

Shall I loſe my ſweetneſſe, ſayes the Fig-tree, and goe to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
over the trees? Why doeſt thou not reaſon thus with thy
ſpirit? Shall I loſe my ſweetneſſe in contending, to get my will
to be above others? God ſorbid. There was a time that both my
my ſelfe and others found much ſweetneſſe in the temper of
ſpirit; there was nothing but peaceableneſſe, quiet, calmneſſe,
contentedneſſe in it, and how comfortable was ſuch a temper of
ſpirit! me thought when my ſpirit was in that ſweet frame, all
things were ſweet to me; but ſince I have been intereſted in
quarrels and contentions, it hath beene farre otherwiſe with me.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 4. Perverſneſſe in the tongue cauſes a breach in the
ſpirit. Contentions cauſe much perverſneſſe in mens tongues,
and this cauſes a breach in their ſpirits. Your contending coſts
you deare: though it were in nothing elſe, yet the loſſe of this
ſweetneſſe of ſpirit makes it very coſtly to you. All the wrong
that you ſhould have put up if you had not contended, had not
been ſo great an evil to you, as this one thing is. There is nothing

delivered from the fierce and implacable hatred of Divines.</hi> There
was much diſputing, contending, quarrelling in thoſe times,
which was ſo tedious to the ſpirits of theſe good men, as it made
them the willinger to dye, that they might be where their ſouls
ſhould be at reſt. That Saint of God old M. <hi>Dod,</hi> never loved to
meddle with controverſies; he gave that reaſon, He found his
heart the worſe when he did. Men ſeldome come away from
hot diſputes, or any other contentions, but their ſpirits are altered
for the worſe. They finde it ſo, and others finde it in them. If
a man has beene abroad, and met with company with whom he
hath been contending, his wife, children, ſervants, finde that he
comes not home with the ſame ſpirit that he went out with.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, they hinder the freedome of a mans ſpirit, which a
wiſe man ſets a high price upon: the ſtrength of many mens
ſpirits is ſpent in contentions, they have no command of them
to any thing elſe. When a man is once engaged in a conteſt, he
knows not how to get off; Contention is a great ſnare to a man,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104285:108"/>
he wiſhes he had never medled with it, he is weary of it, but
knowes not how to come off fairely. I have read of <hi>Francis</hi> the
firſt, King of <hi>France,</hi> conſulting with his Captaines how to
lead his Army over the Alpes, into <hi>Italy,</hi> whether this way or

one to intereſt himſelfe in quarrels, but the difficulty is to be
diſengaged from them when you are in.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they hinder the good of the body; many men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

your comforts were wont to be double, treble, ſeven fold, an

he had any thing that he could communicate to another godly
man, and the other had the like joy that he had any thing to
communicate to him; thus comforts were multiplyed; but now
your comforts are ſingle, Oh the ſweetneſſe, the ſutableneſſe

it was a bleſſed oneneſſe of heart: they did as it
were exchange ſoules one with another every day; their ſoules
did cloſe claſpe one with, and cleave one to another. Oh how
did they love to open their hearts one to another! what delight
was there in pouring forth their ſpirits one into another! What
cheerfulneſſe was there wont to be in their meeting! they eate
their bread together with ſingleneſſe of heart and joy, praiſing
the Lord. There were no ſuch merry meetings in the world, as
the meetings of the Saints were wont to be: They parted one

hearts warmed, enlarged, reſolved, ſtrengthened in Gods waies.

dye for one another: but now they are burdens to one anothers
ſpirits, they bring evils one upon another. Thoſe who heretofore
were forward Profeſſors, whoſe ſociety was onely amongſt the
Saints, now they can ſuit well enough with thoſe who are carnal,
they cloſe with them, their converſe is moſt amongſt them.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104285:109"/>
Oh Lord, what fire is it that is kindled amongſt us! The nature
of fire is, <hi>Congregare homogenea, &amp; ſegregare heterogenea,</hi> to
gather things of a like nature together, and ſeparate things of a
different: but our fire does quite contrary, it ſeparates things
that are Homogeneall, and joyns things Heterogeneall. Surely
this is no other then the fire of hell.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, they hinder our time. Abundance of time is ſpent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
about our diviſions, which we are not able to give account to
God for. When men are engaged in contentions, they will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them night and day, whatſoever buſineſs be neglected, to
be ſure that muſt not: yea the choice of our time that was wont
to be ſpent in meditation, reading, prayer, is now ſpent in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
and wrangling. Thoſe retired times that we were wont
to converſe with God in, are now ſpent in the workings of our
thoughts about our diviſions; and when we come abroad then
a great part of our time is taken up in going firſt to this body,
and then to the other, to help forward and foment matter of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion.
Of all the time of a mans life, that time that is ſpent in
lawing and quarrelling is the worſt, and happy it were for many
that it might not be reckoned amongſt the days, weeks, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
of their lives.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, they hinder our prayers. <hi>If two or three agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
                  <hi>touching any thing they ſhall aske, it ſhall be done for them
by my Father,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 18. 18. 1 Tim. 2. 8. I will that
men pray, lifting up their hands without wrath.</hi> When <hi>Daniel</hi>
was in a ſtrait, he goes to his companions, and deſires them to
lift up prayers to God for him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 17. There was a a ſweet
agreement between them. Hence their ſtock and trade in prayer
went in common, but diviſions do exceedingly hinder prayer,
either one with another, or one for another. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. the
Apoſtle giving rules for a peaceable loving life between man &amp;
wife, the woman muſt be meek, and the man live with his
wife as a man of knowledge; and they muſt walk together
as the heires of life. Why ſo? <hi>That your prayers may not bee
hindred.</hi> Private contentions in families are great hindrances of
family-prayers: So our publick diviſions and contentions are
the great hindrances of the prayers of Chriſtians in a more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
way. How were they wont to pour forth their hearts in
prayer together? then their hearts cloſed, but now it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104285:110"/>
Men do not walk now together as the heirs of life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their prayers are hindred. God accepts not of our gift, if
we offer it when our hearts are at a diſtance from our brethren.
When breaches continue, and we are not reconciled, you know
Chriſt requires us to leave our gift at the Altar till reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be made. It is the Spirit of God in the Saints that is the ſpirit
of prayer: now Gods Spirit is a Dove-like, meek, quiet, and
peaceable ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, they hinder the uſe of our gifts: When Veſſels are
ſowred with vinegar, they ſpoil liquor that is poured into them,
they make it good for nothing: Many men have excellent
gifts, but they are in ſuch ſowre vinegar ſpirits, that they are of
little or no uſe in Church and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>1. In theſe times of diviſion, many men exerciſe their gifts
and parts in little or nothing elſe but in matters of diviſion; do
you think that God hath given you ſuch parts for no other end
but this?</p>
               <p>2. They have no hearts to impart to their Brethren their gifts
in counſelling, admoniſhing, ſtrengthning, comforting: No,
their hearts are eſtranged from them, they care not to have any
thing to do with them: but do you think, that you are ſo far
your own men, that you may keep in, or imploy your talents
as you pleaſe? Are you not the Stewards of Chriſt, are they not
given to you for the edification of your Brethren, as well as for
good to your ſelves? Can this ſatisfie your conſciences? ſuch a
one differs from you, he hath angred you, therefore though you
have opportunity of being uſeful to him, yet you refuſe it, as if
it were at your liberty to lay out your abilities for good, or not,
Certainly, this is not according to the mind of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.
12. 7. The manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
withall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If you do make uſe of your gifts for the good of others,
yet diſſentions between you will hinder the profit of them, you
are not like to do any good by them, except they be carryed on
by the oyl of love, they wil not ſoak into mens hearts. When
did you ever know a wrangling contentious Miniſter (though
his gifts were never ſo excellent) do good amongſt his people?
And what comfort can a man have of his life, if he be laid aſide
by God as a uſeleſs man?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:104285:110"/>
4. Theſe diviſions cauſe men to make the gifts of others
uſeleſs to themſelves, whereas God puts opportunity into mens
hands, to get much good by thoſe excellent gifts their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
have, yet if there be any difference between them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will not acknowledge the gifts of GOD in them,
or otherwiſe they have no mind to receive from them
that good they might have, becauſe their hearts are not with
them.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, they hinder our graces; how little of God and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
Chriſt, little ſpiritualneſs appears in Profeſſours of Religion
ſince theſe rents and diviſions have been amongſt us, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of what in former times hath appeared. As the members of
the body (ſayes <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) are not quickned, except they be
joyned, ſo even the members of Chriſt do not receive of the
quickning vertue of Chriſt, except they be joyned: Here is the
reaſon of the deadneſs, coldneſs, emptineſs, barrenneſs, vanity
of your ſpirits, you are not joyned: O where are the heavenly
Chriſtians that were wont to be, thoſe humble, thoſe holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſoules, who lived by faith, who were able to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
their whole lives were nothing elſe but a continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of ſelf-denyall, who were not onely patient, but joyfull
under afflictions? Where are thoſe watchfull Chriſtians who
walked cloſe with God, who enjoyed ſuch ſpirituall communion
with him, as made their faces ſhine in their holy heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations?
Where are thoſe tender, broken-hearted Chriſtians
that were wont to be, who lived upon the Word, to whom the
Word was more ſweet then honey and the honey comb? Now
there is another kind of face of Profeſſours of Religion, as if
there were godlineſs in theſe dayes, not of the ſame kind
with that which was formerly. If our fore-fathers, who were
the moſt holy and gracious, ſhould riſe againe, they would not
own thoſe for Profeſſours of Religion who now make a great
noyſe, keep a great ſtirr about Religion, as if they had got up
higher then their fore-fathers had, and yet are looſe, vain, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
falſe in their way. Certainly, thoſe holy, gracious Saints,
whom theſe new Profeſſours ſleight, were they alive, they
would abominate them, as the great diſgrace of, and diſhonour
to Jeſus Chriſt and his Saints.</p>
               <p>Take but away their diſputes, and for any elſe, how empty
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104285:111"/>

of rubbiſh, we cannot ſee it, and can theſe men be any other

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Our Diviſions hinder the breaking forth of the luſtre, the

               <p>The fire of our contentions raiſes ſuch a ſmoak, that it all
beſmothers us, it takes away our comlineſs, it makes us look

               <p>They hinder our doing good in publick; that which concerns <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
many, muſt be done by many: But how can two, much leſs
many, walk together, if they be not agreed? that which one
does, the other ſeeks to undo: Now although God can turn
whatſoever is contrary to his work, to the furtherance of it, yet
man cannot do ſo. When God would hinder the work of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Babel,</hi> he comes down and confounds their tongues, ſo
as they could not joyn together in it: Thus when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
would hinder the work of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he knows no
way more likely then by dividing the hearts of thoſe who are
employed, if he can poſſibly, that thereby he might bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>They hinder our own ends; none are more croſſed in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/>
ends and deſignes, then contentious people; we have not the
mutuall benefits of one anothers Eſtates, Houſes, the many ways
of accommodation and help for one another, as heretofore
we were wont to have; now every man ſhifts for himſelfe;
ſcarce any man who knew what the heartineſs of friendſhip
meant, enjoyes thoſe outward accommodations as he was
wont.</p>
               <p>They hinder the bleſſing of God, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 133. The Pſalmiſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/>
commending the love of Brethren concludes, <hi>There the Lord
commanded the bleſſing, even life for evermore.</hi> There! that
is, where the love of Brethren is, there is a bleſſing, a bleſſing
commanded by God; it comes with power, and this no leſs then
life, and this life for evermore. God dwels in <hi>Salem,</hi> ſayes <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, they are againſt the ſolemn charge and command of
God, and of Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>John 3. 23. This is his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that we ſhould believe on the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,
and love one another as he gave us commandement.</hi> It is not an
arbitrary thing that we ſhould love one another, but it is the
command of God, and a great command joyned to that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. The one is as truly neceſſary
to ſalvation as the other. Let men talk of faith, of believing on
the Son of God, of truſting to free grace in Chriſt, yet if they
have dividing, contending ſpirits, no love, no ſweetneſs, no
grace of union with the Saints, their faith is a dead faith: And
becauſe God ſtands much upon this to have his people live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:104285:112"/>
And it is alſo obſervable, that he ſayes of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of love, that he <hi>gave us that commandement.</hi> It is a gift,
for it is a ſweet commandement. We ſhould not onely ſubmit
to it, as being bound by the authority of it: but we ſhould open
our hearts to it, and embrace it joyfully as a gift from God. The
commandement of love God gives us as a gift from his love. The
excellency of theſe commandements are further amplified, <hi>ver.
24. And he that keepeth his commandements dwelleth in him, and
he in him.</hi> I do not thinke that you can finde in all the Scripture
any command of God in one ver. and a piece of another ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated
and commended. Again, <hi>chap. 4. 21. This commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have we from him, that he who loveth God loves his brother
alſo.</hi> If you think you have any command to love God, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Jeſus Chriſt, know the ſame authority layes a command
upon you, to love your brother alſo. <hi>Joh. 15. 12. This is my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
that ye love one another as I have loved you.</hi> And
<hi>ver. 17. Theſe things I cowmand you, that ye love one another.</hi>
Chriſt you ſee likewiſe makes a great matter of the Saints loving
one another. Surely the ſinne then muſt needs be great that
breaks ſuch a great commandement as this, upon which God
the Father and Jeſus Chriſt his Son layes ſo much weight.</p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe unkind and unloving diviſions are againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the prayer of Jeſus Chriſt, yea againſt that prayer he made for
us a little before he died, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21. he prayes to his Father, that
all who did believe, and ſhould after believe on him, might be
one, as his Father is in him, and he is in his Father; and that they
<hi>may be one in the Father and him:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Oh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I am now going out of the world, and I foreſee, when I am
gone, even thoſe whom thou haſt given me, who are one in
me, and in thee, will meet with ſtrong temptations to divide
them one from another: but oh Father I beſeech thee, let thy
fatherly care be over them, to keep their hearts together, that
they might be united in the ſtrongeſt union that is poſſible for
creatures to be united in. Oh Father, let them be one,
as thou and I am one. Would we not be loath to loſe the
benefit of that heavenly prayer of Chriſt for us in that 17. of <hi>Joh.</hi>
read it over, ſee what ſoul-raviſhing excellency there is in it,
ſeeing he hath expreſly ſaid he intended us who live now, in it, as
well as thoſe Diſciples who then lived with him; let us prize
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:104285:113"/>
this prayer, as being more to us then ten thouſand worlds. <hi>Luther</hi>
writes a chiding Letter to <hi>Melancthon;</hi> By thoſe ſinfull diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fears and carking thoughts of yours, ſayes he, you do <hi>irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
facere praeces noſtras,</hi> you make void our prayers. How great
then is the evill of our diviſions? by them we do what in us lies
to make void as concerning us the prayer, that bleſſed prayer of
Jeſus Chriſt. Sathan, ſayes Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> hath deſired to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now
you like Wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith
fail not. He ſhall not prevail, ſayes Chriſt: Why? Becauſe I
have prayed for you. Oh bleſſed Saviour, is not thy prayer
againſt our diviſions, as ſtrong? Canſt not thou prevail
with thy Father as well in this as in that? We know thy
Father did and does ever hear thee: ſome way or other
this prayer of CHRIST is, and ſhall be heard; yet our
ſin is not the leſs, for it tends to the fruſtrating of Chriſts
prayer. Sathan deſires to winnow us in our diviſions, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
not to have the Chaffe divided from the Wheat, he rather
would have the Chaffe mixed with the Wheat. The mixing the
Chaffe with the Wheat makes a great ſtirre amongſt us: But
Chriſts prayer which helped <hi>Peter</hi> in his winnowing, we hope
will help us in ours: only let not us do any thing that makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, our diviſions are againſt our own prayers, How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
have many who now are eſtrang'd from one another, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo prayed together, as their hearts have ſeemed to melt one
into another, ſo as one would think it impoſſible that ever in
this world there ſhould have been that diſtance between them
that now there is. How often have we prayed, Oh that once
we might be bleſſed with ſuch a mercy, as to worſhip God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own mind! that we might be delivered from
conſcience oppreſſion, from ſpirituall bondage! Oh that we
might be delivered from the inventions of men in the ſervice of
God: that the Saints might joyn and ſerve the Lord with one
ſhoulder. There were never ſuch hopes that the Saints ſhould
enjoy their prayers ſo as of late there hath been, and yet never
were they ſo divided as now they are: they now ſeek to bring
one another in bondage. If five or ſix years ſince when many
of us were praying together, making our moans to God for that
oppreſſion we were under, God ſhould have then preſented as
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104285:113"/>
in a Map, ſuch times as theſe are to our view; could we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
that it were poſſible that there ſhould be ſuch a diſtance
in our ſpirits as now there is?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, our Diviſions are very diſhonourable to Jeſus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Chriſt; were it, that they darkned our names onely, it were
not ſo much; but that which darkens the glory of Jeſus Chriſt,
ſhould goe very neere unto us. I have read of <hi>Alexander Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
ſeeing two Chriſtians contending one with another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them that they ſhould not preſume to take the name of
Chriſtians upon themſelves any longer; For (ſayes he) you
diſhonour your Maſter Chriſt, whoſe Diſciples you profeſſe to
be. It is diſhonour to a General to have his Army routed, and
run into confuſion. The Devill ſeems to prevaile againſt us in
theſe our diviſions, ſo as to rout us. <hi>John</hi> 17. 21. 23. is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Scripture, to ſhew the ſinfulneſſe of our diviſions, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
they put upon Chriſt, and it may be as ſtrong an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt them as any I know in the Book of God; Chriſt
praying to the Father for the union of his Saints, uſes this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
O Father let this be granted, that <hi>the world may beleeve
that thou haſt ſent me:</hi> And againe, <hi>ver. 23. Let them be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in one, that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> If
they be not united one to another in love and peace, but have
a ſpirit of Diviſion ruling amongſt them, what will the world
thinke? ſurely, that thou didſt not ſend me; that I who am their
head, their teacher and Lord, never came from thee, for thou art
wiſdom, holineſs and love, &amp; if I had come from thee, then thoſe
who own me to be theirs, and whom I own to be mine, would
hold forth in their converſations ſomething of that ſpirit of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
wiſdome and love there is in thee; but when the world
does not ſee this in them, but the clean contrary, they will never
beleeve, that I came from thee; thoſe truths that I came into
the world to make known as from thee, O Father will not be
beleeved, but rather perſecuted, if thoſe who profeſſe them by
their diviſions one from another, and oppoſitions one againſt
another, ſhew forth a ſpirit of pride, folly, envy, frowardneſſe;
therefore, O Father, let them be one as thou and I am one; if
this Petition be not granted, how ſhall I look the world in the
face; I ſhall be contemned in the world: what am I come
down from thee, for ſuch glorious ends as indeed thoſe were,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:104285:114"/>
for which I came into the world, and when I ſhould come to
attaine thoſe ends, for which I came, ſhall there be ſuch a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in thoſe who doe profeſſe my Name, that by it the world
ſhall perſwade themſelves, that thou didſt never ſend me? O
what a ſore evill would this be! ſurely any Chriſtian heart muſt
needs tremble at the leaſt thought of having a hand in ſo great
an evill as this is.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Diviſions are ſinfull becauſe they grieve the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 30, 31. Grieve not the holy Spirit of God,
whereby ye are ſealed to the day of redemption.</hi> Surely, there is no
godly heart, but will ſay, O God forbid that I ſhould doe any
thing to grieve the good ſpirit of God, it is the Spirit that hath
enlightned me, that hath revealed the great myſteries of God, of
Chriſt, of eternall life unto me; it is that Spirit that hath drawn
my Soul to Jeſus Chriſt, that hath comforted it, with thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
that are more to me then ten thouſand worlds; the
Spirit that hath ſtrengthned me, that helpes me againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
that carries me through difficulties, that enables me to
rejoyce in tribulations; the Spirit that is an earneſt, to aſſure
me of Gods electing love; the ſpirit thet hath ſealed me up to
the day of Redemption; and now ſhall I be g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ily of ſo great a
ſinne as to grieve this bleſſed Spirit of the Lord? If I did but
know wherein I have grieved it, it could not but make my ſoul
to bleed within me, that I ſhould have ſuch a wretched heart,
to grieve this holy Spirit, by whom my ſoule hath enjoyed
ſo much good: I hope ſhould for ever hereafter take heed
of that thing, I would rather ſuffer any griefe in the world,
to mine owne ſpirit, then be any occaſion of grief to that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Spirit of God. But would you know what it is that hath
grieved it, and what it is that is like to grieve it further? mark
what followes, <hi>ver. 31. Let all bitterneſſe, wrath, anger, cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and evill speaking be put away from you with all malice:</hi>
And would you doe that which may rejoyce it? Oh! God
knowes it would be the greateſt joy in the world for me to doe
it, then <hi>ver. 32. Be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
one another even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven
you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, theſe diviſions doe grieve and offend our Brethren,
this ſhould not be a light matter to us, Chriſt accounts it a great
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:104285:114"/>
evill to offend one of his little ones: We may thinke it a little
matter to give offence to ſome of Gods people who are poore
and meane in the world, ſo long as we have the bravery of it,
and the countenance of great men, no matter for them. But
(friend) whatſoever ſlight thoughts thou haſt of it, Chriſt thinks
it a great matter; you may look upon them as under you, the
times favour you more then them; but if you ſhall give them
cauſe to goe to God, to make their moanes to him, of any ill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
they have had from you; Lord thou knoweſt I was for
peace to the uttermoſt that I could, ſo farre as I was able to ſee
thy Word for my guide; but theſe who heretofore were as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to me, now their ſpirits are eſtranged, their hearts are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered,
their words, their carriages are very grievous, and all
becauſe I cannot come up to what their opinions, their ways
are; certainly this would prove very ill to you, regard it as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as you will; it may be when others carry themſelves towards
you otherwiſe then you expected, you vent your ſelves againſt
them in quarelling, in giving ill language, in vilifying and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
your ſtrength runs out this way; but there are a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, who being wronged, improve their ſtrength in
patient bearing, yet in making their moan to God in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of faith, in committing their cauſe to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. from 24. to 31. you have the ſtory of the ſervant
who had ten thouſand talents forgiven him, who yet took his
fellow-ſervant by the throat who ought him a hundred pence,
and put him into priſon; the Text ſayes, <hi>When his fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
ſaw what was done, they were ſorry, and came and told their
Lord what was done.</hi> You do not hear them cry out of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervant,
O what a vile baſe wretch was he, who would deal
thus with his fellow! No, but they went and told their Lord. It is
not the way of Chriſtians when they apprehend wrong done, to
give ill language, to ſeek to right themſelves or others by bitter
provoking expreſſions; but their hearts being filled with griefe,
if they muſt needs vent it, if quiet debates with their Brethren
will not eaſe them, let them vent themſelves in the powring
forth their complaints to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, there is much ſinne in our diviſions, for they ſtir <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
up much corruption on all ſides, both in our ſelves and others;
As if you ſhake a glaſs of water that has dirt in the bottome, the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104285:115"/>
dirt ſpreads it ſelf all over: ſo doth the dirty ſtuffe in our hearts,
theſe diviſions cauſing a commotion in them; that corruption is
now diſcovered, that neither our ſelves nor others had thought
had been in us: Do not you ſay in your hearts, and it may be one
to another, Who would have thought it poſſible, that ſo much
filthy ſtaffe ſhould lie ſo long in ſuch mens hearts undiſcovered,
which now appeares ſince theſe unhappy diviſions have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us? <hi>James 3. 16. Where there is envying and ſtrife, there
is confuſion and every evill worke.</hi> When Snakes are cold, they
lye ſtill; but if the heat of fire come to them, then they hiſſe and
put forth their ſtings: Thus mens corruptions heat by the fire of
contention that is kindled amongſt us, begin to ſtirre, to act,
yea, to riſe very high. The reaſon that ſome give of that prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of the Apoſtles, <hi>Epheſ. 4. Let not the Sunne goe downe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your wrath,</hi> which alſo I finde <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon the place
gives, is, becauſe when mens wrath is ſtirred by contending, if
it continues in the heat of it till night, as they lye upon their
beds their corruptions will be boyling, they will lye muſing and
plotting againſt thoſe that contend with them; their thoughts
in the night ſeaſon will worke up their corruptions to a great
height; have you not found it ſo, when the Sunne was gone
downe upon your wrath, you could hardly ſleepe that night?
<hi>William</hi> the Conquerour in his firſt yeer commanded, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
night at eight a clock a Bell ſhould be rung, and that all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould then put out their fire, which was called the <hi>Curfew
Bell:</hi> it were well that ſome were admoniſhed every night, to
cover the fire of their paſſions.</p>
               <p>We ſtirre up likewiſe the corruptions of others, in theſe our
diviſions; doe you not ſee thoſe diſtempers formerly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
working and breaking forth in your Brethren when you
provoke them in your contending with them? O pitty, pitty
thy Brother, if thou canſt not pitty thy ſelfe; does it not grieve
thee, that thy Brother ſhould bring ſinne upon himſelf? Were
it not better for thee to ſuffer; then for thy Brother to ſinne? It
is an evill thing to be an occaſion of griefe to our Brethren, <hi>The
Lord does not willingly grieve the children of men,</hi> but to be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſinne to them is much worſe: When did you ever meet
with your Brethren, and had your ſpirits put into any heat, but
after your parting when you began to be coole, you then ſaw
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104285:115"/>
canſe to grieve for unbeſeeming words, carriages, breakings
forth of paſſion, that there was either in you or them: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in a froward debate there is more ſinne committed in one
houre, then there is otherwiſe in a whole twelvemonth, between
thoſe who live lovingly and ſweetly together: yea, ſometimes
ſuch corruptions are ſtirred by differences and diviſions, that
one would think were not competible to a Saint; namely, the
rejoycing in the evill of other men, yea of godly men. <hi>David</hi>
ſaid, his zeal had ever conſumed him, becauſe his enemies had
forgotten Gods word; but ſome mens zeale doe even conſume
them, becauſe their friends do remember Gods Word; the
more inoffenſive they walke, the more are they troubled; it
were endleſſe to mention the uncharitableneſſe, wrong, malice,
injuſtice, oppreſſion, cruelty, with the abundance of other ſins
that are cauſed by our diviſions.</p>
               <p>Eightly, Yet further, as they ſtirre up ſinne, ſo they harden <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
in ſinne. Fire hardens the clay into a brick: Thus are mens
hearts hardened in evill by our diviſions, men who hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had tender ſpirits, their hearts were redy to relent
upon any brotherly admonition, now they are ſtiffe, they ſtand
out ſturdily, yea behave themſelves ſcornfully: O this fire of
contention hath baked their luſts, hath hardned their hearts.
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. God promiſes to give his people one heart, and this
heart ſhould be a heart of fleſh: While the hearts of the Saints
are united, they are tender; but when they divide, they grow
hard.</p>
               <p>Hence is the reaſon why Brethren being falne out, it is ſo hard
to convince either of them of any ill carriage, they are angry, &amp;
they think they do well to be angry, and all becauſe their hearts
are hardened. <hi>Jonah</hi> was in a pettiſh mood, his heart was
hardened with it, let God himſelf come now to convince him,
he ſtands it out, he will by no meanes acknowledg himſelfe
faulty; no, what he does he will juſtifie, he does well to
be angry.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, there is much ſinne in them, for they are a meanes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
to keep off others from Gods wayes; if this be their religion
for men to quarell one with another, I will have none of it:
Carnall hearted men uſe to charge Religion with all the miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of the Profeſſours of it. You know what Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:104285:116"/>
ſayes, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. If men speak with ſtrange tongues, aud there
comes in one unlearned, will they not be to him as Barbarians,
will they not ſay they are mad?</hi> Thus when the men of the world
looke upon thoſe who profeſſe Religion, and ſee their carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
their wayes ſtrange, divided amongſt themſelves, will they
not think them even mad people? <hi>I charge you,</hi> ſayes the
Church, <hi>Cant. 3. 5. by the Roes and by the Hindes, that you ſtir
not up my Beloved till he pleaſe.</hi> This by ſome is interpreted thus,
The Roes and Hindes are ſhy and fearfull creatures, by them are
ſignified ſuch as are obſervers of the wayes of the Church, and
ready to take offence at any thing they ſee amiſſe in them,
therefore I charge you, ſay thoſe who are faithfull, that you
doe nothing that may make any diſturbance in the Church,
whereby ſuch as are obſervers of your wayes ſhall be offended:
If they ſee miſcarriages in you, they will fly off, and of all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
there are none more offenſive to the lookers on, then
wranglings and contendings; when they ſee this, they will
conclude, Surely this is not the way of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 10. They are a very ill improvement of our zeal and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
Zeal and courage have ſuch an excellency in them, as its
a thouſand pitties they ſhould have no other improvement then
to raiſe and maintain quarels and diviſions. The Lord hath uſe
of every mans zeal and courage, reſerve them for his, for ſome
notable work that God hath to do for thee, and do not ſpend
them about that from whence comes no good. If Soldiers lying
neare their enemies, have no ſtore of powder, ſhould ſpend
what they have in making ſquibs and fire-workes, would they
not be condemned of folly, if not of treachery, by all? Thoſe
who have the moſt zeal and courage, have little enough to
ſerve their turne, for the ſervices that God requires of them, and
muſt this be ſpent in unworthy brablings, wanglings and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellings?
That mans body is in an ill condition that hath a ſore
to which the humors have recourſe to feed it, leaving off the
ſupplying to the parts of the body that are to be nouriſhed and
maintained by them; the ſore is fed, but the other parts grow
lank and feeble. Thus it is with many mens ſpirits, they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered,
and then what abilities they have, are drawn forth
to feed thoſe diſtempers; what account can be given to God of
ſuch a uſe of them as this?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:104285:116"/>
11. They make very much againſt the Cauſe of Chriſt now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
in hand, the great work of Reformation. Had we joyned hand
in hand together, and ſet out ſelves to ſerve the Lord with one
ſhoulder, what abundance of ſervice might have been done?
how might the honour of Chriſt have been advanced high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us before this day? But while one draws one way, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
another, one ſeeks to ſet up, and another labours to pull
down, how can the work go on?</p>
               <p>You will ſay, That is true indeed, things would go on a pace,
if thoſe who differ from others would give up their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and practiſes to them, to beleeve what they beleeve, and
to doe what they doe. But how can this be? you would
not have them give up their judgements or practices to them
till they know they be right, and how can that be, till they
by diſcuſſing, praying, reading, meditating, finde that out?
If ſome men had certainly found out the right, and other men
knew certainly that they had done ſo, then the worke were at
an end.</p>
               <p>But when we complain of our diviſions for making much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Cauſe of Chriſt, or work of Reformation, we do not
complain againſt men, becauſe they cannot all underſtand things
alike. But this we complain of,</p>
               <p>1. That all men who profeſſe godlineſſe, have not
joyned in oppoſing that which they beleeve cannot ſtand
with godlineſſe, by all the wayes that God hath put into
their hands.</p>
               <p>2. That they have not joyned to promote thoſe wayes of
godlineſſe, which they are convinced to be ſo.</p>
               <p>3. That they have not joyned to ſtudy what wayes and means
may be found out to eaſe the hearts and conſciences one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to beare with one another, ſo far as Chriſt would have
them be helpfull to, and beare with one another. It is this
that hath made ſuch a ſtop in the work of Reformation. A peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
humble, and quiet diſcuſſing of things, furthers that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
that Chriſt would have. Doe you thinke that Chriſt
would be pleaſed with ſuch a Reformation wherein the leſſer
part ſhould give up their conſciences and practices to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the greater? ſuch a kind of ſlubbering over matters
might ſoon be, but Chriſt muſt have all the matters of his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:104285:117"/>
worſhip and doctrine conſented to, and practiced from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of faith. Let us joyn with all our might in all we know,
and with peaceable, quiet, humble ſpirits ſeek to know more,
and in the mean time carry our ſelves humbly and peaceably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thoſe we differ from, and Chriſt will not charge us at the
Great Day for retarding his Cauſe, the great work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> 12. Theſe our diſſentions are againſt a great part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace which God hath made with his people in Chriſt,
and thoſe many promiſes of ſo much peace that there is to be in
the times of the Goſpel. We by theſe do that which tends to
make void the Covenant, we doe as it were ſay that Chriſt is
not come in the fleſh, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 3. Every ſpirit that confeſſeth not
that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God, and this is
that ſpirit of Antichriſt.</hi> Many men talk much of Antichriſt,
bet ſuch as profeſs the Goſpel, and yet are of unpeaceable, ſnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
contending ſpirits, they have the ſpirit of Antichriſt, and
they doe not confeſſe that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh.
It is the Argument the Jews have againſt Chriſt, ſay they, If he
were come, then that Propheſie <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 6. would be fulfilled,
<hi>The wolfe ſhall dwell with the lambe, and the leopard ſhall lye
downe with the kid, and the cow and the beare ſhall feed together,
&amp;c.</hi> But this is not ſo, they bring many other places where
Peace is propheſied of, as <hi>Eſay 9. 7. Of the encreaſe of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and peace ſhall be no end.</hi> Thoſe who ſeeke for his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
ſhould ſeek for his Peace alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galatinus de Arcanis Catholicae veritatis,</hi> ſpends divers Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in anſwering the Jews objections againſt Chriſt from theſe
places with others, as <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. the 6, 7, 8. Chapters. A ſpeciall
part of the Covenant of Grace is in that promiſe, <hi>Ezek. 11. 19.
I will give them one heart, and I will put a new ſpirit within
them, and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God, ver.</hi> 20.
And <hi>Jer. 32. 38, 39. They ſhall be my people, and I will be their
God, and I will give them one heart and one way.</hi> Many men
ſpeak much of the Covenant of Grace, who manifeſt little of
this part of it in them. If that which is againſt any command
of God be ſinfull, much more is that which is ſo directly againſt
Gods Covenant with his people, that which tends to make
even the Covenant of Grace to be of none effect; if it be of no
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:104285:117"/>
effect in one part of it, it will be of none in the other.</p>
               <p>13. By our diviſions we croſs that end that God aimed at in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/>
the variety of his adminiſtrations in the gifts and graces of men;
That this was not Chriſts end in diſpenſing gifts and graces in
a different way, that there might be fuell adminiſtred to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is a time of Faſting and Prayer; <hi>England</hi> never
knew what ſuch Faſting and Prayer meant, as it hath knowne
of late: No nation in the world that we know of ever knew the
like; and ſhall we in ſuch times as theſe, when we are caſting
downe our ſelves before Almighty God, when we are judging
our ſelves before him, in the pride and frowardneſs of our hearts
contend againſt one another? <hi>Eſay 58 4. Behold, ye faſt for

of wickedneſs indeed, that fights in times of Faſts. <hi>Is it ſuch
a Faſt that I have choſen?</hi> How doe we in the dayes of our Faſts,
acknowledge our vileneſs, our unworthyneſs of the leaſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
our pride, our ſelf-love, our envy, our paſſions, all thoſe
diſtempers that are dividing diſtempers, yet ſtill we continue
in them, and they break forth into dividing practices? Surely
our Faſts will riſe up in judgement againſt us, to make the ſin of

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, It is a time alſo of great mercies; <hi>We are afflicted, but
not forſaken;</hi> and mercies ſhould ſweeten our ſpirits. This Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
hath been a continued miracle of mercies; if our agreeing
together, our love to one another were now beyond the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of all men, as Gods mercies to us have been beyond,
and above all expectation, even ſuch a fruit of mercies would be
the greateſt mercy of all. But if inſtead of being ſweetned by
mercies we are the more imbittered one againſt another, how
great is this ſinne? If we ſhall take occaſion from our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:104285:119"/>
at <hi>Nazeby, Taunton, Bridgewater, Sherburne, Briſtol,</hi> to
ſeek to drive out of the Kingdome thouſands of godly men
whom God uſed as inſtruments of ſo great mercy to us; will not
this be ſin unto us? God brought us indeed into a wilderneſſe,
but he hath there ſpoke comfortably to us; our wilderneſſe is
our way to <hi>Canaan.</hi> It was the charge of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 24. when they were going from Egypt to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
<hi>See that ye fall not out by the way:</hi> We hope God is lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
us to Canaan, oh that we could ſee Chriſt looking upon
us, and charging us, ſaying, See that you fall not out by the way,
do not grudg one againſt another, let not one ſay, You are the
cauſe of our trouble, and another ſay, Nay, but you are the cauſe
of our trouble; let every one charge his own heart, let every
man fall out with his own ſin as much as he will, but let not
brethren fall out by the way.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is a time of Service; God never put ſuch oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of ſervice into our hands, as now he hath. How many
holy men who were furniſhed with large abilities and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
hearts to have done ſervice for God and his people in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, lived privately, onely enjoyed ſweet communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between God and their owne ſoules, but oh how did
they prize opportunities of ſervice! how did they thirſt after,
and greedily embrace advantages for publique work! they were
willing to ſubmit to any thing to the uttermoſt their conſciences
would ſuffer them, that they might be employed in work for
God and his Saints; Though their encouragement from men
was ſmall, yet their work was wages to them; but in thoſe
times, almoſt all places of publique imployment were in the
hands or at the diſpoſe of evill men; could they have foreſeen
that within a few yeers, there ſhould be a doore open for all
godly men, to full opportunities for the imployment of
their gifts and graces to the uttermoſt. How would they have
rejoyced and longed to have ſeen thoſe times, and bleſſed thoſe
who ſhould live in them! I am confident it cannot be ſhewn
that ever there was a time ſince the world began, that ſo many
godly people in a Kingdome have had ſuch a large opportunity
of publike ſervice, as for theſe laſt five yeers hath been in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and ſhall this opportunity be loſt with our wranglings
and contendings? Oh how unworthy are we to live in ſuch
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:104285:120"/>
times as theſe are! When a Maſter ſets his ſervants to work, and
that in ſuch a peece of work as is of great concernment, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of which if loſt, will be a great loſſe to him: if theſe
ſervants ſhall trifle away this opportunity with wrangling one
with another about their work, one oppoſing another in it, will
this be a good account to their Maſter? So much time was ſpent
in work, but ſo much in quarelling, whereby there is little of the
work done. We read of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> cap. 6. 3. when <hi>Sanballat</hi>
and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> thoſe quarelſome companions ſent to him to meet
them, intending to quarrell with him, he anſwered them, <hi>I am
doing a worke, ſo that I cannot come, why ſhould the worke ceaſe?</hi>
If we ſee men ſet upon ſtrife and contention, we ſhould not
meddle with them, to ſpend our time in anſwering what comes
from them; our caſe were miſerable, if we were at the mercy
of every quarreller, bound to anſwer whatſoever he pleaſes to
put forth. But let us tend our work; theſe opportunities of
ſervice that now we have are too pretious to give away to them,
to be ſpent, to be loſt upon them. How juſt were it with God to
take theſe opportunities from us, to bring us againe into ſuch a
condition as we ſhould be glad of a dayes imployment in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ſervice, and then oh how would our conſciences wring us,
and grate upon us for ſuch ill improvement of them, for ſuch
unworthy loſſe of them when we had them!</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. This time is the time of the tryall of our ſpirits. We never
had ſuch a time to try what ſpirit of love, what principles of
union are in us, as now we have; and ſhall we now miſcarry?
May it not be juſtly thought that all our ſeeming love one to, &amp;
cloſing one with another formerly, was only for our own ends?
Before we were all under oppreſſion, or at leaſt the fears of it,
when we looked upon our ſelves as in the ſame condition. then
the trial was not ſo much: but now there is ſome difference made
in the condition of godly men. Some have the times ſmiling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them more then others; now is the time of tryal. The time of
the triall of the ſpirit of <hi>Phara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hs</hi> Butler towards <hi>Joſeph,</hi> was
when he was out of priſon, injoying his preferment at the Court,
&amp; <hi>Joſeph</hi> remained ſtil in priſon. Perhaps while they were fellow-priſoners
he might tell <hi>Joſeph</hi> that his heart did cloſe much with
him, and if he had any opportunity to be uſeful to him, oh what
a happineſſe ſhould he think it to himſelfe! Surely it ſhould be
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:104285:120"/>
improved for the good of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the uttermoſt. But when he
was preferred, when he had reſpect amongſt great ones, and
<hi>Joſeph</hi> ſtill was kept low, then he is not the ſame man that he
was when he was <hi>Joſephs</hi> fellow-ſufferer. Now he hath other
things in his head: <hi>Joſeph</hi> is forgotten by him. Where this evill
is, be ſure God will find it out: for it is an evill very grievous to
his Spirit. Put theſe together, and it will appeare that it is no
time now to contend, whatſoever we doe at other times. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I have read of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> having a dear friend
of his ſlaine by a bullet as he ſate with him at ſupper, Ah ſayes
he, I could grieve for thee, but now is no time for me to let
down my ſpirits. So when any ſhal do ſuch things as might cauſe
contention, do you ſpeak to your own heart, Ah I find my anger
ſtirred; I could contend, but now is no time for me to let my
ſpirits riſe in a contending way; theſe times call for peace and
union, not for ſtrife and debate. This is the 11. aggravation
we are divided in ſuch a time as this.</p>
                  <p>The twelfth is, we are divided, notwithſtanding we are all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
convinced of the evill of diviſions. We cry out exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them: we tell one another that of all the tokens of Gods
diſpleaſure amongſt us theſe are the greateſt. Yet ſcarce a man
does any thing, or leaves any thing undone towards any help
againſt diviſions, or furtherance of our union. Every man cries
out of the Theefe, but who ſtops him? We all ſay we would
have peace, oh peace is an excellent thing! But where is the
man who is willing to be at any coſt for it, either in putting up
any wrong which he conceives is done to himſelf, or bearing
with his brother in any thing differing from himſelf? The Lord
may juſtly judge us out of our own mouths.</p>
                  <p>13. We have complained of others who are in place of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/>
to be of harſh cruel diſpoſitions. We have ſayd if they had
been of gentle, loving, peaceable diſpoſitions, tendring the glory
of God dearly, &amp; the good of their brethren as their own, what
abundance of good might they have done! We have thought in
thoſe times, Oh if ſuch men were in place, who were then our
dear brethren, whom we conceived to be of holy, humble, ſweet,
peaceable ſpirits, very tender-hearted towards any they ſaw
godlineſſe in; had they power in their hands, what ſafety, peace,
reſt, would the Saints have! How comfortably ſhould they goe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:104285:121"/>
on in their work! How would they be edified, prayſing the
Lord! What a heaven upon earth ſhould we have! And yet we
finde it otherwiſe. We may ſay, we looked for light, and behold,
(I will not ſay darkneſſe) but behold dimneſſe even from them:
for brightneſſe, but behold obſcurity. Oh how doe the carriages
of theſe men in ſome degree juſtifie the harſhneſſe, ſowerneſſe,
domineering and cruelty of ſome of the Prelates! We hope no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhall ever befall us as to be ſuch a temptation to us, as to
juſtifie their places. But ſome of their perſons are ſo farre juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
as there is occaſion given to think they were not ſuch vile
men as heretofore we thought they were. For now we ſee what
a temptation there is in having the times ſhine upon me, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
power put into mens hands. We ſee now that men who
have other manner of principles then ever they had, yet how
ſadly they miſcarry when they come under the like temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
How can we anſwer Chriſt Jeſus for theſe things?</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> 14. We are ſtill divided, though we have ſeen the wofull

               <p>Firſt, our diviſions provoke the wrath of God againſt us; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
though the wrath of man accompliſheth not the righteouſneſſe
of God, yet it may accompliſh the wrath of God. <hi>Eſay 9. 21.
Manaſſeh againſt Ephraim, and Ephraim againſt Manaſſeh, and
they together againſt Judah; for all this his anger is not turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,

us; ſo long as our wrath one againſt another continue ſo hot,
certainly Gods wrath is not appeaſed.</p>
               <p>We read of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was about ſacrificing <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
he found a Ram entangled in the bryars, which God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for him to be a ſacrifice: We are this day entangled in the

would they have given when they firſt divided from us, to have
procured ſo great diviſions amongſt our ſelves, as have been, &amp;
yet are? If a Million would have purchaſed them, rather then
they ſhould not have been, they would (no queſtion) have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <p>We have often ſaid that ſome who have kept at the Parliament
have ſerved the deſignes of the King and thoſe about him better

<hi>Hoſea 17. ult. The rage of their tongue ſhall be their diviſion in

might joyne againſt the Turks he brings in this Apologue:

were indeed a great company of dogs more then themſelves

of different colours: Upon this the wolves made nothing
of them, accounting it an eaſie matter to deale with them
who were ſo differing amongſt themſelves. In the ſame manner,
ſayes <hi>Melancthon,</hi> doe <hi>Staphilus,</hi> and <hi>Caniſius,</hi> and others of
the pogiſh faction, triumph in reſpect of us; upon which he

would governe them, and make all in our Churches to be one in

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, yea by theſe we are like to be made a prey to our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Here many ſad ſtoryes might be told you of the prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of enemies againſt divided people. The diviſions of Iſrael
at this time made them a prey to their adverſaries, which you
may ſee cleerly if you read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. afterwards the diviſions
of the other tribes made them a prey to the Romans. When
the Turks have prevailed over Chriſtians, do not all ſtories
tell us it hath been through the diviſions of Chriſtians? When
Normans, Danes prevailed in <hi>England,</hi> it was by the advantage
they had of our diviſions; if we will ſtill divide and contend,
our condition may prove to be like two birds pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>king at one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
in the mean time the Kite comes and catches them both
away.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if God ſhould free us from our enemies, yet we are like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
to devoure one another, and this is a greater miſery then to be
devoured by the common adverſary. <hi>Gal. 5. 15. If ye bite and
devour one another, take heed ye be not conſumed one of another.</hi>
What biting and devouring was this? It was not in an open
hoſtile way, they did not take up Arms one againſt another, but
by their different opinions and contentious carriages in matters
of Religion. Their differences in the matters of Religion were
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:104285:123"/>
very great, <hi>Non de finibus, ſed de haereditate,</hi> not about the
bounds, but the inheritance it ſelfe; yet unpeaceableneſſe and
violence in their carriages one towards another, though the
matter of their difference was ſo great, is condemned and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Apoſtle. Do not our Adverſaries ſay, Let them alone
and they will devoure one another? God gives us good hope
that he will deliver us from our enemies; but the hearts of many
godly and wiſe men tremble within them, fearing leſt that
wolviſh diſtemper of ours ſhould feed upon our own fleſh,
when the matter that it had to feed upon from without is taken
away.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, if we ſhould not devour one another, yet being thus
divided, we are like to periſh of our ſelves, as thoſe <hi>Inſecta,</hi> which
after they are cut aſunder, yet the ſeverall parts live, they wrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
up and down a little while, but they cannot hold long. So it
is like to be with us; except we joyn we cannot live.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, theſe diviſions are like to make many miſerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
for if God be not mercifull to them, and that ſoon, they
are like to be ſuch a rock of offence, as to ſplit them, upon which
they are running; they are in very great danger to make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
of their conſciences, yea I fear ſome have done it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
if it be not ſo, the Lord be mercifull to them, and prevent it.
The ſpoiled houſes, the torn eſtates, the maimed bodies of men
cauſed by our diviſions, are ſad objects to look upon; but the
broken, maimed, ſpoiled conſciences that theſe have cauſed, and
are like further to cauſe, were and yet are like to be objects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us to be lamented with tears of bloud. This ſhipwrack of
conſcience it may be is not felt now, but it will prove horrour
of conſcience hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, they are like to lay a foundation of much evill to
poſterity, this conſideration is almoſt as ſad as any. We think
it a great evill that Kings children ſhold be brought up in the
ſight of bloud, that they ſhould be in danger to have principles
of cruelty or tyranny infuſed into them in their tender age;
we are afraid leſt the muddy water they drink now ſhould breed
diſeaſes in them that may break out afterward. Surely it is a
great evill alſo for the children of the Church, to be brought up
in the ſight and exerciſe of diviſions in matters of Religion; that
that knowledge of Religion which they now take in, ſhould
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104285:123"/>
be as troubled waters full of ſoyle. In the beginning of this
Parliament there was as hopefull a generation of young ones
comming up as ever the Sun ſaw, but many of them have loſt
their lives in this publique Cauſe; God will certainly take a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
conſideration at the hands of the adverſaries for their
blood eſpecially; we have cauſe to bleſſe God for them: God
made uſe of them to ſtop the rage, the overflowing of the proud
adverſaries upon us; they have ſerved their generation, and have
been more uſefull in it, then others who have lived 70. or 80.
yeers formerly: but for thoſe who are preſerved, theſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the things of Religion have ſpoiled many of them, they
are carryed away with ſuch a ſtrange kind of ſpirit of error, of
conceitedneſſe, folly, wilfulneſſe, bitterneſſe, licentiouſneſſe,
and boldneſſe, that their hopefull beginnings are loſt, ſo that
the next generation is like to reap very ſowr, bitter, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome
fruits of theſe our quarrels and contentions. By what
hath been ſaid you may ſee why the Spirit of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 19.
puts the ſowers of diſcord amonſt thoſe whom God hates:
What the harveſt of ſuch ſeed is like to be, we ſhall ſee in the
next Head.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Aggravations of the miſery that comes by our diviſions.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt, our miſery is the greater, becauſe it is ſtill increaſing; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Diviſions make way for diviſions; we beat our brethren till
they cry, and then we beat them becauſe they cry, is not this
hard dealing? We read in our Chronicles that thoſe who were
born in <hi>England</hi> the yeare after the great mortality 1349. wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſome of their cheek teeth;<note place="margin">T. Walſingham in eodem anno.</note> if we ſhould judge of mens teeth
by their biting, one would think that now men had more teeth,
or at leaſt farre ſharper then they were wont to have; there
was never ſuch biting as now there is. Yet thanks be to God
this increaſe is not in all places, not in our Armies; time was
when we were much afraid of diviſions there, but now we
hear they are comfortably united, Dividing terms are not heard
amongſt them as formerly; though there be differing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
their hearts and armes are open one to another, they love
one another, they are willing to live and dye one with another.

The bleſſing of the Almighty be upon you; go on and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper,

and delights to uſe you in great ſervices, for the honour of his
Name and good of his people. You have had, and have the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

                  <p>
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of a <hi>Theban</hi> band that were but three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
yet were the moſt terrible to the enemies, of any, and did
the greateſt ſervices: They were called the <hi>Holy Band,</hi> becauſe
they hated diſhoneſt things, and were willing to venture their
lives for honeſt cauſes, fearing diſhonourable reproach more
then honourable danger. But though this was one cauſe why it
had that name,<note place="margin">Plutarch in the life of Pelopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</note> yet <hi>Plutarch</hi> thinks that the firſt cauſe why it
was called the <hi>Holy Band,</hi> was from their intire love one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
By the ſelfe ſame reaſon (ſayes he) that <hi>Plato</hi> calleth a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a divine friend by Gods appointment, Theſe <hi>Thebans,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with other of their Countreymen, had a great power of the
<hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> to reſiſt ſuch a power as the <hi>Athenians,</hi> for feare
of it, left off to protect them, renouncing that league that they
had before with them. Every man, ſaid the <hi>Thebans,</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.
But theſe deſpiſed <hi>Thebans</hi> meeting with the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
about the City of <hi>Tegyra,</hi> where according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of ſome they were ſixe to one, and a warlike valiant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
one came running to <hi>Pelopidas</hi> the Captain of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi>
ſaying, Sir, we are falne into the hands of the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians.</hi>
Nay, are they not falne into ours? ſayes <hi>Pelopidas.</hi> And
ſo it fell out, for they utterly routed them. In all the warrs that
the <hi>Lacaedemonians</hi> ever had, as well with the <hi>Grecians</hi> as with
the barbarous people, no Chronicle ever mentioned that they
were overcome by any number equall in battell. Whereupon
theſe <hi>Thebans</hi> grew ſo terrible to their enemies, that none durſt
for a long time encounter with them. After this battell <hi>Pelopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
would never ſeperate them one from another, but keeping
them together he would alwayes begin with them, to give a
charge in his moſt dangerous battells. Yet notwithſtanding all
this ſervice they had ill requitall from the people, for when their
Captain <hi>Pelopidas</hi> came home, they ſtirred up a party againſt
him, that ſought to break him, though they could not prevaile.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:104285:124"/>
It is farther reported of this Band, that it was never broken nor
overthrowne till the battell of <hi>Choeronea,</hi> where it ſeems they
had ſome added to them. And ſee what love and valour will doe
in an Army unto death. <hi>Philip</hi> taking a view of the ſlaine bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
there, he ſaw foure hundred dead on the ground, one hard
by another, all of them thruſt thorow with Pikes on their breaſts,
and being told that it was the Lovers Band, he fell a weeping
for pitty, ſaying, <hi>Woe be to them that thinke theſe men did or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
any evill or diſhoneſt thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ever ſince our Armies have been united, God hath wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bleſſed them. Shall men of warre be at peace? and is this
comely? and ſhall men of peace be at warre? how uncomely
will this be? Yet ſo it is, The ſeeds of diſſentions never ſprung
up more againſt us then of late they have done. The ſpirits of
men ſeeme to be heat and ready to boyle one againſt another in
this City more then heretofore they have done. The Lord hath
made <hi>London</hi> a bleſſing to the whole Kingdome, and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Kingdomes too. The children not yet borne will have cauſe
to bleſſe God for <hi>London,</hi> for their union, their faithfulneſs, their
courage, their bounty: and ſhall now, when God is about brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
in reſt to us from the rage of our enemies, a fire of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be kindled amongſt us? Shall the comfort of all our former
mercies and future hopes be loſt, by raiſing up of new quarrels?
and muſt this come from the City? The Lord forbid. The Lord
make you like <hi>Jeruſalem, a City Compact, at unity within it ſelfe.</hi>
Your very name carries unity in the face of it. <hi>Civis à coeundo,</hi>
ſays <hi>Cicer: quod vinculo quodi ſocietatis in unu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> coeunt quaſi Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis.</hi>
I remember I have read in <hi>Livy</hi> a notable ſpeech of <hi>Scipio</hi>
to the Citizens at <hi>Carthage.</hi> By what name, ſayes he, ſhall I call

Things are not come to this paſſe in this City. The

Only do you make it appear to be ſo, by knitting your ſelves ſo

you ſeeks to diſunite you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond aggravation of the miſery of our diviſions, is, Surely
none will pitty us in all that evill that comes upon us by them.
If God ſhould have ſuffered our enemies to have prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, all the Proteſtant party in the world would have pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
us. If thoſe who eſcaped had fled for their lives to them,
they would have entertained them with much compaſſion. But
if we miſchief our ſelves by our diviſions, we ſhall be looked
upon as contemptible in the eyes of all. If we ſhould flye to
them, we may expect to be entertained with rebukes; You are
an unworthy generation, God put a price into your hands, to
have done your ſelves and all the Proteſtant party good; you
might have freed your ſelves from thraldome, and many wayes
have been helpfull to us, but you had ſuch proud, envious, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome
ſpirits, that you brake aſunder one from another, you
miſchieved one another, and ſo have undone your ſelves and
your poſterity; yea are not worthy to live amongſt men. Can
we be able to bear ſuch rebukes as theſe? Every man that is in
miſery deſires to be pittied, but this miſery is like to be ſuch, as
no pitty can be expected in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, our conſciences will fly in our faces, telling us that
we may thank our ſelves for all this. It is a great part of the
torment of the damned, that their conſciences ſhall be alwayes
upbraiding them for bringing ſo much evill upon themſelves.
This ſhall be the gnawing of that worm of conſcience for
ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, our miſery is and will be aggravated by the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
of it: our familiars, our brethren, thoſe who not long
ſince were dear to us, will be made uſe of to make us miſerable.
How great a miſery will this be? When the men of <hi>Judah</hi> came
up to <hi>Samſon,</hi> to deliver him to the Philiſtines, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15. 11, 12.
ſayes <hi>Samſon</hi> to them, <hi>But ſweare to me that ye will not fall upon
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:104285:125"/>
me your ſelves.</hi> He thought it a very grievous thing for the men
of <hi>Judah</hi> to fall upon him. He did not ſo much regard what the
Philiſtines could do againſt him. Certainly there is nothing in
the world more ſad then for one brother to make another mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.
The Hiſtory of that Warre between <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi>
tells of one having ſlaine a man not knowing him, but after he
looked and found it was his brother, in the anguiſh of his heart,
becauſe he had ſlaine his brother, he took his ſword and ran it
into his own bowels. It is a great evill to be an inſtrument of
evill to our brethren, and to ſuffer evill from our brethren.</p>
                  <p>This conſideration might be enough to ſtop us in our diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and cauſe us to think of wayes of joyning. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the

that the misfortune of <hi>Laias</hi> who was ſlaine by his brother <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dipus,</hi>
was the firſt originall cauſe that the <hi>Thebans</hi> began to be
in ſuch love one with another, to joyn in that <hi>Holy Band</hi> before
mentioned. If this were cauſe enough to take us off from our
contentions, we have enough of this amongſt us. The Lord
be mercifull to us.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the miſery of our contentions in the Civill State is ſuch,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
as if we be overcome, we are undone, for our outward conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we and our poſterity are made ſlaves; if we do prevaile, yet
there is ſadneſſe in our conqueſt. That is a miſerable war, which
is thus. The Civill Wars of the Romans were ſuch, <hi>Nullos habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura

victory.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, what help can there be? for we wilfully make our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
ſelves miſerable; if men will undoe themſelves, who can helpe
it? Except God comes in from heaven with a mighty hand to
help, our wound is incurable.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have ſeen what evill and bitter things our diviſions

               <p>Secondly, that it is no ſuch ſtrange thing as ſome would make
it, that there ſhould be diviſions in times of Reformation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how it comes to paſſe that godly men are divided, who

ſo ſharp amongſt thoſe men who ſeem to come very near toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

things.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, how far God himſelfe, and Chriſt, and the Goſpel may
be ſaid to have a hand in our Diviſions.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, What good uſes we ſhould make of our Diviſions.</p>
               <p>For the firſt. The ill uſes that many make of our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
are,</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Some upon the evills they ſee and feel in them, think
it was better with us heretofore, and wiſh we had thoſe times
againe; Juſt like the murmuring Iſraelites, as ſoon as they
were put to any ſtraits, they wiſhed they were in Egypt again;
it was better with us then, ſay they. Yea <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 13. out of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
with their preſent condition, they commend the Land of
Egypt, wherein they were Bond-ſlaves, to be a Land that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with milk and hony, murmuring at <hi>Moſes</hi> that brought
them out of ſuch a Land. The Land of Canaan that God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to carry them to, was a Land that flowed with milke and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but out of the perverſneſſe of their ſpirits they deſpiſed that
Land, and Egypt now in this froward humour of theirs, muſt be
the Land that flowed with milke and honey. Oh the perverſenſs

for God or man to pleaſe them! how unworthy are ſuch fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts as theſe, to live in ſuch a time as this, to ſee the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:104285:126"/>
great work of God that he hath done for his people. It is true,
heretofore men ſeemed to be more united then now, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
more differences in mens opinions and wayes then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
but whence was it that men formerly were not at ſuch
a diſtance? was it not becauſe they were chained together? two
priſoners chained to a block keep together all day long; men
that are at liberty walk in the ſtreets at a diſtance; if the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ſhould commend their life as more comfortable then yours,
becauſe they keep cloſer together all the day then you do,
would you envy their happineſſe? time hath been that a tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
chain hath been upon us, we dared not then diſcuſs any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of differerence with freedom; if a Convocation determined
it, there was a chain upon us to faſten us to it; now God hath
given us more liberty to debate things freely, that we may finde
out the truth more clearly; and though men while they are in
their debates be at ſome diſtance one from another, do not ſay
it was better with us heretofore then it is now, thou doſt not
ſpeak wiſely concerning this thing.</p>
               <p>Surely theſe men who are ſo deſirous of former times, are <hi>ad
ſervitudinem nati,</hi> born to be ſlaves; it is pitty but they ſhould
have their eares bored for ſlaves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ill uſe that others make of theſe diviſions is to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
cry out of Religion &amp; preaching; ſince there hath been ſo much
profeſſion and preaching, we never had good world, there was
more love and unity before, all things were more quiet, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
were more at peace one with another: This is no other
then if men when Chriſt lived amongſt them, ſhould have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt him, Since this Chriſt hath come amongſt us, we
have had more trouble then we or our fore-fathers heretofore
have known; we were not wont to heare of men poſſeſt with
the Devill, ſo as now we do, now what a noyſe is there in all
the countrey of men poſſeſſed with evill ſpirits? we do not read
of ſuch things before Chriſts time; yet do you think this was a
good argument why men ſhould wiſh that Chriſt had never
come? If the Devill be put into a rage now more then before,
it is a ſigne he is more oppoſed then he was before; he
poſſeſſed all in quiet before, but now his Kingdome begins to
ſhake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, becauſe of theſe diviſions, many reſolve they will</hi>

                  <hi>ſtand Neuters, they ſee it is doubtfull which way things may
goe; ſeeing there are ſuch differences, we will ſtand by and look

in danger to be for any thing at the laſt, or to turn Atheiſts.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, others cry out againſt theſe men that have been moſt
active in this common Cauſe, putting forth themſelves, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
their eſtates and lives, and putting on others; at the firſt
theſe men were honoured, but men did not then ſee what would
follow, they did not think that ſuch troubles would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ſuch undertakings as now they have found; upon this
their hearts riſe againſt thoſe who were the moſt publique ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
Had it not been, ſay they, for a few hot fiery ſpirited men
who know not what they would have, things had never come
to this paſſe, we might have been quiet; Theſe men are by

of turbulent unquiet ſpirits, and yet they have been the means of
preſerving you and your poſterity from ſlavery, and of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

willingneſſe of theirs to hazard their eſtates and lives for your
good; You have cauſe to bleſſe God, ſeeing you were of ſuch
low, narrow, timerous ſpirits your ſelves, unfit for ſuch a work
as God had to do in the beginning of the change of theſe times,
that he raiſed up others, and gave them enlarged, reſolved ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
fit for ſuch a publique work, accompanied with ſo many
difficulties as attended upon this, did they break the ice for
you, and do you thus requite them? This is like a froward,

all we are yet about is only preparatory work for the Houſe of
our God. If God will uſe us in this only, yet bleſſed be his name.
Wherefore though our diviſions be many and very evill, yet
they are not ſo evill nor many, but that there may be hope in
Iſrael concerning this thing. For conſider,</p>

                  <p>THe Apoſtle would not have us think it ſtrange concerning

hard to parallel, but the Church in all ages hath been ſorely
afflicted with diviſions. <hi>Act. 15. 39. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> two
great Apoſtles, were ſo divided, that they could not keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
together, but went one from another in anger. The Text

You will ſay, Surely it was ſome very great matter that ſhould
cauſe ſuch eminent and holy men to be in ſuch a paſſion one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
another, to be ſo hot as not to company together. Truly
no: the matter was not great, it was whether <hi>Mark</hi> ſhould
go with them or no; the one would have him, the other would
not have him, &amp; about this the contention aroſe to this height.
Reade the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to the
<hi>Galathians,</hi> you ſhall finde very great diſſentions in theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:104285:129"/>
And in after-times eſpecially, when God delivered them
from thoſe ten bloudy Perſecutions, the contentions of the
Church were very great. When <hi>Conſtantine</hi> came to the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
Councell,<note place="margin">Socrat. Eccleſ. hiſt. lib. 1. c. 5.</note> divers of the Members of that Councell accuſed
one another to the Emperour, and put up Libels one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
which Libels <hi>Conſtantine</hi> cauſed to be burned. After all
the debates of the Councell, with the preſence of the Emperour,
who laboured all he could for peace and union amongſt them,
making large ſpeeches to that purpoſe, to them, yet there were
five of them diſſented from the reſt in matters of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
then any amongſt us diſſent from our Brethren, namely,
in that point of Chriſts being of the ſame ſubſtance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I finde in <hi>Euſebius</hi> this grievous complaint:<note place="margin">Euſeb. Eccleſ. hiſt. lib. 8. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>After our
affaires, through too much liberty, eaſe and ſecurity, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the rule of piety, one purſued another with open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely
and hatred; we impugned our ſelves by no other then our

words, ſo that Biſhops againſt Biſhops, and people againſt
people raiſed ſedition; and they which ſeemed our Shepherds, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide the rule of piety, practiſed contention and ſchiſme among

mutuall hatred, and enmity, and every one proceeded in ambition,
much like tyranny it ſelfe, then the Lord according to the ſaying
of Jeremy, made the daughter of Sion obſcure, and overthrew
from above the glory of Iſrael.</hi> The contentions of the Church
cauſed by thoſe four grand Hereſies of <hi>Arius, Macedonius, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius,
Eutyches,</hi> one after another, exerciſed the Church a long
time. There was much ſiding, ſome cleaving to one part, ſome
to another in all theſe four. The firſt denyed Chriſts divinity,
upon which the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell was called. The ſecond,
the perſonality of the Spirit, upon which the ſecond Generall
Councell was called at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The third, the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of perſons in Chriſt, upon which the third Generall
Councell was called at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> The fourth confounded Chriſts
natures, upon which the fourth was called at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this time <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Donatus</hi> cauſed much diſturbance
in Europe and Africa. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> who lived in the third Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
reekons threeſcore ſeverall Hereſies that had got head, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
followers of them all, which cauſed great breaches in the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:104285:130"/>
Church from the time of the Apoſtles to the time wherein he
lived. After the diviſion of the Empire into the Eaſterne
and Weſterne parts, then aroſe mighty contention for the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
between the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that
put the Church into wofull contentions for many yeares, one
part excommunicating the other, writing and oppoſing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to the uttermoſt. When this heat is at the hotteſt then
on the one ſide, upon the Weſterne parts God let out the
<hi>Gothes, Hunnes, Vandals,</hi> thoſe barbarous people, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
upon the Eaſterne, ſo that all learning was almoſt extinct
in the Chriſtian world, and groſſe darkneſſe came upon the face
of all Churches. The Church having loſt her lights, men of
learning and worth, then the great contention about Images
aroſe that <gap reason="foreign">

ſhed in that quarrell. In this condition have the Churches been
from time to time divided, yea fighting with one another about
opinions. And for the diviſions and contentions betweene

of the burning of dead bodies, then the houſe of Chriſts flock: are
theſe Shepherds? are theſe the Sheep of Chriſt, whom I ſee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
away in their miſerable burning? Surely they are Shepherds

of them in this horrible and deadly burning, remember not that
they are Sheep or Shepherds. <hi>And thus he proceeds further in

                  </p>
                  <p>This fiery triall of diſſentions in the Church then is no new
thing; we are to be ſenſible of it, to account it a great affiction;
but not to look upon it as if ſome ſtrange thing had befalne us,
that never befell the Churches before.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, How can we do leſſe but account it a very
ſtrange thing, that thoſe who fear God ſhould be thus divided?
that dogs ſhould ſnarle one at another, is no marvaile: but that
ſheep, that thoſe who are godly ſhould do thus, this we cannot
but wonder at: for what reaſon can there be given for it, yea
what ſhew of reaſon can there be imagined?</p>
                  <p>If we conſider of things wiſely,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reaſons why godly men dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo much one from another.</note> we have no ſuch cauſe to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that godly men in this their eſtate of imperfection ſhould
differ ſo much one from another as they do; For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, every godly man prizes and ſeeks after knowledge; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:104285:132"/>
others mind little but their profit and pleaſure; they trouble not
themſelves about the knowing the things of God, except am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
puts them upon it; they care not which way truths goe:
But the Godly man prizes every truth at a high rate, worth the
contending for, to the uttermoſt, rather then to deny it or loſe
it. In the dark, all colours be alike, but in the light they appeare
diverſe. While the Egyptians were in the darke, they all ſate
ſtill, but they moved with various motions when the light brake
out upon them: when men diſcuſſe things, and deſire to ſee
farther into them, it is impoſſible, conſidering the weakneſſes
of the beſt, and the variety of mens apprehenſions, but there
muſt needs be much difference in mens judgements, &amp; then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that every thing they apprehend to be a truth, their
conſciences are engaged in it, at leaſt thus farre, that they muſt
not deny it for a world; this puts mens ſpirits at diſtance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
both be godly, both love the truth equally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Godly men are Free-men, Chriſt hath made them ſo,
and requires them not to ſuffer themſelves to be brought under
bondage, they muſt not, cannot ſubmit their conſciencee to the
opinions, determinations, decrees of any men living; they cannot
ſubmit to any as Lords over their faith; this others can do: as for
points of Religion, ſay ſome, let learned men judge of them, we
will not be wiſer then they, we will ſubmit, and others muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to what they ſhall determine: this makes quick work indeed
of diviſions, but this, thoſe who feare God, cannot do; they muſt
ſee every thing they own as truth, with their own light, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from Jeſus Chriſt though they reverence men of greater
parts, deeper learning, yet they have the charge of Chriſt upon
them, not to acknowledge it as truth, till they underſtand it to
be ſo; this cauſes much contention amongſt good men, through
their weakneſſe and corruption of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>The leſſe diſtance men apprehend between themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in regard of power, the more differences there are amongſt
them, as they ſay the greateſt and ſoreſt ſtormes are about the
Equinoctiall: Men are kept more at peace in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
then in the Church, becauſe there is a greater ſubjection
of one to another there, then may be admitted in the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, godly men give up themſelves to the ſtricteſt rules
of holineſſe, they walk in the narrow way of Chriſt, it is broad
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104285:132"/>
enough to the ſpirituall part, but in regard of our corruptions,
it is a narrow pent way; they dare not give way to themſelves
to decline a haires bredth from the rule, to gratifie others; they
dare not bend to them, that they might ſute more with them,
but muſt keep themſelves to the ſtraight rule; they muſt keep
juſt in their path; they cannot go aſide to give way to others;
hence there is claſhing, every one not having the ſame thoughts
of the rule and way that others have; thoſe who walke by
looſe rules, in wayes that are broad, even to their fleſh, they
can ſure themſelves one to another eaſily, they can gratifie their
friends, yea the corruptions of their friends more then others
can do; godly men cannot yeeld for peace ſake to ſuch termes
as other men can.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the things that the Saints are converſant about, are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
great things, things of a high nature, about their laſt end, their
eternall eſtates; hence every one is very charie, and carefull, and
ſtrongly ſet to maintain what he apprehends; thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not the infinite conſequence of thoſe things, who have
not had the feare of them fall upon their hearts, they wonder at
the ſtifneſſe of mens ſpirits that they can be brought to yeeld no
more in ſuch things that they conceive they might yeeld in, and
where there are different apprehenſions of thoſe things that
concern mens eternall eſtates, even amongſt godly men, they
muſt needs ſtand out one againſt another, till God cauſes one
of them to ſee things otherwiſe then now he doth.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the things of Religion are hidden myſteries, they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
the ſecrets of God, they are hard to be underſtood, God reveals
them in a differing way, they are not ordinarily ſo clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
but that the apprehenſions of them are like to be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the Saints are bound to watch over one another, each <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
is his brothers keeper, they ought to adviſe, admoniſh, reprove
one another, not to ſuffer ſinne to be upon their brethren; now
this (through our corruption) is very diſpleaſing, we doe not
love to be medled with, to be croſſed in what we have a mind
to; but other men can better preſerve their own quiet, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their brethren alone; I will not trouble them, leſt I be
troubled my ſelfe. Hence it is that they many times live more
quietly one with another, then godly men do; yet this is a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:104285:133"/>
great evill, a ſhame to thoſe who are godly, that it ſhould be ſo
upon any termes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, ungodly men are dead in ſins, the Devill hath them
ſure enough, he doth not ſeek to ſtir their corruptions ſo much
as he doth the corruptions of the godly; he ſhall not get ſo
much advantage by the one as by the other; therefore he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to keep the corruptions of the godly acting as much as he
can, that he may diſquiet their owne ſpirits, and the ſpirits of
thoſe with whom they converſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee it is no ſuch wonder why there are diſſentions
amongſt men that truly feare God; Suppoſe they ſhould live
all together, yet ſo long as they live here in this muddy world,
it cannot be but there will be ſometimes foule weather amongſt
them; but if you look into the Church, and conſider of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions
there, there is a farther reaſon for them, for uſually
there are many hypocrites mingled with the godly there, they
taking up a profeſſion of religion and ſo creep into the Church,
they finde ſpirituall things unſuitable to them, hence they fly
off,<note place="margin">Hypocritis nihil est crudelius, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patientius, &amp; vindictae cupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, plane ſunt ſerpentes, quo nullum eſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal vindictae cupidius.</note> their ſpirits not being brought under the yoke of Chriſt, they
fling againſt thoſe things that pinch them. We read <hi>Num.</hi> 11.

after they were got out of Egypt, was from the mixt multitude

                  <p>2. Thoſe who agree in many things, have hope it may be to get <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
one another to them; upon this they ſtruggle with one another
the more: as for thoſe who are at a great diſtance, they have no
hope to prevaile with them, therefore they make no onſet, but
ſeeing themſelves fruſtrated of their hopes, there this troubles
them, yea it oft ſtirs up a ſpirit of anger againſt them whom they

they are beyond others in, as otherwiſe they might, becauſe ſuch
as are ſo near them are againſt it, if they did not agree in moſt
things, and thoſe of greateſt moment, their oppoſition would
not be much regarded: but becauſe they are ſuch men who for
their judgements and lives are ſo unblameable, their differing in
ſuch a thing is more then if a hundred times as many, who were

                  <p>2. By theſe Diviſions God exerciſes the graces of his ſervants.
A little skill in a Mariner is enough to guide his Ship in faire
weather: but when ſtormes ariſe, when the Seas ſwell and
grow troubleſome, then his skill is put to it. In theſe ſtormy
troubleſome times there had need be much wiſdome, faith,
love, humility, patience, ſelfe-deniall, meekneſſe, all graces
are put to it now, they had need put forth all their ſtrength, act
with all their vigour; our graces had need be ſtirring, full of life
and quickneſſe now. God prizeth the exerciſe of the graces of
his Saints at a very high rate. He thinks it worth their ſuffering
much trouble. It is a good evidence of grace, yea of much grace,
to account the trouble of many afflictions to be recompenſed by
the exerciſe of graces. In times of diviſion men had need ſtirre
up all their graces, and be very watchfull over their wayes, and
walke exactly, be circumſpect, accurate in their lives. Thoſe
who have not their hearts with them, have their eyes upon them,
prying into them, watching for their halting. When there is
ſiding there is much obſerving. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſayes <hi>David, Pſal. 27. 11.)

light. Sparkes are beaten out by the Flints ſtriking together.
Many ſparks of light, many truths are beaten out by the beatings
of mens ſpirits one againſt another. If light be let into a houſe,
there muſt be ſome trouble to beat down a window. A child
thinks the houſe is beating downe, but the father knowes
the light will be worth the coſt and trouble. If you will
have the cloth woven, the Woofe and Warpe muſt be
caſt croſſe one to another. If you will have truths argued out,
you muſt be content to bear with ſome oppoſition for the time.
Thoſe who are not willing to bear ſome trouble, to be at ſome
coſt to find out truth, are not worthy of it. Thoſe who love truth
will ſeek for it, for truths ſake; thoſe who love victory, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                     </gap>and in them.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 34, 35. he ſayes, <hi>Thinke not that I am come to ſend
peace on the earth, I came to bring a ſword. I am come to ſet a
man at variance againſt his Father, and the Daughter againſt her
Mother.</hi> One would think it to be the ſtrangeſt ſpeech that could
be, to come from the mouth of him who is the great peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
Oh bleſſed Saviour, muſt we not think that thou art come
to ſend peace? Thou art our peace. Is not thine Embaſſage
from thy Father, an Embaſſage of peace? True: peace with
my Father, but not peace on the earth; not an earthly peace;
do not think that I came from heaven to work this for men, that
they ſhould live at eaſe in plenty and pleaſure, that they ſhould
have no diſturbance, no trouble to the fleſh: no, the event of
my comming you will finde to be a ſword, diviſions, and that
between thoſe of the neareſt relation. A child who is wicked
will deſpiſe and break with his godly father, and the daughter
with her godly mother. And <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 53. the carnall father
and mother will have their hearts riſe againſt their godly ſonne
and daughter. <hi>I am come to ſend fire on the earth, and what will
I if it be already kindled?</hi> Let it kindle as ſoone as it will, I am
contented, I know much good will come of it. Theſe Scriptures
are enough to take away for ever the offence of diviſions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Chriſt himſelfe is the greateſt offence to wicked men
that ever was in the world: he is the ſtumbling ſtone and rock
of offence, thouſand thouſands being offended at him miſcarry
everlaſtingly. Chriſt foreſeeing how many would be offended
at him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 6. bleſſeth the man who ſhall not be offended.
Some are offended at what they ſee in Chriſt; others apprehend
whatſoever is in him to be moſt excellent and lovely, that which
they cannot but defend and ſtand for to the death. He is diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of men, rejected by the builders, a ſtone of ſtumbling to
them: but to the Saints the chief corner ſtone, elect, precious,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104285:136"/>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Such different apprehenſions of Chriſt muſt
needs divide men.</p>
                  <p>2. Chriſt comes to make the greateſt alteration that ever was
or can be in the world, and do we not finde that troubles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
alterations, and above all alterations, alterations in
government, and eſpecially ſuch a government as gives no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
yeelds no compliance with any thing elſe? When
Chriſt comes he brings his fanne in his hand, he muſt have his
floore throughly purged; he gathers his wheat into his garner,
&amp; ſevers the chaffe to be burnt in unquenchable fire. If he comes
thus, who ſhall abide his comming? <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2. Who ſhall ſtand
when he appeares? <hi>for he is like a Refiners fire, and Fullers ſope,
he ſhall ſit as a refiner and purifier of ſilver, he ſhall purifie the ſons
of Levi.</hi> Certainly there will be much adoe when they come
to be purified. No men in the world are like to make ſo much
ſtirre when they come to be purified as the Clergy will. Chriſt
comes to caſt out Devils, they will fome, fret, vex, rend and
teare when they are a caſting out. The Goſpel likewiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides.
The word of the Goſpell is a dividing word. <hi>Heb. 4. 11.
It is quicke, powerfull, ſharper then a two-edged ſword, piercing
even to the dividing aſunder of ſoule and spirit, of the joints and
marrow.</hi> It divides in a mans own heart, and divides between
man and man. The light of it divides. The firſt diviſion we ever
read of was of Gods making, <hi>Gen. 1. 3, 4. When he ſaid, Let there
be light, and God divided the light from the darkneſs.</hi> The doctrine
of the Goſpel ſhews the ſpiritualneſs of Gods commands, the
ſinfulneſſe of thoughts, of the firſt ſtirrings of ſin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. this
touches to the quick.</p>
                  <p>The heat of the Goſpel divides: it is like fire when it comes,
<hi>Is not my word like fire?</hi> The preaching of the Goſpel with
power heaps coales of fire upon mens heads, which will either
melt them, or burn them. In it there is a ſeparation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
from the vile.</p>
                  <p>The Ordinances of the Goſpel divide, they difference men.
Some they will receive, others they will not. They muſt bring
men to a higher, to a ſtricter way then the ſluggiſh, dead, vain,
ſlight, droſſie hearts of men are willing to come up unto.</p>
                  <p>The godlineſſe that is in Chriſt Jeſus divides, therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
will live godly ſo, muſt expect to ſuffer perſecution,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12.</p>

1. Thoſe who hold forth the life and power of godlineſſe, ſeem
to challenge a more ſpeciall peculiar intereſt in God then others
which cannot be endured, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 19. We are of God, and the
whole world lyes in wickedneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Their lives condemne others, which they cannot abide, as
<hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid to condemne the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7.</p>
                  <p>3. In godlineſſe there is an excellency. They whoſe hearts are
naught cannot look upon that hath any appearance of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
without a ſpirit of envy. If they judge men only to be
conceited with it as an excellency, but for their parts they think
it not to be ſo, then they look upon them with a ſpirit of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>4. Godlineſſe makes men zealous in ſuch things as others can
ſee no reaſon why they ſhould. They think they do <hi>incaleſcere
in re frigida,</hi> and that the ground of their zeal is vanity, and
turbulency of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>5. It makes men conſtant: nothing can turn them out of
their way. The Son yeelds not to his Father, the Servant not
to his Maſter; this is judged to be ſtoutneſſe and wilfulneſſe,
though God knowes it is far otherwiſe, it muſt needs therefore
enrage others at them.</p>

uttermoſt for him, now God hath granted theſe to us, we abuſe
them, we grow wanton, we jarre one againſt another: we are
like ſome Marriners, who are calme in a ſtorme, But ſtorme in a

ſpirits of thoſe who heretofore longed after ordinances, freed
from theſe defilements they mourned under, when they have
their deſires in great meaſure ſatisfied, diſcovers ſo much evill in
the hearts of men, that it juſtifies thoſe whom themſelves have
had hard thoughts of, men who ſeemed carnall and naught, that
you looked upon as very evill, men of bitter ſpirits againſt good
men, you thought ſuch things apparently argued them void of
grace, and yet when you are got into Church-fellowſhip, that
way of freedome, that your ſoules mourned after a long time,
now though you be joyned in covenant one to another, yet if

to make and to confirm peace within. Oh conſider, is the
breach between man and man ſo grievous? how grievous is that
which is between God and the Soul! I find it hard, and doubt
whether it be poſſible to be at peace with men in this world;
I find them of ſuch froward, peeviſh, ſelfiſh, wilfull ſpirits,
even many who ſeem to be good men otherwiſe, but God gives
many encouragements to poor ſouls to come unto him; he is
a God of love and mercy, he delights not to grieve the children
of men, to cruſh under his feet the priſoners of the earth: he is
willing to be reconciled to ſinners: there is nothing that his
heart is more ſet upon, then reconciliation with wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſouls. Oh that in theſe ſad dayes of miſerable diſſentions,
I might be bleſſed with the comforts of the reconciliation of my
ſoul with God! if this were, I hope I ſhould be able contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bear, and with ſtrength to paſs through all thoſe heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadning
evils cauſed by theſe breaches and diſſentions there are
amongſt us. This were a good uſe indeed, made of ſuch evill
things, if mens contending with you ſhall thus further your
peace with God; what he once ſaid of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, it was <hi>Faelix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
peccatum,</hi> a happy ſin, becauſe it occaſioned ſo much good in
Mans Redemption: So I may ſay of that ſtrife and contention
there is among us, it is <hi>faelix contentio,</hi> a happy contention, that
God hath turned to ſo much good unto you.</p>
                  <p>I have read of <hi>Robert Holgate,</hi> who was Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:104285:138"/>
becauſe he could not peaceably enjoy his ſmall living in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne-ſhire,</hi>

providences and duties which ſhall be ſo bleſſed unto thee, as
to further thy getting into the favour of the high God, and the
enjoyment of the ſoule-ſatisfying ſweetneſſe there is in peace
with him; what cauſe ſhalt thou have of admiring free grace,

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 8. Labour to make up your want of that good and comfort
you heretofore had in Chriſtian communion, with a more cloſe
and conſtant communion with the Lord, who hath been pleaſed
to ſpeak peace unto you. Although I have not that comfort in
communion with the ſtreams, yet I may find it fully made up in

                  <p>

I love it above gold.</hi> We uſe to put a price upon things that
are rare: what makes Jewels to be of that worth, but for the
rarity of them? Unity, hearty love, ſweetneſs of communion
among brethren, is now a very rare thing, a ſcarce commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
let us prize it the more, and you who do enjoy it, bleſs God
for it.</p>
                  <p>10. The more confuſed, broken, and troubleſome we ſee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
things to be, the more let our hearts be ſtirred up in prayer to
God, putting him in mind of all thoſe gracious promiſes that
he hath made to his Church for peace and union: Lord is it not
part of thy Covenant with thy people, that <hi>thou wilt give them
one heart?</hi> haſt thou not ſaid that they ſhall <hi>ſerve thee with one
ſhoulder?</hi> haſt thou not told us that thou wilt <hi>make Jeruſalem

ſhould be no pricking bryar nor grieving thorn?</hi>

hath been their great care not to enwrap themſelves in the guilt
of theſe diviſions, but they can appeale to God that they have
endeavoured after peace ſo far as they could with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
let them bleſs God for this mercy, it is a great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
to be delivered from the guilt of thoſe diviſions. <hi>Deut.
33. 8. Of Levi he ſaid, Let thy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim be with thy

didſt ſtrive at the waters of Meribah. Maſſah</hi> ſignifies <hi>tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Meribah, contention.</hi> Places and times of contention
are places and times of tentation. Now if God ſhall prove us
at thoſe places in thoſe times, and we be found upright, this
will bring a bleſſing upon us. At thoſe waters where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
murmured, contending even with God himſelfe, <hi>Aaron</hi>
(though there was ſome weakneſſe in him) yet kept himſelfe
from being involved in the guilt of that ſinne of contending
with God. And <hi>Sol-Jarchi,</hi> with other of the Hebrewes, ſay,
that the Levites were not in that ſinne neither; which they
thinke that place <hi>Malachie</hi> 2. 5. refers unto, <hi>My covenant was
with him of life and peace, for the feare wherewith he feared
me, and was afraid before my name.</hi> The feare of God was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Levi,</hi> at that time he dared not contend as then others did,
and therefore my covenant of life and peace was and is with
him. We have been theſe three or foure yeeres at theſe waters
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104285:139"/>
of <hi>Maſſah</hi> and <hi>Meribah,</hi> God hath tryed us. How happy are
thoſe who have held out, who have kept their conſciences free,
upon whom the fear of God hath been, and through that feare
of his, have walked before him in the wayes of truth and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?

Oh that it might be, what ſorrow ſoever it coſts us!</p>
               <p>We read <hi>Judges</hi> 2. 12. 3, 4, 5. the Lord ſent an Angell from
<hi>Gilgal</hi> to the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who told them how graciouſly he
had dealt with them, yet they had contrary to the command of
God made a league with the inhabitants of the Land, for which
the Lord threatned that they ſhould be as thorns in their ſides.
When the Angell ſpake theſe words to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
the people lift up their voice and wept. And they called the
name of that place <hi>Boehim,</hi> a place of tears. Their ſin was too
much joyning, joyning in league where God would not have
them: thoſe whom they joyned with, God told them ſhould
be thornes in their ſides. Upon this they wept, and that ſo ſore,
that the place received its name from their weeping. But oh
that the Lord would ſend his Angell, yea his Spirit to us, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us of our evill, that we to this day have not joyned in ſure
league one with another, but are thorns in the ſides of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and that after ſo many mercies, ſuch great deliverances
from our bondage, from the rage of ungodly men, yea that we
are ſo falſe one to another, though the Lord hath never broke
covenant with us, which was the heart-breaking argument the
Angell uſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. Yea the Lord hath done abundantly for us,
beyond our hopes, deſires, thoughts, and that after all this there
ſhould be nothing but breaches and diviſions amongſt us, that
we ſhould be not only thornes, but ſpeares and ſwords in one
anothers ſides, piercing to one anothers hearts. Are we the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Let our hearts then break for the breaches of
our hearts. Let them break, and melt, and mourn, and bleed, and
reſolve that nothing ſhall comfort them, but peace with our
God, and peace one wth another.</p>

ſo with us, that we had no need to be wrote to, to be preached
to, concerning this. Does it appear by our carriages one towards
another, that we are taught of God to love one another? But
that God may teach us this day, attend to what ſhall be ſaid to

think our hearts ſhould of themſelves run into one another. But
that I may not ſeeme to leave our wounds open, ſo that aire

                  <p>IF notwithſtanding the differences from Gods mind, and many
weakneſſes, there may be peace and love between God &amp; his
Saints: then ſurely notwithſtanding theſe things, the Saints may
be at love and peace among themſelves. Let this be laid for a

if men differ in their judgement and practice in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:104285:140"/>
though it be in things that are but the weakneſſe of godly
men, yet there muſt needs be heart-burning and diviſion. Let
all peaceable men deny this conſequence, Let us not ſay it will
be ſo, and that our words may be made good afterwards indeed
make it ſo: certainly the connection of them, if there be any, is

to the other. Tell me, were it a ſigne of valour in a man to draw
his ſword at every Whappet that comes near him? yea at every
Fly that lights upon him? Were it not folly and madneſſe? Why?
he may by putting forth his finger put them off from him. Thy

                  <head>The third joyning Principle.</head>
                  <head type="sub">It is better to doe good, then to receive good.</head>
                  <p>ACtive good is better then paſſive; only God himſelfe, his
Angels and Saints do good; all creatures can receive good.
This principle would quickly joyne us; for if this were in mens
hearts, they would ſtudy to do all the good they could to one
another, and ſo gaine upon one anothers hearts: and the more
good we doe to any, the more will our hearts be inclinable to
love them. The very communication of goodneſſe, if it be out
of a good ſpirit, carryes the heart along with it to the ſubject
this good is communicated to: the more good God doth to any,
the more he loves them. God hates nothing that he hath made,
but loves what there is in any thing of his work: but when he
communicates his grace, his Spirit, when he gives his Chriſt in
theſe gifts, he gives his heart: they do not only come from love,
but they make the ſubject further lovely in his eyes. So it is with
us in our proportion: if you take a poore childe from the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,
or out of the Almes-houſe, and make him your heyre, you
do not only do this good to him becauſe you love dim, but you
alſo love him more,<note place="margin">Hodie non reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navimus, quia neminem affeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus beneficio.</note> becauſe you look upon him as an object of
your goodneſſe as one raiſed by you. <hi>Titus</hi> accounted that day
loſt, a day wherein he had not raigned, if he had done no good.
This principle would make men great as well as good. It is the
glory of God that he does ſo much good. And if men could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
this greatneſſe, ſatisfying greatneſſe, the moſt and greateſt
contentions that are in the world would be layd down: for what
do men contend ſo much for as for greatneſſe?</p>

                  <p>VVE are all of one body: whatſoeuer good others have, it
is the good of the body; it makes them ſome way able
to doe that good that we would have done, or at leaſt that we
ſhould deſire to have done. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayes that <hi>Solon</hi> made a law
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:104285:143"/>
whereby every man was enabled to ſue whoſoever wronged his
neighbour, as if he had wronged himſelf; he gave this reaſon
for it, There is no good that one man has in a Common-wealth,
but it is another mans as well as his.</p>
                  <p>Community in the Church is more. 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 22. Whether Paul,
or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or things to come, all are yours, you are Chriſts, and Chriſt
is Gods.</hi> If you be godly you have an intereſt in all the eminent
godly men in the world, in all their gifts, their graces, in all
they have or do; all that is in the world that hath any good in
it, is yours, yea what is evill ſhall be ſerviceable to you for good.
This is brought by the Apoſtle to quiet the jarrings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
that were amongſt the Corinthians. One would be for
<hi>Paul,</hi> another for <hi>Apollos,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, What need this
contention, who you are for, and who another is for? they are
all yours, all the excellency there is in them is the good of every
one of you. A ſpeciall reaſon why men contend ſo much, is, they
think the good that other men have is their evill, therefore they
muſt either get it to themſelves, or darken it in thoſe that have
it. But ſuch men acted by ſuch a principle are poore, low-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
men. A man of a raiſed, enlarged ſpirit, opens his heart
that it may be filled with that infinite good in which there is all
good. Now if it be that good my ſoul cloſeth with, and is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in, then whatſoever hath any goodneſſe in it, be it where
it will, it flowes from this Infinite Ocean of good that my ſoul is
launched into, and ſome way or other flows into this againe;
though thorough mens corruptions, there may be windings and
turnings in the courſe of it, yet hither it comes at laſt, and
therefore it is mine as really and truly as any I have in mine
own hand: my ſoul then ſhall rejoyce in all the good I ſee my
brethren have, in all they do, I will bleſſe God for it, and ſeek
the furtherance of it what I can. Surely this man muſt needs be
a man of peace and love.</p>

There is a notable ſtory of a Turkiſh Emperour, perceiving his

to his Concubine <hi>Irene,</hi> his heart vvas ſo taken vvith her that he

not her all was daſhed, ſo much did he dote upon <hi>Irene.</hi> This
the Nobles and State could not bear: he therefore at laſt ſo far
conſidered the publique, as he overcame his doting affections.
He brought <hi>Irene</hi> before them, and ſayes, That ye may ſee how
much I prize the content of my people, I ſacrifice her to them,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:104285:146"/>
and ſo drew his ſword, and ſlew her with his own hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes. If according to her demerits for drawing his
heart away from the good of the Common-wealth, ſhe had bin
given up to the ſword of juſtice, it might have ſatisfied as well.
But leſt I be thought to be too literall, give me leave to allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize

                  <p>Secondly, that is baſeneſs, when our yeilding is thorough <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

had we had a ſpirit of wiſdome and courage, we might have
peace upon more honourable terms. Indeed many think every

as are not put to any great triall themſelves. But when our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
tell us, that what we do is what the rule allowes us; it
is not becauſe we would avoyd trouble, but we find thorough
Gods grace, our hearts in ſome meaſure prepared for ſuffering,
if God were pleaſed to call us to it, in any thing wherein he
may have glory, and the publick may be benefited. But becauſe
all things duly conſidered, we ſee that God in ſuch a way ſhall
have more glory, and our brethren generally more good: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatſoever becomes of our particular in regard of eſteem,

him in all holineſſe and godly fear, and in other things that go
as near to us, we are able to deny our ſelves as much as ever: in
this we may have comfort, that it is not baſeneſs that makes us
yeild, but rather the grace of God enabling us to rule over our

                  <p>7. One God. Though there be three perſons in the Divine
Nature, and every perſon is God, yet there is but one God; here
is an union infinitely beyond all unions that any creature can be
capable of; the myſtery of this union is revealed to us, to make
us in love with union. Our intereſt in this one God is ſuch a

great power in it to make up all breaches, to heal all old grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
After their Father was dead, their conſciences miſgave
them for what they had done to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> they were afraid old
matters would break forth, and that <hi>Joſeph</hi> would turn their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
now how do they ſeek to unite <hi>Joſephs</hi> heart to them?
<hi>We pray thee,</hi> ſay they, <hi>forgive the trespaſſe of the ſervants of the

ſtranged from the ſervants of the God of my Father? The Lord

&amp; he was my Fathers God; this argument had more in it to draw
<hi>Joſephs</hi> heart to them, then if they had ſaid, We are your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,

but the ſervants of the God of thy Father is much more.
Let us look upon all the godly, though they have many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
though they have not carryed themſelves towards us as
they ought, yet they are the ſervants, yea the children of our
God, and of our fathers God; let this draw our hearts to them.
If they be one with us, in their intereſt in one God, let them be
one with us in the affections of our heart, to love them, delight
in them, and rejoyce in communion with them.</p>
                  <p>One God and Father. <hi>Mal. 2. 10. Have we not all one Father?

Is it ſeemly that one mans children ſhould be alwayes conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
quarrelling and miſchieving one another? do you thinke
this is pleaſing to your Father? It followes in that 4. of <hi>Epheſ.

to ſome in one kinde, to ſome in another, be matter for you to
contend about. <hi>And he worketh in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe gifts and graces eſpecially that are in his children, are
his workings; that ſome have more then others, it is from his

of your Brethren. <hi>He is in all.</hi> Men may have children in whom
little or nothing of their Father appeares, but God is in all his
children, notwithſtanding all their weakneſſes, therefore our

of the moſt famous Scriptures for the union of the Saints in one,
that we have in all the book of God.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, If indeed we could ſee God in ſuch, if

of natures very different. The common gifts that men who are

                  <p>THere muſt be a due conſideration of all theſe, and we muſt

not the fire ye ſhall make goe thorough the water.</hi> We muſt deal
with every man according to his temper. Some men are by their
complexions of a more harſh and rugged temper then others.
Conſider what is the beſt way of dealing with ſuch: in the main

ſpend their lives for you: if the harſhneſs of their natures cauſe

though no evill in them is to be juſtified, yet deal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

it may be their hearts are preſſed with diſappointments, it may

they have family-temptations, and perſonall temptations that
you are freed from: you do not know what you might doe if
you were under the like temptations. Bleſſe God that you are

Some men have been brought up altogether amongſt Prelaticall

                  <p>Conſider mens yeares: old age looks for reſpect, and juſtly:

much for your good: though ſome infirmities ſhould break forth
that are incident to old age, we muſt cover and paſſe by what
we can, not forgetting that reverent reſpect that is due to the
hoary head found in the way of godlineſſe. Conſider mens gifts:
it may be they are not able to riſe to your height, to underſtand
what you do; thank God for your ſtrength, but be not angry
with your brother becauſe he is weaker. This was one of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments

which the Apoſtle mentions our calling to peace is as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
a caſe to preſerve peace in, as any can fall out in ones life.
It was the caſe of man and wife unequally yoaked, one is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever,
the other an Infidell, yet being man and wife the Apoſtle
determines that the Beleever muſt be content to live with the
unbeleever, as it becomes a wife or a husband; except he or ſhe
of themſelves will depart, but they ſhould give them no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

very much tryed, and that is when a ſervant meets with a harſh,

thing would put ones ſpirit into a rage, one would thinke this
would do it. No, ſaith the Apoſtle, ſuch muſt be the command
you muſt have over your ſpirits, as you muſt patiently bear this:
and he grounds it upon this, <hi>For hereunto were ye called,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.
21, 22. But though husbands and wives ſhould live at peace,
though they ſuffer one from another: though ſervants ſhould
put up wrongs from their maſters, yet it followes not that the
like patience ſhould be required in us, when we are wronged by
our equals, by thoſe to whom we have no ſuch band of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Amneſtia;</hi> a Law that was made by <hi>Thraſybulus,</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the people; that former injuries ſhould be forgotten. It
was made upon this occaſion. After <hi>Lyſander</hi> had conquered
the Athenians, he ſet thirty Governours over them which ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized
exceedingly. <hi>Thraſybulus,</hi> with many others, were
baniſhed; but after a while, <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> gathering together
his baniſhed Countreymen, he got up an Army, and by it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Athenians from the yoke of theſe thirty Tyrants: now
becauſe when the baniſhed men came home <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would be revenged upon thoſe whom they judged the
cauſes of it, and the other would be enraged againſt them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Thraſibulus</hi> got the people to joyne with him in this Law,
which they called <hi>Amneſtia,</hi> that all former wrongs ſhould be
forgotten, &amp; that they ſhould live lovingly and peaceably hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth

from bondage, and ſettle things amongſt us, the addition of
ſuch a Law which we may call our Engliſh. <hi>Amneſtia</hi> will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
neceſſary. Otherwiſe oh the abundance of the fire of malice
that will remaine raked up under the aſhes, ready upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to burſt out! one will look upon the other with eyes full
of revenge, with ſcorn, hatred, and diſdain; one will charge
the other as the cauſe of all our miſeries, and curſe him; the
other will charge him, and curſe him as deeply. Every time
men think what they have ſuffered, their hearts will be enraged.
Such now is that extreme bitter exaſperation, and deadly rage
of mens hearts one againſt another, that whenſoever peace ſhall
be concluded, if it be not made exceeding ſure, our pacification
is like to be the foundation of far greater evills to us then yet

                  <p>IF God ſhould catch advantages againſt us, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of us? This is moſt unſeemly, when men are ſeeking to
finde out truth, if then they ſhall piddle about words, catch at
phraſes; get hold of expreſſions; and ſeek to make their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
out of them; and in this ſhall be the greateſt ſtrength of
their anſwer, though this may have a ſpecious ſhew before men,
who are willing to receive any thing which makes againſt what
they would have cruſhed, yet this will not abide before the
throne of Chriſt. We reade <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. Chriſt had a great diſpute
with the Devill, in which he had him at great advantage in his
quotation of a Scripture, <hi>ver. 6. He ſhall give his Angells charge
concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall beare thee up, leſt at
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:104285:157"/>
any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtoue.</hi> This was quoted out
of the 91. <hi>Pſal. ver.</hi> 11. there it is, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge
over thee to keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi> Yet Chriſt did not catch
this advantage, he did not ſo much as upbraid him for leaving
out that paſſage, which he might juſtly have done, but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to the thing. Yea Chriſt might have taken a further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
againſt the Devill, for the words following in the Pſalm
are a propheſie of Chriſt deſtroying the power of the Devill,
<hi>Thou ſhalt tread upon the Lyon and Adder, the young Lyon and the
Dragon ſhalt thou trample under thy feet.</hi> Chriſt did not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take the
advantage of this neither, and upbraid him with it, he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
againſt him in the thing it ſelfe he brought. It is a ſigne
that men have leſſe advantage in the matter, when they ſeek ſo
much to catch at all the advantages they can in the manner of
the expreſſions of thoſe whom they oppoſe.</p>
                  <p>2. Make the beſt interpretation of things you can. 1 <hi>Cor.
13. 5. Love thinkes no evill.</hi> It may be if you meet with a man
in the ſtreets, if he ſtayes not to talk with you, if he takes not
ſpeciall notice of you, you preſently think it is his pride, his
ſleighting, diſregarding you, this is the worſt interpretation
that can be. Why? is it not poſſible that it may be thorough
multitude of buſineſſe in his head that you know not of? May it
not be that his eyes and thoughts were another way? he did not
take notice of your paſſing by him; is it not thus often with your
ſelfe in reſpect of others? Againe, perhaps ſuch a man you find
not in his behaviour towards you when you are with him, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo ſmilingly upon you, carrying himſelfe in that familiar
affable way as you expected;<note place="margin">

it is his pride and ſurlineſſe, whereas it may be it is becauſe
his head is fuller then yours, which may afterwards be for your
good, if you would be but patient a while; it may be it is from
ſome trouble of his ſpirit at that time; it may be it is from the
temper of his body, his conſtitution, or ſome weakneſſe in it at
that time; if ſuch a faire interpretation may be made, why ſhould
not an ingenuous candid ſpirit make it? This very exception I
find was taken againſt <hi>Baſilius Magnus,</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in one
of his Orations, in which he highly commends <hi>Baſil,</hi> anſwers
it, and juſtifies him; It is hard to keep unity, love and peace
with men who are of exceptious carping diſpoſitions; if God
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:104285:158"/>
were ſtrict to mark what we doe amiſſe, what would become
of us? God is ſtrict to mark what good there is in his Saints;
if there be any little good in the midſt of much imperfection,
Gods way is to paſſe by the imperfection, and take notice of the
good; but our way is often, if there be a little bad, though but
through a very pardonable miſtake, in the midſt of much good,
to paſſe by all the good, and to ſeize upon the miſtake, to make
it the ſeed of contention, to brood over it, and ſo beget the brats
of contention from it. Certainly this ought not thus to be.</p>

not to take away our water and our neceſſary commodity to live by,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:104285:159"/>
for which things men of judgement muſt needs fight? as for other
goods, if I be richer then thee, I am ready to give thee of mine; and
if I have leſſe, I will not think ſcorn to thank thee, if thou wilt give
me ſome of thine. Alexander <hi>being pleaſed to hear him ſpeak thus
wiſely, embraced him, and ſaid unto him,</hi> Thinkeſt thou that this
meeting of ours can be without fight, for all theſe goodly fair words?
No, no, thou haſt won nothing by them, for I will fight and contend
with thee in honeſty and curteſie, becauſe thou ſhalt not exceed me

1 <hi>Theſſ. 5. 23. The very God of peace. 2 Theſſ. 3. 16. The Lord of
peace himſelfe.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt in being the Prince of peace; the holy
Ghoſt in being like a Dove that hath no gall: the Goſpel is the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:104285:163"/>
Goſpel of peace; the Kingdome of God is peace as well as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe;
the legacy that Chriſt left is a legacy of peace; the
Apoſtolicall benediction is grace, mercy, and peace: the glory
of the Church is in this, that it is a City compact at unity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it ſelfe. Yea this will be the glory of that glorious Church,
that God is raiſing a new Jeruſalem, there ſhall be no more cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, <hi>Apoc. 21. 4. Ezech. 14. 9. The Lord ſhall be King over all
the earth, in that day there ſhall be one Lord, and his name ſhall be
one.</hi> There is but one Lord now, but he is called by different
names, but in that day his name ſhall be but one. <hi>Zeph. 3. 9.
Then will I turne to a people of pure language, that they may call
upon the name of the Lord, and ſerve him with one conſent.</hi> The
Hebrew word is with one ſhoulder, now we ſhoulder one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but then all ſhall ſerve the Lord with one ſhoulder. This
love and peace is compared to the moſt delightfull, and the moſt
profitable things; <hi>Behold how good and pleaſant it is for brethren
to dwell at unity; it is like the precious ointment upon the head, that
ranne downe upon the beard, even Aarons beard; that went downe
to the skirts of his garment, as the dew of Hermon, that deſcended
upon the mountaines of Sion. Pſal.</hi> 123.</p>
               <p>There are many promiſes made to this. <hi>Mat. 5. Bleſſed are
the peace-makers. 2 Cor. 13. 11. Be of one minde, live in peace,
and the God of peace ſhall be with you. John</hi> 15. 12. Chriſt ſayes,
<hi>This is his commandement, that we love one another. ver.</hi> 14. he
ſayes, <hi>Ye are my friends if ye doe whatſoever I command you.</hi> By
loving others we doe not only get them to be our friends, but
Chriſt too. Me thinks I ſee Chriſt here pleading for love, as one
who had to deale with two men who were at ſome variance,
perſwading them to peace and love; Come, you ſhall paſſe by
all former things, you ſhall be made friends, by this you ſhall
gaine me alſo to be a friend to you as long as I live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Geneſ. 13. ver.</hi> 8. to the end, is a remarkable Scripture to
ſhew how God is with a loving, gentle, peaceable diſpoſition.
<hi>Ver.</hi> 8. 9. we have <hi>Abrahams</hi> kinde gentle yeelding to <hi>Lot</hi> his
inferiour for peace ſake; but mark what followes, and you
ſhall finde he loſt nothing by this his yeelding: for as ſoone as
<hi>Lot</hi> was gone from him, the Lord came to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and
ſaid to him, <hi>Lift up now thine eyes and looke from the place where
thou art, Northward, Southward, Eaſtward and Weſtward, for
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:104285:163"/>
all the Land that thou ſeeſt to thee will I give it, and to thy ſeed for
ever: ariſe, walke thorough, the Land in the length of it, and in the
breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee.</hi> The difference of what
<hi>Jacob</hi> ſayes of <hi>Reuben</hi> when he was to dye, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 4. from that
of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 33. 6. is obſervable: <hi>Jacob</hi> ſayes, <hi>Hee is the
firſt borne, the beginning of his ſtrength; but he ſhall not excell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he went to his fathers bed.</hi> But <hi>Moſes, Let Reuben live and
not dye, and let not his men be few.</hi> The reaſon of this difference is
given by ſome, becauſe it was fit that <hi>Jacob,</hi> to deter his other
children, ſhould exerciſe the authority of a father, but <hi>Moſes</hi>
frees him from the curſe, becauſe he was alwayes loving to his
brother <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> Brotherly love hath a bleſſing going along with
it: God loves it exceedingly, for it makes much for the glory
of God. And to what purpoſe do we live, if God have not
glory by us? <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 5, 6, 7. the Apoſtle firſt prayes that <hi>the
God of patience and conſolution would grant them to be like minded
one towards another, according to Chriſt Jeſus, that they may
with one minde and one mouth glorifie God.</hi> Then he exhorts:
<hi>Wherefore receive ye one another, as Chriſt alſo received us to the
glory of God.</hi> Much of Gods glory depends upon our union.
Yea God ſtands ſo much upon this, that he is willing to ſtay for
his ſervice till we be at peace one with another. <hi>Mat. 5. 23, 24.
Leave thy gift before the Altar, and firſt be reconciled to thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> My worſhip ſhall ſtay
till you be reconciled. I love my worſhip, and deſire it much,
but I muſt have peace and love amongſt your ſelves firſt, I will
ſtay for that. But I beſeech you let us not make God ſtay too
long. Remember while you are wrangling and quarrelling,
God ſtayes on you all this while. If children ſhould be quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and one comes to them, and ſayes, Your father ſtayes for
you, it is time for them to break off. But not unmannerly with
God, in making him ſtay ſo long upon you: ſome of you have
made him wait upon you for an acceptable duty of worſhip di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
weeks, yea it may be many moneths, and yet your ſpirits
are not in temper to offer any ſacrifice to God. What a fearfull
evill is it then to ſtand out in a ſtubborne, ſullen, dogged manner
refuſing to be reconciled! Learned <hi>Druſius</hi> cites Hebrew Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſaying, That he that offends his brother ought to ſeeke to
pacifie him; if he refuſe to be pacified, then he muſt bring three
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:104285:164"/>
of his friends with him to intercede twice or thrice, and if he
ſhall after this refuſe,<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>quia implacabilis eſt, vocatur peccator,</hi> is called a <hi>ſinner,</hi> with a
ſpeciall note upon him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Saints enjoyment of the ſweetneſſe of love, peace
and unity among themſelves, what is it but heaven upon earth?
Heaven is above all ſtorms, tempeſts, troubles, the happineſſe
of it is perfect reſt. We pray that the will of God might bee
done on earth as it is done in heaven; why, may not we have a
heaven upon earth? this would ſweeten all our comforts, yea all
our afflictions. But the Devill envies us this happineſſe. Come
Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</p>
               <p>If you would have the excellency of love ſet before you more
fully, reade over and over again the Epiſtles of <hi>Iohn.</hi> Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
ſtory reports of this bleſſed Apoſtle, whoſe heart was ſo
full of love, that when he grew very old, not able to preach, yet
he would be brought into the congregation in a chaire, and
there ſay only theſe words, <hi>Little children flee idolatry, love one
another.</hi> But the more excellent union and peace is, the more is
the pitty that it ſhould be abuſed to be ſerviceable to mens luſts;
the more would our miſery be if we ſhould be abuſed in our
treaties about it; if we ſhould have a mock-peace; if we ſhould
be gulled in either offers of or concluſions about peace; if peace
ſhould be made our ruine, but a preparation of us for ſlaughter.
It hath been by many obſerved, that what the Engliſh gained of
the French in battell by valour,<note place="margin">Comineus lib. 4. c. 8.</note> the French regained of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
by cunning Treaties. The Lord deliver us from ſuch French
tricks. Let us all be for peace, yet ſo as not to be befooled into
bondage by the name of peace. Now God hath by his mighty
arme helped us, let us not be put off with a bable, and made to
beleeve it is this Pearle. We know with whom we have to deale.</p>
               <p>And now as the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſſ. 3. 5. The Lord direct your
hearts into the love of God:</hi> Let me adde, And into the love of
one another. Let us all ſtudy peace, ſeek peace, follow peace,
purſue peace, and the God of peace be with us.</p>
