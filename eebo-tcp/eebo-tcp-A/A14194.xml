            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And more than that, the moſt part of them finiſh their daies, not in the ſweet and calme waters, like <hi>Pourcontrells,</hi> but by a death diſſeaſoned, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in their greene youth, and flouriſhing age, by the ſtormes and tempeſts, as doe the <hi>Dolphins,</hi> within the torrents, billowes, or waues of the ſea, toſſed by diuers factions. And it ſeemeth that this fatality pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth ordinarily the moſt worthy and vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: ſo that they finiſh their liues many times with violence or precipitation; and not to goe vnto their death in a ſmooth path, but to bee interrupted with ſome ſtrange accident, which cclipſeth the bright ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning luſtre of their greatneſſe, which daſell the mindes of men, that from below beheld them ſitting aloft on the throne of Maieſtie. All which appeared moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and euidently to be true in the moſt worthy and royall Princeſſe MARY STVART Queene of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who in all her life being toſſed and turmoiled with infinite misfortunes, concluded it with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death, as followeth in the ſequell of this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of her life and death.</p>
            <p>MARY STVART Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was daughter vnto <hi>Iames</hi> the fiſt, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a wiſe and valiant Prince, and of the Lady MARY, of the Illuſtrious family of the Dukes of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> (whoſe fame for valour is renowned thorow all Chriſtendome,) was borne on the eighth day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember in the yeere of our Lord 1541. She was not aboue eight daies old when her father died: being left thus young, the Noblemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided (whereof the family of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Lynnox</hi> being the heads,) the one ſide ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth of <hi>England,</hi> and the other by the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe was by the care of her mother who inclined vnto the

               <hi>French</hi> King, at the age of ſix yeeres or thereabouts, ſent into <hi>France</hi> in the Gallies of <hi>Villagagnon</hi> a Knight of the <hi>Rhodes</hi> appointed by the <hi>French</hi> King vnto this ſeruice, in the which voyage by the Weſt Seas (for in the other paſſage neere the Straits of <hi>Calice,</hi> the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> had laid a ſtrong Nauy to intercept her) ſhe hardly eſcaped drowning by meanes of a ſtorme or tempeſt that happened, neere vnto the coaſt of little <hi>Brittaine</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where ſhe afterward tooke land, from whence ſhe was conueyed vnto the Court of <hi>France,</hi> where ſhe was brought vp vnder her Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators the <hi>French</hi> King and the Dukes of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and by their exquiſite care ſhe drew in with the aire the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the humours of the countrey, and in the end by the ſingular grace of nature, and carefulneſſe of her friends and Kinsfolks, became with her age the faireſt and goodlieſt Princeſſe of our time. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this her rare beauty, ſhe had her vnderſtanding and intendment ſo pure and perfect, her iudgement ſo certaine, ſurmounting, and aboue the condition of her age and ſex, that it bred and cauſed in her a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of courage, which was yet mixt and qualified with ſuch ſweetneſſe and modeſty, that you could not ſee any thing more Royall, any thing more gracious. Her manners and priuate actions were ſuch, and were ſo well liked of generally, that it cauſed King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond of <hi>France,</hi> and his Queene (who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for her prudence) to marry their eldeſt ſonne, <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and heire of their Crowne, vnto this Lady, as vnto one well deſeruing to be ioyned in mariage vnto their ſonne, heire apparant of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt kingdome in <hi>Europe:</hi> And ſo vpon the foure and twentieth day of <hi>April,</hi> in the yeere of our Lord 1558. <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and MARY STV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ART Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were maried in the Church

By this her mariage her husband obtained not onely the Title of King of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the right of his wife, but alſo another more rich and great, which was, of the moſt contented Prince the earth then beheld, for that hee was ioyned in mariage with a Princeſſe who beſides many other great vertues compoſed her ſelfe wholly to pleaſe and to giue content vnto her husband, and therein vſed not the ordinary care of a Princeſſe, but more trauell and ſollicitude than doe the women of meane condition and qualitie maried vnto great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as alſo appeared after his death (which befell not long after) by her immeaſurable mourning, not being able to finde any conſolation for her ſorrow in that place where ſhee had loſt that which ſhee had loued better than her ſelfe, ſo much that the amitie of her kinsfolks and allies could not retaine her, nor the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and regret of all <hi>France</hi> could not call her backe, nor the ſweetneſſe of that Court which inuited her could not ſtay her, but that ſhee would depart from thence.</p>

The Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> being vexed at this repulſe, ſent for <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> with whom ſhee had long ſpeeches about this matter, which I will briefly ſet downe out of the letters of <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> (though I ſhal make rehearſal of ſome things already ſaid) that the originall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of the priuie malice which was betweene the greateſt and wiſeſt Princeſſes of our time or age, may more euidently appeare.

Embaſſador: nothing grieueth me ſo much as that I did aske thoſe things which were not needfull: by Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour I can returne into my Countrie, without asking her leaue, as I came hither in deſpight of her brother <hi>Edward.</hi> Neither want I friends which can and will bring me home, as they brought me hither; but I had rather haue vſed her friendſhip, than of any other. I haue often heard you ſay, that the amitie betweene her and mee was neceſſary to both our Kingdomes, yet it ſeemeth that ſhee thinketh otherwiſe, or elſe ſhe had not giuen mee the repulſe in ſo ſmall a matter: but perhaps ſhee beareth more fauour vnto the <hi>Scots,</hi> which rebell againſt me, than to me the Queene of <hi>Scots,</hi> equall to her in princely royaltie, her neareſt kinſwoman, and moſt certaine heire vnto her.

vs to meaſure our ſelues with a certaine equalitie: but I forbeare compariſon, which is little better than contention, and wanteth not euill will. As for the treatie of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> it was made in the life of the King my husband, whom it was my dutie to obey in all things, and ſince that hee delaied the confirmation of the ſame, let the blame remaine in him, and not in me.</p>
               <p>After his death, the Counſellors of <hi>France</hi> left me to mine owne Counſellors, neither would mine Vncles meddle with the affaires of <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe they would not offend Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> nor the <hi>Scots.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> that be with me be priuate men, nor ſuch fit men that I ſhould aske counſell of them in ſuch great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

But ſhee determineth to ſtop my way, leſt I ſhould giue it, ſo ſhee is the cauſe that I cannot ſatisfie her; or elſe ſhee would not bee ſatisfied perhaps, for the intent that there may bee no end of diſcord betweene vs. Shee caſteth often in my teeth, that I am a young girle, as a reproach, and truly ſhe may iuſtly thinke mee an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe girle if I dealt in theſe weightie affaires, without the aduice of the Eſtates. A wife is not bound, as I haue heard, with the deeds of her husband, neither in her honour, nor in conſcience: but I doe not diſpute this thing, yet I may ſay this thing truly; I haue done nothing to my deareſt ſiſter, which I would not haue done to my ſelfe; I haue vſed all offices of courteſie and kindred, but ſhee either beleeueth not, or contemneth them: I would to God I were ſo deare to her as I am neare of bloud, for this were a pretious kinde of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. God forgiue them that ſow the ſeeds of diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene vs (if there bee any ſuch.) But thou who art an Embaſſador, tell mee in good ſooth,

for what cauſe ſhe is ſo diſpleaſed with me, who neuer hurt her hitherto either in word or deed.</p>
               <p>To theſe ſpeeches <hi>Throgmorton</hi> made anſwer. I haue no commiſſion to anſwer you, but to heare what your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, about the confirmation of the treatie of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> But if it pleaſe you to heare the cauſe of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I will lay it downe in few words (laying aſide the perſon of an Embaſſadour.) As ſoone as the Queene my Ladie and Miſtreſſe was crowned, you did vſurpe the title and armes of <hi>England,</hi> which you did not take in the reigne of Queene MARIE; Iudge you in your diſcretion if a greater wrong can bee offered vnto a Prince: Such iniuries as this, priuate men cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, much leſſe Princes.</p>
               <p>But, ſaid ſhe, my husbands father, and my husband himſelfe would haue it done, and commanded it to bee ſo. After their deceaſe, when I was at mine owne hand, I left off wholly both thoſe armes, and the title, but yet I know not how it can be any wrong to the Queene, if I alſo a Queene, whoſe Grand-mother was eldeſt ſiſter vnto <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, doe beare theſe armes, ſince others farther off than I bore them: I am ſure, <hi>Courtney</hi> Marqueſſe of <hi>Exceter,</hi> and the Ducheſſe of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> Niece vnto <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, by his younger ſiſter, did beare the armes of <hi>England,</hi> with borders for a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, by a ſpeciall fauour.</p>
               <p>When theſe things did not ſatisfie Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was fully perſwaded that ſhee put in delaies ſtill vpon ſome more hopes, ſince ſhe had not propoſed vnto the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had once or twice aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſince her husbands death, any thing about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the treatie; She being vpon her way, ſent for <hi>Throgmorton</hi> againe vnto <hi>Abbeuille,</hi> where ſhee cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly asked him, how ſhe might ſatisfie Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> in word or deed; he ſaid, by ratifying the treatie

The ſecond, of ratifying the treaty betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> was ratified by my husband and mee; neither can it bee ratified againe, when my husband is expreſſedly named in it. The Articles 3, 4, and 5. are already performed, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for warre are ceaſed. The <hi>French</hi> Souldiers are called backe out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Fortreſſe of <hi>Aymouth</hi> is demoliſhed, I haue not borne nor vſed the title nor armes of <hi>England</hi> ſince my husbands death. It is not in my power to put them out of the houſhold ſtuffe, buildings, and Letters patents through <hi>France,</hi> as it is not in my power to ſend into <hi>England</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> and <hi>Randan,</hi> who are not my ſubiects, to diſpute about the ſixth Article: And for the laſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, I hope my ſeditious ſubiects ſhall not haue cauſe to complaine of my ſeueritie. But as I perceiue, ſhe will preuent me by ſtopping my returne, that they ſhall not haue triall of my clemencie: what remaineth now in this treatie, which may be wrong to the Queene? Yet that I may giue her ſatisfaction more abundantly, I will write larger Letters of this buſineſſe with mine owne hand, though ſhee doth not vouchſafe to write backe vnto me, but by her Secretarie: But I pray you my Lord Embaſſador, doe the part of an Embaſſador, that is, rather mollifie than exaſperate the matter.</p>
               <p>But yet Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was not ſatisfied with theſe letters, in whoſe minde the iniurie for the vſing of the armes and title of <hi>England</hi> was deeply imprinted, and ſtill ſhee was afraid, leſt ſhee ſhould challenge them againe, if ſhee were not bound and tied thereto by the

confirmation of the treatie and the religion of an oath.</p>
               <p>In the meane while the Q of <hi>Scotland</hi> getting a good gale of wind, departed from <hi>Calice,</hi> and in a foggie miſt paſſing by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhips, which ſome thought were ſent to Sea to conuey her with honour; others, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Pirates, and as others ſaid, to intercept and take her, arriued ſafe in <hi>Scotland:</hi> For <hi>Iames</hi> the Baſtard very lately returning by <hi>England,</hi> had ſecretly willed Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to take her by the way, if ſhe had a deſire to prouide for Religion, and her owne ſecuritie. And <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> being glad that <hi>d'Oyſell</hi> was detained in <hi>England,</hi> perſwaded it alſo. Shee being returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> vſed her ſubiects with all courteſie, changed not their religion (though it had beene brought in by tumults) and beganne to ſettle the common wealth by enacting good Lawes: But vnto Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſhee ſent <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> with her owne, and the letters of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nobilitie, in the which ſhee promiſed all care to make and conſerue amitie with her; and requeſted that a certaine forme of peace might bee made betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that there was none more certaine, than if Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (if ſhee ſhould haue no iſſue) would declare her by the authoritie of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the next heire to ſucceed her in the Realme of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This thing ſeemed ſtrange vnto Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who looked for the confirmation of the treatie of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> promiſed by word, and by her hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: yet ſhe anſwered; <hi>As concerning the ſucceſsion, ſhee hoped the Queene of</hi> Scotland <hi>would not by violence take her Crowne away from her and her children, if ſhe had any: ſhee promiſed not to derogate any thing of her right vnto the Crowne of</hi> England, <hi>although ſhe had claimed the title and armes of</hi> England, <hi>through the too much haſtie ambition of other men, for which iniurie it was meet that</hi>

                  <hi>ſhe made ſatisfaction.

Neither did the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> thinke it ſafe to deliuer her ſelfe into the hands of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with whom ſhe had contended for the right of the Kingdome: It made her to ſtagger, and to doubt in the matter, and alſo to which ſide to incline and ſway, when ſhee heard that Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſtood openly for the Proteſtants in <hi>France:</hi> whileſt ſhe conſidered (as ſhee wrote her ſelfe) that ſhee came by her father from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bloud, and by her mother from the <hi>French,</hi> that ſhee was crowned Queene, and Dowager of <hi>France,</hi> and the moſt rightful Heire of <hi>England,</hi> and withall expected

the Kingdome thereof: That ſhee was much indebted vnto her Vncles in <hi>France,</hi> which had brought her vp, and that ſhee much deſired the loue of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ſhe feared, ſuch was her piercing vnderſtanding, leſt if ſhee ioined her ſelfe with her in a very ſtrict kinde of amitie, ſhe might procure the euill will of the <hi>French</hi> King, be abandoned by her Vncles, and loſe her dowrie out of <hi>France,</hi> by preferring the vncertaine friendſhip of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (which, to vſe her owne words, paſſed not beyond the perſon) before the certaine loue of the <hi>French.</hi> Hereupon the conference (which had beene treated of many moneths, and the Articles alſo drawne) came to nothing, eſpecially when ſhee by her letters did vtterly refuſe to come vnto the enteruiew, except ſhe might be deſigned heire apparant of <hi>England</hi> by authoritie of Parliament, or elſe bee adopted by Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to be her daughter, to lay a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a moſt certaine peace and vnion of both the Realmes, ſo often deſired. If theſe things were granted, ſhe promiſed to addict her ſelfe wholly to Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> yea, and not to reſpect and regard her Vncles the <hi>Guiſes.</hi> Alſo in theſe lettes ſhee inſinuated that ſhee vrged theſe things the more vehemently, for that ſhee had heard that many did ſecretly deuiſe to ſet in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſucceſſor, and that onely for the cauſe of Religion, though ſhee did tolerate in <hi>Scotland</hi> the Religion of the Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>But when the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> at the ſame time dealt with the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that ſhee might marrie with his ſonne <hi>Charles</hi> the Archduke, who then ſued vnto Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for mariage; Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> threatned her by <hi>Thomas Randolph,</hi> that if ſhee did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto the Cardinall (the mortall enemie of <hi>England)</hi> about that mariage, both that the amitie betweene

                  <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> might be diſſolued, and perhaps ſhe excluded from her hope of the Realme of <hi>England:</hi> and if ſhe would not miſſe thereof, ſhe in friendly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner willed her to chooſe ſuch a husband in <hi>England,</hi> in whoſe choice ſhee might principally giue her ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and then giue ſatisfaction to her owne Subiects, and alſo to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, in the conſeruation of the peace, and make the way ſmoother and plainer vnto her aſſured ſucceſſion in <hi>England,</hi> which cannot bee publiſhed and made knowne vntill it was certainly knowne whom ſhe would take to her husband.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This came to the knowledge of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and to preuent her purpoſe, ſhee declared vnto her by <hi>Randolph,</hi> that that mariage was ſo vniuerſally diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, that ſhe adiourned the Parliament againſt the will of her Councell vntill another time, leſt the Eſtates, moued vnto wrath for this cauſe, ſhould make ſome act againſt her right in ſucceſſion: which leſt it ſhould afterward come to paſſe, ſhe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her not to doe ſo, but to giue ſatisfaction vnto the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, by thinking vpon ſome other match.

The Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> (when the matter had hung thus in talke for the ſpace of two yeeres) now determined to take <hi>Darly</hi> vnto her husband, did ſuſpect that Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did not deale ſincerely with her, but that ſhe did propound this mariage for no other end and purpoſe, but that ſhee might make the firſt choice of the beſt ſuiter or wooer for her ſelfe, or elſe might marrie with better excuſe vnto <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> But the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Delegates looking alſo for their owne purpoſes, determined by one way or other to thruſt ſome obſtacle or other in any mariage, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

himſelfe, accounting himſelfe moſt ſure of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> willed <hi>Bedford</hi> ſecretly by his letters, not to vrge the matter much. And vpon this hope it is thought he fauored <hi>Darly</hi> in ſecret.</p>

               <p>IN the meane time <hi>Darly</hi> got leaue with much adoe to goe into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to ſtay there three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, by the earneſt and humble ſuit his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made vnto Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> vnder the colour, that he might bee preſent at the reſtoring of his father: and ſo he came vnto <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> in the moneth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruarie. He was a young man, of perſonage moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of an Empire, of a comely ſtature, of a moſt milde nature, and ſweet behauiour. As ſoone as the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſaw him, ſhe fell in loue with him, and to couer her loue ſhe talked now and then with <hi>Randolfe</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadour in <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and at the ſame time ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> for a diſpenſation, becauſe <hi>Darly</hi> and ſhee were ſo neere of kinne, that a diſpenſation was neceſſary by the Canon Lawes.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18326:17"/>
Romane Religion againe, and that many would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline vnto them, vpon the certaintie of their ſucceſſion comming of this mariage, and others out of the loue vnto the Romane Religion, and foraſmuch as they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that moſt of the Iuſtices of Peace were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted vnto it. To preuent theſe things, they thought it moſt neceſſarie, firſt to winne the Queenes good will, to marrie ſpeedily ſome husband, that out of the certaintie of ſucceſſion by her and her iſſue, and from none other, the affaires and hopes of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men might depend, for they feared that if the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> maried firſt, and had iſſue, the moſt of the people would incline and bend toward her ſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the certaintie of the ſucceſſion and ſecuritie. Secondly, that the profeſſion of the Romane Religion ſhould bee infringed, or weakened, as much as might be: and that of the reformed, diligently aduanced and eſtabliſhed; this by dealing more moderately with ſome hot ſpirited Proteſtants about things indifferent; and the other, by calling in the depriued Biſhops vnto their priſons (for they had beene diſperſed into the Countries in the time of the great plague) by giuing vnto the Biſhops more ample authoritie, to exerciſe the Eccleſiaſtical lawes againſt that terrifying bugge of the Premunire, (which the Lawyers obiected againſt them) by ſuppreſſing bookes comming from the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries into <hi>England,</hi> ſet out by <hi>Harding,</hi> and the Diuines that were fled ouer the Seas, by remouing away certaine <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Prieſts that lurked in <hi>England;</hi> by depriuing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fugitiues of their Eccleſiaſticall liuings, which they enioyed vntill this time; by compelling the Iudges of the land, who for the moſt part were Papiſts, to take the oath of Supremacie. But to diſturbe the mariage with <hi>Darly,</hi> it was thought beſt to put them in feare, by muſtering Souldiers vpon the borders
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18326:18"/>
toward <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by putting a greater Garriſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Barwicke:</hi> that the Counteſſe of <hi>Lennox</hi> mother to <hi>Darly,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> her ſonne ſhould be committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Priſon: the Earle of <hi>Lennox,</hi> and <hi>Darly</hi> his ſonne, ſhould be recalled out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> vpon paine to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit all their goods, before that any league could bee made by them with the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spaine:</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> enemies to the mariage, ſhould be maintained, and <hi>Catharine Gray,</hi> with the Earle of <hi>Hertfort,</hi> ſhould be receiued into ſome fauour, of whom as of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor in the ſucceſſion of the Kingdome, ſhee ſeemed ſomewhat to bee afraid.

                  </gap>uſtrate of his hope, returning thorow <hi>England,</hi> in a rage and furie put into their heads, that if they deſired or had a care of the preſeruation of Religion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the tranquillitie of <hi>England,</hi> and ſecuritie of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they ſhould hinder the returne of the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by one meanes or other. Yet ſhee arriued ſafe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> paſſing by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet in a thicke miſt, and vſing her brother with all courteſie, commended the gouernment of all the affaires into his hands.</p>
               <p>Yet theſe things did not cut off the branches of his ambition, which daily ſprang out, both in words and deeds: For neither could he containe himſelfe, but that oftentimes amongſt his friends he would lament, that the warlike <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation, no leſſe than that of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, was ſubiected to the gouernment of a woman, and out of the doctrine of <hi>Knox</hi> (whom hee accounted as a Patriarke) hee would often diſcourſe that Kingdomes were due vnto vertue, not vnto kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: That women were to bee excluded from the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Kingdomes; and that their rule was mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous. Hee dealt alſo with the Queene by his friends, that ſhe would ſubſtitute ſome out of the familie of the <hi>Stewarts,</hi> who if ſhe died without iſſue, ſhould ſucceed one after another in the Kingdome; and not to haue any regard whether they were legitimate or illegitimate, hoping that he ſhould be one of them, being a Kings ſonne, although illegitimate. But the Queene, when ſhe out of her wiſdome weighed, that ſuch a ſubſtitution was a thing contrary to the Lawes of the Land, and would be a wrong vnto the right heires, a moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious example, and perillous alſo for the ſubſtitutes themſelues, yea and a barre vnto her to keepe her from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18326:22"/>
mariage againe. She anſwered mildly, that ſhe would take deliberation in the matter, and conſult with the Eſtates of the Realme about it. And to ſhew herſelfe courteous and bountifull to her brother, ſhe created him Earle of <hi>Marre,</hi> and afterward Earle of <hi>Murrey</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Marre</hi> was in controuerſie) and aduanced him to an honourable mariage: All this ſhee did, being all this while ignorant that hee affected the Kingdome, (bragging that he was the lawfull ſonne of <hi>Iames</hi> the fift.) And to make the way thereunto, he through the fauourwherein hee ſtood with the Queene, oppreſſed the moſt noble familie of the <hi>Gordons,</hi> who had very many vaſſals, tenants and retainers, whom hee feared much, both in reſpect of himſelfe, and of their religion: And baniſhed from the Court the Duke of <hi>Chaſteaule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> (who was accounted the next heire to the Crowne) impriſoned the Earle of <hi>Arran</hi> his ſonne, baniſhed <hi>Bothwell</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and put all them that he thought might croſſe him, out of office: And he as a Guardian kept the Queene as his Ward, and at his command, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt carefull and diligent to keepe her from mariage.</p>
               <p>And as ſoone as he vnderſtood, that on the one ſide the Emperour ſued to her for his brother, and the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> for his ſonne; he diſſwaded her vtterly from them both: becauſe (forſooth) the libertie of <hi>Scotland</hi> would not, nor could not endure a forraigne Prince. And whenſoeuer that gouernment deſcended vnto women, that they maried no other husbands, but of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation: But afterwards, when all the <hi>Scots</hi> generally wiſhed to ſee her maried, and hee found out that the Counteſſe of <hi>Lennox</hi> had ſo prouidently wrought, that ſhee inclined to marrie <hi>Darly;</hi> hee alſo commended him as a good husband for her, hoping the young man, being of a ſoft nature, would be ruled
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18326:23"/>
by him in all things. Yet when hee ſaw the Queene to loue <hi>Darly</hi> exceedingly, and he himſelfe to grow out of her fauour, hee repented him of his counſell hee had giuen, and willed Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to hinder her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by one meanes or other.</p>
               <p>The mariage being made vp, and <hi>Darly</hi> proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med King, when the Queene reuoked the donations made to him and others, againſt the Lawes in her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie; hee with other, put himſelfe in armes againſt the King; alleadging, that the new King was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie vnto the Religion of the Proteſtants; and that he was maried without the conſent of the Queene of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But hee fled into <hi>England</hi> (as I haue already ſaid) neuer aduenturing to fight: And being fruſtrate of all hope of helpe from thence, hee dealt by letters with <hi>Mourton,</hi> a profound ſubtill man, who was as his other ſelfe, that ſince the mariage could not bee diſſolued, yet that the loue betweene the parties might be broken by ſome ſecret deuices: and a fit occaſion offered it ſelfe; for ſhe vpon the ariſing of ſome priuate diſcontent, to keepe vnder the ſwelling minde of the young man, and to conſerue her royall authoritie whole to her ſelfe, had begunne to ſet her husbands name laſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations and Records, and to omit it vtterly in the coine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mourton</hi> being a cunning man to breed diſcontents, with his flattering words crept into the Kings good liking and opinion, and then perſwaded him to take vpon him the Crowne of the Realme, yea, in deſpight of the Queene, and to make himſelfe free from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of women; for that it is the condition of women, ſaid he, to obey, and of men to rule. By this counſell, if it were taken, he hoped not onely to draw away the loue of the Queene, but of all the Nobilitie and commons alſo from the King, to eſtrange the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18326:23"/>
Queene, and with diuers ſlanders firſt heartened the King to murther <hi>Dauid Rizius a Piedmountoys,</hi> leſt that politike fellow ſhould preuent their purpoſes (this man was a Muſitian by profeſſion, and came the laſt yeere with <hi>Moret</hi> the Embaſſador of <hi>Sauoy;</hi> and by the Queene for his wit and dexteritie receiued into her houſhold and fauour, and preferred to write her <hi>French</hi> letters, and vnto her priuie Councell in the abſence of the Secretarie.) Then to eſtrange her loue the more, he perſwaded the King to bee preſent at the murder, with <hi>Ruthen</hi> and the reſt, who ruſhing together with him in to the Queenes dining Parlour, at ſupper time (ſhee ſitting at the table with the Counteſſe of <hi>Argile)</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the fellow with their naked ſwords, as he taſted meat taken from the Queenes table, at the Cupbord (as the ſeruants of the priuie Chamber vſe to doe) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her face, being great with childe, trembling with feare, ſetting a Piſtoll at her breaſt; ſo that ſhee was in danger of abortion, and dragged him into the vtter Chamber, where they moſt cruelly killed him, and ſhut vp the Queene into a Parlour: <hi>Mourton</hi> all this while guarding all the paſſages.</p>
               <p>This murther was committed the euening before the day appointed vnto <hi>Murrey</hi> to appeare for his triall in the aſſembly of the Eſtates for his rebellion, who came in on the next day, when no body expected him, and no man appeared againſt him in that troubleſome time: So that it may ſeeme that the murder of <hi>Dauid</hi> was haſtened of ſet purpoſe to procure the ſecuritie and ſafety of <hi>Murrey.</hi> Yet the Queene at the earneſt ſuit of the King, receiued him courteouſly, and continued in brotherly loue towards him. But the King when he conſidered the enormitie of the offence (and ſeeing now the Queene to bee very angry) repented his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in humble manner ſubmitted himſelfe vnto
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18326:24"/>
her clemencie, weeping and lamenting, and asking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, did ingenuouſly confeſſe, that he committed that hainous offence by the inſtigation of <hi>Murrey</hi> and <hi>Mourton:</hi> and from thenceforth did ſo hate <hi>Murrey,</hi> (for <hi>Mourton, Ruthen,</hi> and others, were fled into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> vpon the murther, with the commendatorie let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Murrey</hi> vnto <hi>Bedford)</hi> that hee deuiſed to kill him. But when out of wrath and raſhneſſe, hee could not conceale his purpoſe, nor (ſuch was his reſpect vnto the Queene his wife) durſt execute it; he told her how profitable it would bee for the common-wealth, and alſo for the ſecuritie of the royall familie, if <hi>Murrey</hi> were rid out of the way. She deteſting the thing, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified him euen with threats, from ſuch enterpriſes, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in hope of reconciliation. Yet hee when hee ſaw, to his hearts griefe, the Baſtard to be of ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the Queene, out of his impatience hee plotted the ſame matter with others; which when it came to the eares of <hi>Murrey,</hi> to preuent him, vnder colour of dutie, hee laieth cloſer ſnares for the young man, vſing <hi>Mourton</hi> (though abſent) for his counſellor.</p>
               <p>They thought it requiſite aboue all things, vtterly to auert the Queenes minde from the King; and by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie to induce <hi>Bothwell,</hi> lately reconciled vnto <hi>Murrey,</hi> and in great fauour with the Queene, into their ſocietie, ſhewing him a hope to be diuorced from his wife, and to marrie with the Queene, as ſoone as ſhe was widow. And for the performance of theſe things, and alſo to defend him againſt all perſons, they bound themſelues vnder their hands and ſeales, being perſwaded, if the matter hit right, that they might by one labour kill the King, vtterly diſcredit the Queene amongſt the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and Commons, vndoe <hi>Bothwell</hi> vtterly, and bring the gouernment of all the affaires vnto their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bothwell</hi> being a lewd minded man, blinded with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18326:24"/>
ambition, and therefore venturous to attempt, quickly laid hold on the hope offered vnto him, and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly committed the murther. But <hi>Murrey</hi> had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly gone home a prettie way off, fifteene houres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he might no way be ſuſpected; and that hee might from thence giue aid vnto the Conſpirators, when any need was, and all the ſuſpition might light vpon the Queene. As ſoone as hee returned vnto the Court, both he and the Conſpirators commended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her <hi>Bothwell,</hi> as moſt worthy of her loue, for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of his familie, his valour ſhewed againſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and his approued fidelitie. They put in her head, that ſhee being alone and ſolitarie, was not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the tumults that were raiſed, preuent ſecret plots, and vphold the burthen and heauie weight of the Kingdome. Therefore ſhe might doe well to take as a Companion of her bed, counſell, and danger, the man that could, would, and durſt oppoſe himſelfe againſt all trouble. And they draue and enforced her ſo farre, that the fearefull woman, daunted with two tragicall murthers, and remembring the fidelitie and conſtancie of <hi>Bothwell</hi> towards her and her mother, and hauing no other friend vnto whom to reſort, but vnto her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fidelitie, gaue her conſent: Yet vpon theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that aboue all this, prouiſion might bee made for the ſafetie of her little ſonne; and then, that <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> as well might bee cleered from the murther of the King, as alſo from the bond of his former mariage.</p>
               <p>What <hi>George</hi> Earle of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile,</hi> men of great Nobilitie in <hi>Scotland,</hi> did forthwith proteſt of this matter, I thinke good to ſet downe in this place, out of the originall, with their owne hands, ſent vnto Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which I haue ſeene. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as Murrey and others, to cloake their rebellion againſt the Queene (whoſe authoritie they vſurpe) doe</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:18326:25"/>
                  <hi>ſlander her openly, as priuie and conſenting vnto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death: Wee doe publikely proteſt and ſweare theſe things. In the Moneth of December, in the yeere of our Lord God one thouſand fiue hundred fiftie and ſix, when the Queene lay at</hi> Cragmyller, Murrey <hi>and</hi> Liding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>did acknowledge before vs, That</hi> Mourton, Lyndſey, <hi>and</hi> Ruthen <hi>killed</hi> Dauid Rizio, <hi>for no other end, but to procure the ſafetie of</hi> Murrey, <hi>who was to bee attainted at the ſame time. Therefore leſt they ſhould bee vnthankfull, they wiſhed that</hi> Mourton <hi>and the reſt, baniſhed for the death of</hi> Dauid, <hi>might bee brought home againe: And this they inſinuated could not be done, except the Queene were ſeparated by a diuorce from the King, which they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to effect, if wee would grant our conſents. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> Murrey <hi>promiſed vnto me</hi> George <hi>Earle of</hi> Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, <hi>the reſtitution of my ancient Patrimonie, and perpetuall fauour of the baniſhed men, if I would fauour the diuorce. Then they went vnto</hi> Bothwell, <hi>that hee ſhould conſent thereunto. Laſtly, we came vnto the Queene, and</hi> Liding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>in all our names beſought her exceedingly to remit the ſentence of exile againſt</hi> Mourton, Lyndſey <hi>and</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: <hi>He exaggerated the faults and crimes of the King with bitter words; and ſhewed, that it was much for the good and benefit of the Queene and the Common-wealth, that a diuorce were ſpeedily ſued out: foraſmuch as the King and ſhe could not liue together with ſecuritie in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <hi>She anſwered, ſhe had rather depart into</hi> France, <hi>and liue priuately for a time, vntill her husband acknowledged his faults: for ſhe would haue nothing to be done that ſhould be wrong to her ſonne, or diſhonour vnto her ſelfe. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto</hi> Lidington <hi>replied, ſaying: Wee that are of your Councell will prouide for that. But I command you (ſaid ſhe) not to doe any thing which may bee a blemiſh to my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or a ſtaine to my conſcience. Let things be as they be, vntill God aboue doe remedie it: That which you thinke may</hi>

                  <hi>be good for mee, may proue euill. Vnto whom</hi> Lidington <hi>ſaid, Commit the matter vnto vs, and you ſhall ſee nothing done but that which is good, and that which ſhall be allowed in the Parliament. Hereupon, ſince that within a few daies after, the King was moſt ſhamefully murdered; Wee out of the inward teſtimonie of our conſcience, are moſt aſſured, that</hi> Murrey <hi>and</hi> Lidington <hi>were the authors and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this murder of the King, whoſoeuer were the actors of the ſame.</hi> Thus much <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Argile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Conſpirators applied all their skill that <hi>Bothwell</hi> might be cleared of killing the King: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without delay, the Parliament is ſummoned for no other cauſe, and Proclamations are ſet out to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the perſons ſuſpected for murdering the King. And when <hi>Lennox,</hi> father to the murdered King, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and charged <hi>Bothwell</hi> as the Regicide, and was very importunate that <hi>Bothwell</hi> might bee brought to triall before the Parliament began: This alſo was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and <hi>Lennox</hi> commanded to come in with his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation within twentie daies. On which day, when hee heard nothing from the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> and could not bee preſent in the Citie full of his enemies, without danger of his life; <hi>Bothwell</hi> was brought to the Barre, and arraigned, and acquitted by the ſentence of the Iudges; <hi>Mourton</hi> alſo vpholding and maintaining his cauſe, and openly taking his part.</p>
               <p>This buſineſſe being finiſhed, the Conſpirators wrought ſo, that the moſt of the Nobilitie gaue their conſent vnto the mariage, vnder their hands and ſeales, leſt he (fruſtrated of the promiſed mariage) ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach them as contriuers of the murder. But of this mariage of the Queene with <hi>Bothwell</hi> (who was created Duke of the <hi>Orkeneis)</hi> the ſuſpition increaſed with all men, that the Queene was conſenting to the Kings death: which the Conſpirators increaſed by letters ſent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18326:26"/>
into all places, and in their ſecret meetings at <hi>Dunkelden</hi> they conſpired forthwith to kill <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and depriue the Queene: Yet <hi>Murrey,</hi> that hee might be thought cleere of this conſpiracie, obtained leaue of the Queene (but hardly) to trauell into <hi>France.</hi> And that he might put all diffidence out of her head, hee commended all his affaires and eſtate in <hi>Scotland,</hi> vnto the fidelitie of the Queene and <hi>Bothwell.</hi> Hee was ſcarce gone out of <hi>England,</hi> but behold the ſame men which had cleered and acquitted <hi>Bothwell</hi> from the murder, and conſented vnto the mariage vnder their hands and ſeales, tooke vp armes againſt <hi>Bothwell,</hi> as meaning to apprehend him: And indeed they ſecretly willed him to ſaue himſelfe by flight, for no other intent, but that hee ſhould not be taken, and diſcouer all their plot, and withall, that they might lay hold of. his flight, as an argument or reaſon to accuſe the Queene of killing the King. But ſhee being taken, they vſed her moſt contumeliouſly, and in moſt vnſeemely faſhion, and putting on her an old cloake, thruſt her into priſon at <hi>Lochleuyn,</hi> vnder the cuſtodie of the mother of <hi>Murrey,</hi> who had beene the Concubine of <hi>Iames</hi> the fift, who moſt malapertly inſulted ouer the calamitie of the impriſoned Queene, boaſting that ſhee her ſelfe was the lawfull wife of <hi>Iames</hi> the fift, and that her ſonne <hi>Murrey</hi> was his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iſſue.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> vnderſtood theſe things, in her minde deteſting this barbarous inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Subiects (whom ſhe called oftentimes Traitors, Rebels, vnthankfull and cruell fellowes) againſt a Princeſſe, her ſiſter, and neighbour; She ſent <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to expoſtulate with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators for this inſolencie vſed againſt their Queene, and to take ſome courſe how to reſtore her into her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer libertie, and for the ſeuere puniſhment of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18326:26"/>
of the King; and that the young King might be ſent into <hi>England,</hi> that order might bee taken for his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, and not ſent into <hi>France.</hi> And what I ſhall hereafter declare (during his abode in <hi>Scotland)</hi> take yee vpon the credit of his letters, which is approued.</p>
               <p>He found the moſt part in <hi>Scotland</hi> incenſed againſt the Queene, who in plaine termes denied acceſſe vnto her, both to him, and alſo to <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Crocus</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors. Yet could not the Conſpirators agree among themſelues what to doe with her: <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> and a few others would haue her to be reſtored vpon theſe conditions: That the murderers of the King ſhould bee puniſhed according to Law; The Princes ſafetie prouided for; <hi>Bothwell</hi> diuorced, and Religion eſtabliſhed. Others would haue her to bee baniſhed for euer into <hi>France,</hi> or into <hi>England:</hi> So as the King of <hi>France</hi> or Queene of <hi>England,</hi> did giue their words, that ſhe ſhould reſigne the Kingdome, and transferre all her authoritie vnto her ſonne and certaine Noble men. Others were of opinion, that ſhee ſhould be arraigned publikely, and condemned vnto perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all priſon, and her ſonne crowned King: Laſtly, others would haue her depriued both of her life and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by a publike execution. And this <hi>Knox</hi> and ſome Miniſters of the Word, thundered out of their Pulpits.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Throgmorton</hi> out of the holy Scriptures brought many places to proue, <hi>that obedience was to bee yeelded vnto the higher powers, that carry the ſword:</hi> And wittily argued, <hi>that the Queene was not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the iudgement of any, but onely of the celeſtiall Iudge: That ſhe could not be arraigned or brought to triall before any Iudge on the earth: And that there is no Magiſtrate had any authoritie in</hi> Scotland, <hi>which is not deriued from the authoritie of the Queene, and reuocable at her pleaſure.</hi> They oppoſed the peculiar Law of the Kingdome, among

               <p>On the twentieth day after the reſignation, <hi>Murrey</hi> himſelfe returned out of <hi>France;</hi> and the third day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he with many of the Conſpirators came vnto the Queene, againſt whom hee laid many hainous crimes, and perſwaded her to turne vnto God by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to aske mercie of him. She ſhewed her ſelfe ſorrowfull for the ſinnes of her former life, ſhe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome things hee obiected, others ſhee extenuated, others ſhee excuſed by humane frailtie, and the moſt matters ſhee vtterly denied. Shee required him to take vpon him the gouernment of the affaires for her ſonne, and required him earneſtly to ſpare her life, and her reputation. He ſaid, it lay not in his power, but it was to bee ſought for of the States of the Realme; yet if ſhee deſired to haue her life and honour ſaued, hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed theſe things for her to keepe: That ſhe ſhould not trouble nor diſturbe the tranquillitie of the Realme; That ſhe ſhould not ſteale out of priſon, nor moue the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> or the King of <hi>France,</hi> to vex <hi>Scotland</hi> with forraigne or ciuill warre; That ſhe ſhould not loue <hi>Bothwell</hi> any more, or deuiſe to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge on the enemies of <hi>Bothwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Regent being proclaimed, bound himſelfe by his hand and ſeale, to doe nothing concerning peace or

warre, the perſon of the King or his mariage, or the libertie of the Queene, without the conſent of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators. Hee willed <hi>Throgmorton</hi> by <hi>Lidington,</hi> not to intreat any more for the Queene; for that hee and the reſt had rather endure all things, than that ſhe being freed, ſhould keepe <hi>Bothwell</hi> companie, bring her ſonne into danger, her Countrie into trouble, and alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them. We know (ſaid he) what you <hi>Engliſh</hi> men can doe by warre: You may waſte our borders, and we may yours; &amp; we know aſſuredly, that the <hi>French</hi> men in regard of our ancient league, will not abandon and forſake vs. He denied alſo <hi>Ligneroll</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, to haue acceſſe vnto the Queene, vntill <hi>Bothwell</hi> was taken; and euery day hee vſed the diſtreſſed Queene worſe and worſe, whereas ſhee had deſerued well at his hands, and contrary to his promiſe hee had made vnto the King of <hi>France.</hi> Thus much out of the Letters of <hi>Throgmorton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly after, <hi>Murrey</hi> put to death <hi>Iohn Hepborne, Paris</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man, <hi>Dagliſh,</hi> and the other ſeruants of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who had beene preſent at the Kings death: But they (which <hi>Murrey</hi> little expected) at the Gallowes proteſted before God and the Angels, that they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Bothwell,</hi> that <hi>Murrey</hi> and <hi>Mourton</hi> were the authors of killing the King, and cleered the Queene from all ſuſpition; as <hi>Bothwell</hi> himſelfe priſoner in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> all his life time, and at his death, did with many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oathes and religious proteſtations, affirme, that the Queene was not priuie nor conſenting to it. And fourteene yeeres after, when <hi>Mourton</hi> was to ſuffer death, hee confeſſed, that <hi>Bothwell</hi> dealt with him to conſent vnto the murder of the King, which when he vtterly denied, except the Queene did command it vnder her hand; To that <hi>Bothwell</hi> did anſwer, that could not be done, but that the deed muſt bee done without her knowledge.</p>

Hereupon ſuch a multitude

came vnto her from all places in a day or two, as ſhee had an armie of ſix thouſand valiant men, which yet <hi>Murrey</hi> eaſily put to flight, becauſe they were ſo fierce, and would not bee ordered in the fight.

Shee hauing receiued this anſwer, and the acceſſe denied, both by her Letters, and alſo by <hi>Maxwell</hi> Lord <hi>Herris,</hi> ſhee earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her, <hi>That ſhee might as well ſhew the iniuries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by her, as alſo cleare her ſelfe of the crimes obiected againſt her in her preſence: That it was moſt iuſt that Queene</hi> ELIZABETH <hi>her neareſt kinſwoman of bloud ſhould heare her in her preſence, being baniſhed; and alſo reſtore her vnto her Kingdome, againſt thoſe whom being baniſhed for their villanies committed, ſhee had reſtored vnto their eſtates, at the interceſsion of Queene</hi> ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, <hi>and that to her owne deſtruction, except it were ſpeedily auerted. Therefore ſhe humbly requeſted, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhee might bee admitted to her ſpeech, and holpen, or that ſhe might ſpeedily bee permitted with her leaue and fauour to depart out of</hi> England, <hi>to craue helpe from ſome other place, and not to be detained any longer like a priſoner in the Caſtle of</hi> Carlile; <hi>foraſmuch as ſhee came volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily into</hi> England, <hi>truſting on her loue, oftentimes promiſed by Letters, Meſſengers, and tokens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Through theſe letters, and the words of <hi>Herris,</hi> Queene ELIZABETH ſeemed (for who can reach into the ſecret cogitations of Princes? and wiſe people

conceale to themſelues their owne purpoſes) from her heart to haue compaſſion of this Princeſſe her kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being in very great diſtreſſe; who was taken by her Subiects by force, thruſt into priſon, brought into danger of her life, condemned, and yet neuer heard ſpeake in her owne defence (which is neuer denied to a priuate man) and had fled into <hi>England</hi> vnto her vpon an aſſured hope of helpe and reliefe. Moreouer, ſhe was much moued, that the diſtreſſed Queene had volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily offered, to haue her cauſe argued and diſputed of before her, and had taken vpon her to proue her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries guiltie of all the crimes whereof they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed her, who was innocent.</p>
               <p>Whether the pittie of Queene ELIZABETH was vnfained or not, is not knowne: But certaine it is, the Councellors of <hi>England</hi> did enter into a mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, what ſhould be done with her: If ſhe ſhould be kept ſtill in <hi>England,</hi> they feared, that ſhe which had an alluring eloquence, would daily draw to her part many more to fauour the right ſhee pretended vnto the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> who would kindle her ambition, and leaue nothing vnattempted to purchaſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for her. That forraigne Embaſſadors would helpe and aſſiſt her purpoſes; and that then the <hi>Scots</hi> would not faile her, when they ſaw ſuch a faire prey. Moreouer, the fidelitie of keepers was vncertaine, and if ſhe ſhould die in <hi>England</hi> by ſickneſſe, it would giue occaſion of ſlander, and the Queene ſhould bee vexed and turmoiled euery day with new moleſtations. If ſhee ſhould bee ſent into <hi>France,</hi> they feared, leſt her Coſens the <hi>Guiſes</hi> would againe purſue the right and claime ſhee made vnto <hi>England,</hi> vpon a conceit and opinion that ſhe could doe much in <hi>England</hi> with ſome for Religions ſake, with others by the probabilitie of the right, whereof I ſpeake; and with many vpon a

mad deſire of innouation. Beſides that, the friendſhip betweene <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> which is very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, might be broken, and the ancient league betweene <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> renewed; which might be more dangerous than in former times, when <hi>Burgundy</hi> was tied vnto <hi>England</hi> in a ſtricter league than at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; <hi>England</hi> hauing now no aſſured friends but the <hi>Scots.</hi> If ſhee ſhould be ſent backe into <hi>Scotland,</hi> they feared leſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> faction ſhould bee put out of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, the <hi>French</hi> faction raiſed to the gouernment of affaires, the young Prince expoled vnto danger, the Religion in <hi>Scotland</hi> changed, the <hi>French</hi> and other forrainers brought in, <hi>Ireland</hi> more vexed and annoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Iriſh Scots,</hi> and ſhe her ſelfe brought into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of her life by her aduerſaries at home.

               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the Lord <hi>Herris</hi> humbly beſought the Queene, not to beleeue raſhly any thing againſt the truth, againſt the Queene vnheard, and that in <hi>Scotland</hi>

                  <hi>Murrey</hi> ſhould not precipitate the Parlament, to the preiudice of the expulſed Queene, and to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good Subiects. Which though ſhee vrged excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, yet <hi>Murrey</hi> in the Kings name, held the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, attainted many that ſtood for the Queene, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and deſtroied their houſes and poſſeſſions.

And howſoeuer they had forgotten the dutie and allegeance of Subiects toward their Princeſſe, yet ſhe could not forget any duty or office of good will and pietie towards her ſiſter and neighbour Queene.

And withall, willed him not to ſell away the Queenes apparell and precious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, though the Eſtates had permitted the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Murrey</hi> did as ſhe willed him, ſince he had depended vpon no other place, but onely vpon <hi>England,</hi> for this courſe of his fickle gouernment, and the Noblemen of the Realme refuſed to bee ſent on that meſſage. To <hi>Yorke</hi> therefore (the place appointed for the meeting) came hee himſelfe and ſeuen of his deareſt and moſt familiar friends, as Commiſſioners for the King infant, namely, <hi>Iames</hi> Earle of <hi>Mourton, Adam</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Robert</hi> Commendator of <hi>Dunfermellin, Patricke</hi>

The ſame very day came thither <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolke, Thomas Ratcliff,</hi> Earle of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> a little before made Preſident of the North, and Sir <hi>Ralph Sadleir</hi> Knight, one of the priuie Councell, appointed Commiſſioners, to heare the cauſe of the depriuation, for the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (who tooke it moſt vnkindly that Queene ELIZABETH would not heare her to ſpeake, and yet commanded her Subiects to be heard againſt her, before Commiſſioners; foraſmuch as ſhee being an abſolute Prince, could not be bound to anſwer but at pleaſure, vnto her Subiects accuſing her.)

               <p>The Commiſſioners of the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> (for the firſt place of honour was giuen vnto them) before they tooke the oath, proteſted although the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> was content that the cauſes betweene her and her rebellious Subiects ſhould be argued in the preſence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, yet that ſhee did not therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her ſelfe to bee ſubiect to any, or vnder the rule of any, being as ſhe is, a free Prince, and vaſſall and holding of none.

                  <hi>diſapproue the mariage, ſo much as in word, vntill they had by faire words enticed the Captaine of the Caſtle of</hi> Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, <hi>and the Prouoſt of the Towne vnto their ſide: For then late in the night, aſſaulted they the Caſtle of</hi> Borth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke <hi>(where the Queene lay) and when ſhe, by the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the night, eſcaped, forthwith they leuied an armie vnder the pretence to defend the Queene, and met her going towards</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>with Banners diſplaied, ready to fight; and by</hi> Grange, <hi>whom they ſent before, they willed her to ſend away</hi> Bothwell <hi>from her companie, vntill hee ſhould be brought to triall: which ſhe to auoid the effuſion of bloud, willingly did.

And whereas they charge her to haue vſed them with rough and rigorous words; it is no wonder, ſince they being her ſubiects, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſworne their allegeance vnto her, had vſed her more rudely and vilely than becommeth any to vſe the Maieſtie of a Prince.

In that they ſay ſhee voluntarily made a reſignation of the Kingdome, for that ſhe was wearied with moleſtations in the gouernment, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vntrue; foraſmuch as ſhe was not outworne or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied by age, nor weake by ſickneſſe, hut both in minde and body able to diſcharge the moſt weightie matters of Eſtate. But this is moſt certaine, that the Earle of</hi> Athold, Tulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardin <hi>and</hi> Lidington <hi>(who were alſo of their counſell) did will her to ſubſcribe vnto the Letters Patents of the reſignation, that ſhe might auoid death, aſſuredly intended,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:18326:34"/>
                  <hi>and that this would be no wrong nor barre to the priſoner, or her heires; foraſmuch as priſon is</hi> a iuſt feare, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made by a priſoner <hi>(by the opinion of the Lawyers)</hi> is of no force, and vtterly void. <hi>And that</hi> Nicholas Throgmorton <hi>did perſwade her to the ſame, by a ſchedule written with his owne hand, whom ſhe alſo requeſted to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie vnto the Queene of</hi> England, <hi>that ſhe had ſubſcribed by coaction, and againſt her will. Moreouer, that</hi> Lindſey <hi>when he brought the Letters Patents of the Ceſsion to bee ſubſcribed, threatned her with death, and draue her by force to ſubſcribe vnto it, which ſhee neuer read, the teares run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning downe from her eies. And that the Lord of the Caſtle of</hi> Lochleuyn <hi>refuſed to ſubſigne it as a witneſſe, becauſe he ſaw and knew for certaine, that ſhee ſubſcribed againſt her will. Alſo that reſignation and renunciation is moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, in which nothing is aſsigned vnto her, whereon ſhee may liue, nor libertie granted, nor ſecuritie of life promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. So that to men of indifferencie ſuch like vniuſt reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation cannot ſeeme to preiudice her royall Maieſtie; which as ſoone as ſhe was free at libertie, openly declared, ſhe did it by compulſion, making a Declaratorie thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many Noblemen of the Realme. Neither ought thoſe things which they brag they did by the authoritie of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be any preiudice vnto the Queene; for where in the Parlaments of</hi> Scotland <hi>about an hundred Earles, Biſhops, and Barons haue their voices, in this tumultuarie Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there were preſent no more but foure Earles, one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop onely, one or two Abbots, and ſix Barons; and of that ſmall number, ſome did put in a proteſtation, that nothing ſhould be done to the wrong of the Queene, or her ſucceſſors, becauſe ſhe was a captiue. Neither were the Embaſſadors of</hi> England <hi>nor</hi> France <hi>admitted to know of her, whether ſhe reſigned her Kingdome voluntarily, although they made earneſt ſuit ſundry times.

                  <hi>it is moſt apparant, that impietie did neuer reigne more, and with leſſe controlment, in throwing downe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ruinating worſhipfull families, and afflicting the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable commonaltie.

               <p>When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners had heard theſe things, they required that <hi>Murrey</hi> ſhould produce and proue more ſound cauſes of this great ſeueritie vſed againſt an abſolute Queene: Foraſmuch as whatſoeuer had beene hitherto ſhewed, was not ſtrengthened with witneſſe, but with letters of ſmall credit, and <hi>Lidington</hi> had inſinuated that hee had oftentimes counterfeited the Queenes hand.

vnworthy perſon with her little ſonne, of all her right of ſucceſſion in <hi>England.</hi> And hee thought hee had thereby eſcaped two perils; for he feared, if he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt her, hee ſhould doe againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and vndoe her for euer; and if hee ſpake for her, leſt hee ſhould incurre the implacable indignation of the Queene, and the hate of all them that loued her not for Religions ſake.</p>
               <p>But whereas at that time the affaires of <hi>Scotland</hi> were much troubled by the friends of the expulſed Queene, and the preſence of <hi>Murrey</hi> was needfull there; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his accuſation before the Queene, <hi>Bacon</hi> Keeper of the great Seale, the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Arundell, Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter, Clinton,</hi> Lord Admirall, <hi>William Cecill,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Sadleir</hi> Commiſſioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by new Letters Patents; and produced Articles ſtanding vpon coniectures, the teſtimonies of ſome men, and the decrees made in the Parlament, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially certaine amatorie Epiſtles and Verſes written (as he ſaid) with the Queenes hand, to proue her priuie to the death of her husband, and <hi>Buchanans</hi> booke (called the <hi>Detection)</hi> hee gaue them to reade, which was of ſmall credit with the greater part of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, becauſe hee was one of that ſide, and wonne by money to write. But as for the Epiſtles and Verſes (which wanted names, ſubſcriptions, and notation of the time; ſince that, there bee euery where many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which can ſo cunningly imitate and counterfeit other mens hands, that hardly the true can be knowne from the falſe) Queene ELIZABETH gaue ſmall credit, though there was womanly priuie hatred (which carrieth away that ſex farre from the right) betweene them, and ſhee was well content that ſome blot of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by this accuſation was left, and remained on the Queene of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:18326:35"/>
But when her Commiſſioners heard that ſhee was contumeliouſly accuſed by <hi>Murrey,</hi> they were moſt ready to anſwer; but ſhee (being ſecretly inſtructed by many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lawyers, that it was lawfull ſo to doe; foraſmuch as the former authoritie and Commiſſion giuen to the <hi>Duke</hi> and others was abrogated) had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken away their Commiſſion: and ſhee in plaine termes, refuſed the new <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners; of whom one or two ſhee thought to wiſh her no good, but rather ill; except the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors might be added vnto them, and ſhe herſelfe might be publikely admitted to defend her innocencie before the Queene, and <hi>Murrey</hi> detained and brought to triall, whom ſhe affirmed might be proued to bee the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the murder of DARLY.

               <p>
                  <hi>Murrey</hi> a little before his departure, had craftily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vnto <hi>Norfolke,</hi> the mariage with the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and alſo ſecretly by <hi>Meluin</hi> to the Queene a hope to be reſtored into her Kingdome (as wee ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare anon) and at the ſame time to draw the loue of

Queene ELIZABETH from the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he had ſpread rumors that ſhe had tranſpoſed her right vnto <hi>England</hi> vnto the Duke of <hi>Anjeou,</hi> and that the tranſcription was confirmed at <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo letters (whether true or forged I will not ſay) which the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> had written vnto her friends, in which ſhee both charged Queene ELIZABETH as though ſhee had not vſed her according to her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and bragged of hope of aid from ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. This put Queene ELIZABETH in great feare, yet could not ſhee coniecture from whence this new hope ſhould ariſe, the ciuil warre increaſing ſo in <hi>France,</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Rhedon</hi> was ſent vnto her by the King, to requeſt her not to intermeddle with the affaires in <hi>France,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> who was come the laſt yeere into the <hi>Netherlands</hi> to profligate the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Religion, had very troubleſome buſineſſe come vpon him.</p>
               <p>But, as it came to light afterward, <hi>Robert Ridolphus</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> who had liued long at <hi>London,</hi> as a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Factor, was ſuborned by Pope <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> (who durſt not ſend a Nuntio openly) to ſtirre ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> againſt Queene ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, which hee did both diligently and ſecretly.

               <p>NOw <hi>Murrey,</hi> who had made himſelfe a ſecure way to returne into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the hope made to the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> of her reſtitution, and to <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and to others in <hi>England</hi> (for ſhee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the <hi>Scots</hi> that lay in wait to kill him, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them not to impeach his returne) As ſoone as hee came vnto <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> he called the Noblemen friends to the Queene, vnder the colour to conſult with them about her reſtitution. And when <hi>Hamilton</hi> Duke of <hi>Chaſteauleroy,</hi> appointed Lieutenant by the Queene, and <hi>Herris</hi> perſwaded by the letters of the Queene, too much credulous, came thither firſt, <hi>Murrey</hi> fearing ſome traps, circumuented them; and ſtaying for no moe, put them in priſon, and forthwith annoied and vexed the friends of the Queene with fire and ſword.</p>
               <p>Hereupon were rumours ſpread in all places of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> againſt <hi>Murrey,</hi> namely, that hee had made a pact with Queene ELIZABETH that the young King of

                  <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould bee deliuered vnto Queene ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, to be brought vp in <hi>England:</hi> That the Caſtles of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>Sterling</hi> ſhould bee furniſhed with Garriſons of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men: That <hi>Dunbritton</hi> ſhould be wonne for the benefit of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> That <hi>Murrey</hi> ſhould bee proclaimed ſucceſſor vnto the Realme of <hi>Scotland,</hi> if the King died without iſſue, and ſhould hold the Kingdome of Queene ELIZABETH, by fealtie and homage. Theſe reports increaſed, and with a certaine probabilitie did ſo poſſeſſe mens mindes thorow all <hi>Britanie,</hi> that Queene ELIZABETH thought good, for the conſeruation of her owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and for the good of <hi>Murrey,</hi> to wipe away theſe blots. Therefore in a writing printed, ſhe declared in the word of a Prince, that theſe reports were moſt vntrue, and deuiſed by them who enuied the tranquillitie of both the Kingdomes; and that there had beene no pact either by word or writing betweene her or her Agents and <hi>Murrey,</hi> ſince hee came laſt into <hi>England,</hi> that ſhe knew of; but that the Earle of <hi>Lennox</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of the young King had requeſted, that the King if hee could not bee ſafe in <hi>Scotland</hi> from the plots of wicked men, might be ſent into <hi>England.</hi> Moreouer, ſhe affirmed, that whatſoeuer is ſaid of the paction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Murrey</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Hertford,</hi> namely, that they would giue mutuall helpe the one to the other, to get the Crownes of both the Kingdomes, to be vtterly falſe and vntrue.

And indeed ſhe did her beſt endeuour, though ſhee was toſſed on the one ſide with feare out of the inuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate emulation, which doth neuer die betweene wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Princeſſes; and on the other ſide, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion

               <p>The Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> kindled more this compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and miniſhed the feare with her often and louing letters; in which ſhe ſolemnely promiſed, both for the courteſie which ſhee had found at her hands, and alſo for the neere bloud of kindred which was betweene them; that ſhee would attempt nothing againſt her, and that ſhee would not bee beholding to any other Prince for her reſtitution, but onely vnto her. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that Queene ELIZABETH dealt earneſtly with <hi>Murrey,</hi> by <hi>Wood</hi> his Secretarie, and with other <hi>Scots</hi> about the reſtoring of her vnto her former digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and eſtate, and if that could not bee granted, then that ſhee might bee ioined with her ſonne; and if that could not be granted neither, yet that ſhee might liue a priuate life at home among her friends, freely, ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and honourably. But ſhee could not ſtirre or moue <hi>Murrey</hi> (who had all the gouernment in his hand) to yeeld a iot.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time, a ſtill rumor went vp and downe amongſt men of the better ſort, that the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> would marrie the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was a thing well taken of many, but in ſundry manners, according as men wiſhed.

But many men, who ſaw the Queene was not minded to marrie, and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Princes, enemies vnto <hi>England,</hi> did caſt their eies vpon the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the moſt certaine Heire of <hi>England,</hi> thought it would bee a better way to eſtabliſh quietneſſe, and to containe the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> within bounds; that ſhee were maried to the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> the greateſt and moſt honourable

man of <hi>England,</hi> and a man in the loue of the people, and bred vp in the Religion of the Proteſtants, rather than to a forreigne Prince, who might bring both the Kingdomes into danger by her meanes, and alſo come ſo to inherit both the Kingdomes, which they heartily wiſhed might be conſolidated in a Prince of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, if the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould happen to die, whom they alſo purpoſed to bring into <hi>England,</hi> that hee being the true heire of <hi>England,</hi> being brought vp amongſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> might be better loued of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> men. And thus all the ſcruples about the ſucceſſion might be taken away, Queene ELIZABETH ſhould haue no cauſe to feare the Duke, and the Queene of <hi>Scotland;</hi> when ſhe had the King in her hands. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that the Duke ſhould attempt nothing againſt him, but loue him more dearely; They determined to eſpouſe <hi>Margaret</hi> the Dukes onely and little daughter vnto him, to bee maried together when they came to riper yeeres. Amongſt theſe were the Earles of <hi>Arundell, Northumberland, Weſtmerland, Suſſex, Pembrooke,</hi> and <hi>Southampton,,</hi> and very many <hi>Barons,</hi> yea, and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> himſelfe, whether in pollicie, and to worke the Dukes deſtruction, it is vncertaine: yet all theſe thought it good to acquaint the Queene with the matter, and to leaue the deciſion thereof to her pleaſure, and that ſhe ſhould preſcribe the conditions for the full ſecuritie and ſafetie of her owne perſon, Religion and the Realme. But now take the matter briefly if you pleaſe, from the very beginning out of the written confeſſion of the Duke, which I haue ſeene, and the memorials of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> who was the greateſt dealer in this buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>When the Commiſſioners met at <hi>Yorke</hi> the laſt yeere, <hi>Lidington</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe</hi> to winne his fauour, talked with the Duke of a mariage to bee made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betweene
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18326:38"/>
him and the Queene of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and ſo did <hi>Murrey</hi> himſelfe with the Duke at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, who in priuate talke with the Duke, and alſo with many others, fained that he wiſhed nothing more, than that matters in <hi>Scotland</hi> being ſet in good order, the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> his deareſt ſiſter, might be reſtored vnto her former dignitie and eſtate, ſo that onely ſhe would ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and vnfainedly receiue into her former fauour and grace her ſubiects, and that all the remembrances of all offences might be quite forgotten. Yet he feared, if ſhe maried a husband out of her owne choice, from <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> or <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that ſhee would reuenge the iniuries ſhe had receiued, change the Religion receiued in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and procure great danger vnto <hi>Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d.</hi> To preuent theſe things, he promiſed to beſtow all his labour, that where ſhee who had firſt maried a boy, then a raſh and heady young man, and laſtly too a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braine (thoſe were his very words) might now bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Duke, a man of diſcretion; which thing might turne vnto the tranquillitie of both the Realmes, the ſecuritie of both the Princes, and eſpecially to the eſtabliſhing of Religion, ſince he (ſuch was his reſpect vnto the Queene of <hi>England)</hi> might more proſperouſly containe <hi>Scotland</hi> in the amitie of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and might with the more eaſe draw the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> vnto the true Religion which he profeſſed. With theſe ſame things <hi>Murrey</hi> alſo ſecretly acquainted the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> by <hi>Robert Meluin,</hi> and offered his labour very officiouſly, toward the effecting thereof. But the Duke anſwered, that he could determine nothing about the mariage, before that ſhee did cleere her ſelfe of the crimes obiected againſt her; yet <hi>Roſſe</hi> as diligently as hee could, ceaſed not to draw him to it, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing.</p>
               <p>A few daies after, <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> met the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18326:39"/>
Duke in the Court at <hi>Weſtminiſter,</hi> vnto whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſled and offered his ſeruice very kindly, and ſignified that <hi>Leiceſter</hi> would talke with the Duke, about the mariage betweene him and the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which <hi>Throgmorton</hi> ſaid, ſeemed ſtrange to him, ſince <hi>Leiceſter</hi> himſelfe ſued for the ſame mariage not long ſince. But he willed the Duke in friendſhip, if it were ſo, that he ſhould giue the honour of that mariage vnto <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> who had beene before time a ſuiter therein. But if hee ſtood ſtifly in it, to denie and refuſe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the <hi>Scots</hi> did charge her with very many hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crimes. But yet, ſaid <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> I wiſh from my heart, that ſhee were maried vnto you, as well for the good of Religion, as alſo that ſhee may not depend of any other but on our Queene. Yet this I forewarne you, if you doe any thing in this matter, let <hi>Leiceſter</hi> guide you by aduice; for you of yourſelfe ſhall hardly get the Queenes conſent.</p>
               <p>A day or two after, <hi>Leiceſter</hi> moued the matter to the Duke, who anſwered iuſt euen as <hi>Throgmorton</hi> ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned him; and when hee came to ſpeake of the crimes, <hi>Leiceſter</hi> extenuated the ſame, and called <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Candiſh</hi> witneſſe, whoſe ſeruice (though ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) he commended vnto the Duke. Then <hi>Leiceſter</hi> told <hi>Pembrooke</hi> of the matter, and the Duke told <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell;</hi> and they together with <hi>Throgmorton</hi> in their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters commended vnto the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Duke as a fit husband (which <hi>Murrey</hi> had done alſo before:) The <hi>Duke</hi> alſo wrote and ſignified his loue, and offered his ſeruice in very louing words. From that time he imparted vnto them all the letters he wrote vnto her, or receiued from her; and they talked often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with <hi>Roſſe</hi> about the manner of concluding it.

               <p>But the rumor of this mariage came more plainly to the Queenes eare, by the Ladies and women of the Court, who ſmell out cunningly and quickly theſe loue matters. Which when the Duke vnderſtood to be true, he dealt very earneſtly with <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> both by <hi>Throgmorton</hi> and by <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> to open the matter ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily vnto the Queene: he made delaies, and lingred, as it were, to ſtay for a fit time to ſpeake. But <hi>Cecill</hi> willed the <hi>Duke</hi> (who was now full of care) to open all the matter to the Queene himſelfe, whereby all ſcruple might bee ſpeedily taken away from the Queene and from himſelfe alſo. <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was againſt it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to open the matter to the Queene in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe.

               <p>At which time the Queene called the Duke vnto her in a gallery, and chid him very much, that without her priuitie he had ſued vnto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the way of mariage; and commanded him vpon his alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, to ceaſe from further medling therein. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſo to doe willingly and gladly, and doubted not to ſay (as though hee cared not a whit for her) that his reuenues in <hi>England,</hi> were little leſſe than thoſe of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at this time lamentably impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueriſhed by the warres; and alſo when hee was in his Tennis-court at <hi>Norwich,</hi> he ſeemed to himſelfe to bee equall, after a ſort, vnto many Kings. But from that time, he began to bee more deiected in minde, and when hee ſaw the Queene to looke and ſpeake to him more ſternely, and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> in a manner eſtranged, and moſt of the Noblemen to ſteale away out of his companie, ſcarce ſaluting or ſpeaking to him, haſted vnto <hi>London</hi> without taking any leaue, and went in to <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> who bade him be of good cheere, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him very much. And on that ſame very day Queene ELIZABETH reiected with ſhew of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Embaſſador, intreating her very much to deliuer the Queene captiue, and bade that ſhe ſhould behaue her ſelfe quietly, leſt ſhortly ſhee ſaw them on whom ſhe chiefly relied to hop headleſſe.</p>
               <p>And now when the rumor of the mariage was hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euery day than other, and the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador exceedingly vrged her deliuerie (more by the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, than by the commandement of the <hi>French</hi> King, as it was after knowne:) new
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18326:41"/>
ſuſpicions from euery place were laid hold on: and <hi>Cecill</hi> who applied all his care for the good of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike and Religion, was very diligent to finde the depth of the matter; and therefore wrote vnto <hi>Suſſex</hi> Lord Preſident of the North, who was a familiar friend, and neere allied in bloud vnto the Duke, to certifie the Queene what he knew of the Dukes mariage. But his anſwer is vnknowne vnto mee. And where it had beene obſerued, that the Duke had many ſecret confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with <hi>Murrey</hi> Regent of <hi>Scotland</hi> at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court; <hi>George Cary</hi> ſonne to the Lord <hi>Hunſdon</hi> was ſent ſecretly vnto <hi>Murrey,</hi> to learne of him if the Duke had imparted vnto him any thing about this mariage. The Duke in the meane while, terrified with a falſe rumor ſpread, that there was a commotion raiſed in the North, and being certified by <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> that he ſhould bee put in priſon, went out of the way into <hi>Norfolke,</hi> whiles his friends in the Court (who had promiſed ſo much) might auert &amp; turne aſide the ſtorme that hung ouer his head, &amp; he himſelfe might mitigate the Queenes diſpleaſure by his humble letters. But there were men ſet about him to marke and note all his actions. When he found no comfort among his friends, and <hi>Heydon, Cornwallis,</hi> and other worſhipfull Gentlemen of thoſe parts, perſwaded him, if he were guiltie of any offence toward the Queene, to flie vnto her mercie; he waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and was tormented with diuerſitie of cares. In this while was the Court in quandarie, ſuſpitious and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that he would breake out into rebellion; and they ſay, it was determined to kill the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> preſently if he did ſo.</p>
               <p>But hee, out of his inbred good nature, and out of his conſcience, that hee had not offended againſt any Law made treaſon (for that act of marying the Kings ſiſters, or brothers, or aunts children, without the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18326:41"/>
Kings knowledge, made treaſon by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, was repealed by King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt) and alſo for feare leſt the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> out of ſuſpicion ſhould be vſed more hardly and extremely, hee ſent let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnto his friends in the Court, and told them, that hee ſtept aſide vnto his houſe, that in time, and by his abſence, he might procure a remedy againſt malicious rumours, which are at all times entertained with open eares in the Court, and asked pardon moſt humbly for his offence, and forthwith tooke his iourney toward the Court.</p>
               <p>As he returned, at Saint <hi>Albans, Owen</hi> a gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> ſent ſecretly by <hi>Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton</hi> and <hi>Lumley,</hi> who were committed, willed him to take all the fault vpon himſelfe, and not to lay it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and others, leſt he ſhould make his friends his enemies. There <hi>Edward Fitz-Gerard</hi> brother vnto the Earle of <hi>Kildare</hi> (Lieutenant of the Penſioners) met and receiued him, and conueyed him vnto <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> three miles from <hi>Windſor</hi> (where the Queene then lay.) Foure daies after, the Abbot of <hi>Dunfermelling</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the letters of <hi>Murrey,</hi> Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> vnto the Queene; in which hee ſhewed her, that the Duke dealt with him ſecretly at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, to fauour his mariage with the Queene of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that if hee would not, he threatned him exceedingly, and that hee promiſed to fauour it, that he might preuent and auoid the await &amp; ambuſcado laid by one <hi>Norton</hi> to kill him; from whom and others, the Duke gaue his word hee ſhould returne without danger. And that ſhortly after, the Duke requeſted him by his letters written in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, to giue his conſent vnto the mariage. Moreouer, that the Duke did ſignifie vnto him by <hi>Boyd,</hi> that hee would neuer forſake and abandon the Queene of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and further, that the agents of the ſame Queene

               <p>The Duke, who had ſecret and warie commerce of letters (which were ſent priuily in Ale-bottles) with the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe, Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Throgmorton</hi> was about this time examined about this mariage with the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and his ſecret conferences with the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and confeſſed moſt things, was ſent to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> vnder the keeping of Sir <hi>Henry Neuill</hi> Knight, being bitterly reproued that hee had departed from the Court without leaue obtained, and charged as though he had intended to rebell.

Some Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were forbidden the Court, as priuie to theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who humbly confeſſed that they with the Duke agreed to the mariage, which <hi>Murrey</hi> had firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; yet ſo that the Duke, the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> and they, willed that the matter ſhould bee referred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Queene before the mariage was to be ſolemnized, and deſired pardon for their offence. In like manner

the Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> who were of this counſell, ſubmitted themſelues vnto <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> Lord Preſident of the North, and beſought him to make interceſſion vnto the Queene for their pardon. Alſo ſundry Pamphlets came out againſt this mariage, and againſt the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the right by which ſhee claimed to become heire vnto <hi>England;</hi> wherein they ſhewed their wits with ſuch malapert ſaucineſſe, that the Queene thought once to haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them by ſeuere edict, and permitted the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe</hi> (winking thereat) to make anſwer; who forthwith ſet forth a booke vnder the name of <hi>Morgan Philips,</hi> againſt them, wherein hee defended the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Queene, her right to ſucceed, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of women (for this alſo was impugned) but ingenuouſly acknowledged afterward in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, that he had his arguments for her right of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſecretly from <hi>Anthonie Browne</hi> chiefe Iuſtice in the common Place, and <hi>Carrell</hi> an excellent good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawyer.</p>

               <p>After theſe things, the priuie Councell of <hi>England</hi> ſate oftentimes, and conſulted whether it was beſt that

There could not be a fitter man for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and more noble than the Duke, who had the loue of the Realme: And hee had great reaſon to reuenge the wrongs done vnto him, by his long detention in priſon; and now to his reproach, not called vnto the Parlament, in which he had a place and voice, as the chiefeſt Nobleman, and Earle Marſhall of</hi> England. And to perſwade him the more effectually, he ſhewed him a roll of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, who had vowed to ſpend their liues and goods for him, if he would attempt it. As for forraine aid, he aſſured him that <hi>the Pope (ſo that the Romiſh Religion might bee aduanced) would defray all the charges of the warre, who had already laid in banke a great ſumme of money the laſt yeere when the Bull was publiſhed; of the which money</hi> Ridolph <hi>himſelfe had diſtributed a great part among the</hi> Engliſh <hi>fugitiues. Hee promiſed that the King of</hi> Spaine, <hi>irritated by the iniuries of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>men, would ſend to helpe them foure thouſand horſe, and ſix thouſand foot, which might bee ſent ouer and landed at</hi> Harwich, <hi>a Port in</hi> Eſſex <hi>(whereabouts the Duke had many tenants and Gentlemen holding of him) moſt fitly and without ſuſpicion, in the beginning of Summer, when the Duke of</hi> Medina Caeli <hi>was to come with a good Nauie into the Low-Countries.</hi> Laſtly, he concluded, <hi>that ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration might be vſed, that all ſuſpicion of treaſon in the Duke might be taken away, and prouiſion made for the ſafetie of the Queene of</hi> England, <hi>if onely ſhee would embrace or tolerate the Romiſh Religion, and conſent to the mariage of the Queene of</hi> Scotland <hi>with the Duke.</hi>

The Duke gaue eare to theſe things as likely, but yet refuſed to ſubſcribe vnto the letters of credit (as they call them) which <hi>Ridolph,</hi> being ready to depart, ſhewed vnto him. Neither would he heare the aduice of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> which hee had long ſtudied, and put into his head by <hi>Barker;</hi> namely, <hi>that the Duke with a ſelected companie of Noblemen, to take the Queene ſuddenly, and to diſturbe the Parlament, and by this meanes the mariage with the Queene of</hi> Scotland <hi>might bee finiſhed, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion ſet in better ſtate in</hi> England, <hi>without any great ſtirre, and without any forraine aid: Which might eaſily be done, hauing ſo many Noblemen ready and prompt to enter into this action, as could not bee aſſembled againe in one place without ſuſpicion. And iuſt cauſe there was, for that the Duke was kept long in priſon againſt the Lawes of the Realme, and not admitted into the Parlament; and alſo for that more rigorous Lawes were deuiſed againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. And to doe this hee brought in the example of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrutio <hi>in</hi> Italy, <hi>and others, who by ſudden actions had proſperouſly effected great matters; and how fiue Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in</hi> Scotland, <hi>very lately, had diſturbed the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein</hi> Murrey <hi>was to bee attainted, and gotten the Queene into their hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This aduice the Duke (who was out of his inbred good nature farre from any villanie) deteſted and diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as pernicious and dangerous. But about the ſame time, <hi>Henry Percy</hi> offered his ſeruice vnto <hi>Roſſe,</hi> for to deliuer the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> out of priſon; ſo that <hi>Grange</hi> and <hi>Carre</hi> of <hi>Ferniherſt</hi> would receiue her at the borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and his brother the Earle of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> might bee deliuered out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But when his credit was ſuſpected, becauſe of his priuate familiaritie with <hi>Burghley,</hi> and alſo he delaied the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very long, that plot came to nothing: (For the which, vpon his ſubmiſſion hee was notwithſtanding

fined in the Star-chamber at fiue thouſand Markes, which neuertheleſſe the Queene pardoned.) As alſo the plot of <hi>Powell</hi> of <hi>Sandford,</hi> one of the Penſioners, and of <hi>Owen,</hi> a Gentleman belonging to the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> who intended to aduenture vpon the ſame action, but that <hi>Roſſe</hi> did inhibit and hinder them, as not able to performe ſo great an attempt, ſince they were not men of that abilitie and meanes.</p>
               <p>Yet did many <hi>Engliſh</hi> men haſten the mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi> as much as they could; for they had by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions brought him to thinke of the mariage with her againe, contrarie to the promiſe he had made, which was firſt found out by theſe meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ridolph</hi> the <hi>Florentine</hi> (whom wee haue ſpoken of) being ſent ouer Sea into forraine Countries, to deale in the Queene of <hi>Scotlands</hi> buſineſſe, had acquainted <hi>Charles Bailiffe</hi> a <hi>Flemming,</hi> ſeruant to the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with all his ſpeeches with the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> and had deliuered vnto him letters in Ciphers vnto her, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſadour, <hi>Norfolke, Roſſe,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lumley,</hi> all put in one Packet, which <hi>Bailiffe</hi> brought ouer with him, though <hi>Roſſe</hi> had bidden him to leaue them with the Captaine of <hi>Calice</hi> to bee ſent ouer.

               <p>About the ſame time, the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> had ſent a certaine ſumme of mony vnto the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, for her friends in <hi>Scotland;</hi> hee deliuered it vnto <hi>Barker</hi> and <hi>Higford,</hi> who acquainting the Duke with the matter, deliuered it to one <hi>Browne</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Shrewsburie,</hi> a retainer of the Dukes, to bee carried by <hi>Baniſter</hi> and <hi>Lander</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> vnto the Lord <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.

               <p>The Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> diſcourſed in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie theſe things at large. <hi>The</hi> French <hi>King allowed the conference appointed with the</hi> Scots, <hi>and that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the mariage of</hi> Anjeou <hi>with Queene</hi> ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, <hi>for no other purpoſe, but that they might with the better colour denie their aid promiſed to reſtore her: That they ſecretly ſought to hinder her mariage with</hi> Don Iohn d'Auſtria, <hi>and that they fauoured exceedingly the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with</hi> Norfolke <hi>(vpon malice to the</hi> Spaniard:) <hi>That the Duke of</hi> Alba <hi>did diſallow the purpoſe of ſending backe the Queene of</hi> Scotland <hi>into</hi> Scotland, <hi>ſo much that he thought thereby would bee wrought not onely the vtter deſtruction of the Queene, but alſo of the Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all Britaine; becauſe that the Queene returned into</hi> Scotland <hi>ſhould be in danger of ſiege, or elſe of neceſsitie put to the aduenture of a battell with the Rebels, who may eaſily get her into their hands, by the helpe of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>men, before forraine aid could come to helpe her.

                  <hi>ſecretly to keepe theſe things from the</hi> French <hi>King by all meanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the priuie Councellors had receiued this Commentarie, the letters I ſpake of, and others ſent from the Pope, and <hi>Barker</hi> being taken, had confeſſed all theſe things; Sir <hi>Ralph Sadleir</hi> was commanded to watch the Dukes houſe (at the <hi>Charter-houſe</hi> in <hi>London)</hi> with a band of Souldiers. The next day the Duke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe being examined (not knowing what his ſeruants had confeſſed, and thinking that the Commentarie had beene burned and the letters alſo) denied all things ſtoutly: a day or two after, namely, on the ſeuenth day of September, he was conueyed to the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> againe, by Sir <hi>Ralph Sadleir,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Neuill,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Wilſon.</hi> And then <hi>Baniſter,</hi> who was the Dukes Lawyer, and the Earles of <hi>Arundell</hi> and <hi>Southampton,</hi> the Lords <hi>Lumley,</hi> and <hi>Cobham,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> his brother, <hi>Henry Percie, Lowder, Powell, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeere,</hi> and others were put in priſon, who euery one in hope of pardon, told all they knew.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as the Commiſſioners ſhewed to him the confeſſions of theſe men, the letters of the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> with the Commentarie, hee was aſtonied; but beholding the Commentarie with the letters which he thought had beene burned, hee brake out into theſe words: <hi>I am betraied and vndone by my ſeruants, becauſe I knew not how to diſtruſt, which is the ſinew of wiſdome.</hi> But hee beſought the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners very humbly to ſpeake vnto the Queene in his behalfe, promiſing that hee would hide nothing that hee knew; and ſolemnly proteſting that hee approued nothing which might haue beene wrong vnto the Queene, or detriment vnto the Realme; yea, that hee vtterly condemned the purpoſes and plots to ſurprize the Queene and the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and to ſet free
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18326:54"/>
the Queene of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that hee neuer had a thought to bring in any forraine forces, but onely to ſuppreſſe the <hi>Scots</hi> that rebelled againſt the Queene. The ſame day, being examined of fiftie Articles, more or leſſe, he concealed nothing. Then all the courſe of the buſineſſe was laid downe and declared in the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, a great aſſembly of Noblemen, the Maior and Aldermen of <hi>London</hi> being preſent, and afterwards to all the Citizens in the Guild-hall, by <hi>William Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> the Recorder.</p>

               </p>
               <p>They anſwered; If ſuch a Prince be lawfully depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, his Agent cannot challenge the priuilege of an Embaſſadour, ſince none but they which haue the rights of an abſolute Prince can appoint Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</p>

               </p>
               <p>They anſwered; If ſuch a Prince who ſhall come into the Kingdome of another Prince, and bee kept in priſon, hath not loſt his principalitie, hee may haue an Agent; but whether that Procurator may be reputed an Embaſſadour, that dependeth on the authoritie of his Commiſſion or delegation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>They anſwered, The Prince may forbid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, that he doe not come into the Realme, and command him to depart out of the Realme, if hee doe not containe himſelfe within the bounds preſcribed vnto an Embaſſadour; yet in the meane time hee may vſe and enioy the priuileges of an Embaſſadour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the authoritie giuen him by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>After theſe anſwers of the learned Lawyers, <hi>Roſſe</hi> being brought backe out of the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> was ſharply rebuked and told by the Councellors, that hee was no more to be acknowledged for an Embaſſadour, but as a

plotter of treaſons to be ſeuerely puniſhed. He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>That he is the Embaſſadour of an abſolute Queene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly depriued; That hee had dealt diligently according to his place and dutie, for the libertie of his Prince, and the good of both the Kingdomes; That he came into</hi> England <hi>with a ſufficient authoritie (which hee ſhewed) with the moſt ample authoritie of an Embaſſadour; and that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred rights and priuileges of Embaſſadours are not to bee violated by any meanes. Burghley</hi> told him in diſcreet words, that neither the priuileges of Embaſſage, nor letters of publike credit did protect Embaſſadours who offend againſt the publike Maieſtie of the Prince, but that they are ſubiect to puniſhment; otherwiſe it might bee lawfull for wicked minded Embaſſadours to attempt any thing againſt the liues of Princes.

Laſtly, he excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he being an Embaſſador, could not without a great offence depart from his dutie, and abandon his foueraigne Princeſſe in her affliction and aduerſitie; and that hee propounded the taking of Queene ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH for no other cauſe, but to trie the Dukes minde, whether hee ſtood conſtant and reſolute. But the crimes of the other he wittily extenuated, and by no meanes he could be induced to tell the names of the Noblemen that promiſed to helpe the Duke to ſurprize the Queene; But he confeſſed that he by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did aske aduice of the Duke, <hi>Arundell, Lumley,</hi> and <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> by their ſeruants that came to and fro, and the Vicount <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ague</hi> by <hi>Lumley,</hi> about the deliuerie of the Caſtles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the hoſtages, the deliuerie of the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> vnto the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, and the reſtoring of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels.

But it is wonderfull what ieſts ſomelewd conſtruers of words, made of that clauſe, <hi>Beſides the naturall iſſue of her body;</hi> ſince the Lawyers call them <hi>Naturall</hi> that are borne out of matrimonie, but the legitimate they call out of the forme of words vſed in the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Children of his body lawfully begotten;</hi> inſomuch, that being a young man, I heard it often ſaid, that that word was thruſt into the Act by <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> to the intent that hee might at one time or other, thruſt vpon them, againſt their wills, ſome Baſtard ſonne of his, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall iſſue of the Queene.</p>

               <p>Silence being made, the Letters Patents of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was read; then a white wand was deliuered vnto the Lord <hi>Steward,</hi> by <hi>Garter</hi> King at Armes, which hee ſhortly after deliuered vnto the Serieant at Armes, who ſtood by and held it vp all the while. Then the Earles and Barons were called by their names, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one made anſwer to his name. Then ſilence was made againe, and the Lieutenant of the Tower was commanded to returne his precept, and to bring the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18326:57"/>
Duke to the Barre. Forthwith he was brought in, and Sir <hi>Owen Hopton</hi> ſtood on the one ſide of him, and Sir <hi>Peter Carew</hi> on the other ſide; and next by him ſtood a man holding an Axe, with the edge from the Duke: Silence being made againe, the Clerke of the Crowne ſaid thus to the Duke; <hi>Thomas Duke of Norfolke late of Keningale, in the Countie of Norfolke, hold vp thy hand:</hi> (which when hee had done, the Clerke read the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement with a loud voice, that is to ſay, That in the eleuenth yeere of Queene ELIZABETH and after, the Duke did traiterouſly deuiſe to put her from her Crowne, and to kill her, and to raiſe warre againſt her, and to bring in forraine forces to inuade the Realme. That whereas he knew MARIE late Queene of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to haue claimed the Diadem of <hi>England,</hi> with the title and armes thereof, yet hee without the Queenes knowledge intended to marrie with her, and lent her a great ſumme of money, contrarie to the promiſe he had made vnder his owne hand. That whereas he knew the Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland, Markenfield,</hi> and others, had raiſed rebellion againſt the Queene, and were fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> he releeued them with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. That in the thirteenth yeere of the Queene, hee by letters requeſted aid of men from Pope <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> the profeſſed enemie of the Queene, the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> to deliuer the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to reſtore Papiſtrie into <hi>England.</hi> Laſtly, that hee gaue aid vnto <hi>Herris</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> and other enemies of the Queene in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This being read, the Clerke asked the Duke, whether hee were guiltie of theſe crimes or no?</p>
               <p>He beſought, that if it were lawfull by the Law, he might haue a Lawyer appointed him to defend or pleade his cauſe. <hi>Catlin</hi> Chiefe Iuſtice anſwered, that it was not lawfull. The Duke ſaid; <hi>It is meet that I ſubmit</hi>

                  <hi>my ſelfe to the opinion of the Iudges; but there bee many darke and obſcure points in this buſineſſe; neither vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood I of my arraignment till within this foureteene houres; I was kept from bookes; now I ſee, I am to fight for my life without weapons: Yet I haue heard, that a Lawyer was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned vnto</hi> Humfrey Stafford <hi>in a caſe of treaſon, in the reigne of</hi> Henry <hi>the ſeuenth. Dier</hi> chiefe Iuſtice of the Common pleas anſwered, that a Lawyer was aſſigned vnto <hi>Stafford</hi> about the priuilege of the Sanctuarie, from whence he was taken away by force, and that he anſwered for himſelfe without a Lawyer for the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Duke ſaid, <hi>I muſt ſpeake this day for my life, my goods, for my children, and that which is moſt to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, for my loyaltie and honeſtie (let honour goe by:) yet let me aske one queſtion; Whether that the enumeration of the crimes muſt be holden for true in euery part, and to which part I muſt anſwer? Catlin</hi> ſaid, When the cauſes be true, the enumeration is alſo to be accounted true. <hi>I doe deſire to be told</hi> (ſaid the Duke) <hi>whether euery ſingular thing bee treaſon; For I haue heard in the cauſe of the Lord</hi> Scroope, <hi>in the reigne of</hi> Henry <hi>the fourth.</hi> As hee would haue ſaid more, the Clerke of the Crowne interrupted him, ſpeaking aloud; <hi>Thomas Duke of Norfolke, art thou guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or not guiltie?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Not guiltie.</hi> The Clerke asked him againe; <hi>How wiltthou betried? I commend</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>my cauſe to God and to my Peeres: The hainouſneſſe of my crimes woundeth my heart, but the benignitie of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie from whom I could expect no more, doth recomfort me: and I beſeech you, my Lord Steward, that I may bee dealt withall according to Law, and that my memorie, which is ſlipperie, may not be oppreſt with the confuſed varietie of things. That I haue you my Peeres and Iudges, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelfe happy; for vnto many of your integrities I would willingly commit my life. I truſting vnto mine innocencie did not flie: but yet I cannot but ingenuoſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:18326:58"/>
                  <hi>that I haue tranſgreſſed againſt the Queene, but in no treaſon. I beſeech you let not thoſe things of ſmaller mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be put amongst the other of treaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſaid <hi>Barham</hi> the Queenes Serieant at law; The crimes of treaſon whereof thou art indicted are theſe: Thou didſt deuiſe to depriue the Queene of her Realme and of her life: Thou didſt intend to marrie with the Queene of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Thou didſt ſend for forraine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to inuade the Realme: Thou gaueſt maintenance vnto the Rebels, and didſt helpe the <hi>Scots,</hi> enemies to the Queene. The Duke interrupted him, ſaying, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, I pray you doe not aggrauate the matter with words, in obiecting the mariage and other things which be not trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Barham</hi> turning to the Noblemen, vrged the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaying; He that would marrie her that claimeth the Kingdome, the ſame man deſireth and ſeeketh after the Kingdome; but this the Duke began when he was one of the Commiſſioners at <hi>Yorke,</hi> to heare the cauſe of the Queene of <hi>Scotland;</hi> at which time hee was ſworne to weigh indifferently and vprightly the accuſations and defences on both ſides. The Duke ſaid; <hi>That cauſe hath ſundry parts, which bee without the compaſſe of treaſon.</hi> The Steward of <hi>England</hi> bade the Duke not to vſe ſuch digreſſions from the purpoſe, who when <hi>Barham</hi> ſtill vrged it with a loud voice, hee acknowledged that the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> had claimed the Realme of <hi>England</hi> as due to her, but that ſhee had giuen ouer the claime long ſince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barham</hi> to the contrarie ſhewed how ſhe had not left off the claime, becauſe ſhe had not yet made a releaſe or renunciation thereof; and hee accuſed the Duke hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly that he taught the Delegates of <hi>Scotland</hi> what to ſay; and this out of the confeſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe.</hi> The Duke confeſſed that <hi>Lidington</hi> moued the mariage vnto him, and that hee refuſed it, and that hee
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18326:59"/>
told them nothing; and requeſted that the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe</hi> might be produced before him.</p>
               <p>Then did <hi>Barham</hi> proſecute at large many things which I haue mentioned before, to proue that the Duke did vnmeaſurably deſire the Kingdome: and ſtood much vpon this point; What other thing could the Duke propoſe vnto himſelfe in his minde, without the priuitie of the Queene, to marrie the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a woman without goods, without King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (her ſonne being now eſtabliſhed in the Realme of <hi>Scotland)</hi> but that hee might get by her meanes or right the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and conſequently depriue the Queene of her life and Kingdome? The Duke ſaid; <hi>Theſe things are farre fetcht to conuince me to haue imagined the depriuation and deſtruction of the Queene.</hi> I will come neerer, ſaid <hi>Barham:</hi> It is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne that you deuiſed with others, to ſurprize the Tower of <hi>London</hi> (which is the chiefeſt hold of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,)</hi> ſo that it is of neceſſitie that you then compaſſed the deſtruction of the Queene, ſince Kingdomes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to haue a partner. The Duke denied not, that one <hi>Hopton</hi> put into his head, the ſurprizing of the Tower, yet that he reiected the ſame: Why then, ſaid <hi>Barham,</hi> didſt thou aske the Earle of <hi>Pembrookes</hi> aduice, who diſſwaded thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barham</hi> went on, and vrged him, that when the Queene requeſted of the Infant King of <hi>Scotland</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Caſtles, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels out of <hi>Scotland</hi> to bee deliuered; the Duke ſecretly willed the <hi>Scots</hi> not to conſent thereunto. He accuſed him alſo, that he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted priuily to ſteale away the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> out of priſon: And this was after hee had ſolemnly promiſed to meddle or deale with her no more.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Candiſh</hi> was brought in witneſſe againſt him; that the Duke had a reſolute purpoſe to marrie her, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18326:59"/>
that hee asked him if hee could draw his Vncle to his ſide, if Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> died. The Duke vtterly deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe things, and reiected his teſtimonie, as of a needy man, and a childiſh witneſſe. Moreouer, it was ſhewed, that the Duke ſent ſecretly his man to the Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> to aduiſe them not to riſe in rebellion, as a thing that would proue very dangerous. Alſo the letters of the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> were ſhewed, wherein ſhee lamented that <hi>Northumberland</hi> was intercepted before hee was ready to riſe. (For this flying newes was brought to her, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance of ſet purpoſe.)</p>
               <p>To theſe things the Duke anſwered: <hi>Theſe reaſons doe not probably proue, that he compaſſed the deſtruction of the Queene, and that nothing yet brought againſt him, was of any moment, but onely the teſtimonie of the Biſhop of</hi> Roſſe; <hi>neither was this to be receiued, ſince he was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainer, citing the authoritie of</hi> Bracton, <hi>the moſt learned Lawyer of our Land; that he neuer made ſuch reckoning of</hi> Northumberland <hi>and</hi> Weſtmerland, <hi>that hee would put his life into their hands: he relied (he ſaid) and truſted ſo much vnto his innocencie, that hee had neuer ſo much as a thought to flie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gerard</hi> the Queenes Atturney ſaid; It is moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that he did purpoſely intend to marrie the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> to worke the Queenes deſtruction: It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo apparant, that he did aduiſedly conſult of inuading the Realme, by the letters vnto the Pope, the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alba.</hi> All his dealings with <hi>Ridolph</hi> are now well knowne, by the ſecret Ciphers and Charactericall notes hidden vnder the tiles of <hi>Howard</hi> houſe; alſo by the letters (which hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bee burned) found in the Matts in the entrie of the chamber; and all theſe things may bee proued out of the examinations of them who were not terrified
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18326:60"/>
with torments, nor attainted of treaſon. To theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Duke ſaid; <hi>Of the conſultations of the Pope and the King of</hi> Spaine, <hi>I was neither author nor fautor; yea, I alwaies diſliked them. Let them bee puniſhed that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the fault, and let them not charge mee, to excuſe themſelues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore <hi>Gerard</hi> accuſed the Duke, that hee tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with <hi>Ridolph</hi> of the landing of ten thouſand Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers out of <hi>Flanders</hi> at <hi>Harwich,</hi> a Hauen in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and this out of the examination of <hi>Barker:</hi> And alſo that letters were written and ſent by <hi>Ridolph</hi> vnto the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> vnto which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Duke did not ſubſcribe, yet that hee ſent by the counſell of <hi>Roſſe, Barker</hi> his Secretarie vnto the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Embaſſadour, who ſhould aſſure them that they were his very letters. The Duke ſaid; <hi>My memorie fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth me, neither can it call to minde ſuch intricate varietie of matters. You Lawyers haue your briefe notes, I am put to anſwer</hi> ex tempore. <hi>This is alſo improbable, that I ſhould deale with the Pope, vnto whoſe Religion I was alwaies an aduerſarie. I had rather be pulled in peeces by horſes, than reuolt from the Religion I profeſſe. The ſituation of</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich <hi>doth eaſily confute all this accuſation. Who ſeeth not, how hard a matter it is to bring an armie thorow that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, which is all encloſed, and moſt troubleſome, with nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row waies? If I had imagined to make warre againſt my Prince, I ſhould doubtleſſe haue furniſhed my ſelfe with Armour; but in theſe whole ten yeeres, I haue not bought any more than eight Corſlets, and no Gun-powder at all; I would neuer haue committed ſuch letters vnto</hi> Barkers <hi>fidelitie, but rather vnto</hi> Baniſter, <hi>whom I eſteemed aboue many</hi> Barkers.</p>
               <p>Now were brought forth the letters of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> ſent out of priſon vnto the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and intercepted; out of which the former things were
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18326:60"/>
confirmed. The Duke required to ſee the letters; for he ſeemed to doubt that they were counterfeit. But the Lord Steward ſaid, Doubt not, they bee written with <hi>Roſſes</hi> owne hand. Another ſhort letter written with Oker by the Duke, commanding his man to burne a bundle of letters hidden in a certaine place, and to lay the fault vpon <hi>Roſſe,</hi> who might eaſily auoid the Law, by the priuilege of an Embaſſadour, was alſo ſhewed: To theſe letters the Duke ſaid; <hi>I being certified, that it was diuulged amongst the common people, that I had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many; I anſwered in that ſhort letter; and when I ſaw all places to be narrowly ſearched, I commanded that bundle to be burned, that I might keepe many men from trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bromley</hi> the Queenes Sollicitor, ſhewed the letters of <hi>Ridolph,</hi> wherein hee ſignified, that the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> approued their purpoſe; and alſo the Popes letters vnto the Duke, dated the tenth day of May. Then <hi>Wilbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> made an cloquent ſpeech of the credit of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and of the Dukes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. Vnto which the Duke ſaid; <hi>I haue not the skill to refell ſo poliſhed and ornate a ſpeech; yet the Orator as skilfull as be is, for all that, left out what the force of feare is, which oftentimes quaileth and dauntoth a good courage; and againe he commended and vrged</hi> Bracton <hi>againſt the credit of forraine witneſſes. Catlin</hi> chiefe Iuſtice made anſwer: In ſuch cauſes as theſe, the teſtimonies of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers are allowable, and that it was in the will of the Peeres to giue credit or diſallow ſuch teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>Now they were come to proue that the Duke had releeued the Rebels after they were fled, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the letters of the Counteſſe of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in which ſhe gaue thanks to the Duke for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſecretly ſent vnto her and her husband. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the laſt obiection, about the releeuing the <hi>Scots,</hi> enemies to the Queene, was proued out of the Dukes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18326:61"/>
letters to <hi>Baniſter,</hi> out of the confeſſion of <hi>Baniſter,</hi> and the money deliuered vnto <hi>Browne</hi> of <hi>Shrewsburie.</hi> Here the Duke asked the Iudges, <hi>Whether the ſubiects of another Prince confederate with the Queene, may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted enemies to the Queene? Catlin</hi> anſwered, they might; and that the Queene of <hi>England</hi> may make warre with ſome Duke of <hi>France,</hi> and yet at the ſame time be in amitie with the King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When now it drew toward night, the Lord Steward asked the Duke what hee had more to ſay for himſelfe? He anſwered; <hi>I put my truſt in the equitie of the Lawes.</hi> The Lord Steward commanded the Lieutenant of the Tower to take the Duke aſide; and then ſilence being made, he turned vnto the Peeres, and ſaid: <hi>You haue heard how</hi> Thomas <hi>Duke of</hi> Norfolke <hi>hath beene indited of high treaſon, who hath pleaded not guiltie, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto God and to you; therefore it is your part, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider among you, whether he be guiltie or no, and to declare your opinion according to your conſcience, and vpon your honour:</hi> and withall, he bade them to goe aſide, and to conſult one with another. After a little time, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vnto their places: Then the Steward beginning at the loweſt, ſaid: My Lord <hi>De La-ware,</hi> is <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> guiltie of the crimes of high treaſon, whereof he is indited, or not guiltie? He riſing vp, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hand on his breaſt, ſaid, Guiltie. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were each one asked in their order. Then was the Duke brought againe to the Barre, vnto whom the Lord Steward ſpake in this manner: Thomas <hi>Duke of</hi> Norfolke, <hi>thou haſt beene indited of ſundry high treaſons; and put thy ſelfe to bee tried by God and thy Peeres, who haue found thee guiltie; haſt thou any thing to ſay why iudgement ſhould not be given againſt thee?</hi> Hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>The will of God (who will iudge betweene mee and my falſe accuſers) be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:18326:61"/>
All men now keeping ſilence, the edge of the Axe was turned towards him: Then <hi>Barham</hi> for the Queene requeſted the Lord Steward to giue iudgement; which he (weeping) did, in theſe formall words: <hi>Foraſmuch as thou</hi> Thomas <hi>Duke of</hi> Norfolke <hi>haſt beene indited of high treaſon, and haſt pleaded not guiltie, and haſt put thy ſelfe vpon thy Peeres, who haue found thee guiltie; therefore this Bench doth adiudge that thou ſhalt bee lead backe from hence vnto the Tower (from whence thou cameſt) and from thence laid on a Hurdle, ſhalt be drawne vnto the place of execution, and there to bee hanged, cut downe aliue, to bee bowelled, thy head cut off, thy body to bee diuided into foure quarters, thy head and thy quarters to bee diſpoſed of at the Queenes pleaſure: And ſo our Lord haue mercie on thy ſoule.</hi> The Duke hearing this iudgement, ſaid with a good courage; <hi>Iudgement is giuen againſt mee, as againſt a Traitor; I truſt in God, that excluded from your fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I ſhall enioy the celeſtiall fellowſhip; I will prepare my ſelfe to die; I requeſt this one thing, that the Queene would bee good to my children and ſeruants, and ſee my debts paid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A few daies after <hi>Barney</hi> and <hi>Mather</hi> were executed, who conſpired with <hi>Herle</hi> a <hi>Ruffian,</hi> to kill ſome o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

all hee could, that no violence ſhould bee offered vnto <hi>Mourton,</hi> to remoue <hi>Lennox</hi> away out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to comfort the Noblemen of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> faction.

And I truſting vpon thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe freely offered, (although thy ſeruants had oftentimes deceiued me) reſolued to flee for helpe vnto thee, as to my laſt aſſured Anchor, in my aduerſitie; and ſo had I done, if the way had beene as open and eaſie for me, as it was for them that rebelled againſt me.

Now reſteth my moſt inſtant and importunate ſuit, that I thinking onely of the life to come, may haue ſome reuerend Catholike Prieſt, to direct me in my Religion, for the ſaluation of my ſoule. This laſt office is not to be denied vnto poore wretches of the baſeſt and meaneſt eſtate. Thou doeſt permit vnto the Embaſſadours of forraine Princes, the exerciſe of their Religion, and I voluntarily permitted it to my ſubiects that were of a contrarie Religion. If this be denied vnto mee, I hope, I ſhall bee excuſed before God. But I feare mine aduerſaries ſhall not eſcape without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Aſſuredly it will be a preſident vnto other Princes of Chriſtendome, to ſhew the like ſeueritie againſt their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects that be in Religion contrarie vnto them; if this ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie be vſed towards me a free and abſolute Princeſſe, and thy neereſt Couſin, for ſo I am, and will be ſo to thee whiles I liue, in ſpite of mine aduerſaries, let them ſtomacke it neuer ſo much. I deſire not to haue my familie increaſed, but I requeſt to haue onely two maids, which are neceſſary and needfull to me in this my weakneſſe and ſickneſſe of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And let not my aduerſaries fulfill their cruell mindes altogether againſt me, inbarring me of ſo ſmall a courteſie. Whereas I am ſecretly accuſed by</hi> Shrewsburie, <hi>that I haue priuily and without thy knowledge practiſed to transferre my right in</hi> Scotland <hi>vnto my ſonne, contrary to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made vnto</hi> Beale: <hi>I deſire thee not to giue credit vnto the ſuggeſtions of</hi> Beale, <hi>I promiſed nothing but vnder cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conditions, to which I am not bound, except they bee performed by thee. From that time hitherto, I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no anſwer; and there is not a word ſpoken of them; but yet the practiſes in</hi> Scotland <hi>to deſtroy me and my ſonne, haue not ceaſed. That long-laſting ſilence I cannot inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret to bee any other thing but a plaine repulſe and deniall; and ſo I ſignified by my letters to thee, and to thy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors; thoſe things which the</hi> French <hi>King and his mother imparted vnto me, I alſo ſincerely imparted vnto thee, and</hi>

                  <hi>asked thy aduice in them, but I heard not a word from thee againe. I neuer had ſo much as a thought to ſubmit my ſelfe vnto thy Councell about mine affaires and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, before I knew what it ſhould be; for it might ſeeme a meere folly ſo to doe. How my aduerſaries in</hi> Scotland <hi>doe triumph ouer me and my impriſoned ſonne, thou art not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; I attempted nothing there that may bee hurtfull vnto thee, but onely to procure a firme peace in that Kingdome, which is more to bee reſpected by mee, than by thy Councellours: foraſmuch as I haue more intereſt therein than they. I earneſtly and from my heart deſired to beſtow and confirme vnto my ſonne the title of a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therewithall to burie in the earth all diſcords and diſſentions. Is not this to pull the Diadem from my ſonnes head? But indeed mine aduerſaries would not haue it confirmed vnto my familie.

               <p>About the ſame time were ſome practiſes in <hi>England,</hi> but with no ſucceſſe, in the behalfe of the Q of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> of which the chiefeſt was <hi>Francis Throgmorton</hi> eldeſt ſonne to <hi>Iohn Throgmorton</hi> Iuſtice of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> who fell into ſuſpicion out of his letters vnto the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which were intercepted. As ſonne as hee was taken, and began to confeſſe ſome things, <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and <hi>Charles Arundel</hi> a Courtier, fled out of the land into <hi>France,</hi> who with other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, lamenting their eſtate among themſelues, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that the Queene by the wicked and craftie dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Walſingham,</hi> was eſtranged from them: That they were abuſed with contumelies and reproaches: That ſtrange kinds of ſubtiltie were inuen ted againſt them: That ſecret ſnares were ſo cunningly laid, that whether they would or no, they ſhould bee brought within the compaſſe of treaſon; and that they had no hope of ſafetie at home. And to ſay the truth, very craftie trickes and deuices were deuiſed and vſed to trie mens minds; counterfeit letters vnder the names of the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> and the fugitiues couertly ſent and left in the houſes of Papiſts, ſpies diſperſed in euery place, to hearken after rumours, and to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of words: bringers of tales, whatſoeuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation they brought, were receiued and entertained; very many examined vpon ſuſpicion, and amongſt them, <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Philip</hi> Earle of <hi>Arundel</hi> commanded to keepe his houſe, and his wife deliuered vnto the keeping of <hi>Thomas Sherley; William Howard,</hi> brother to the Earle, and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Howard</hi> their Vncle, brother vnto the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,</hi> oftentimes examined concerning letters from the

Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from <hi>Charles Paget,</hi> &amp;c. who eſcaped very narrowly for all his prudence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Paget</hi> and <hi>Charles Arundel</hi> being arriued in <hi>France,</hi> were watched and obſerued by <hi>Edward Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> the Queenes Lieger Embaſſador with the French King; but yet he could not finde out their purpoſes and practiſes. Yet dealt he with the French King, that they, <hi>Morgan</hi> and other Engliſhmen, plotting againſt their Prince and Countrey, might be remoued out of <hi>France.</hi> He was anſwered, <hi>If they practiſed any thing in France, that the King would puniſh them according to the Law; that the King could not take knowledge and doe iuſtice on them if they bad plotted any thing in England. That all Kingdomes are free vnto them that flie thither for ſuccour, that it behoueth all Kings, euery one to defend and maintaine the liberties of his Kingdome, and that Queene Elizabeth not long ſince had receiued into her kingdome Montgomery, the Prince of Condee, and other Frenchmen, and that at this very time the Embaſſador of the King of Nauarre practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome plots, lieth in England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About ſuch time as theſe things were done, <hi>Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dino de Mendoza,</hi> Embaſſador for the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> paſſed in great ſecrecie into <hi>France,</hi> fretting and fuming as if he had beene driuen violently out of <hi>England,</hi> and the right of an Embaſſador thereby vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, when he himſelfe being a man of a violent and turbulent ſpirit, abuſing the ſacred right of Embaſſade vnto treaſon, was to be purſued (as many were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) after the ancient manner of ſeueritie, with fire and ſword, and commanded to depart out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for he medled and was acceſſary with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked plots of <hi>Throgmorton</hi> and others, to bring in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine power into <hi>England,</hi> &amp; to diſpoſſeſſe the Queene. And when he was mildly reproued of thoſe things, he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18326:80"/>
was ſo farre from wiping the obiections away with a modeſt anſwer, that he re-charged againe the Queene and her Counſellors with their detention of the money of the Genowayes, with the ſuccours giuen vnto the Eſtates of the Netherlands, and vnto the Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iou,</hi> and vnto <hi>Don Antonio</hi> the Portugall, and with the piracies and ſpoiles made by <hi>Drake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet leſt the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſhould thinke that the lewd parts of <hi>Mendoza</hi> were not reuenged, but the rights of an Embaſſador violated, <hi>William Waad</hi> Clerke of the Counſell is ſent into <hi>Spaine,</hi> who ſhould plainly informe him how badly he had diſcharged the office of an Embaſſador, and withall ſhould ſignifie (leſt the Queene in ſending him away might ſeeme to renounce the ancient amitie betweene the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes) that all kinde and friendly offices ſhould be done on her part, if he ſent any other as his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, who was deſirous and willing to conſerue the amitie betweene them; conditionally that the ſame courteſies might be ſhewne vnto her Embaſſadour in <hi>Spaine.</hi> But when the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> would not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to admit <hi>Waad</hi> vnto his ſpeech, but referred him to his Counſellors, he taking it in euill part, without feare ſpake openly, that it was a moſt vſuall and receiued cuſtome, that Embaſſadors ſhould be admitted to the preſence of Princes, euen by their enemies, and in the time of the hotteſt warres: And that <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth the Emperour, father to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> admitted to his preſence the Herald, who from the French King denounced warre againſt him, and in plaine termes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to acquaint the Counſellors with his errand. And when <hi>Idiaques</hi> Secretary to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> could by no policie get out of him what his meſſage was, at laſt he receiued all the matter from <hi>Mendoza</hi> lurking ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in <hi>France.</hi> Then he laying aſide his publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18326:81"/>
in familiar manner ſignified vnto <hi>Waad,</hi> that he was very ſorry that there were ſome who cunningly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to breake the amitie, and to nouriſh diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Princes; that wrong was done to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike King himſelfe, not vnto his Embaſſadors, firſt to <hi>Deſpes,</hi> and now vnto <hi>Mendoza,</hi> and that there was no cauſe why he ſhould accuſe vnto the King any more <hi>Mendoza,</hi> who was ſufficiently diſgraced by his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious ſending out of <hi>England;</hi> or complaine that he was not admitted: And that the Catholike King did no more but like for like, ſince <hi>Mendoza</hi> had beene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed without audience; and as ſhe had referred <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza</hi> vnto her Counſellors, ſo the King in like manner put him off vnto the Cardinall <hi>Granuellan.</hi> When <hi>Waad</hi> anſwered, that there was much difference betweene him who had neuer offended the Catholike King, and <hi>Mendoza</hi> who had offended grieuouſly againſt the Queene, and had a long time not vouchſafed to come vnto her, and had committed things vnfitting an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour. Yet he could not be admitted; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard, he returned home. The moſt of the crimes which he was to obiect againſt <hi>Mendoza,</hi> were taken out of the confeſſion of <hi>Throgmorton:</hi> Who being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be apprehended, had ſecretly ſent a deske (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his ſecrets lay) vnto <hi>Mendoza.</hi> His other desks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing narrowly ſearched, there were found two Rolls or Liſts, in one of the which the names of the Hauens of <hi>England</hi> which were fit to land Forces, in the other the names of the Noblemen and Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> who profeſſed the Roman Catholike Religion, were written downe. As ſoone as he ſaw them brought out and ſhewne to him, he cried out often that he neuer ſaw them before, and that they were foiſted in to worke his deſtruction, yea euen when he was examined vpon the racke: but laid againe vpon the racke, he denied not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18326:81"/>
to anſwer vnto their Interrogatories. Being asked of thoſe Rolls or Catalogues, and for what purpoſe they were written, he made this hiſtoricall narration: <hi>That he a few yeeres ſince going vnto the waters at the Spaw, did conſult and deuiſe with Ieney and Fra Inglefield how England might be inuaded, and the forme of gouernment thereof altered and changed, and vpon that reaſon that he ſet downe the names of the Hauens and of the Noblemen. That Morgan by his letters had ſignified vnto him out of France, that the Catholike Princes had now conſulted and determined that England ſhould be inuaded, and the Queene of Scotland deliuered vnder the conduct of Guiſe as Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, who wanted nothing but money and ſome bands of men in England to ioyne with him to his helpe. To procure theſe things, that Charles Paget vnder the counterfet name of</hi> Mope <hi>was ſent ſecretly into Suſſex, where the Duke of Guiſe determined to land his Armie. That he acquainted Mendoza, who had notice and knowledge of theſe things already by the Conſpirators, with the matter, and told him the names of the Hauens and Noblemen. Neither did he denie that he promiſed his furtherance, and withall to haue admoniſhed Mendoza with what Noblemen he being a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like perſon ſhould treat of this matter, which he being a priuate man could not doe without great danger: and that he ſhewed a way to him how ſome principall Catholikes as ſoone as the forraine Forces were landed, might leuie ſouldiers in the Queenes name, and then to ioyne them to the forraine Forces.</hi> Theſe things he voluntarily confeſſed.</p>
               <p>Yet at the Barre in the Guildhall of <hi>London,</hi> being accuſed of theſe things, he preciſely denied euery one of theſe things, and auerred that they were meere deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his owne head, to auoid the torment of the racke againe; and openly accuſed the Queene of crueltie, and the examiners of falſhood, deuiſing an eſcapatorie or ſtarting-hole by the ſpace of time which was betweene
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18326:82"/>
the fault committed and the iudgement. Foraſmuch as in the thirteenth yeere of Queene ELIZABETH cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine things were made treaſons, for the which none ſhould be arraigned except the delinquent were indited within ſix moneths after the fault committed, and the crime was proued by the teſtimonie and oath of two men, or by the voluntary confeſſion of the offender, without violence; and that this time was expired long ſince, and that therefore he was not to be arraigned for the ſame. But the Iudges told him that the crimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected vnto him, were not of that kinde, but that he was liable to the Law by an ancient law of treaſon made in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth no circumſcription of time or proofe, and that by that law the ſentence of death was pronounced againſt him. Being afterward perſwaded, he fled vnto the mercy of the Queene, and againe confeſſed in a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more fully, all things which he had ſaid before; which things, not perſeuering in his words, he began to denie againe at the gallowes, but in vaine.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Waad</hi> being returned out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> was ſent to the Q. of <hi>Scotland,</hi> about a treatie to be had between her and Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay,</hi> which was propounded two yeeres ſince, and interrupted, as is ſaid before, vnto whom ſhe affirmed with great proteſtations, with what ſinceritie ſhe hath dealt about this treatie, and withall, deuoteth herſelfe and all her labour vnto the Queene, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to depend wholly on her if onely ſhee would vouchſafe her ſo much loue and honour. Moreouer, ſhe firmely promiſed, ſo that the treatie might goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that ſhe would intercede, yea, and bring to paſſe that her ſonne ſhould receiue <hi>Angus</hi> and the other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> into fauour; and alſo that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Roſſe</hi> and <hi>Glaſco,</hi> her Agents and Miniſters in <hi>France,</hi> ſhould not plot any thing againſt the Queene
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18326:82"/>
and Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and that ſhee would haue nothing to doe with the Rebels or Fugitiues of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queene ELIZABETH was glad to heare theſe things, and whereas that <hi>Angus, Marre, I Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>Glammys</hi> were fled into <hi>England,</hi> and making vſe of the opportunitie offered, ſent <hi>Beale</hi> vnto the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who together with the Earle of <hi>Shrewsburie,</hi> ſhould ſhew her, that if ſhee continued in the ſame minde with which ſhee had acquainted Maſter <hi>Waad,</hi> that <hi>Mildmay</hi> ſhould come forthwith vnto her, and treat with her about her libertie, and then ſhould talke with her in the meane while to entreat her ſonne the King to reſtore the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Fugitiues, and to tell her that they had committed no fault againſt the King, but againſt ſome violent Counſellors who gaue him euill counſell; and laſtly, that as much as they could they ſhould get out of her the pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That ſhee had propounded nothing vnto Maſter</hi> Waad, <hi>but vpon condition, and that hee whom ſhee thought to bee an honeſt man would not ſay otherwiſe. For the reſtoring of the</hi> Scots, <hi>that her labour therein would be very neceſſary, and ſhould not be wanting if ſhe certainly knew any good would redound to her ſelfe and her ſonne, ſo that they would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmit themſelues vnto the King, and be obedient vnto him; but if that were not done, that then the Queene ſhould giue aid vnto her ſonne, that they might bee reduced vnto their obedience. Moreouer, ſhe doth not cloake nor hide it, that ſhe when ſhe was ſickly, committed her ſelfe and her ſonne vnto the care and truſt of the</hi> Guiſe <hi>her moſt deare Couſin, of whoſe purpoſes or intents ſhee knew nothing,</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:18326:83"/>
                  <hi>neither would ſhe diſcouer them if ſhe knew them, vnleſſe a firme aſſurance were giuen her of her libertie; for that it was the part of an vnaduiſed perſon to forſake her aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red friends, for an vncertaine hope. She requeſted that ſhe being an abſolute Prince; might bee no more diſhonourably vſed, than Queene</hi> MARIE <hi>did ſometime deale with her ſelfe, being at that time her ſubiect, and impriſoned; or than the</hi> French <hi>King did vſe the King of</hi> Nauarre, <hi>being alſo his ſubiect, and bore armes againſt him. Shee alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted that the treatie might bee brought to an end before any in</hi> Scotland <hi>were ſent Embaſſadour about that matter. And for that the</hi> French <hi>King had acknowledged her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Embaſſadour, and</hi> Seton <hi>ſent by her ſonne into</hi> France, <hi>as Embaſſadours from Princes of the ſame authoritie and conioyned, ſhe gaue that honour to the Queene, to publiſh this Aſſociation of her and her ſonne in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her not to preiudicate the ſame.</hi> Theſe things were heard, but by terrors obiected, ſhifted off and deluded by the meanes of them who know how to nouriſh the hatred betweene the women that bore no in ward good will one to the other, eſpecially by the diſcouerie of the papers which <hi>Chreycton</hi> a Scottiſh Ieſuite ſailing into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and intercepted by ſome Sea-rouers of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> tore in peeces: but the torne papers caſt out of the ſhip, were caſt againe into the ſhip by a contrary wind, not without a miracle (as <hi>Chreycton</hi> himſelfe ſaid) and glewed together by the great labour and ſingular skill of <hi>Waad,</hi> laid open and diſcouered new plots of the Pope, of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> about the inuading of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore to occurre vnto and preuent the wicked counſels and ſecret policies of ſeditious perſons, and to prouide for the Queenes ſafetie, vpon the which both the Kingdome and Religion depended: Many men <hi>(Leiceſter</hi> being the beginner) of all eſtates in

                  <hi>England,</hi> out of common charitie, whileſt they feared not her, but were fearefull of the other, bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in a certaine Aſſociation with their mutuall oathes, ſubſcriptions and ſeales, to perſecute with all their forces vnto death, them who did attempt any thing againſt the Queene.</p>
               <p>The Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> who quickly vnderſtood that a way was made by it to make her away, wearie of her long miſerie, and fearing worſe things, propounded theſe things to the Queene and her Counſellors, by <hi>Nauus</hi> her Secretarie: <hi>If her libertie might be granted, and that ſhe might be aſſured of the ſincere minde and loue of Queene</hi> ELIZABETH, <hi>that ſhe would binde her ſelfe in a moſt ſtrict league of amitie with the Queene, moſt dutifully honour and obſerue her before all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, forget all offences paſt, acknowledge her the true and moſt rightfull Queene of England, and that ſhe would not challenge during her life any right vnto the Crowne of England, nor practiſe anything againſt her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly; and vtterly to renounce the title and armes of England, which ſhe had vſed by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Francis <hi>her husband; and alſo vnto the Bull of the Pope about her depoſition and depriuation: Yea and alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into that</hi> Aſſociation, <hi>for the ſecuritie of the Queene; and into a defenſiue league (ſauing the ancient league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene France and Scotland) yet ſo that nothing be done in the life of the Queene, or after her death, which may be hurtfull vnto her, her ſonne, and their heires in ſucceſsion, before they be heard in the Aſſemblie of the Eſtates of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. For more aſſurance of theſe things, that ſhe will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as an hoſtage in England, and if ſhe may haue leaue to depart out of England, that ſhe will giue pledges. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that ſhe will alter nothing in Scotland, ſo that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of her religion be permitted only to her and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. That ſhe will for euer forget all the wrongs done her</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:18326:84"/>
                  <hi>in Scotland, (but yet vnder that condition, that the things publiſhed to her infamie may be repealed.) That ſhe will commend vnto the King Counſellors which were deſirous to keepe peace with England; and would reconcile vnto him as much as lay in her the Noblemen that were fled into England, if they would humbly acknowledge their fault, and that the Queene gaue her word to giue aid vnto the King againſt them, if at any time they fell or departed from their obedience. That ſhe would doe nothing about her ſonnes mariage, without the priuitie of the Queene; and that ſhe would not doe anything without the priuitie of her ſonne: ſo ſhe requeſted that her ſonne might be ioyned in this treatie, whereby it may be made more ſtrong. She doubted not but that the King of France would be contented, and binde himſelfe by promiſe together with the Princes of the houſe of Lorraine, for the performance of theſe agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> She alſo deſired that theſe things might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with ſpeed, leſt any thing might happen in the meane while to hinder it. Laſtly ſhe earneſtly deſired, that ſhe might haue the fauour to haue more libertie, that therein the loue of the Queene might appeare more euidently to her.</p>
               <p>Out of theſe things, as matters of much honour and dutie, Queene ELIZABETH ſeemed to reioyce; and it was then thought ſhe was inclined to deliuer her, although there were ſome in <hi>England</hi> who ſetting new feares before her eyes, drew her from it. But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being well followed, and in a manner concluded, was moſt of all hindered by the Scots of the contrary faction, who exclaimed that Queene ELIZABETH was vtterly vndone, if ſhe were deliuered out of priſon, and both the Realmes would be vndone, if ſhe were ioyned with her ſonne in the kingdome of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and if the exerciſe of the Roman Religion were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto her, if it were but in her Court.</p>

And ſome of the Scottiſh Miniſters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> out of their Pulpits, and in their meetings, railed moſt vilely againſt their Queene: they ſpoke ill of the King and his Counſellors, and being commanded to appeare in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, obſtinately and contemptuouſly denied ſo to doe, as if the Pulpits were exempted from the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and that Eccleſiaſticall perſons were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the King, but to the Presbyterie; directly againſt the lawes made this yeere in the Aſſemblie of the States, in the which the Kings authoritie ouer all perſons both Eccleſiaſticall and Laicks, was confirmed for euer: <hi>viz.</hi> That the King and his Counſellors are competent Iudges in all cauſes; and they who would not obey the ſame, are to be accounted for Traitors.

and ſo great was her deſire of libertie, that ſhe gaue her minde and eares as well vnto the treacherous counſell of her enemies, as vnto the pernicious deuices of her friends: And ſo much the more, for that as ſhe had perſwaded her ſelfe that the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> was made to endanger her life; ſo now ſhe had an inkling that by the policie of ſome men ſhe was to be taken away from the keeping of the Earle of <hi>Shrewsburie,</hi> (who being an vpright man, did not fauour their plots) and to be committed vnto new Keepers.

taken from <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and committed to the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Amias Paulet</hi> and <hi>Drewgh Drury,</hi> and that of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (as ſome thinke) that being driuen into deſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe might be more apt to take abrupt counſels, and more eaſie to be intrapped. For <hi>Sbrewsbury</hi> in all that fifteene yeeres, had ſo prouidently kept her, that there was no place left of plots from her or againſt her. And now alſo ſhe dealt more earneſtly with the <hi>Pope</hi> and the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> by <hi>Francis Inglefield,</hi> to haſten that which was begun, and that with all expedition, whatſoeuer became of her. And <hi>Leiceſter</hi> (who was thought to ſtudy how to deceiue the right owner of the ſucceſſion) ſecretly ſent ruffians (as many ſaid) to murther her. But <hi>Drury</hi> an honeſt minded and vpright man, deteſted the wickedneſſe from his heart, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them not to haue any acceſſe vnto her. Yet ſome ſpies ſecretly crept in, and there were cloſely ſent as well counterfeit as true letters, by which her womaniſh weakneſſe might be thruſt forward to her deſtruction, as we will ſay hereafter.</p>
               <p>And to turne quite away the loue of Queene ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH from her, it was whiſpered in her eares, that <hi>Allan</hi> for the Catholikes Eccleſiaſticks of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Inglefield</hi> for the Laicks, and the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe</hi> for the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with common conſent, and with the conſent of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> had decreed that Queene ELIZABETH was to be depoſed from her Crowne, and the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> was to be diſinherited of the kingdome of <hi>England</hi> as manifeſt and open Heretiques; the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be maried to ſome Catholike Nobleman of <hi>England,</hi> he to be choſen King of <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, and the election to bee confirmed by the <hi>Pope:</hi> The lawfull children of this man by the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be declared ſucceſſors in the kingdome.

And all theſe things vpon the credit of <hi>Hart</hi> a Prieſt. But who this <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ſhould be, <hi>Walſingham</hi> made diligent inquiry, but he found not who he was.

But for that this verſe (as too plaine) did not ſo well like them, they tooke it away and in the ſtead thereof they put this:</p>

               <p>It is reported that theſe tables were intercepted and ſecretly ſhewne vnto the Queene, who knew none of them by the countenance but <hi>Barnwell,</hi> who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes come vnto her about the cauſes of the Earle of <hi>Kildare,</hi> vnto whom hee belonged; but by other tokens which ſhe was told ſhe knew the man. Truly one time walking forth for her recreation, ſhe eſpied <hi>Barnwell,</hi> and looked earneſtly on him without feare, and turning vnto <hi>Hatton</hi> Captaine of her Guard, and others, ſaid, Am not I well attended and guarded, that haue not in my company ſo much as one man that weareth a ſword?

On the XX. day of the ſame moneth, the firſt ſeuen were on a paire of gallowes ſet vpon a ſcaffold in Saint <hi>Giles</hi> his field, where they had vſed to meet, hanged, and cut downe, and their priuities cut off, bowelled and quartered as they were euen aliue, not without the note of cruelty, that is to ſay, <hi>Ballard</hi> the contriuer of the wickedneſſe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pardon of God and the Queene, with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if he had offended her. <hi>Babington</hi> (who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare beheld the execution of <hi>Ballard,</hi> whiles the other turning their faces away, and on their knees were earneſt at their praiers, ingenuouſly acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his fault, and being let downe from the gallowes, ſundry times plainly cried out in the Latine tongue, <hi>Parce mihi Domine Ieſu. Sauage</hi> (the rope breaking) fell from the gallowes, and was ſtrait pulled away,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18326:95"/>
and his priuy members cut off, and bowelled aliue. <hi>Barnwell</hi> extenuated the fault with the pretext of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and conſcience. <hi>Tichburne</hi> humbly acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his wickedneſſe, moued all the multitude to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and ſo likewiſe did <hi>Tilney,</hi> being a very proper man, and modeſt in behauiour. <hi>Abington</hi> being of a turbulent ſpirit and nature, caſting out threats and terrors, of the bloud that was ere long to bee ſhed in <hi>England.</hi> On the next day, the other ſeuen were drawne vnto the ſame place, but vſed with more mercy by the Queenes commandement, who hated the former cruelty; for euery one of them hung till they were quite dead, before they were cut downe and bowelled. <hi>Salisbury</hi> the firſt, was very penitent, and aduiſed the Catholikes not to attempt the reſtitution of Religion by force or armes, and the ſame did <hi>Dun</hi> who was the next. <hi>Iones</hi> proteſting that he had diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Salisbury</hi> from this enterpriſe, and that he vtterly condemned and diſliked the haughty and raſh ſpirit of <hi>Babington</hi> and the purpoſe of inuaſion. <hi>Charnock</hi> and <hi>Trauerſe</hi> fixed wholly to their praiers, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelues to God and the Saints. <hi>Gage</hi> extolling the bountifull liberality of the Queene toward his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and deteſting his owne treacherous ingratitude toward a Princeſſe ſo well deſeruing. <hi>Hierom Bellamy,</hi> who had hidden <hi>Babington</hi> after he was proclaimed traitor (whoſe brother priuy to the ſame offence had ſtrangled himſelfe in priſon) aſhamed and ſilent was the laſt of this company.</p>
               <p>Theſe men being executed, <hi>Nauus</hi> the Frenchman, and <hi>Curlus</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> who were Secretaries to the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being examined about the letters, copies of letters, and little notes and Ciphers found in the Queenes cloſet, of their owne will acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their ſubſcriptions, that the handwritings were

their owne, endited by her in <hi>French,</hi> taken by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus,</hi> and turned into <hi>Engliſh</hi> by <hi>Curlus:</hi> Neither did they deny that ſhe receiued letters from <hi>Babington,</hi> and that they wrote backe by her commandement in ſuch a ſenſe as is aforeſaid. Yet this is certaine out of letters, that when <hi>Curlus</hi> did at this time aske <hi>Walſingham</hi> for what he promiſed, that <hi>Walſingham</hi> did reproue him, as one forgetfull of an extraordinary grace, as that he had not confeſſed any thing but that hee could not deny, when <hi>Nauus</hi> charged him therewithall to his face.</p>
               <p>The Counſellors of <hi>England</hi> could not agree what ſhould be done with the Queene of <hi>Scotland:</hi> ſome thought good that no ſeuerity was to be vſed againſt her, but to be kept very cloſe, as well for that ſhe was not the beginner of this plot, but onely made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it; and alſo for that ſhe was ſickly, and not like to liue long. Others for the ſecuritie of Religion would haue her diſpatched out of the way, and that by the courſe of Law. <hi>Leyceſter</hi> had rather haue it done by poyſon, and ſecretly ſent a Diuine to <hi>Walſingham,</hi> to ſhew him that this was lawfull: but <hi>Walſingham</hi> prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted that he was ſo farre from allowing that any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſhould be vſed, that long agoe hee croſſed and broke the aduice of <hi>Morton,</hi> who had perſwaded to ſend her into <hi>Scotland,</hi> that ſhe might be killed in the very borders of both the kingdomes.

ſaid: <hi>I am much aggrieued that the Queene my moſt deare ſiſter is wrong informed of me, and that I, who haue ſo ſtraitly beene kept ſo many yeeres, and being now lame, after I haue offered ſo many equall and faire conditions for my liberty, haue laine ſo long time neglected: Although I haue fully forewarned her of many dangers, yet I was not beleeued, but was alwaies deſpiſed, although I am moſt neere to her in bloud. When the Aſſociation was made, and when it was confirmed in the Parlament, I foreſaw that whatſoeuer danger befell, either by forraine Princes abroad, or any harebraine fellowes at home, or for the cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I ſhould pay deare for the ſame, I hauing ſo many deadly enemies at the Court. I may take it in euill part, and I haue cauſe for it, that a league was made with my ſonne, without my priuity or knowledge, but ſuch like things I pretermit. But to come vnto theſe letters; It ſeemeth ſtrange vnto me that the Queene commandeth me, as if I were her ſubiect, to come vnto a triall: I am an abſolute Queene, neither will I doe or commit any thing, which may empaire or wrong the Royall Maieſtie of Kings and Princes, of my place and ranke, or my ſonne; My minde is not ſo deiected, neither will I yeeld and ſinke downe vnder calamity, I referre my ſelfe vnto thoſe things which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted before</hi> Bromly <hi>and the Lord</hi> De la Ware. <hi>The lawes and ſtatutes of</hi> England <hi>are to me vtterly vnknowne, I am deſtitute of counſellours, I tell you plaine I know not who may be my Peeres: my papers and notes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances are taken from me, there is none that dare pleade or ſpeake in my cauſe. I am free from all offence againſt the Queene, neither am I to be called in queſtion, but vpon mine owne word or writing, which can neuer be brought againſt me; But yet I cannot deny but that I haue commended my ſelfe and my cauſe to forraine Princes.</hi>

this anſwer put into writing, and they asked her if ſhe perſiſted in the ſame; After ſhe had heard it diſtinctly read, ſhe commended it as truly and rightly conceiued, and ſaid ſhe would perſiſt in the ſame: <hi>But,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I did not remember one thing which I wiſh may be put in: Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>world was farre more ſpacious than the kingdome of</hi> England. Laſtly, ſhe began to complaine of the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done vnto her, and the Treaſurer to rehearſe the benefits of Queene ELIZABETH beſtowed vpon her, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhee had puniſhed many who did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the right ſhe challenged vnto <hi>England,</hi> and had hindered that ſhe was not condemned by the Eſtates of the Realme, for the purſuing the mariage with the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> the rebellion in the North, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: which things when ſhe ſeemed to make ſlight of, they went away.</p>

About this matter thoſe Commiſſioners ſelected came to her againe, vnto whom ſhe ſignified that ſhee did not vnderſtand the meaning of theſe words, <hi>Since ſhe is in the protection of the Queene.</hi> The Chancellor anſwered, <hi>This to be apparant enough to any one of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but yet it is not the duty of Subiects to expound what the Queene meant, neither were they made Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for that cauſe.</hi> Then ſhe requeſted that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation which ſhe had made in former times, to bee ſhewed and to be allowed. It was anſwered, that it was neuer allowed, neither that it was to be allowed now, for that it was a wrong to the Crowne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Shee asked by what authoritie they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. It was anſwered, by the authority of the letters Patents, and the law of <hi>England. But you,</hi> ſaid ſhee, <hi>make lawes as you liſt, vnto which, it is no reaſon why I ſhould ſubmit my ſelfe, ſince that the</hi> Engliſhmen <hi>in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times refuſed to ſubmit themſelues vnto the</hi> Salicke law of the Frenchmen. <hi>But if they proceeded by the law of</hi> England, <hi>they ſhould bring a preſident for their doings, ſince that, that law for the moſt part conſiſted vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and cuſtomes. But if by the Canon Law, then no other men ought to expound the ſame, but the makers of them.</hi> It was anſwered, that they would proceed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Ciuill nor Canon lawes, but by the lawes of <hi>England:</hi> But yet that by the Ciuill and Canon lawes it might be ſhewed that ſhee ought to appeare before them, if ſhe did not refuſe to heare this; neither did ſhe refuſe to heare, but as in way of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not by way of Iuſtice or triall.</p>
               <p>Hereupon ſhe fell into other ſpeeches, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhe neuer compaſſed or deuiſed any thing to hurt or kill the Queene, that ſhe had beene offended at the wrongs and indignities done to her, that ſhe ſhould bee a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke, if ſhe were diſcourteouſly vſed; That ſhe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18326:100"/>
did by <hi>Nauus</hi> offer her labour and beſt meanes for the reuocation of the <hi>Popes Bull;</hi> That ſhe would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her innocency by letters, neither was this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: And to conclude, that all her offices of good will for this twenty yeeres haue beene reiected; with ſuch like ſmall digreſſions, her going on further they called backe, and bade her to ſay in plaine termes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhee would anſwer before the Commiſſioners; Shee replied, <hi>That this their authority was giuen to them by the new act made to enſnare her: That ſhe could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Lawes of the Queene, which ſhe vpon good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuſpected: That ſhee hauing beene hitherto of good courage, would not now wrong her anceſtors the Kings of</hi> Scotland, <hi>by acknowledging that ſhee is a ſubiect of the Crowne of</hi> England, <hi>for this is no other thing than open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confeſſe them thereby to haue beene rebels and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Yet that ſhe refuſed not to anſwer, ſo ſhe be not redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto the ranke of a ſubiect: and that ſhe had rather die a thouſand times, than to anſwer as a Criminall offender.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vnto theſe ſpeeches <hi>Hatton</hi> the Vice-Chamberlaine of the Queene ſaid; <hi>You are accuſed (but not condemned) to haue conſpired to kill our Lady and anointed Queene. You ſay you are a Queene. Be it ſo. But the Royall eſtate of a Queene doth not exempt you from anſwering vnto ſuch a crime as this is, neither by the Ciuill nor Canon law, nor by the law of Nations, nor by the law of Nature. For all Iuſtice would be of no force, yea be vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, if faults of ſuch nature ſhould be committed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out puniſhment. If you bee innocent, you doe wrong to your credit by flying from triall. You proteſt your ſelfe to be innocent, but Queene</hi> ELIZABETH <hi>is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minde, and not without cauſe, but truly to her great griefe: Therefore to examine your innocency, ſhee hath ſent with authoritie moſt honourable, moſt wiſe, and moſt vpright men, who with equity and with fauour, are to</hi>

                  <hi>heare you, and they will reioyce from their heart, if you cleare your ſelfe of this crime. Beleeue me, the Queene her ſelfe will be very glad, who ſaid to mee at my departure, that there could not a thing haue happened more grieuous vnto her, than that you are charged with this fault. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laying by the ſuperfluous priuilege of a Royall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, which can be now of no vſe, make your appearance for a triall, ſhew your innocency, leſt by ſearching of eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions you draw vpon your ſelfe ſuſpicion, and purchaſe a perpetuall blemiſh of your reputation. I doe not refuſe, ſaid ſhe, to anſwer in a full Parlament, before the Eſtates of the kingdome lawfully called, ſo that I may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared next in ſucceſsion: Yea and before the Queene and her Counſellors, ſo that my proteſtation may be admitted, and I may bee acknowledged the next kinſwoman of the Queene. In plaine termes I will not ſubmit my ſelfe vnto the iudgement of mine aduerſaries, by whom I know all the defence I can make of mine innocency, will not be allowed and receiued.</hi> The Chancellor asked her if ſhe would anſwer, if her proteſtation were admitted: She anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>I will neuer ſubmit me to the new law m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, Yet we will proceed to morrow though you be abſent, and continue obſtinate in the cauſe. She ſaid, <hi>Search and examine your conſciences, haue regard to your honour, God will requite you and your heires for your iudgement vpon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the next day being the fourteenth day of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhe ſent for ſome of the Commiſſioners, and reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, that the proteſtation might bee admitted and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. The Treaſurer asked her whether ſhee would come to triall, if the protoſtation were onely receiued and put into writing without allowance. At length ſhe condeſcended, yet with an euill will, leſt ſhee (as ſhe ſaid) might ſeeme to derogate from her predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18326:101"/>
or ſucceſſors, but that ſhee was much deſirous to cleare the crime obiected, being perſwaded by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Hatton,</hi> which ſhe had better thought on.</p>
               <p>Forthwith met and aſſembled in the Chamber of preſence, the Commiſſioners that were preſent. There was a chaire of Eſtate ſet vnder a Canopy in the vpper part of the Chamber, for the Queene of <hi>England:</hi> Againſt it lower and further off, neere vnto the railes a Chaire for the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hard to the walls on both ſides benches or formes, on the which on the one ſide ſate the Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of <hi>England,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Oxford, Kent, Darby, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Rutland, Cumberland, Warwicke, Penbroke, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne,</hi> and Vicount <hi>Mountacute;</hi> On the other ſide the Lords, <hi>Aburgeuenny, Zouch, Morley, Stafford, Grey, Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Sturton, Sandes, Wentworth, Mordant,</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bletſo, Compton</hi> and <hi>Cheiney:</hi> Next to them ſate the Knights of the Priuy Counſell, as <hi>Iames Croft, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Hatton, Francis Walſingham, Ralph Sadleir, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mildmay,</hi> and <hi>Amias Powlet;</hi> Forward before the Earles ſate the two chiefe Iuſtices, and the chiefe Baron of the Exchequer; on the other ſide, two Barons and other Iuſtices, <hi>Dale</hi> and <hi>Ford,</hi> Doctors of the Ciuill law; at a little table in the middle ſate <hi>Popham</hi> the Queenes Atturny, <hi>Egerton</hi> the Sollicitor, <hi>Gaudie</hi> the Queenes Serieant at law, the Clarke of the Crowne, and two Clarkes.</p>
               <p>When ſhe was come and had ſet her ſelfe in her ſeat, ſilence being made, <hi>Bromly</hi> the Chancellor turning to her, made a ſhort ſpeech to this purpoſe: <hi>The moſt high and mighty Queene of</hi> England <hi>being certified to her great griefe and anguiſh of minde, that you haue plotted both the deſtruction of her and of</hi> England, <hi>and alſo of Religion; according to the duty due vnto God, her ſelfe, and people, in the which leſt ſhe ſhould faile, and out of</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:18326:101"/>
                  <hi>no malice of minde, hath appointed theſe Commiſsioners, who may heare what things are obiected againſt you, and how you can cleare your ſelfe from the crimes laid againſt you, and ſhew your innocency:</hi> She ariſing vp ſaid, <hi>that ſhe came into</hi> England <hi>to ſeeke and requeſt aid, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her, neuertheleſſe that ſhee was deteined in priſon euer ſince that time.</hi> Shee proteſted, <hi>that ſhe was not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Queene, but was a free and abſolute Queene, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to be forced or compelled to be brought in or tried before the Commiſsioners or any other Iudge, for any cauſe whatſoeuer, but only God alone the Soueraigne Iudge of all, leſt that ſhe ſhould doe wrong and iniury vnto her owne Royall Maieſty, her Sonne the King of</hi> Scotland, <hi>her Succeſſors, or any other abſolute Princes: But now ſhe was there in perſon to refell the crimes obiected againſt her.</hi> And ſhe requeſted her friends or ſeruants to witneſſe theſe things. The Chancellor not acknowledging that helpe was promiſed, anſwered, <hi>That this proteſtation was to no purpoſe, for that whoſoeuer, of whatſoeuer ranke or eſtate he were in</hi> England, <hi>did offend againſt the lawes of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>may be made ſubiect to the ſame, and may be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and iudged by the late new law. And that therefore that proteſtation made to the preiudice of the lawes, and of the Queene of</hi> England, <hi>was not to be admitted.</hi> Yet the Commiſſioners commanded, as well her proteſtation, as the anſwer of the Chancellor to be recorded. Then the letters Patents, which, as I haue often ſaid, were founded vpon the Act of Parlament, being read aloud, ſhe with a great courage made a proteſtation againſt that Act, as made directly and purpoſely againſt her, and in this matter put it to their conſcience: And when the Treaſurer anſwered, that euery man in this Realme was bound to the obſeruation of the lawes, though neuer ſo lately made, and that ſhee might not ſpeake in diſgrace of the lawes, and that the Commiſſioners
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18326:102"/>
would iudge by vertue of that law, whatſoeuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations or appellations ſhe made: At length ſhe ſaid ſhee was ready and prepared to anſwer of any act whatſoeuer, done againſt the Queene of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Gawdy</hi> expounded and made plaine the Act in euery point, and affirmed, that ſhee had offended againſt the ſame, and then he made an Hiſtoricall Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Babingtons</hi> conſpiracy, and concluded, that <hi>ſhe knew of it, allowed it, promiſed helpe, and ſhewed the waies and the meanes.</hi> She with an vndanted courage anſwered, <hi>that ſhe knew not</hi> Babington, <hi>neuer receiued letters from him, nor neuer wrote vnto him, neuer plotted the deſtruction of the Queene: And that to proue it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the ſubſcription vnder her owne hand was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. She neuer heard ſo much as any man ſpeake it: that ſhe knew not</hi> Ballard, <hi>neuer maintained him, but that ſhee had heard that the Catholikes were much agrieued with many things; and that ſhe certified the Queene therewith in her letters, and had earneſtly deſired her to haue pitty of them. And that many, vtterly to her vnknowne, had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their ſeruice vnto her; yet that ſhe neuer moued any, to any wickedneſſe: and that ſhe being ſhut vp in priſon, could neither know, nor hinder the things which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon this, out of the confeſſion of <hi>Babington,</hi> ſhee was vrged that there paſſed an entercourſe of letters betweene her and <hi>Babington.</hi> She acknowledged, that ſhe had ſpeech with many by letters, neuertheleſſe it could not be gathered thereby, that ſhee knew of all their naughty practiſes: She requeſted, that a ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with her owne hand might be produced, and ſhe asked, who could haue harme by it, if ſhe had requeſted to haue letters detained almoſt a whole yeare. Then the Copies of the letters of <hi>Babington</hi> vnto her were read, in the which all the plot was deſcribed. She ſaid,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18326:102"/>
                  <hi>As concerning theſe letters, it may be that</hi> Babington <hi>might write, but let it be proued that I receiued them: if</hi> Babington <hi>or others haue affirmed this, I ſay in plaine termes they lie. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens faults are not to be laid on my back. A packet of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which was deteined almoſt a yeer, came about that time to my hands, but truly I know not by whom it was ſent to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To proue that ſhe had receiued <hi>Babingtons</hi> letters, there was read out of the confeſſion of <hi>Babington</hi> the heads of the letters which he had voluntarily confeſſed that ſhe had written backe.</p>
               <p>In like manner things taken out of the confeſſions of <hi>Ballard</hi> and <hi>Sauage</hi> were read, who confeſſed that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington</hi> had communicated vnto them letters receiued from the Queene of <hi>Scotland.</hi> She affirmed, that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington had receiued none from her, yea rather that ſhe had beene angrie with them that ſecretly ſuggeſted, and gaue counſell about the inuading of</hi> England, <hi>and warned them to beware and take heed.</hi> Then were ſhowen the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in the which the plot of <hi>Babington</hi> was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and approued. She asked to haue the copie of them, and affirmed <hi>that they came not from her, but perhaps out of her Alphabet of Cyphers in</hi> France, <hi>that ſhe hath laboured to get her libertie, which is a thing naturall to all men, and to haue treated with her friends to vſe meanes to deliuer her: Neuertheleſſe vnto many whom ſhe was not diſpoſed to name, who offered their ſeruice, ſhee had not anſwered a word, but that ſhe much deſired to turne away the ſtorme of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution from the Catholikes, and that ſhe intreated the Queen thereunto, that ſhee would not get a kingdome with the bloud of the meaneſt of all the Commons. That there are many who attempt things pernicious without her knowledge, and in ſome letters which ſhe hath receiued very lately, ſome had begged pardon of her, if they attempted any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her priuitie. That it was an eaſie matter to counterfeit the Characters and Cyphers, as a young man, who had boaſted</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:18326:103"/>
                  <hi>himſelfe to be the bastard brother to her ſonne, did very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in</hi> France. <hi>That ſhee alſo feared leſt this was contriued by</hi> Walſingham, <hi>who (as ſhee had heard it muttered) had plotted againſt the life of her and her Sonne. She proteſteth that ſhe neuer thought to hurt or kill the Queene, but that ſhe had rather more willingly bestow her life, than that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes ſhould be afflicted ſo often, and loſe their liues with ſuch grieuous torments for her ſake, and in hatred of her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> ſaid the Treaſurer, <hi>none who was an obedient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect was put to death for Religion, but many were for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, maintaining the Popes authoritie and Bull againſt the Queene. But,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I haue heard otherwiſe, and I haue read it alſo in printed bookes. The writers of ſuch bookes,</hi> replied he, <hi>wrote alſo that the Queene was depriued of her Royall dignitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walſingham,</hi> who euen now perceiued himſelfe nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and touched, roſe vp, and proteſting that his minde was not poſſeſſed with any euill will, ſaid, <hi>I call God to witneſſe, that I, as a priuate man, haue done nothing not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming an honeſt and vpright man, neither for the publike perſon which I beare haue done any thing which doth not belong vnto my place. I confeſſe that I haue beene carefull of the ſafetie of the Queene and the Realme, and haue curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſought to finde the plots againſt her. If</hi> Ballard <hi>had offered me his ſeruice, I had not refuſed it, and had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced him for his trauell and paine taken. If I haue plotted any thing with him, why did he not tell it out, that he might haue ſaued his life?</hi> She ſaid that ſhee remained conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this anſwer: ſhe requeſted <hi>him not to be angrie, for that ſhee ſo freely ſpoke what ſhee had heard, and that he would not beleeue more them that ſlandered her, than ſhe did them that defamed him: That ſpies were men not to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, for they diſſemble one thing, and ſay another. That he would by no meanes beleeue that ſhee conſented to hurt or kill the Queene.</hi> And then weeping amaine, ſaid, <hi>I will</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:18326:103"/>
                  <hi>neuer caſt away my ſoule in conſpiring to kill my moſt deare ſiſter.</hi> The Lawyers made anſwer, that it would bee ſoundly proued by teſtimonies preſently. Theſe things were done before noone.</p>
               <p>In the afternoone, for the more ſubſtantiall proofe thereof, the copie of the letters which <hi>Charles Paget</hi> wrote, was brought forth and ſhewed, and <hi>Curlus</hi> one of her Secretaries, witneſſed, that ſhee receiued, of the conference betweene <hi>Mendoza</hi> and <hi>Ballard</hi> about the counſell of inuading <hi>England.</hi> She anſwered, <hi>This is nothing to the matter, neither doth it proue that I conſented to hurt or kill the Queene.</hi> Moreouer, the Lawyers went forward, to proue that ſhe was priuie of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and alſo conſpired to kill the Queene, out of the confeſſion of <hi>Babington,</hi> and the letters betweene her and <hi>Babington;</hi> in the which hee had ſaluted and ſtiled her <hi>his high and mightie Ladie and Queene.</hi> And by the way they rehearſed, that there was a Counſell holden of aſſigning and conferring ouer the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> vnto the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> She acknowledged, that a Prieſt came to her, and ſaid, if ſhee did not ſtop it, that both ſhe and her ſonne ſhould bee excluded from their inheritance: but ſhee would not tell the name of the Prieſt. And moreouer, ſhee ſaid, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> challenged a right vnto the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and would not giue place vnto any, but vnto her. Then they preſſed her with the teſtimonies of <hi>Nauus</hi> and <hi>Curlus</hi> her Secretaries, out of the confeſſion of <hi>Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the letters that paſt betweene <hi>Babington</hi> and her; and all the credit of their proofes depended vpon the teſtimonie of them, and yet they were not brought forth face to face. She did acknowledge <hi>Curlus</hi> to bee an honeſt man, but not a ſufficient witneſſe againſt her. That <hi>Nauus,</hi> ſometimes Secretarie to the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> commended to her by the <hi>French</hi> King,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18326:104"/>
might be eaſily induced either by bribes, or hope, or feare, to beare falſe witneſſe, as one, who ſundry times had made raſh oathes, and had <hi>Curlus</hi> ſo tractable and at his becke, that hee would write whatſoeuer hee bade. And it may bee that they might put into the letters, ſuch things which ſhee had not endired, and alſo that ſuch letters came to their hands, which yet ſhee neuer ſaw. And broke out into ſuch or the like words: <hi>The Maieſtie and ſafetie of Princes will bee of ſmall authoritie, and bee contemned, if they doe depend on the writings and teſtimonie of their Secretaries. I did endite vnto them nothing but that which nature hath taught mee; that I might recouer and get my libertie at laſt; neither am I to be conuinced, but out of mine owne words or writing. If they haue written any thing that may be hurt and dammage to my moſt deare ſiſter, vnwitting to mee, let them bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for their inconſiderate boldneſſe. I certainly know if they were here preſent, they would in this cauſe acquite mee of this fault. And if I had my papers here, I could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer vnto theſe things in particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt thoſe things, the Treaſurer obiected, that ſhe had determined to ſend her ſonne into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to aſſigne ouer vnto the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the right that ſhee chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged in the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> Vnto whom ſhee anſwered, <hi>That ſhe had no Realme that ſhe could giue away, but yet it was lawfull to giue away her owne things at her will and pleaſure.</hi> When the Alphabets of Cyphers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed vnto <hi>Babington,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lodouick,</hi> and to the Lord of <hi>Fernihurſt,</hi> were obiected vnto her out of the teſtimonie of <hi>Curlus,</hi> ſhee denied not, <hi>but that ſhe had ſet downe more, and among the reſt, that for the Lord</hi> Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douick, <hi>at ſuch time as ſhee commended him and another vnto the dignitie of a Cardinall, and as ſhee hoped without offence, foraſmuch that it was no leſſe lawfull for her to haue commerce of letters, and treat of her affaires, with men of</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:18326:104"/>
                  <hi>her Religion, as it was for the Queene, with the profeſſors of the other Religion:</hi> Then they preſſed her thicker, with the agreeing teſtimonies of <hi>Nauus</hi> and <hi>Curlus,</hi> repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againe, and ſhee alſo repeated her former anſwers; or elſe repulſed them with preciſe denials, proteſting againe, that ſhee neither knew <hi>Babington</hi> nor <hi>Ballard.</hi> Among theſe ſpeeches, when the Treaſurer put in his verdict, ſaying, that ſhe knew well <hi>Morgan,</hi> who ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent <hi>Parry</hi> to kill the Queene, and had giuen him an annuall penſion, ſhe replied, <hi>ſhe knew that</hi> Morgan <hi>had loſt for her cauſe all that he had, and therefore ſhe was bound in honour to releeue him, and that ſhee was not bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge an iniurie done by a well deſeruing friend vnto the Queene, but yet that ſhee had terrified him from making any ſuch attempts. But yet penſions,</hi> ſaid ſhee, <hi>were giuen out of</hi> England <hi>vnto</hi> Patricke Grey, <hi>and to the</hi> Scots <hi>that were mine enemies, as likewiſe to my ſonne.</hi> The Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer anſwered: <hi>At ſuch time as the reuenues of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of</hi> Scotland <hi>were much diminiſhed and impaired by the negligence of the Viceroyes, the Queene gaue ſome libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie vnto the King your ſonne, her moſt neere allied Couſin.</hi> Afterward was ſhewed the contents of the Letters vnto <hi>Inglefield,</hi> and to the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and vnto <hi>Bernardino de Mendoza,</hi> concerning forraine aid. And when to thoſe ſhee had made anſwer: <hi>Theſe things touch not nor concerne the death of the Queene; &amp; if ſo be that ſtrangers deſired and laboured to deliuer her, it was not to be obiected againſt her; and that ſhe had ſundry times ſignified vnto the Queene, that ſhe would ſeeke for her libertie:</hi> The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was adiourned vnto the next day.</p>
               <p>On the next day ſhe repeated againe her former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, and requeſted that it might be recorded, and a copie thereof deliuered vnto her, lamenting <hi>that the moſt reaſonable conditions which ſhe had propounded often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vnto the Queene, were alwaies reiected, yea when ſhe</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:18326:105"/>
                  <hi>promiſed to giue her ſonne, and the ſonne of the Duke of</hi> Guiſe <hi>for hoſtages, that the Queene, or the kingdome of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>ſhould take no harme by her. That ſhe ſaw long ere now, that all waies of libertie were ſtopped, but now that ſhee is moſt baſely vſed, to haue her honour and eſtimation called into queſtion, before Petifoggers and Lawyers, who draw euery circumſtance into conſequences by their quiddities and trickes, ſince that anointed and conſecrated Princes are not ſubiect, nor vnder the ſame lawes that priuate men are. Moreouer when they haue authoritie and commiſsion giuen them of examining</hi> Things tending to the hurt of the Queens Perſon; <hi>yet notwithſtanding the cauſe is ſo handled and letters wreſted, that the Religion which ſhe profeſſeth, and the immunitie and maieſtie of forraine Princes, and the priuate commerces betweene Princes, are called into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhe below her Royall dignitie is brought to the barre, as it were to be arraigned, and to no other purpoſe, but that ſhe may be wholly excluded from the fauour of the Queene, and from her right in the Succeſsion, when ſhe appeared vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to confute all obiections, leſt ſhee might ſeeme to haue beene ſlacke in the defence of her honour and credit.</hi> Shee alſo called to their memorie, <hi>how</hi> ELIZABETH <hi>her ſelfe had beene drawne into queſtion for the conſpiracie of</hi> Wyat, <hi>when yet ſhe was moſt innocent,</hi> Religiouſly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <hi>that although ſhe wiſhed the good and welfare of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, yet ſhe would not haue it to be done by the death and bloud of any one. That ſhe had rather play the part of</hi> Heſter, <hi>than of</hi> Iudith, <hi>make interceſsion vnto God for the people, rather than to take away the life of the meaneſt of the people.</hi> And then appealing vnto the Maieſtie of God, and vnto the Princes that were allied vnto her; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating againe her proteſtation, ſhe requeſted that there might be another aſſembly about this matter, and that ſhee might haue a Lawyer aſſigned vnto her, and that ſince ſhe was a Prince, that they would giue credit <hi>to the</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:18326:105"/>
                  <hi>word of a Prince; for it was extreme folly to ſtand vnto their iudgement, whom ſhe moſt plainly ſaw to be armed with fore-iudgements againſt her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vnto theſe ſpeeches the Treaſurer ſaid: <hi>Since that I beare a twofold perſon, the one of a Delegate or Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the other of a Counſellor; Firſt, take of me a few things, as from a Commiſsioner: Your Proteſtation is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the copie thereof ſhall be deliuered vnto you. Wee haue authoritie giuen vs vnder the Queenes owne hand, and the great Seale of</hi> England, <hi>from the which there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation: neither come we with a fore-iudgement, but to iudge according to the rule and ſquare of Iuſtice. The Lawyers aime at no other thing, but that the truth may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare how farre forth you haue offended againſt the Queens perſon. We haue ful power giuen vs to heare and examine the matter, yea in your abſence; yet we deſire to haue you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, leſt we ſhould ſeeme to diminiſh your honour or credit: neither haue we thought to object vnto you any thing, but that you haue done or attempted againſt the Queenes perſon. The letters are read for no other purpoſe, but to lay open the practiſe againſt the Queene, and other things pertaining thereunto, and are ſo mingled with other things, that they cannot be ſeparated. And therefore the whole letters, and not parcels taken out of ſundrie places of them, are read, for as much as circumſtances doe giue credit vnto the things of which you dealt with</hi> Babington.</p>
               <p>Shee interrupting him, ſaid, <hi>That the circumſtances might be proued, but not the deed, that her integritie depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not vpon the credit and memory of her Secretaries, though ſhee knew them honeſt: but yet if they haue confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſomething out of feare of the racke, hope of reward, and of impunitie, it is not to be admitted and receiued out of iuſt cauſes, which ſhee may declare in another place; that the minds of men are carried away by ſundrie kinds of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that they would neuer haue confeſſed ſuch things, but</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:18326:106"/>
                  <hi>either for gaine, or vpon ſome hope: that letters may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected vnto others, than vnto whom they are written, and that many things which ſhe had not dictated, had many times beene inſerted: if her papers had not beene taken away, and that ſhee had a Secretarie, ſhe could with more eaſe confute their obiections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But nothing</hi> (ſaid the Treaſurer) <hi>ſhall be obiected, but from the nine and twentieth day of</hi> Iune, <hi>neither will the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers doe any good, ſince the Secretaries and</hi> Babington <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, without torture haue affirmed you to haue ſent letters vnto</hi> Babington; <hi>which thing, although you deny, let the Commiſsioners iudge, whether more credit is to be giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their affirmation or your deniall. But to come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As a Counſellour I tell you this, you haue made many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions about your libertie at ſundrie times: that nothing came thereof, was long of you, or of the</hi> Scots, <hi>and not of our Queene, for the Noble-men of</hi> Scotland <hi>abſolutely denied to deliuer the King for hoſtage. And when laſt of all there was a treatie for your deliuery,</hi> Parry <hi>was ſent ſecretly by</hi> Morgan <hi>to kill the Queene. Ah</hi> (ſaid ſhee) <hi>you are my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemie: Yea rather</hi> (replied he) <hi>I am an enemie to the enemies of Queene</hi> ELIZABETH: <hi>but enough of theſe things; Let vs therefore proceed vnto proofes: when ſhee denied to heare, Yet we will heare</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>and I alſo</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>in another place, and will defend my ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now were read againe the letters vnto <hi>Charles Paget,</hi> in which ſhee told him, there was no other way for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to bring the <hi>Netherlands</hi> into ſubiection, than by placing a Prince in <hi>England</hi> who might doe him good: the letters vnto the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> to haſten aid and forces to inuade <hi>England:</hi> the letters of Cardinall <hi>Allan,</hi> in which he ſaluted her as his <hi>high and ſoueraigne Ladie,</hi> and ſignified that the buſineſſe was commended vnto the care of the Prince of <hi>Parma.</hi> As theſe were in reading, ſhe interrupted them, ſaying: <hi>That</hi> Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18326:106"/>
                  <hi>and her Secretaries accuſe her to excuſe themſelues; that ſhee neuer heard of the ſix Ruffians; that the other things were not to the matter; that ſhee eſteemed</hi> Allan <hi>to bee a reuerend Prelate; that ſhee did acknowledge no other head of the Church, than the Pope of</hi> Rome; <hi>that ſhe was not ignorant in what regard and eſtimation ſhee was with him and with forraine Princes, nor could ſhee hinder it, if they in their letters called her Queene; that her Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſince they did againſt their office, faith, and fidelitie, confirmed by oath vnto her, deſerued no credit; that there was no credit to be giuen to them that were once forſworne, though they ſwore againe by all the oathes of God; neither that they did thinke themſelues tied with any oath whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer in conſcience, ſince that they haue ſworne vnto her before that loyaltie and ſecrecie, neither for that they were not ſubiects of</hi> England: <hi>that</hi> Nauus <hi>had written often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times otherwiſe than ſhe had dictated, and that</hi> Curlus <hi>had written all whatſoeuer</hi> Nauus <hi>had bidden, but that ſhe would maintaine and vphold their faults in all things, but thoſe that might blemiſh her honour. Perhaps alſo theſe fellowes did confeſſe to doe themſelues a benefit, whilſt they might thinke not to hurt her, with whom, as with a Queene, they thought mildneſſe ſhould be vſed; that ſhee heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of</hi> Ballard, <hi>but of one</hi> Hallard, <hi>who had offered his ſeruice, which yet ſhe had refuſed, for that ſhee had heard that the ſame man had beene belonging to</hi> Walſingham.</p>
               <p>Afterward, when the notes out of the letters vnto <hi>Mendoza,</hi> which <hi>Curlus</hi> had acknowledged that hee wrote out in a priuate character, were read before her, and ſhe was vrged out of them, as if ſhee had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to transfer the right in the Kingdome vnto the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> and that <hi>Allan</hi> and <hi>Parſons</hi> ſtaied now at <hi>Rome</hi> for that purpoſe and intent: Shee complaining that her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants had broken their fidelitie confirmed by oath, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: <hi>When I being in priſon, and languiſhed with care,</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:18326:107"/>A
<hi>without hope of libertie, and there was not any more hope left of euer bringing to paſſe thoſe things, which very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny expected of me in my ſickneſſe and declining age. Many thought it ſit that the Succeſsion of the Realme of</hi> England <hi>ſhould be eſtabliſhed in the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>or in a Catholike</hi> Engliſh-man: <hi>and a booke was brought to proue the right of the</hi> Spaniard; <hi>which being not admitted by me, I offended many. But all my hope in</hi> England <hi>being now deſperate, I am reſolued not to reiect forraine helpe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sollicitor admoniſhed the Commiſſioners ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly what might become of them, their Honours, goods, and poſteritie, if the Kingdome ſhould be ſo transferred: but the Treaſurer ſhewed them that the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> could not be transferred, but to deſcend by the right of ſucceſſion according to the Lawes.</p>
               <p>Shee requeſted that ſhee might be heard in a full and open Parlament, or that ſhee her ſelfe might ſpeake to the Queene (whom ſhe hoped would haue reſpect vnto a Queene) and the Counſellors. And then riſing from her ſeat with a cheerefull countenance, ſhe ſpoke a few words aſide with the Treaſurer, <hi>Hatton, Walſingham,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Warwicke.</hi> Theſe things being done, the Aſſembly or meeting was adiourned vnto the fiue and twentieth day of <hi>October,</hi> in the Starre-chamber at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Thus much of this matter out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of <hi>Edward Barker, principall Regiſter to the Queenes Maieſtie, and of</hi> Thomas Wheeler, <hi>a Notarie publike, Regiſter of the Audience of Canterburie,</hi> and of other credible perſons that were preſent. And in this manner the Queene thought good to haue her tried, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lawyers, who are ſo curious in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of words, and following of formes, rather than in the expounding of the Lawes themſelues, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their forme of law, ſhe was to be called to triall
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18326:107"/>
in the Countie of <hi>Stafford,</hi> and to be brought to hold vp her hand at the barre publikely before the Bench, and to be tried by twelue men, ſaying this indeed was a ſweet and goodly forme of iudgment againſt a Prince. But to auoid and put away ſuch abſurdities, ſhee thought it better to referre ſo great a cauſe vnto the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen of the Land, and Realme, and to the Iudges; and this ſcarce ſufficeth, when as (ſaid ſhee) all mens eies are caſt vpon vs Princes, as being ſet aloft, as on a high ſcaffold, ſo that in vs euen the leaſt blemiſh or ſpot is ſeene afarre off, ſo that we are carefully to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that we doe nothing vnworthy of our ſelues.</p>
               <p>But to returne where I left: At that day met all the Commiſſioners (but the Earles of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke,</hi> who were then ſicke) and after that <hi>Nauus</hi> and <hi>Curlus</hi> had affirmed and confirmed before them, that euery and ſingular the letters and copies of letters, which were produced before, to bee moſt true vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their oathes, <hi>viua voce,</hi> voluntarily without hope or reward; the ſentence againſt the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> was pronounced and confirmed with the ſeales and ſubſcriptions of the Commiſſioners; and recorded in theſe words: <hi>By their aſſent, conſent and accord, they doe pronounce, giue, and ſay their Sentence and Iudgement, at the day and place laſt rehearſed, that after the end of the aforeſaid Seſsion of Parliament, ſpecified in the aforeſaid Commiſsion,</hi> viz. <hi>after the aforeſaid firſt day of</hi> Iune, <hi>in the</hi> 27. <hi>yeere aforeſaid, and before the date of theſaid Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diuers things were imagined and compaſſed within this Realme of</hi> England, <hi>by</hi> Anthony Babington <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with the priuitie of the ſaid</hi> MARIE, <hi>pretending title vnto the Crowne of this Realme of</hi> England, <hi>tending to the hurt, death and deſtruction of the Royall perſon of our ſaid Ladie, the Queene. And to wit, that after the aforeſaid firſt day of</hi> Iune, <hi>in the ſeuen and twentieth yeere aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:18326:108"/>
                  <hi>and before the date of the aforeſaid Commiſsion, the ſaid</hi> MARIE <hi>pretending title vnto the Crowne of this Realme of</hi> England, <hi>compaſſed and imagined within this Realme of</hi> England <hi>diuers things tending to the hurt, death and deſtruction of the Royall perſon of our Lady the Queen, againſt the forme of the Statute ſpecified in the aforeſaid Commiſsion.</hi> Of this Sentence which depended whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the credit of the Secretaries, neither were they brought face to face, according to the firſt Statute of the 13. yeere of Queene ELIZABETH her ſelfe, was very much ſpeech and different amongſt men, ſome iudging them vnworthy of credit, and others againe thought them worthy to be beleeued. I haue ſeene the Apologie of <hi>Nauus</hi> written vnto King <hi>Iames,</hi> in the yeere 1605. in the which hee doth laboriouſly excuſe himſelfe, in proteſting that hee was neither the Author, nor perſwader, nor firſt diſcouerer of that plot or deuice, neither that hee failed at all in his dutie through negligence or incircumſpection, but rather that he ſtoutly did impugne the heads of the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt his Ladie this day. Which thing yet doth not appeare by the publike records. But the ſame day it was declared by the Commiſſioners, and by the Iudges of the Realme, <hi>That that Sentence did derogate nothing from</hi> IAMES <hi>King of</hi> Scotland <hi>in his right or honour, but him to be in the ſame place, eſtate and right, as if that Sentence had not beene giuen at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a ſhort time after there was a Parlament holden at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the which the Eſtates of the Kingdome who had approued and confirmed by their voices the ſentence pronounced againſt the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by one conſent and accord deliuered by the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor vnto the Queene a ſupplication, in which they moſt earneſtly beſought her, that for the conſeruation of the true Religon, the tranquillitie of the Realme, ſafetie
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18326:108"/>
of the Queene, the good eſtate of them and of their poſteritie, the ſentence giuen againſt MARY Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> according to the Law might be publiſhed. They fetcht their reaſons from the dangers hanging ouer the heads of their Religion, her Royall Perſon, and Realme, by her who nurſed vp in the Religion of the Papiſts, and ſworne one of the Holy League to root out the Religion of the Proteſtants, had challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged long the Realme as due to her, and had thought it a moſt iuſt thing to oppugne a woman excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and meritorious to depriue her of her life. She had ſubucrted and ouerthrowne the flouriſhing fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Realme, and laid fewell vnto all plots con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued and tumults in <hi>England.</hi> To ſpareher, was no other thing but to vndoe the people, who will take it in euill part if ſhe be ſuffered to eſcape without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will not beleeue themſelues freed from the oath of the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> except ſhe were put to death. Laſtly, they called to her remembrance what fearefull examples of Gods puniſhment there were againſt King <hi>Saul</hi> for that he killed not <hi>Agag;</hi> and vpon <hi>Achab,</hi> for that he killed not <hi>Benadad.</hi> Thus ſaid the States of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament.</p>
               <p>The Queene with a maieſticall countenance and voice anſwered vnto this effect: <q>The benefits of Almightie God are ſo great and ſo many toward me, that I doe not only acknowledge them moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but doe admire them as miracles, foraſmuch as I cannot expreſſe them in words. Although there be no mortall man more beholding to the Maieſtie of God than I my ſelfe, ſo oft times deliuered from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers not without miracle; yet I am not indebted more than for this only thing, which I account as a miracle; that is to ſay, That as I receiued and tooke vpon me the gouernment of the Realme with
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18326:109"/>
the full conſent and good will of all, ſo I ſee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the ſame, if not your greater loue and good will toward me, after that XXVIII. yeeres be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired: and if I ſhould faile therein now, and that it did not continue ſtill, I might perchance be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to breathe, but ſurely not to liue. But now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though attempts be made againſt my life, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe nothing troubleth me more, than that ſhe who is of the ſame ſex, of the ſame ſtocke and linage, and alſo of my bloud and kindred, hath beene acceſſarie to the ſame. And I am ſo farre off from being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious toward her, as that when ſome plots againſt me came to light, I wrote vnto her, that if ſhe would confeſſe them in her priuate letters vnto me, they ſhould be wrapped vp in ſilence. Neither did I write thus with this minde, to enſnare her, for that whatſoeuer ſhe could confeſſe, was knowne to me. Yet neuertheleſſe though things are come to this paſſe that they are, if ſhe would truly repent, and that none would vndertake her cauſe againſt mee, and that hereupon my life only, and not the ſafetie of all the people did depend (I would not haue you thinke I faine) I would truly moſt willingly forgiue her: yea if <hi>England</hi> by my death might flouriſh more, and haue a better Prince, I would moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily lay downe my life; for I doe deſire not to liue, but for the good of the people, and not of my ſelfe. Neither is there any cauſe, hauing liued in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I haue, why I ſhould deſire to liue, or feare to die. I am not ignorant of all kinde of lifes, for I haue obeyed, and I haue gouerned; I haue had good neighbours, and alſo euill; I haue found treacherie where I truſted: I haue euill beſtowed benefits, and I haue beene euill reported of when I haue done well. When I call theſe things paſt to minde, ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18326:109"/>
the things preſent, and expect future things, I thinke them moſt happie who die ſoone: againſt ſuch euils as theſe I put on a manly minde, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer befall vnto me, death may not take and finde me vnprouided.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>As concerning theſe treaſons, I will not ſo preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my ſelfe, or the lawes of my Kingdome, that I doe not thinke but that ſhe the author and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of this treaſon, is a ſubiect, and liable by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient lawes, although this new law had neuer beene made; the which neuertheleſſe was not enacted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to entrap her, as many folkes that fauour her doe ſuſpect and imagine. It was ſo farre off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made to enſnare her, that it was rather done to premoniſh and deterre her from attempting any thing againſt it. And ſince that it hath the force of a law, it was thought meet to proceed againſt her by the ſame. But you Lawyers be ſo curious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in examining the words and letters of the law, and following your formalities, rather than in the expounding the lawes themſelues, that by your formes ſhe was (as is ſaid before) within the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Stafford</hi> in perſon to be arraigned, ſtanding at the barre, and holding vp her hand, and to be tried by the verdict of twelue men. Aſſuredly it were a goodly forme of iudgement vpon a Prince. To auoid ſuch like abſurdities, I thought it moſt fit to referre ſo great a cauſe to be examined by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and Iudges; and this is ſcarce ſufficient, for that the eyes of all men are fixed on vs that are Princes, ſtanding aloft (as it were) on a Theater or Stage, and in vs the leaſt blemiſh is ſeene, be it neuer ſo farre off: ſo that we are very carefully to prouide and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that we commit and doe nothing vnworthy of our ſelues. But you by this new law haue brought
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18326:110"/>
me into a very great ſtrait, that I ſhould ſet downe the determination for the puniſhment of her, who is a Princeſſe moſt neere to me in bloud, and whoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and plots haue ſo grieued my heart, that not to increaſe it by hearing the ſame rehearſed, I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ablented my ſelfe from this aſſembly of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not for feare of ſome lying in wait to kill me, as ſome imagine: yet I will vtter this ſecret (though I be no blabbe) I ſaw with theſe eies, and read the oath wherein ſome haue bound themſelues to kill me within a mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Your Aſſociation for my ſafetie I haue not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet I neuer ſo much as thought of ſuch a thing before the ſame was ſhewed mee vnder their hands and ſeales.

               <p>When they had deliberated and conſulted much, and a long time, and had iudged both the good and the euill of the Prince to concerne all men, they fall againe to the ſame opinion with one voice, and for theſe cauſes: <hi>For that the Queene could not be in ſafetie, as long as the Queene of</hi> Scotland <hi>liued, except ſhee repented ſeriouſly, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged her crimes, or elſe was tied and kept in a ſtraiter priſon, and with deeds of writing vnder her hand, or by oath, or ſhould giue hoſtages, or depart out of the Realme.

They held and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſtraiter cuſtodie, writings vnder her hand, oath and hoſtages as nothing, for as much as theſe things vaniſhed in ſmoake, preſently as ſoone as the Queene was dead or made away; but if ſhee departed out of the Realme, they feared ſhee would forthwith aduance her Standards to inuade the Kingdome.</hi> When the Chancellor, and <hi>Puckering,</hi> Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Lower houſe, had declared theſe things at large, vrging to haue the ſentence put in execution, <hi>For as much as it was iniuſtice to deny the execution of law, if it were to any one of her ſubiects that deſired it, much more to all the</hi> Engliſhmen <hi>efflagitating it ſo much with one voice and one heart.</hi> Vnto whom the Queene made a Speech in this manner.</p>

               <p>About the ſame time the Lord <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> and <hi>Beale</hi> are ſent to the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſignifie the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence giuen againſt her, and that the ſame as moſt iuſt was approued and confirmed by the authoritie of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, and that the States did very much vrge the ſame in reaſon of <hi>Iuſtice, Securitie, and Neceſsitie;</hi> and therefore ſhould perſwade her that acknowledging her ſinnes againſt God and the Queene, ſhe might by this repentance before her death, purge and cleanſe her from her ſinnes; inſinuating, that as long as ſhe liued the Religion receiued in <hi>England</hi> could not ſtand firme. Hereupon ſhe with an vnwonted alacritie and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe ſeemed to triumph, giuing thankes to God,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18326:113"/>
and reioycing to her ſelfe, that ſhe was accounted an inſtrument for the re-eſtabliſhment of Religion in this Iſland: And vehemently beſought them that ſhee might haue a Catholike Prieſt to direct her conſcience and adminiſter the Sacraments: and vtterly reiected the Biſhop and Deane, whom they commended as fit men for that purpoſe, and gaue the Engliſh nation a bitter taunt, in ſaying oftentimes, <hi>that the Engliſhmen had vſed crueltie toward their Kings in killing them now and then, ſo that now it was not ſtrange if alſo they exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed tyrannie on me borne and come alſo of their bloud.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>L'aubeſpineus</hi> the French Embaſſador ſtopped and ſtaied a little the publication of the iudgement; but ſome Courtiers diligently labouring in it, in the moneth of December it was publikely proclaimed thorow the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> the Maior, the Aldermen, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Citizens being preſent, and afterward thorow all the Realme. In the preface the Queene did in earneſt manner proteſt that this Proclamation was wrung out and extorted from her, not without great anxietie of minde, by great neceſſitie, and the moſt vehement ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of the Eſtates of the Realme, though there were ſome who thought this to be ſpoken by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans policie, who deſire to ſeeme alwayes to doe that which they doe by coaction, though they deſire it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much.</p>
               <p>The diuulging of this direfull and dolefull Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being told vnto the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhee was ſo farre off from being deiected, that rather with a reſolued and ſtaied countenance ſhe gaue thankes vnto God, with lifting vp her hands vnto heauen. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Powlet</hi> her Keeper depriued her of all dignitie and reſpect, and ſhe was no more accounted of but as a meane woman of the baſeſt ranke, yet ſhe endured it with a moſt quiet minde. But hauing gotten leaue of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18326:113"/>
him with too much adoe, by letters vnto Queene ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH dated the nineteenth day of December, <hi>ſhe declareth her ſelfe free from all malice and hatefull minde againſt her, giueth thankes vnto God for that ſentence of death, who would haue the end of her ſorrowfull life to come. She intreateth her that ſhe may be obliged and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden vnto her only, and not vnto others, for theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that follow, ſince that ſhe could expect and looke for no good from the hot-minded Puritans, who carried all away in</hi> England. <hi>Firſt, that when her enemies were glutted and ſatisfied with the ſhedding of her innocent bloud, that her body may be carried by her ſeruants to be buried in ſome hallowed ground, eſpecially into France, where her mother reſteth in peace; ſince that violence hath beene offered vnto the aſhes of her forefathers and anceſtors in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and the Churches either pulled downe or prophaned; neither could ſhe hope for a buriall with Catholike rites in</hi> England, <hi>amongst the ancient Kings the anceſtors to both of them: ſo that at laſt her body may reſt, which conioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned to her ſoule did neuer reſt nor had quiet. The ſecond was (foraſmuch as ſhe feared the ſecret villanie of many men) that ſhe might not be put to death ſecretly, without the knowledge of Queene</hi> ELIZABETH, <hi>but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of her ſeruants and others, who might beare true wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her faith toward Chriſt, her obedience to the Church, and the end of her life, againſt the falſe rumours which her aduerſaries might ſpreade and deuiſe. The third was, that her ſeruants might freely and peaceably depart, and might goe whither they would, and enioy the legacies ſhe had bequeathed vnto them in her Teſtament. Theſe things ſhe requeſted very earneſtly in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, by the ſoule and memorie of</hi> HENRY <hi>the ſeuenth, progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to them both, by the royall honour that ſhe had borne.</hi> Then ſhe complained, <hi>that all royall furniture was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently taken away by the commandement of ſome of her</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:18326:114"/>
                  <hi>Counſellors, and forebodeth that their malice would breake out vnto greater matters.</hi> And addeth, <hi>if they had ſhewen the letters and papers taken away without fraud and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, that it would haue plainly appeared, that there was no other cauſe of her death, than the too ſcrupulous care of ſome men of the ſecuritie of Queene</hi> ELIZABETH. <hi>Laſtly, ſhe earneſtly deſired her to write a few words with her owne hand concerning theſe matters.</hi> But whether theſe letters came euer to the hands of Queene ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, I cannot ſay.</p>
               <p>But ſundry men talked in ſundry manners according to their ſundry wits, of this matter; not to ſpeake of the Clergie men of both ſides, who are for the moſt part vehement in their opinions.</p>
               <p>There were ſome plaine and indifferent weighers of matters, who thought they dealt very rigorouſly with her, for that ſhe was a free and abſolute Princeſſe, aboue whom none had any authoritie but God alone, for that ſhe was ſo very neere of kinne vnto Queene ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, who alſo had promiſed very liberally in the word of a Prince, vnto her driuen out of her Realme, as ſoone as ſhe was arriued in <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Henry Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemore,</hi> all humanitie, courteſie, and rights of hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; and yet on the other ſide had deteined her in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and had violated the ſacred bonds of friendly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie. That ſhe could be in no other eſtate than of one taken in the warre, and that all the meanes of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſafetie and libertie is lawfull to them that be taken in the warre. That ſhe could not offend in the caſe of treaſon, in that ſhe was no ſubiect, and the like hath no power ouer the like; and that thereupon the iudgement of the Emperour againſt <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Sicilie</hi> was void and of none effect, for that he was not ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Empire. That the Embaſſadors of Princes, if they ſhall conſpire againſt the King vnto whom they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18326:114"/>
are ſent Embaſſadours, are not touched as Traytors, much leſſe the Princes themſelues. And that the Affect is not to be puniſhed, except the Effect follow. And it was neuer heard that a Prince was put to death by the hand of an executioner. Moreouer, that ſhee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned againſt the Law of God, the Ciuill Law of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Lawes of <hi>England;</hi> yea, againſt the firſt Statute of the Parlament in the XIII. yeere of Queene ELIZABETH her ſelfe, in the which it was enacted, <hi>that none ſhould be arraigned for conſpiring againſt the Queenes life, but by the teſtimonie and oath of two lawfull witneſſes, to be brought forth face to face againſt the partie arraigned:</hi> and in this iudgement no witneſſe was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, but ſhee was oppreſſed and caſt by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of her Secretaries, who were abſent.

And that word of the Emperour <hi>Hadrian</hi> was commended, <hi>Credit is to be giuen vnto witneſſes, and not vnto teſtimonies.</hi> Theſe men alſo to themſelues, or their aſſured friends, complained, that buſie fellowes were ſuborned, who by diſſimulation, counterfeit letters, and contriued de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, had cunningly deceiued a woman eaſie to bee wronged, and greedie of libertie, ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There were others who thought ſhee was not a free and abſolute, but only a Titularie Queene, becauſe ſhee had made a Seſſion, and paſſed away her Kingdome to

her ſonne, and had ſubmitted herſelfe vnto the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> when ſhee came firſt into <hi>England,</hi> and as by well doing ſhe had and enioyed the benefit of the Lawes; ſo in doing euill, ſhee might be ſubiect vnto the equitie of the ſame lawes, according vnto that ſaying of the Lawyers, <hi>Hee that offendeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law, deſerueth not the benefit of the Law.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the condition of a Forraine Prince, offending in the Realme of another Prince, ſhould be better than the condition of a King reigning well. They alſo thought her to be a Subiect, although not <hi>Originary,</hi> yet <hi>Temporary,</hi> for that two abſolute Kings (as concerning Royall authoritie) cannot be at one time in one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. That this is a receiued and ruled opinion of the Lavvyers, <hi>The King out of his Territorie</hi> (except it be in a voyage of warre) <hi>is a priuate man, and therefore can neither beſtow nor exerciſe any Regalities.</hi> Moreouer, that ſhe hath loſt by her fault abſolute Gouernment, and that ſubiects euen in <hi>their habitation or houſe</hi> may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit treaſon. And as for kindred, there is no Alliance neerer vnto any one, than their Countrey, that is to be vnto vs another God, and our prime and deareſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. And as for the promiſes of humanitie and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous entertainment promiſed, that they be not priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges to commit wicked facts afterwards without puniſhment. That promiſes are to be vnderſtood, <hi>Things remaining in the ſame ſtate, and not changed.</hi> He that hath committed a fault, deſerueth not to enioy the ſecuritie promiſed: And indeed that the law and right of a gueſt entertained are holy, but that the right of our Country is more ſacred: Princes doe neuer binde their owne hands, and that all are bound and obliged more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto their Countrey, than to their owne promiſe.</p>
               <p>And if ſhee were to be dealt withall, as with one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the war, they obiected, I know not out of what
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18326:115"/>
Author, <hi>Thoſe captiues are only to be ſpared, from whom we doe not feare any vexation or trouble and not any others.</hi> That the equall hath power vpon the equall, as often as he doth ſubmit himſelfe vnto the iudgement of his equall, either expreſſedly in words, or couertly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation, or in offending within the iuriſdiction of his equall. That the <hi>Pope</hi> did adnull and abrogate the ſentence of the Emperour againſt <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Siailia,</hi> for that the fact was not committed in the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie of the Emperour, but in the Dominion of the <hi>Pope.</hi> That Ambaſſadors, becauſe of the neceſſitie of Ambaſſades, are fauoured and allowed to be inuiolate by the law of Nations, but not Kings practiſing in the Dominions of another King. Furthermore, that in treaſon the affect without the effect is to be puniſhed. And that to plot to kill the Prince, yea to know it, and to conceale the plot, is accounted treaſon. That many Kings haue beene condemned and put to death, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Rheſcuporis</hi> King of <hi>Thraçia,</hi> by <hi>Tyberius, Licinius</hi> and <hi>Maximianus,</hi> by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, <hi>Bernard</hi> King of <hi>Italy, Conradinus</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> &amp;c. Moreouer, which may ſtand in ſtead of all, That the ſafetie of the people is the chiefeſt law, and that no law is more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred than the ſafetie and welfare of the Common-wealth. That God himſelfe hath enacted this law, that all things that were for the good, profit, and benefit of the Common-wealth, ſhould be accounted lawfull and iuſt. Moreouer, that Secretaries were not to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongſt bond-men, and that the teſtimonie of ones houſhold is to bee receiued about thoſe things which were done ſecretly at home. But it was argued more narrowly, whether accuſers voluntarily ſworne, and acceſſarie in criminall matters, are to be produced face to face, to defend and proue their accuſation. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was granted that there is no great example extant,

Religion, the Common-wealth, thy owne incolumitie, the loue of thy Countrey, the oath of</hi> Aſſociation, <hi>and the care of the Poſteritie, with conioyned prayers doe beſeech thee, that ſhe who ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſubuerteth all theſe ſeuerall things, may with all ſpeed be rid and diſpatched out of the way; and if they cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their requeſt at thy hands,</hi> SAFETIE <hi>it ſelfe cannot ſaue and preſerue this Common-wealth: and the Hiſtorians will publiſh to the ſucceeding age, that the moſt cleere ſhining daies of</hi> England <hi>vnder Queene</hi> ELIZABETH, <hi>ended in a loathſome euening, or rather into an eternall darke night. The poſteritie will finde lacke of our prudence, who (which thing doth accumulate our miſerie) could ſee our euils, and could not preuent them, and will impute the maſſe of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries not ſo much to the malice of our aduerſaries, as to the careleſſe and ſlothfull negligence of theſe times. Let not the life of one</hi> Scottiſh <hi>woman praeponderate and be of more weight with thee, than the vniuerſall ſafetie of</hi> England. <hi>Let there be no ſtay nor delay vſed in ſo great a matter, for that forbearance and delay procureth danger: neither let ſpace and time be giuen vnto theſe wicked plotters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuers of miſchiefe, who now will ſeeke their laſt ſuccour and helpe. by bold and audacious aduentures, and beſides their impunitie, will hope for a reward for their miſchieuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>Amongſt theſe penſiue thoughts, which made the Queene ſo carefull and doubtfull, that ſhe delighted in ſolitarineſſe, and ſate without any cheere, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without ſpeaking a word, and oftentimes ſighing, would mutter to her ſelfe, <hi>Either beare it, or ſtrike home;</hi> and out of ſome obſcure Embleme, <hi>Kill, leſt thou be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;</hi> ſhee deliuered to <hi>Dauiſon,</hi> one of her Secretaries, letters ſigned with her hand, that a Mandate ſhould be made vnder the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> for the putting of her vnto execution, which might be readie, if any danger were readie to fall, and commanded him not to communicate the matter to any man. But on the next day ſhe, whileſt feare did not allow her owne counſell, changing her minde, commanded <hi>Dauiſon,</hi> by <hi>William Killigrew,</hi> that the Mandate ſhould not be made vp. He forthwith came to the Queene, and told her that the Mandate was made and ſealed with the great Seale; She chafing, reproued him for making ſuch haſte; neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, he communicated the Mandate and buſineſſe vnto the Queenes Counſellors, and perſwadeth them, who quickly beleeued that which they deſired, that the Queene commanded that it ſhould be put in execution without delay: <hi>Beale,</hi> than whom there was none more euill affected vnto the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> for Religion, is ſent with one or two executioners and letters, in the which authoritie is giuen vnto the Earles of <hi>Shrewsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Kent, Darby,</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> with others, that ſhe ſhould be put to death, according to the Lawes, (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing to the Queene) and although at that very time ſhee had ſignified vnto <hi>Dauiſon,</hi> that ſhee would take another way and courſe, about the Queene of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet he did not call <hi>Beale</hi> backe.</p>

As ſoone as the Earles came to <hi>Fotheringhay,</hi> they came to her, with <hi>Amias Poulet</hi> and <hi>Drewgh Drury,</hi> in whoſe cuſtodie ſhe was; and ſignified the cauſe of their comming, reading the Mandate, and in few words ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed her to prepare her ſelfe vnto death, for that ſhee was to die the next day. Shee without feare, and with a ſetled minde, anſwered, <hi>I did not thinke that Queene</hi> ELIZABETH, <hi>my ſiſter, would haue conſented vnto my death, for I am not ſubiect vnto your Law; but ſince it is otherwiſe, death ſhall be vnto me moſt welcome, neither is that ſoule worthy of the heauenly and euerlaſting ioyes, whoſe bodie cannot endure one blow of the hangman.</hi> Shee requeſted that ſhe might conferre with her Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, her Confeſſor, and with <hi>Meluin</hi> her Steward. They in plaine termes denied her confeſſor to come vnto her; and the Earles commended the Biſhop or Deane of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburgh</hi> for to comfort her; whom when ſhee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, the Earle of <hi>Kent</hi> being fiery hot in Religion, turned vnto her, and amongſt other words, broke out into theſe, <hi>Thy life will be the deſtruction of our Religion, as on the other ſide, Thy death will be the life of the ſame.</hi> Mention being made of <hi>Babington,</hi> ſhee conſtantly and vtterly denied that ſhee knew of his plots; left the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge vnto God. And being demanded of that which was done by <hi>Nauus</hi> and <hi>Curlus,</hi> ſhe asked if euer it was heard, that the ſeruants were ſuborned and admitted as witneſſes to the death of their Maſters. When the Earles were departed, ſhee commanded them to make haſte with her ſupper, that ſhee might ſet things better in order. She ſupped ſparingly and ſoberly, as her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was. In ſupper time beholding her men and maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruants mourning and weeping, with an vndaunted minde ſhe bade them be of good cheere, and to abſtaine from ſorrow, but rather to reioyce, for that ſhee was to depart preſently out of an abyſſe of euill. And turning
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18326:123"/>
vnto <hi>Burgon</hi> her Phyſitian, asked him if he did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that the force of truth was great. <hi>They ſaid I muſt die, for that I was of counſell to kill the Queene; neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the Earle of</hi> Kent <hi>inſinuateth that there is no other cauſe of my death, but that they feare their Religion by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of me.

After ſupper ſhee read ouer her teſtament, readeth ouer the inuentory of her goods and mouables, and writ on them the names of them vnto whom ſhee appointed them: vnto ſome ſhe gaue money with her owne haud. Shee writeth vnto her Confeſſor, to pray vnto God for her, and alſo ſhe wrote letters of commendation vnto the <hi>French</hi> King, and vnto the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> for her ſeruants. Shee went to bed at her ordinary houre, and ſlept certaine houres; being awaked, ſhe ſpent the reſt of the night in prayers.</p>
               <p>The fatall day beginning to breake <hi>(viz.</hi> the vi.

And then ſetting her minde all vpon God, with all humility, in her Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, beſought him to giue her his grace and fauour, with ſighes, teares, and prayers, vntill the time that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Andrewes,</hi> Sheriffe of the Shire, told her, that ſhee was to come forth.

matron-like apparell, and very modeſt, her head being couered with a linnen vcile, and the ſame hanging very low, her beads hanging down at her girdle, and carying a <hi>Crucifix</hi> of Iuory in her hands. In the gallery the Earles and other Gentlemen receiued her, where <hi>Meluin</hi> her ſeruant on his knees, and with teares in his eies, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his fortune, that he ſhould carrie this heauie and ſad newes of the wofull death of his Ladie into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Shee comforting him, ſaid, <hi>Doe not lament, but rather be glad, thou ſhalt ſtraight-waies ſee</hi> MARY STVART <hi>deliuered and freed from all cares. You may tell them that I die conſtant in my Religion, and firme in fidelitie toward</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> France. <hi>God forgive them who haue thirſted for my bloud, as the Hart doth after the ſpring of water.

               <p>And then teares falling from her eies, ſhe bade <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> farewell againe and againe. And turning to the Earles, ſhee requeſted <hi>that her ſeruants might bee cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly vſed, and that they might enioy thoſe things which ſhe had bequeathed them, that they might ſtand by at her death, and be ſent into their Country with a ſafe-conduct.</hi> They promiſed the former things, but the Earle of <hi>Kent</hi> ſhewed himſelfe ſtrange, fearing ſome ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Shee ſaid, <hi>Feare not, theſe wretches deſire to giue mee their laſt farewell.

               <p>When ſhee had ſaid thus, and turned away, ſhe was permitted to haue thoſe of her ſeruants preſent whom ſhee would name. Shee nominated <hi>Meluin, Burgoine</hi> her Phyſitian, the Apothecarie and Chirurgeon, and two maids, and others, of the which <hi>Meluin</hi> bore vp her traine. So, the Gentlemen, two Earles, and the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe of the Shire going before her, ſhe came to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As ſoone as ſhe ſate downe, ſilence being made, <hi>Beale</hi> read the Commiſſion, and ſhee heard attentiuely, as if it had beene another matter. Then <hi>Fletcher,</hi> Deane of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> began a tedious ſpeech vnto her of the condition of her life formerly paſt, and the preſent, and that to come. Once or twice ſhe interrupted his ſpeech, <hi>and deſired him not to trouble her, and proteſted that ſhe was ſetled in the ancient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Religion, and was readie to end her life in the ſame.</hi> And when he perſwaded her earneſtly to doe true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and with a firme faith to put her hope in Chriſt; ſhee anſwered, <hi>that ſhee was borne and bred, and would now end her life in that Religion.</hi> And vnto the Earles, ſaying that they would pray for her, ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſhe would giue them many thankes if they would pray with her, but I ſhould offend much, if I did communicate in prayer with you, who are of another profeſsion.</hi> Then they bade the Deane to pray, and when the whole company there aſſembled prayed together, ſhee falling on her knees, carrying the <hi>Crucifix</hi> before him in her hands, together with her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, prayed in Latine out of the <hi>Office of our Ladie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Deane had ended his prayers, ſhee in the Engliſh tongue commended vnto God the Church, her ſonne, and Queene ELIZABETH, and beſought
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:18326:125"/>
him to auert his indignation from this Iſle, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that ſhee repoſed her hope in the bloud of Chriſt, (and lifted vp the <hi>Crucifix)</hi> and deſired all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of heauen to make interceſſion vnto him for her; ſhe forgaue all her enemies, and kiſſing the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> and ſigning her ſelfe with the Croſſe, ſhee ſaid, <hi>As thy armes, O Chriſt, were ſpread abroad on the Croſſe, ſo with the ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out armes of thy mercy receiue me, and forgiue mee my ſinnes.</hi> Then ſhee forgaue the Executioners, who asked pardon. And when her maids had taken off her vpper garments, ſhee haſtening them, they cried out amaine, ſhee kiſſing them, and ſigning them with the Croſſe, and ſmiling bade them farewell. Her face being coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a linnen cloth, lying on the block, ſhe ſaid the Pſalme, <hi>In te Domine confido, ne confundar in aeternum.</hi> Then as ſhe ſtretched out her bodie, and oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>In manus tuas Domine commendo ſpiritum meum,</hi> her head was cut off at two blowes.

               <p>As ſoone as word was brought to Queene ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, that the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> was put to death, ſhee not thinking thereof, ſhe heard it with great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſhee looked heauily and could not ſpeake a word, and readie to ſwound for ſorrow, in ſo much that ſhe put on mourning apparell, and grieued exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and lamented very much. Shee cauſed her Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors (being reproued and forbidden her preſence) to be examined, and commanded <hi>Dauiſon</hi> to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi> And as ſoone as her dolour would permit her, ſhe in great haſte wrote this letter following vnto the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> with her owne hand, and ſent it by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert Cary,</hi> one of the Lord of <hi>Hunſdons</hi> ſonnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deare brother, I would to God you did know, but not feele, with what incomparable griefe my minde is tormented and vexed, by reaſon of the lamentable euent which hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen contrary to my minde and will, which you ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand fully by my Couſin; for as much as I cannot abide and endure to ſet it downe by writing. I beſeech you, that as God</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:18326:127"/>
                  <hi>and many others can beare witneſſe vnto my innocencie in this matter, ſo I deſire you to beleeue, that if I had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, I would neuer haue denied the ſame. I am not of that baſe minde, that for any terrour, I ſhould feare to doe that which is iuſt, or to deny it, being done. I doe not ſo degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from my Anceſtors, nor am I of ſuch an ignoble minde. But as it is not the part of a Prince to couer and cloake the ſenſe of his minde with words, ſo will I neuer diſſemble nor gloſe mine actions; but I will performe that they ſhall come to light, and appeare to the world in their colours. I would haue you be aſſuredly perſwaded, that as I know that this was done vpon deſert, ſo if I had imagined it, I would not haue put it ouer vpon any other; neither yet wil I impute that to my ſelfe, which I did not ſo much as thinke. He who ſhall deliuer you theſe Letters, ſhall acquaint and impart other things vnto you. As for me, I would haue you to beleeue, that there is none other who loueth you better, and beareth better affection to you, or that will haue a more friendly care of you and your affaires. If any one ſuggeſteth, or putteth other things into your head, I would haue you to think that he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth more good will and affection to others, than to you.</hi> God Almightie keepe you in health, and preſerue you alwaies.</p>
               <p>In the meane time that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cary</hi> was in his iourney with theſe Letters, <hi>Dauiſon</hi> was brought into the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> before the Commiſſioners appointed, <hi>viz. Chriſtopher Wray,</hi> Lord Chiefe Iuſtice of the Kings Bench, made for that time Lord Keeper of the Priuie Seale, the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Worceſter, Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Lincolne,</hi> the Lords <hi>Gray,</hi> and <hi>Lumley; Iames Croft,</hi> Knight, Controller of the Queenes Houſe, Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay,</hi> Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrard,</hi> Maſter of the Rolles, <hi>Edmund Anderſon,</hi> Lord Chiefe Iuſtice of the Common Pleas, and <hi>Roger Manwood,</hi> Lord Chiefe Baron of the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18326:128"/>
Exchequer. Before theſe Commiſſioners, <hi>Popham,</hi> the Queenes Atturney, charged <hi>Dauiſon</hi> with contempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Maieſtie, violation of his faith, and neglect of his dutie; that whereas the Queene out of her inbred clemencie, would not haue the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though condemned, to be put vnto death, for cauſes knowne to her ſelfe, and not to be ſearched and pried into by others, could not be brought thereunto, neither by the Eſtates of the Kingdom, nor by her Counſellors earneſtly vrging her thereunto; neuertheleſſe, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a <hi>Mandate</hi> to be made for her execution, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent dangers that might enſue, and had committed it vnto the fidelitie and ſecrecie of <hi>Dauiſon;</hi> He being her ſworne Secretarie, forgetting his truſt and dutie, and in contempt of her Maieſtie, contrary vnto which the Queene had commanded, had imparted it vnto the Counſellors, and put it in execution, ſhe being vtterly ignorant thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauiſon</hi> with great modeſtie, and quietly, yet with a good courage anſwered, <hi>That he was ſorie, that in a moſt iuſt cauſe of the Queene of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and moſt weightie iudgement againſt her, if euer there was any, that he ſhould trouble againe the Commiſsioners, if not with the loſſe, yet at the leaſt with the impairing of his reputation, which hee eſteemed aboue all other things: but he was moſt aggreeued that he was charged to haue offended moſt contemptuouſly againſt her Maieſtie, who the more ſhee had beene bountifull to him, and he more bound for her bountie, his offence might ſeeme more hainous. If he ſhould acknowledge himſelfe guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the crimes obiected, he ſhould wrong his credit, which was dearer vnto him than his life. If he ſhould conteſt in his owne defence with the Queene, he ſhould doe a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the obedience of a ſubiect, the dutie of a ſeruant, and the fidelitie of a Secretary.</hi> He proteſted before God and the Commiſſioners, <hi>That wittingly or willingly hee</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:18326:128"/>
                  <hi>had done nothing in this thing, but that which hee was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his conſcience the Queene willed: In the which, if he had carried himſelfe to doe any hurt, either by vnskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or by negligence, he could not chooſe but be grieuouſly ſorie, and vndergoe willingly the cenſure of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As concerning particulars: when the Queene repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him that he had ſealed the <hi>Mandatum</hi> with the great Seale in ſuch great haſte; he affirmed, <hi>That ſhee inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but did not expreſly bid him to keepe it to himſelfe. Neither did he thinke that he committed any fault againſt the truſt of ſilence put on him, ſince he neuer ſpake word of this matter, but vnto the Priuie Counſellors.</hi> Vnto that he did not call backe the <hi>Mandatum,</hi> after that the Queene had ſignified vnto him, that ſhee had changed her minde, he affirmed, <hi>That it was agreed that it ſhould be ſent forthwith, and execution done, leſt the Common-wealth or the Queene might take ſome harme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Egerton,</hi> the Solicitor, began to preſſe <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſon</hi> out of his owne confeſſion, reading a peece there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but he requeſted him to reade it all, and not this peece and that peece; but yet hee had rather it ſhould not be read at all, for that therein ſome ſeccrets not to be vttered were contained; and now and then interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, he ſaid, <hi>That as he would not conteſt with the Queene, ſo he could not endure that his modeſtie ſhould be any detriment vnto the truth and his integritie. Gaudy</hi> and <hi>Puckering,</hi> Sergeants at Law, reproued him ſharply with many words, that craftily hee abuſed the wiſdome of the Counſellors, and that out of the confeſſion of <hi>Burghley</hi> the Treaſurer, vnto whom doubting whether the Queene had aſſuredly determined of the execution to be done, he affirmed it very earneſtly, as he did alſo vnto the reſt, who ſet their hands vnto the letters of the manner of the execution. <hi>Dauiſon</hi> with teares in his
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18326:129"/>
eyes, required the Lawyers not to preſſe him ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently: And wiſhed them <hi>to remember that he would not conteſt with the Queene, vnto whoſe conſcience, and vnto the cenſure of the Commiſsioners hee committed himſelfe wholly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, by the generall cenſure of them, hee was fined at ten thouſand pound, and impriſonment at the Queenes pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauiſon</hi> beſought the Commiſſioners to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion vnto the Queene for him, <hi>not for the honourable place of Secretary, which he had, or his libertie, or for the diminiſhing of the fine impoſed, but that he might be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto her fauour,</hi> which yet hee neuer recouered, though ſhe oftentimes releeued his wants. So <hi>Dauiſon</hi> an honeſt man without policie, and not skilfull in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of State, was brought, as moſt men thought, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage amongſt the Stateſmen, to play his part a while in this Tragedie, and ſtraight had his diſguiſe pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off, and as if he had failed in the laſt Act, thruſt from off the ſtage, and kept long in priſon, but not without the commiſeration of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>He ſaith, <hi>after the departure of the</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Scottiſh <hi>Ambaſſadors, the Queene of her owne minde commanded me to ſhew vnto her the</hi> Mandate <hi>of the execution of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the Queene of</hi> Scotland. <hi>And it being ſhewen, ſhee willingly ſigned with her hand, and commanded it, being thus ſigned, to be ſealed with the Great Seale of</hi> England, <hi>and iesting, ſaid, Signifie this thing vnto</hi> Walſingham, <hi>who was ſicke, yet I feare much that he will die for ſorrow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Moreouer, ſhe ſaid that the cauſes of the delaying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, were, leſt ſhe ſhould ſeeme to be thought to be drawn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto vpon violence or malice, when yet ſhe knew that it was</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:18326:129"/>
                  <hi>very neceſſarie. Moreouer, ſhe blamed</hi> Powlet <hi>and</hi> Drury <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t they had not freed her of this care, and wiſhed that</hi> Walſingham <hi>would trie their mindes in this matter. On the next day, when it was ſealed with the Great Seale, ſhee commanded by</hi> Killegrew <hi>that it ſhould not be done; and when I had told her it was alreadie done, ſhee reprehended ſo much haſte, inſinuating that ſome wiſe men thought ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way might be taken. I anſwered that the courſe which was moſt iuſt, was alwaies the beſt and moſt ſafe. But fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſhee would lay the fault vpon me (as ſhe laid the death of the Duke of</hi> Norfolke <hi>vpon</hi> Burghley) <hi>I communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the matter vnto</hi> Hatton, <hi>proteſting that I would not thruſt my ſelfe into ſo great a buſineſſe; he preſently impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it vnto</hi> Burleigh, Burleigh <hi>vnto the reſt of the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, who all gaue their conſent to the quicke diſpatch of the execution, and euery one vowed to ſtand to it, and to ſticke one to another: and ſent</hi> Beale <hi>with the</hi> Mandate <hi>and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The third day after, when I perceiued that her minde wauered, hearing her tell a dreame of the death of the Queen of</hi> Scotland, <hi>I asked if ſhe had changed her minde; ſhe ſaid no, but, ſaid ſhee, another way might haue beene inuented: and withall asked if any anſwer were comefrom</hi> Powlet. <hi>And when I had ſhewed his letters, wherein, in plaine termes, be refuſed to take vpon him that which was neither honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable nor iuſt; ſhe chaſing, ſaid, that he and others, who had taken the oath of the</hi> Aſſociation, <hi>were periured and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne men, as they who had promiſed many things, but would performe nothing. But I ſhewed her how vniuſt and infamous this would be, and into what danger ſhee brought</hi> Powlet <hi>and</hi> Drury. <hi>For if ſhee approued and allowed the fact, ſhee ſhould draw to her ſelfe both danger and diſhonour with the note of iniuſtice; but if ſhee diſauowed and diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the fact, ſhee ouerthrew vtterly thoſe well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing men and their poſteritie. And afterwardſhee, on the ſame day the Queene of</hi> Scotland <hi>was put to death,</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:18326:130"/>
                  <hi>ſlightly checked mee, that the execution was not done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What griefe and anger ſoeuer Queen ELIZABETH conceiued, or made ſhew of, for the death of the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I am ſure the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> her only ſon, tooke it wonderfull heauily, who with the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable pietie that could bee in a ſonne, reuerenced his moſt deare mother, and mourned and lamented for her exceedingly. For he did not thinke that Queene ELIZABETH, in regard of the <hi>mutuall loue that was betweene them,</hi> and the league of ſtricter friendſhip late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made betweene them, neglecting the ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions of Princes, would haue deliuered his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Prince of equall eſtate, and her neereſt couſin of the Royal bloud, into the hands of a baſe hangman. He ſuffered not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert Cary,</hi> ſonne to the Lord <hi>Hunſdon</hi> (who was ſent from <hi>England</hi> to excuſe the Queene, by laying the fault vpon her Counſellors and <hi>Dauiſon)</hi> to come into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and hardly would heare him by another man, and with much ſuit recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the letters he brought: Called his Ambaſſadour out of <hi>England,</hi> and threatned reuenge. And ſome there were that perſwaded him that other Princes of Chriſtendome would not let ſuch an iniury done vnto the Maieſtie and Royall name of a King, goe vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
               <p>The Eſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> who were aſſembled in great number, profeſſed that they were moſt readie to reuenge the death of his mother, and to defend his right to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> yea and to ſpend their liues and goods in the quarrell, and that they could not diſgeſt the iniurie done, not onely vnto the King, but alſo vnto the whole Nation of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some there were who perſwaded the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire aid of ſhips, and of a Nauie of the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:18326:130"/>
vnto whoſe daughter he began then to ſue for mariage.</p>
               <p>Some who were addicted to the <hi>Romane</hi> Religion, ſuggeſted vnto him, that hee ſhould rather ioyne with the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and with the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſo hee might with caſe get the poſſeſſion of <hi>England.</hi> And aboue all things to giue no credit vnto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of <hi>England,</hi> who now ruled all, and cloſely plotted to deſtroy him alſo: whiſpering this in his eares, <hi>He that hath killed the mother, will alſo kill the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren if he can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some there were who ſecretly aduiſed him to keepe himſelfe as Newter openly, and to hold both the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Romaniſts in ſuſpence. For if that hee ſhewed himſelfe openly for the Proteſtants, the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts of <hi>Europe</hi> will lay all their plots againſt him, and would ſet vp another prop and ſtay in <hi>England</hi> to his great danger.</p>
               <p>Some alſo there were who aduiſed him to keepe a firme peace with <hi>England,</hi> and not to put his certaine hope vpon the vncertaine fortune of warre. And to be conſtant in his Religion, in the which if hee once wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, he ſhould neither get nor purchaſe friends, nor leſſen, nor diminiſh his enemies. Thus euery man as their fancie gaue, or their profit lead them, ſpake. But the King being more prouident, and more wittie than his age gaue him, vſed no haſte, which is alwaies blinde, but weighed their counſels in his minde conſiderately and maturely a long time, both with himſelfe and a very few others.</p>
               <p>But Queene ELIZABETH by laying all the fault on <hi>Dauiſon,</hi> and the raſh credulitie of her Counſellors, ſo to mitigate his griefe and ſorrow by little and little, leſt the comfort giuen out of ſeaſon, might more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate him, and ſo ſtayed vntill his ſorrow leſſened
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18326:131"/>
by length of time, would ſuffer it ſelfe to be handled. But when ſhee ſaw the <hi>French</hi> egge on the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, ſhe fearing leſt he by their policies, and vpon a burning heat of reuenge, ſhould be drawne away from the Religion of the Proteſtants, and the friendſhip of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſhe laboured with all her power to pacifie his minde, exulcerated, and in a manner alienated from her, by all meanes not vnworthy of a Prince.</p>
               <p>Therefore by her Meſſengers and Agents, and after by the Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Berwicke,</hi> ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth theſe weightie and important Reaſons moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently. <hi>Firſt, what a dangerous thing it may be for him to breake into open warre againſt</hi> England <hi>for this cauſe, which ſeemed vnto the Eſtates of</hi> England <hi>to be as well neceſſarie for the ſafetie of the whole Iſland, as alſo moſt iuſt. Then let him conſider if he be of abilitie to take ſuch a warre in hand, for as much as</hi> England <hi>was neuer better furniſhed with Military men and Leaders, with forces and riches; and</hi> Scotland <hi>exhauſted with inteſtine warres, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more weake. If he depended vpon forraine aid, with what great difficultie, and how long it would be ere hee can get it; and if he doe obtaine it, what ſucceſſe can hee hope for, ſince that</hi> England <hi>hauing the Fleets of</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> Zealand <hi>ioyned thereunto, hath no cauſe to feare the moſt mightie and potent Kings of</hi> Europe? <hi>What hope can he place in the</hi> French <hi>King, or the King of</hi> Spaine? <hi>For as much as his power much increaſed and augmented by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion and addition of</hi> England, <hi>may croſſe or empeach their deſignes and purpoſes, for that his Religion may be ſo oppoſed vnto their profeſsion, that they cannot helpe and aid him, but with their owne loſſe and detriment. Neither can the</hi> French <hi>King ſee with a contented minde, the King of</hi> Scotland <hi>to be augmented with the Kingdome of</hi> England, <hi>for feare leſt hee ſhould with warre proſecute the ancient right of the</hi> Engliſh-men <hi>in</hi> France, <hi>or elſe giue helpe or</hi>

                  <hi>ſuccour vnto the</hi> Guiſes, <hi>his Couſins, who at this time gape after the Realme of</hi> France. <hi>But the King of</hi> Spaine <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt will doe all things to ſerue his ambitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, for as much as he vaunteth himſelfe to be the firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Prince of the bloud Royall of</hi> England, <hi>and the ſtocke of</hi> Lancaſter, <hi>though vntruly. In reſpect of which, ſome Ieſuites and others alſo endeuoured to aduance him, whileſt the Queene of</hi> Scotland <hi>was yet liuing, vnto the Crowne of</hi> England, <hi>as a man moſt fit to reſtore the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>authority in</hi> England <hi>(the mother and the ſonne being not reſpected nor regarded.) Moreouer, they perſwaded him, that ſhee determined in her laſt Will and Teſtament, to bequeath the Kingdome of</hi> England <hi>vnto this King of</hi> Spaine, <hi>if her ſonne continued in the Religion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi>

Moreouer, he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and be aduiſed, leſt the Eſtates of</hi> England, <hi>who haue giuen ſentence againſt his mother, doe not exclude him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from the right of Succeſsion, by a new ſentence, whoſe loue, by yeelding and giuing place vnto neceſsitie, and reſtraining the paſsionate motions of his minde, he may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly winne and purchaſe vnto him, for as much as that which is done, cannot be vndone. And at his time he may poſſeſſe and enioy quietly the moſt flouriſhing Kingdome of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <hi>In the meane time, he may enioy ſecuritie, and may ſeeme with all men, indifferent men, that haue vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and conſideration of things, to haue receiued no blemiſh in his honour, for as much as when time was, he omitted no</hi>
