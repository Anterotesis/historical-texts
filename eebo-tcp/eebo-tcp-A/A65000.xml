            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THough the sad Examples of Gods Justice upon notorious Offenders have been many, in the several parts of the World, yet men are not deter'd from but persist in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiousness and Villany: When Satan has by his temptations got once an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he never leaves tempting such Vanquished Sinners, till he has drawn them from less Sins to greater, and so brought them to shame and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction either in this Life, or that which is to come; as by this sad Example, of which I am about to discourse, will more fully appear.</p>
            <p>One Mr. <hi>William Vincent,</hi> a Minister, hearing a Report that a mans hands and feet should Rot off, and yet the said man not at all sick, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36163:4"/>
could eat and drink and speak heartily, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an account where this man lay, could not be satisfied, but made it his business to ride to the place, which was about 14 or 15 Miles distant from <hi>Bednal,</hi> where the said Minister liveth; and coming to some few Houses adjoining to a Heath side in the County of <hi>Stafford</hi> aforesaid, in a little Shed or Barn, there he finds this Subject of Gods Wrath and Object of every Eyes pity that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him: And at that time there were a great many both Men Women and Children beholding of him. The Person so afflicted lying there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a pad of Straw between a pair of Sheets, not being able to help himself, neither one way or other, more than what the Person that looked after him did for him; for there is a man hired onely to tend him.</p>
            <p>As to the Miserableness of his condition it is this, several of his Members consume away and Rot; one Hand being rotted from the wrist that you may not only see through the Master Bones, but also the Bones for half a handful between the Knuckle-bone of the Wrist and upwards, towards the Elbow, hath neither Vein, Flesh, nor Sinew left, but is as bare as any Bone can be: One Hand is as black as a Beasts-Hoof, and drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the form of the same, so that the said Minister upon the first sight of it, did conclude that it had been a Beasts-Hoof that had lain by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36163:4"/>
him, till his Keeper shewed him to the contrary, by moving his Arm; by which it did appear, that that was his Hand, and did join to his Wrist, that was bare to the Bone for above four Inches: The Flesh that next appeared towards his Elbow was ulcerous and in a rotten condition, and one of his Knees rotted, so that his Leg was ready to drop off; yet all this while the said afflicted person eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking and speaking heartily.</p>
            <p>Now you have heard in what a miserable and dreadful condition this sad Subject of Gods just Wrath now lies. Let us proceed to give you an account of his own Conjectures of the Cause of his so exemplary Punishment.</p>
            <p>The said Person stealing a Bible, being accused of the Fact, did absolutely and impudently deny it; not only so, but imprecating sad Judgments against himself, in these and such like words, saying, That he desired that God might make him an Example if he were any ways guilty of that Crime laid to his charge; and that his hands might Rot off if he stole it, and he might Rot alive if he had it, or medled with it: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he knew himself to be guilty of the steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
            <p>All which you may more fully understand by this following Confession from his own Mouth to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36163:5"/>
the said Minister, the Author of this present Narrative.</p>
            <p>This Minister when he came to him propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several Questions to him, after he had bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the lamentable condition of the said Person.</p>
            <p>1. He asked him whether he did not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hand of Divine Vengeance to be upon him, in an extraordinary manner?</p>
            <p>He answered, He did.</p>
            <p>2. The said Minister asked him, whether he did apprehend for what that so sore a Judgment was for, that he then lay under; whether he were guilty of any particular Sin, (that his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science accused him withal) which did provoke Gods Wrath in so high a nature against him.</p>
            <p>He said that his particular Sin was stealing a Bible, for which he apprehended this sore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon him.</p>
            <p>The said Minister said further to him, did you steal a Bible?</p>
            <p>He answered, Yes.</p>
            <p>The Minister told him, though he did, that was a sin pardonable upon Repentance; that God was a merciful God.</p>
            <p>But the afflicted person further added, That when he was questioned for it, he positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed it, and wished that he might Rot alive, and that his hands might Rot off if he ever touched it; and all this while knew himself Guilty of the Crime.</p>
            <p>The Minister asked him how long since this Fact was committed?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:36163:5"/>He answered, About six weeks.</p>
            <p>The Minister asked him how long after that he had wished those sad Wishes to himself, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he apprehended that hand of Gods wrath to be upon him?</p>
            <p>He answered, Not long.</p>
            <p>The Minister asked him, after what manner he found himself alter, as to any Distemper that seized upon him?</p>
            <p>He answered, he was taken with an Aguish and Feverish condition, and immediately his hand began to Rot, and then he looked upon it to be the hand of God upon him, in punishing him for those sad VVishes he wished upon himself: And he further added, That he desired all good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pray for him.</p>
            <p>Having given you an account of the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this miserably afflicted person, without any alteration, as it was taken from his own mouth; give me leave to admonish the Reader seriously to consider, That if we by continuance in sin shall provoke God to withdraw his sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providence, our flesh and bones presently consume and crumble into dust and rottenness.</p>
            <p>Hast thou not seen in a Charnel-house the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed mysteries of humane Nature, bones rudely thrown upon heaps, naked skulls with hollow eye-holes, yielding a dreadful and deformed Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle? Hast thou not beheld their grinning mouths, and gastly looks, and the rest of their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36163:6"/>
members carelesly dispersed and scattered? Such thou mayest consider will every person suddenly be, from whom God shall at any time withhold his providential supports.</p>
            <p>Let this sad Spectacle of Divine Vengeance move us to consider, with what a God we have to do: <hi>Be not deceived; God will not be mocked.</hi> Let every one consider and admire God's Free Grace and Mercy, that he hath not been made a subject of God's immediate wrath, instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a living Monument of Gods long suffering and patience. Let no man presume to take Gods Name in vain; much more not dare to challenge Gods Vengeance upon himself. This sad Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (being well considered) may deter all that hear of it from such notorious sins. Let every man take the advice of <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 32. 29. <hi>To be wise, to understand, and to consider their latter ends:</hi> which being done, will bring us to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, our selves, of Heaven and Hell, and prevent from being unhappy or miserable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Body or Soul. VVhich is the hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of your humble Remembrancer.</p>
