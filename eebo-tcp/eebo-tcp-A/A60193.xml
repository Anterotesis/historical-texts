            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Consolatory Letter to an afflicted Conscience, Grace and Peace.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Deare Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Understand by your Letter, that you have many and great tryals; some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and bodily, some internall and spirituall: as the deprivall of inward comfort, the buffetings (and that in more then ordinary manner) of your soule, with Satans temptations: and (which makes all those inward and outward, the more heavy and insupportable) that you have wanted Christian so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with the Saints of God, to whom you might make knowne your griefes, and by whom you might receive comfort from the Lord, and incouragement in your Christian course.</p>
            <p>Now that which I earnestly desire in your behalfe, and hope likewise you doe in your owne, is that you may draw nearer to God, and be more conformable to his command by these afflictions; for if our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be not sanctified, that is, if we make not an holy use of them by purging out the old leaven of our inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate corruptions, they are but judgments to us, and makes way for greater plagues: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.14. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chiefe end and ayme of God in all the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63866:3"/>
which he sends to his children in love, is, that they may be partakers of his holinesse, and so their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may conduce to their spirituall advantage and profit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. The Lord aymes not at himselfe in any calamities he layes on us, (for God is so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely all-sufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we can adde nothing to him by all our doings or sufferings) but his maine ayme is at our Melioration and Sanctification in and by them. And therefore our duty in every affliction and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, is thus to thinke with our selves: How shall we carry and behave our selves under this crosse, that our soules may reap profit by it?<note place="margin">Iames 4.8.</note> This (in one word) is done by our returning and drawing nearer to the Lord, as his holy Apostle exhorts us. This in all calamities the Lord hath a speciall eye unto, and is exceeding wroth if he finde it not.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Isay 1.4, 5.</note>The Prophet declares <hi>That his anger was not turned from Israel, because they turned not to him that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> them.</hi> Now it is impossible that a man should draw nigh to God, and turne to him, if he turne not from his evill wayes: for in every conversion there is <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> something to be turned from, as well as <hi>Terminus ad quod,</hi> something to be turned to.</p>
            <p>Now, that we must turne to, is God; and that we must turne from, is sinne; as being diametrally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to God, and that which separates betweene God and us.</p>
            <p>To this purpose we must search and try our hearts and wayes, and see what sinnes there be that keepe us from God, and separate us from his gracious favour: and chiefly we must weed out our speciall bosom-sins. This the ancient Church of God counsels each other to doe in the time of their anguish and affliction,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63866:3"/>
               <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.39, 40. <hi>Let us search and try our wayes, and turne againe to the Lord:</hi> for though sinne make not a finall divorce betwixt God and his chosen people, yet it may make a dangerous rupture by taking away sense of comfort, and suspending the sweet influence of his favour, and the effectuall operation of his grace.</p>
            <p>And therefore (deare Sir) my earnest suit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is, that you would di<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igently peruse the booke of your conscience, enter into a thorow search and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of your heart and life; and every day before you goe to bed, take a time of recollection and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, (as holy <note n="*" place="margin">See Gen. 24.63.</note> 
               <hi>Isaac</hi> did in his private walkes) hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a privy Session in your soule, and indicting your selfe for all the sins, in thought, word, or act commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; all the good duties you have omitted. This self-examination, if it be so strict and rigid as it ought to be, will soone shew you the sins whereto you are most inclinable, (the chiefe cause of all your sorrowes) and consequently, it will (by Gods assistance) effectually instruct you to fly from those venemous and fiery ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, which have so stung you.</p>
            <p>And though you have (as you say) committed many grievous sinnes, as abusing Gods gracious ordinances, and neglecting the golden opportunities of grace: the originall, as you conceive of all your troubles; yet I must tell you, there is another <hi>Coloquintida</hi> in the pot, another grand enormity (though you perceive it not) and that is your separation from Gods Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Acts of his publike Service and worship. This you may clearly discern by the affliction it selfe, for God is methodicall in his corrections, and doth (many times) so suite the crosse to the sinne, that you may reade the sin in the crosse. You confesse that your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63866:4"/>
maine affliction, and that which made the other more bitter, is, that God tooke away those to whom you might make your complaint; and from whom you might receive comfort in your distresse. And is not this just with God, that when you wilfully separate your selfe from others, he should separate others from you? Certainly, when we undervalue mercy, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally so great a one as the communion of Saints is, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Lord takes it away from us, till we learne to prize it to the full value. Consider well therefore the haynousnesse of this sin, which that you may the better conceive, First, consider it is against Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Precept, charging us not to forsake the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20.25. Again, it is against our own greatest good and spirituall folace, for by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating &amp; excommunicating our selves from that blessed society, we deprive our selves of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their holy conference, their godly instructions, their divine consolations, brotherly admonitions, and charitable reprehensions; and what an inestimable losse is this? Neither can we partake such profit by their prayers as otherwise we might: for as the soule in the naturall body conveyes life and strength to every member, as they are compacted and joyned together, and not as dis-severed; so Christ conveyes spirituall life and vigour to Christians, not as they are disjoyned from, but as they are united to the mysticall body, the Church.</p>
            <p>But you will say <hi>England</hi> is not a true Church, and therefore you separate; adhere to the true Church.</p>
            <p>I answer, our Church is easily proved to be a true Church of Christ: First, because it hath all the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls, necessary to the constitution of a true Church;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63866:4"/>
as sound preaching of the Gospell, right dispensation of the Sacraments, Prayer religiously performed, and evill persons justly punisht (though not in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as some criminals and malefactors deserve:) and therefore a true Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because it hath begot many spirituall children to the Lord, which for soundnesse of judgement, and holinesse of life, are not inferiour to any in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches. Yea, many of the Separation, if ever they were converted, it was here with us: (which a false and adulterous Church communicated.)</p>
            <p>But I heare you reply, our Church is corrupted with Ceremonies, and pestered with prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. What then? must we therefore separate for Ceremonies, which many think may be lawfully used: But admit they be evils, must we make a tent in the Church for Ceremonious Rites, for circumstantiall evils? That were a remedy worse then the disease. Besides, had not all the true Churches of Christ their blemishes and deformities, as you may see in seaven <hi>Asian</hi> Churches? <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. and 3. And though you may finde some Churches beyond Sea free from Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, yet notwithstanding they are more corrupt in Preachers, (which is the maine) as in prophanation of the Lords day, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As for wicked and prophane Persons amongst us, though we are to labour by all good meanes to purge them out, yet are we not to separate because of this residence with us: for, there will bee a miscellany and mixture in the visible Church, as long as the world endures, as our Saviour shewes by many para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. If therefore we should be so over-just as to abandon all Churches for the intermixture
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63866:5"/>
of wicked Persons, we must saile to the Antipodes, or rather goe out of the world, as the Apostle speaks: it <unclear>is</unclear> agreed by all that <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke was a type and embleme of the Church. Now as it had beene no lesse then selfe-murder for <hi>Noah, Sem,</hi> or <hi>Iaphet,</hi> to have leapt out of the Arke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because of that ungracious <hi>Gains</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; so it is no better then soule-murder for a man to cast himselfe out of the Church, either for reall or imaginall corruptions. To conclude, as the Angell injoyned <hi>Hagar</hi> to returne, and submit to her Mistris <hi>Sarah,</hi> so let me admonish you to returne your selfe from these extravagant courses, and submissively to render your selfe to the sacred communion of this tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evangelicall Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beseech you therefore, as you respect Gods glory and your owne eternall salvation, as <hi>There is but one body and one spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note>
