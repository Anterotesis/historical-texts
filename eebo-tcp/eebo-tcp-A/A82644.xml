         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THe occaſion of this Declaration was for the reſtraint
of Armed men from comming to the Parliament, to
diſturb the Peace of it, and is very improperly alledged
for the maintenance of ſuch Leavies, as are now raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Parliament. The title of the Statute being thus,
To all Parliaments, and Treaties, every man ſhall come
without Force and Armes. So that the Queſtion is not,
whether it belong to the King or no to reſtrain ſuch force;
But if the King ſhall refuſe to diſcharge that Duty and
Truſt, Whether there is not a power in the two Houſes, to
provide for the ſafety of the Parliament, and Peace of the
Kingdome, which is the end, for which the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
concerning the <hi>Militia</hi> was made, and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the ſcope and purpoſe of the Law, cannot
in Reaſon bee adjudged to bee contrary to it; For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Law doe affirme it to bee in the King, yet
it doth not exclude thoſe, in whom the Law hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a power for that purpoſe; As in the Courts of Juſtice,
the Sheriffs, and other Officers and Miniſters of
thoſe Courts. And as their power is derived from the
King by His Patents, yet cannot it be reſtrained by His
Majeſties command, by His great Seale, or otherwiſe,
much leſſe can the Power of Parliament be concluded by
His Majeſties command, becauſe the Authority thereof is
of a higher, and more eminent nature, than any of thoſe
Courts.</p>
            <p>It is acknowledged, That the King is the Fountaine
of Juſtice, and Protection; But the Acts of Juſtice, and
Protection, are not exerciſed in His owne Perſon, nor
depend upon His pleaſure, but by His Courts, and by
His Miniſters, who muſt doe their Duty therein, though
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171278:4"/>
the King in his owne Perſon ſhould forbid them; And
therefore, if Judgements ſhould be given by them againſt
the Kings Will and Perſonall command, yet are they the
Kings Judgements.</p>
            <p>The High Court of Parliament, is not onely a Court
of Judicature, enabled by the Lawes, to adjudge, and
determine the Rights, and Liberties of the Kingdome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch Patents, and Grants of His Majeſty, as are
preiudiciall thereunto; although ſtrengthened both by
His Perſonall Command, and by His Proclamation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great Seale: But it is likewiſe a Councell to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the neceſſities, prevent the imminent dangers,
and preſerve the publike Peace and ſafety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and to declare the Kings pleaſure in thoſe things
as are requiſite thereunto; and what they doe herein,
hath the Stamp of Royall Authority, although His
Maieſty ſeduced by evill Counſell, doe in His owne Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
oppoſe, or interrupt the ſame. For the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
Power, and Royall Pleaſure, is exerciſed and
declared in this High Court of Law, and Councell, after
a more eminent and obligatory manner, then it can be by
any perſonall Act or Reſolution of His Own.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore the Lords and Commons, which
are His Maieſties great and Higheſt Councell, have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
That for the preſent and neceſſary Defence of
the Realme, the Trained Bands, and <hi>Militia</hi> of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſhould bee ordered according to that Ordinance,
And that the Towne of <hi>Hull</hi> ſhould bee committed to the
Cuſtody of Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> to be preſerved from the
attempts of Papiſts and other malignant perſons, who
thereby might put the Kingdome into a combuſtion,
which is ſo farre from being a Force againſt the Kings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171278:4"/>
peace, that it is neceſſary for the keeping and ſecuring
thereof, and for that end alone is in ended: and all his
Majeſties loving Subjects, as well by that Law as by other
Lawes, are bound to bee obedient thereunto, and what
they doe therein is according to that Law to bee interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to bee done in ayd of the King, in diſcharge of that
Truſt which he is tied to performe: and it is ſo farre from
being liable to puniſhment, that if they ſhould refuſe to
do it, or be perſwaded by any Commiſſion or Command
of his Majeſty to do the contrary, they might juſtly be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for the ſame, according to the Lawes and Uſages of
the Realm: for the King by his Soveraignty, is not enabled
to deſtroy his people, but to protect and defend them; and
the high Court of Parliament, and all other his Majeſties
Officers, and Miniſters, ought to bee ſubſervient to that
Power and Authority, which the Law hath placed in his
Majeſty to that purpoſe, though he himſelfe in his owne
perſon ſhould neglect the ſame.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Lords and Commons doe declare the
ſaid Proclamation to be voyd in Law, and of none effect,
For that by the Conſtitution and Policy of this Kingdom,
the King by his Proclamation cannot declare the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Judgement and Reſolution of any of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Courts of Juſtice, much leſſe againſt the High Court
of Parliament; for if it were admitted, that the King by
his Proclamation may declare a Law, thereby his Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
will in effect become Lawes, which would turne to
the ſubverting of the Law of the Land, and the Rights, and
Liberties of the Subjects.</p>
            <p>And the Lords and Commons do require and command,
all Conſtables, Petty-Conſtables, and all other his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171278:5"/>
Officers, and Subjects whatſoever, to Muſter, Levie,
raiſe, March and Exerciſe, or to Summon or Warne any
upon Warrant from the Lievtenants, Deputy-Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
Captaines, or other Officers of the Trained Bands,
and all others according to the ſaid Ordinance of both
Houſes; and ſhall not preſume to Muſter, Levie, Raiſe,
March, or Exerciſe, by vertue of any Commiſſion, or other
Authority whatſoever, as they will anſwer the contrary at
their perils; and in their ſo doing, they do further declare,
That they ſhall bee protected by the Power and Authority
of both Houſes of Parliament; And that whoſoever ſhall
oppoſe, queſtion, or hinder them in the execution of the
ſaid Ordinance, ſhall bee proceeded againſt as violaters of
the Laws, and diſturbers of the peace of the Kingdom.</p>
