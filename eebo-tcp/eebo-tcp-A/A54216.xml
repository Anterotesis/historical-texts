            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis <hi>Enchiridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> I preſent thee with, is the Fruit of <hi>Solitude:</hi> A School few care to learn in, tho' none Inſtructs us better. Some Parts of it are the <hi>Reſult</hi> of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Reflection;</hi> Others the <hi>Flaſhings</hi> of <hi>Lucid</hi> Intervals; writ for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb facs="tcp:33080:4"/>
Satisfaction, and now publiſht for an <hi>Help</hi> to <hi>Human</hi> Conduct.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> bleſſeth God for his <hi>Retirement,</hi> and kiſſes that gentle Hand which lead him into it. For tho' it ſhould prove <hi>Barren</hi> toth' World, it can never do ſo to him.</p>
            <p>He has now had ſome <hi>Time</hi> he could call his own; a Property he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Maſter of before; In which he has taken a View of himſelf and the World; and obſerved wherein he hath <hi>hit</hi> and <hi>miſt</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:33080:4"/>
Mark; what might have been done, what mended, and what avoided; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Omiſſions</hi> and <hi>Exceſſes</hi> of others, as well <hi>Societies</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,</hi> as private Families, and Perſons: And he verily thinks were he to live over his Life again, he could, with God's Grace, ſerve Him, his Neighbour and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>better</hi> than he hath done, and have Seven Years of his Time to ſpare. And yet perhaps he hath not been the <hi>Worſt</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:33080:5"/>
the <hi>Idleſt</hi> Man in the World; nor is he the <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi> And this is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, that it might quicken thee, Reader, to loſe none of the Time that is yet thine.</p>
            <p>There is nothing of which we are ſo <hi>laviſh</hi> as of Time, and about which we ought to be more <hi>ſolicitous.</hi> Without it we can do nothing in this World. <hi>Time</hi> is what we <hi>want moſt,</hi> but what, alas! we <hi>uſe worſt;</hi> and for which God will certainly moſt
<pb facs="tcp:33080:5"/>
ſtrictly reckon with us when Time ſhall be no more. It is of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us in reference to both Worlds, that I can hardly wiſh any Man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than that he would ſeriouſly conſider <hi>what he does with his Time: how</hi> and <hi>to what Ends</hi> he employs it; and what Returns he makes to God, his Neighbour and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it. Will he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a <hi>Leger</hi> for this?</p>
            <p>To come but <hi>once</hi> into the World, and <hi>Trifle</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33080:6"/>
away our true Enjoyment of it, and of our ſelves in it, is lamentable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. This one Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would yield a <hi>thinking</hi> Perſon great Inſtruction. And ſince nothing below Man can <hi>Think;</hi> Man, in being <hi>Thoughtleſs,</hi> muſt needs fall below himſelf: And that, to be ſure, ſuch do, as are <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd</hi> in the uſe of their moſt precious Time.</p>
            <p>This is but too evident, if we will allow our ſelves to conſider, that there is
<pb facs="tcp:33080:6"/>
hardly any thing we take by the Right End, or improve to its juſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>We underſtand little of the Works of God, either in <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Grace.</hi> We purſue <hi>falſe</hi> Knowledg; and <hi>miſtake</hi> Education extreamly. We are <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> in our Affections; <hi>Confuſed</hi> and <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical</hi> in our whole Life; making that a <hi>Burthen</hi> which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a Bleſſing; and of little Comfort to our ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:33080:7"/>
hending the <hi>true Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Happineſs, and ſo miſſing of the <hi>Right Uſe</hi> of Life and <hi>Way</hi> of happy Living. And till we are perſuaded to <hi>ſtop,</hi> and <hi>ſtep a little aſide,</hi> out of the <hi>noiſy Crowd</hi> and <hi>Incumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hurry</hi> of the World, and <hi>calmly</hi> take a Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of things, it will be impoſſible we ſhould be able to make a right Judgment of our ſelves, or know our own <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> But after we have made the juſt Reckonings,
<pb facs="tcp:33080:7"/>
which <hi>Retirement</hi> will help us to, we ſhall begin to think the World in great meaſure <hi>Mad,</hi> and that we have been in a ſort of <hi>Bedlam</hi> all this while.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> whether Young or Old, think it not <hi>too ſoon</hi> or <hi>too late</hi> to turn over the <hi>Leaves</hi> of thy paſt Life: And be ſure <hi>to fold down</hi> where any Paſſage of it may affect thee; And beſtow thy <hi>Remainder</hi> of time, to correct thoſe Faults in thy future Conduct; be it
<pb facs="tcp:33080:8"/>
in relation to this or the next Life. What thou wouldſt do, if what thou haſt done were to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>he ſure to do</hi> as long as thou liveſt, upon the like Occaſions.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Reflections</hi> ſeem to be <hi>vigorous,</hi> as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as we ſurvey our paſt Errors. But, alas, our <hi>Reſolutions</hi> are apt to be <hi>flat</hi> upon freſh Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to the ſame things.</p>
            <p>The Author does not pretend to deliver thee an <hi>Exact</hi> Piece; his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:33080:8"/>
being not Vanity, but <hi>Charity:</hi> 'Tis Miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneous in the Matter of it, and by no means Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial in the Compoſure. But it contains <hi>Hints,</hi> that may ſerve thee for <hi>Texts</hi> to preach to thy ſelf upon; and which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend much of the <hi>Courſe of Human Life;</hi> Since whether thou art <hi>Parent</hi> or <hi>Child; Prince</hi> or <hi>Subject; Maſter</hi> or <hi>Servant; Single</hi> or <hi>Married; Publick</hi> or <hi>Private; Mean</hi> or <hi>Honourable;

            <head>REFLECTIONS AND MAXIMS.</head>
            <p n="1">I. IT is admirable to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how many Millions of People come into, and go out of the World, ignorant of themſelves, and of the World they have lived in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If one went to ſee <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor-Caſtle</hi> or <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> it would be ſtrange if he did not obſerve and remember the Situation, the Building, the Gardens, Fountains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33080:10"/>
And yet few People know themſelves; no, not their own Bodies, the Houſes of their Minds, the <hi>moſt curious</hi> Structure of the World; a <hi>living walking</hi> Tabernacle; nor the <hi>World</hi> out of which it was made, and in which it is fed; which would be ſo much our Benefit, as well as our Pleaſure, to know.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The World is a great and ſtately <hi>Volume</hi> of Natural Things; but how very few Leaves of it do we ſeriouſly turn over! This ought to be the Subject of the Education of our <hi>Youth,</hi> who, at 20, when they ſhould be fit for Buſineſs, know not any thing of it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:33080:10"/>
4. We are in Pain to make them Scholars, but not <hi>Men;</hi> to Talk, rather than to Know; which is true <hi>Canting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The firſt thing obvious to Children is what is <hi>Senſible;</hi> And that we make no part of their Rudiments.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We preſs their Memories too ſoon, and puzle, ſtrain and load them with Words and Rules; to know <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and a ſtrange Tongue or two, that it is ten to one may never be uſeful to them; leaving their Natural <hi>Genius</hi> to Mechanical and Phyſical Knowledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated and neglected; which is of exceeding Uſe and Pleaſure to them through the whole courſe of their Life.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33080:11"/>
7. To be ſure, Languages are not to be deſpiſed or neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But Things are to be preferred.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Children had rather be making of <hi>Tools</hi> and <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of Play; <hi>Shaping, Drawing, Framing</hi> and <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. than getting ſome Rules of Propriety of Speech by Heart: And thoſe alſo would follow with more Judgment, and leſs Trouble and Time.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It were happy if we ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature more in Natural Things; and acted according to Nature; whoſe Rules are <hi>few, plain</hi> and <hi>moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Let us begin where ſhe begins, go her pace, and cloſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33080:11"/>
always where ſhe ends, and we cannot miſs of being <hi>Naturaliſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. The World would not be longer a Riddle to us, the <hi>Heavens, Earth</hi> and <hi>Waters,</hi> with their reſpective, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and numerous Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; their Productions, Natures, Seaſons, Simpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies and Antipathies; their Uſe, Benefit and Pleaſure, would be better underſtood by us: And an <hi>Eternal Wiſdom, Power, Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> very <hi>conſpicuous</hi> to us, through thoſe ſenſible and paſſing Forms: The World wearing the <hi>Mark</hi> of its Maker, whoſe Stamp is every where <hi>viſible,</hi> and the <hi>Characters</hi> very <hi>legible</hi>

In ſhort, Man is <hi>ſpending</hi> all upon a <hi>bare</hi> Houſe, and hath little or no Furniture within to recommend it; Which is preferring the Cabinet before the Jewel, a Leaſe of ſeven years before an Inheritance.

            <p n="25">25. The want of due Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is the cauſe of all the Unhappineſs Man brings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf. For his ſecond

            <p n="34">34. Diſcontentedneſs is not only in ſuch a caſe Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but Injuſtice. For we are both unthankful for the time we had it, and not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt enough to reſtore it, if we could keep it.</p>

the words are apt, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions very natural.

            <p n="268">268. If we are but ſure the End is Right, we gallop over all Bounds to compaſs it; not conſidering that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ends may be very unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attained.</p>

            <p n="276">276. If this be true, <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and their Grandees, of all Men, are the unhappieſt: For they live leaſt <hi>alone.</hi> And they that muſt be enjoy'd by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body, can never enjoy themſelves.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="281">281. The Firſt is endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd by the Ambition of the <hi>Populace;</hi> which ſhakes the Conſtitution: The other by an ill Adminiſtration; which hazards the Tyrant and his Family.</p>
            <p n="282">282. It is great Wiſdom in Princes of both ſorts, not

            </p>
            <p n="287">287. Where the Magiſtrate ſerves ill turns, he loſes his Authority with the People; and gives the Populace op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to gratify their Ambition; And ſo lays a <hi>Stumbling-block</hi> for his People to fall.</p>
            <p n="288">288. It is true, that where a Subject is more popular than the Prince, the Prince is in Danger: But it is as true, that it is his <hi>own Fault:</hi> For no Body has the like <hi>Means, Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> to be popular as He.</p>

289.

            <p n="298">298. It is certain, Princes ought to have great Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances made them for Faults in Government; ſince they ſee by other People's Eyes, and hear by their Ears. But <hi>Miniſters</hi> of State, their immediate Confidents and Inſtruments, have much to anſwer for, if to gratify pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Paſſions, they miſguide the Prince to do a publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>

            <p n="301">301. If Miniſters are weak or ill Men, and ſo ſpoil their Places, it is the Prince's Fault that choſe them: But if their Places ſpoil them, it is <hi>their Fault</hi> to be made worſe by them.</p>

302. It is but juſt that thoſe that reign by their Princes, ſhould ſuffer for their Prince's: For it is a ſafe and neceſſary Maxim, not to ſhift Heads in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while the Hands are in being that ſhould anſwer for them.</p>
            <p n="303">303. And yet it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to be a Miniſter of State, if every Body may be Accuſer and Judge.</p>

the Adminiſtration: And nothing contributes more to this Diſorder, than a <hi>partial</hi> diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſhments in the Sovereign.</p>
            <p n="314">314. As it is not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that Men ſhould be compel'd to ſerve; ſo thoſe that have Employments ſhould not be endured to leave them humourouſly.</p>

            <p n="316">316. A private Life is to be preferred; the Honour and Gain of publick Poſts, bearing no proportion with the Benefits of it. The one

            <p n="317">317. It was a great Anſwer of the <hi>Shunamite</hi> Woman, <hi>I dwell among my own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="332">332. It is a Diſhonour to Government, that its Officers ſhould live of Benevolence; As it ought to be infamous for Officers to diſhonour the Publick, by being twice paid for the ſame Buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="333">333. But to be paid, and not to do Buſineſs, is rank Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p n="334">334. <hi>Diſpatch</hi> is a great and good Quality in an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer; where Duty, not Gain, excites it. But of this too many make their private Market and <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:33080:57"/>
to their Wages. Thus the Salary is for <hi>doing,</hi> and the <hi>Bribe</hi> for <hi>diſpatching</hi> the Buſineſs; As if Buſineſs could be done before it were diſpatched; Or what ought to be done, ought not to be diſpatched; Or they were to be paid a part, one by the Government, t'other by the Party.</p>
            <p n="335">335. Diſpatch is as much the Duty of an Officer, as doing; and very much the Honour of the Government he ſerves.</p>
            <p n="336">336. <hi>Patience</hi> is a Virtue every where; but it ſhines with great Luſtre in the Men of Government.</p>
            <p n="337">337. Some are ſo Proud or Teſty, they wont hear,

what they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</p>
            <p n="338">338. Others ſo weak, they ſink or burſt under the weight of their Office, tho' they can eaſily <hi>run away</hi> with the Salery of it.</p>
            <p n="339">339. Buſineſs can never be well done, that is not well underſtood: Which cannot be without Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p n="340">340. It is Cruelty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not to give the Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py an <hi>Hearing,</hi> whom we ought to help: But it is the top of Oppreſſion to <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat</hi> the humble and modeſt Miſerable, when they ſeek Relief.</p>
            <p n="341">341. Some, it is true, are unreaſonable in their

Deſires and Hopes: But then we ſhould inform, not rail at and reject them.</p>
            <p n="342">342. It is therefore as great an Inſtance of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as a Man in Buſineſs can give, to be <hi>Patient under the Impertinencies and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions that attend it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="343">343. <hi>Method</hi> goes far to prevent trouble in Buſineſs: For it makes the Task eaſie, hinders Confuſion, ſaves abundance of Time, and inſtructs thoſe that have Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs depending, both what to do and what to hope.</p>
            <p n="344">344. <hi>Impartiality,</hi> tho 'it be the laſt, is not the leaſt part of the Character of a good Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p n="345">
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:33080:58"/>

            <p n="348">348. She has but <hi>one Scale and Weight,</hi> for Rich and Poor, Great and Small.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="350">350. The Impartial Judge in Judgment, knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Law; The Prince no more than the

Peaſant; his Kindred, than a Stranger. Nay, his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> is ſure to be upon equal Terms with his Friend, when he is upon the Bench.</p>
            <p n="351">351. Impartiality is the Life of Juſtice; as That is of Government.</p>
            <p n="352">352. Nor is it only a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit in the State, but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families cannot ſubſiſt comfortably without it.</p>
            <p n="353">353. Parents that are partial, are ill obeyed by their Children; and partial Maſters not better ſerved by their Servants.</p>
            <p n="354">354. Partiality is always <hi>Indirect,</hi> if not Diſhoneſt: For it ſhews a <hi>Byaſs</hi> where Reaſon would have none;

if not an <hi>Injury,</hi> which Juſtice every where forbids.</p>
            <p n="355">355. As it makes Favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites without Reaſon, ſo it uſes no Reaſon in judging of Actions; Confirming the Proverb, <hi>The Crow thinks her own Bird the faireſt.</hi>

            <p n="357">357. Nay how <hi>ugly</hi> do our own Failings look to us in the Perſons of <hi>others,</hi> which yet we ſee not in our ſelves?</p>
            <p n="358">358. And but too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon it is, for ſome People, not to know their own Maxims and Principles in the <hi>Mouths</hi> of other Men,
