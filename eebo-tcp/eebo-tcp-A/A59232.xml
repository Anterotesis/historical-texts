            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE DEDICATORY TO THE LEARNED STUDENTS OF Both Our Universities.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>REason</hi> being Man's Nature, and the Proper Act of Reason, the Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Evidently New Knowledges out of Antecedent ones, it may seem Wonderful that Mankind, after the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Reason and Disputing so long time, should still Disagree in their Sentiments, and contradict one another in inferring their Conclusions: so that those who are sam'd for the Greatest Philosophers, do still remain in Perpetual, and (as far as it can be discern'd) Endless and Irreconcileable Variance and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sension about their Tenets. It seems to shock
<pb facs="tcp:62043:6"/>
the very Definition of <hi>Man,</hi> and to lay in some sort a scandal upon Creative Wisdom it self, that, whereas all other Creatures do arrive at the Natural End for which they were made, Mankind alone, nay the Noblest Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Kind, who cultivate their Thoughts with the most exact care that may be, should still miss of Reasoning rightly, and so fall short of True Knowledge, which is their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Perfection.</hi> What Tree but bears the <hi>Fruit</hi> Proper to its Kind? Or, what Cause in the World but produces such <hi>Effects</hi> as are sutable to its Nature? And tho', by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering of Cross-Agents, there <hi>happens</hi> now and then a Deficiency in some very Few Particulars, yet that Defect is never found in a Considerable part of the <hi>Species;</hi> for <hi>Chance</hi> would not be <hi>Chance</hi> if it did come near the reaching an <hi>Universality</hi>: whereas Mankind, in its <hi>whole</hi> Latitude, seems to fall short of improving it self in Truth; at least, in gaining Certainty of it; or, if some have attain'd it, yet the Number of those <hi>Right Reasoners</hi> is so very Inconsiderable, that they are <hi>lost</hi> amongst the Croud of those who <hi>stray</hi> into <hi>Errour.</hi> Nor can those <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Few</hi> who have light on it, obtain Quiet Possession of what they have Acquir'd; but their Title to it is perpetually Disputed by
<pb facs="tcp:62043:6"/>
Great Multitudes of Pretenders; who put in their Claim, and set up their Pleas for their Opposit Tenets. Whence, our First En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry ought to be, <hi>how</hi> Man's Nature comes to be so Disabled from performing its <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Operation,</hi> or from <hi>Reasoning right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> that so we may bethink our selves by what Means it may (if possible) recover the true use of its Natural Faculty; how it may be cur'd of the Impotency it labours under; and be freed from those Impediments which hinder it from Acting as it ought.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Divines will tell us that this mischief happens thro' <hi>Original Sin.</hi> Nor can it be doubted but there is <hi>some</hi> Truth in what they alledge. For, questionless, Passion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storts the Understanding by the Ascendent which the Depraved Will has over it in such Concerns as the Will is addicted to, and has espous'd an Interest in. But, this comes not up fully to our difficulty. For, granting that, when the Soul is thus originally tainted, the Will influences and byasses the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, so as it cannot discern clearly the just value of Spiritual Goods, and, by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it to such False Goods for which it self has a Passionate Concern, it makes it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value Vile Pleasures, Aiery Honour or Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Profit; whence, it becomes blinded and
<pb facs="tcp:62043:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
makes wrong Iudgments both of the one and the other; yet, I see no Reason why Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, which works only by giving us <hi>Corrupt Inclinations,</hi> should hinder us from concluding right in points <hi>meerly Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> to which our Discourse confines us; nor why an <hi>Archimedes,</hi> an <hi>Euclid,</hi> an <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> or an <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> tho' Heathens, may not arrive a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Truth in Mathematicks, and other Sciences to which they apply'd themselves; nor why a man of a Wicked Life, whose Soul is Corrupted with Actual Sin ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Original, may not cast up an Accompt right, as well as he might have done had <hi>Adam</hi> never fallen. To deduce Consequences right out of other Knowledges, which we call the Premisses, is so <hi>nearly</hi> ally'd to our very <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Rational Nature,</hi> that quite to lose that Faculty seems the same as to lose our Manhood; which we cannot be thought to have forfeited by the Fault of our First Parents. Nor has the Depravation of our Will any Interest or Inclination tempting it to be Accessary to such a Miscarriage: Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Acquisition of Science is so Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Innate Vanity and Desire of Esteem, that it runs along with the grain of that primigenial Imperfection. The Honour that accrues to an Eminent Scholar prints
<pb facs="tcp:62043:7"/>
him in such a Character, and is so grateful to Pride and Self-love, that it excites In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in Reasoning, does sooth and not thwart those Vicious Inclinations. Besides, there have been without doubt, many Persons of Eminent Virtue among the Schoolmen both of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and former Ages; who by a long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic'd Habit of Virtue have rectify'd those sinister Propensions of the Will inherited from their Parents; and yet, by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting one another, we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Whence we may conclude that neither Virtuous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations do avail the Good, nor do Vicious ones considerably or discernibly hinder the Bad in order to their Attainment of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Wherefore, we must look for <hi>Another</hi> reason for these constant Miscarriages, and this Unaccountable Disagreement among Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers and Speculaters; and how it comes that the Truth or Falshood of very few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions have, in so many Ages, been <hi>deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively</hi> Determined; or, which is the same, why <hi>Truth,</hi> in things subject to Reason, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, in so <hi>long</hi> time, be made <hi>clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62043:8"/>Reflecting then that Mathematicians do very rarely <hi>disagree</hi> in their Conclusions; or, if any <hi>differ</hi> from the rest, as in the Quadrature of the Circle, or such like, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thro' Surprize, or Unattentiveness to the long train of Consequences which are prae-requisit to those Conclusions; and that by this means a Mistake happens, the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is evidently discover'd, so that even the Mistaker himself is convinced of his Failing, when it comes to be thorowly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by others, Learned in the same Art, who like By-standers see more than did the Gamester; this leads us naturally to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether the <hi>same</hi> Clear Way <hi>has</hi> been taken in <hi>other</hi> parts of Philosophy, as has been in <hi>that</hi> Science. And, at first sight it appears manifestly it <hi>has not.</hi> For 'tis evident that Geometricians do lay for their Axioms <hi>Self-evident Propositions</hi> and <hi>clear Definitions;</hi> and their <hi>Postulatums</hi> are not such as are <hi>meerly</hi> begg'd or <hi>supposed,</hi> and so need our Favour to let them pass for Truths; but they <hi>claim</hi> our Assent to them as their <hi>Due;</hi> and the Consequenees they draw are all of them <hi>Immediate;</hi> which makes the Contexture of the whole Work <hi>Close</hi> and <hi>Compacted.</hi> Whereas I have not observ'd that any other sort of Philosophers have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:62043:8"/>
that Clear Method. Whence we have good reason to suspect that the want of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Method, or something Equivalent to it, has been the sole oecasion of all those Deviations from Truth and Disagreements among Philosophers in their Conclusions and Tenets, which we find in the World. I say, <hi>[or something Equivalent to it.]</hi> For, I do not expect that every Demonstrater should be ty'd to observe that severe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod <hi>in rigour.</hi> This were to condemn <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi> and all the Philosophers that ever writ hitherto. 'Tis too laborious to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to cast his Thoughts perpetually into that Nice and Exact Frame; and very Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie for the Readers also, and would too much strain their Brains to keep them still bent to such a Solicitous Attention. Besides, a Discourse that proceeds <hi>endways</hi> by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Connexion, does comprehend as much in one page, as in <hi>Euclid</hi>'s Method could be contain'd in Many. 'Tis enough then that such Discourses be so <hi>perfectly Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> that they can, if need be, bear that most Rigorous Test. And <hi>such</hi> they must be; or, otherwise, they will scarce pass muster with Acute Wits, who <hi>candidly</hi> and unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assedly pursue <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62043:9"/>Nor does this precise Mathematical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod sute, in all regards, with the <hi>other</hi> parts of Philosophy. For the Notions <hi>that</hi> Science is employ'd in are, for the most part, <hi>Extension</hi> and <hi>Figure;</hi> which being percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to our Sight, they show the thing, in some sort, to our <hi>Eye,</hi> as well as demonstrate it by Reason to our Understanding; whereas, scarce any Other Science affords us this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; which forces us to have recourse only to our <hi>Notions,</hi> and to strive to make them Clear by <hi>Definitions.</hi> In which, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no assistance from our Fancy or Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Representations, they are hence <hi>less ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily</hi> Imprinted and Reflected on; which makes our Attainment of Science more Laborious. Yet, notwithstanding this Accidental Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, their Productions are <hi>not at all</hi> less Evident or less Certain to the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For, it is not the Noting them with A, B, C, that either <hi>makes</hi> them True, or <hi>shows</hi> them to <hi>be so;</hi> but the <hi>Connexion</hi> of the <hi>Notions</hi> we have of those Lines, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, or other Quantities, and of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions to one another, which we voluntarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to signifie by such Letters. Whence results this Evident and Comfortable Corollary that Clear Demonstrations may be had, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, Science attain'd, in other parts of
<pb facs="tcp:62043:9"/>
Philosophy, and in all Other Subjects, <hi>as well</hi> (tho' <hi>not so easily</hi>) as in those of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks; so the Notions belonging to those Subjects be but <hi>Clear'd</hi> and rightly <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected;</hi> sinee 'tis the Connexion of Notions, or (as Logicians phrase it) the <hi>Connexion of Terms,</hi> which does beget Science, and not the Formality of <hi>Lines</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> us'd by Mathematicians.</p>
            <p>By this time we may seem to have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the true reason of the General Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of most Philosophers in the pursuit of Truth. For, since 'tis Impossible that he who intends to Travel to <hi>London,</hi> tho' he have both Clear Eyes, and Strong Legs, and employs both of them to his utmost, should ever arrive at his Iourney's End if he does not take the Right <hi>Way</hi> to it; so it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Impossible any Man should arrive at <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> if he takes not the right <hi>Method</hi> or Way to attain it, tho' he have never so Clear a Natural Wit, and a Strong Brain, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours never so industriously to make use of both to his best advantage. Providence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is justify'd, and the Ability of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faculty asserted; and the Blame lies wholly at the doors of the <hi>Persons</hi> who do not <hi>first</hi> apply their Thoughts to <hi>know</hi> the Way to Truth, e'er they set forwards in
<pb facs="tcp:62043:10"/>
quest of it: but chiefly in those who pretend to be Guides to others, and yet are Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Ignorant of the <hi>Method</hi> that can bring men to it. Mathematicians <hi>take</hi> the Way, and so arrive <hi>at it.</hi> Others (a very few exeepted) do <hi>not take</hi> it, and therefore <hi>miss</hi> of it. Whence we may establish this Fundamental and most Useful Maxim, that <hi>The First and Chief Study of those who pursue true Knowledge in Philosophy, is to apply their Industry to comprehend the METHOD or WAY to it:</hi> that, If <hi>they find not</hi> that, <hi>their most earnest Study is lost Labour;</hi> but that, <hi>having once found it, they cannot doubt of compassing their</hi> End <hi>by using such</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means.</p>
            <p>But is not the <hi>Knowledge of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> insuperably hard to be attain'd? For, if it be, we are never the nearer, but still at the same Loss. To give a Stop to such an apprehension, I must avow that no part of Mathematicks is more Demonstrable than is the <hi>Way</hi> to Demonstrate, or the <hi>METHOD TO SCIENCE.</hi> Nature (as we experience) gives us our Notions; on which, as on its Elements, all Science is grounded. To make these <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Distinct,</hi> we can <hi>distribute</hi> them under <hi>Common Heads,</hi> and <hi>Divide</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62043:10"/>
those Heads by <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> Differences, or such as are <hi>Proper</hi> to each of them, till we come to the Notion we are to discourse of. While we thus <hi>Divide</hi> them, we at the same time, and with the same labour, frame <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions</hi> of each Notion comprehended under those respective Heads; by doing which we gain a Distinct and Clear Conception of them; which does, to a fair degree, faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate our <hi>Judging</hi> whether such or such of them may be with Truth connected in <hi>Propositions,</hi> (or in such Speeches as <hi>Affirm</hi> or <hi>Deny,</hi>) in which <hi>Truth</hi> does Formally consist. To do this more exactly, we consider that those Propositions must either be such as show <hi>of themselves</hi> that the Two Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (call'd it <hi>Terms</hi>) must be Connected; and then they are <hi>Self-connected</hi> or <hi>Self-evident:</hi> Or else they need to be <hi>shown Connected</hi> by means of some <hi>other</hi> Notion which is Connected with them both; to show which we call <hi>Proving.</hi> Those of the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> sort, if perfectly such, are fit to be <hi>First Principles;</hi> whose Nature, as Common Sense tells us, is not to <hi>need</hi> or <hi>admit</hi> of Proof. The Connexion of the <hi>later</hi> sort is made known by <hi>Proof,</hi> or by their joint Connexion with a <hi>Third,</hi> which we call the <hi>Middle Term, Medium</hi> or <hi>Argument;</hi> to do which
<pb facs="tcp:62043:11"/>
is the Proper work of <hi>Discourse</hi> or <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination</hi>: These Three Terms rightly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or put together, compound that most Close and Exact Discourse call'd a <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism.</hi> Certain and most Evident Rules may be assign'd <hi>how</hi> to <hi>place</hi> those Three Terms in the two first Propositions, so as that Discourse may be most <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous;</hi> as also, how to find out such a <hi>Middle</hi> Term as is Proper to Connect the <hi>other Two,</hi> whose Connexion or Truth is under Dispute; and to show the Force of the Consequence, and <hi>why</hi> a New Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion call'd the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> must most <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow</hi> out of the Former ones. All which being Demonstrated, (as I have reason to presume is done in this following Treatise) and the Equivocation of the Words that express our Notions being avoided, I see not what more can be substantially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the <hi>METHOD TO SCIENCE.</hi> For, our Notions being Clear'd, First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples establish'd, the true Form of a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism manifested, Proper Middle Terms found, and the Necessity of the Consequence evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced; all those Conclusions may be Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with <hi>Demonstrative Evidence,</hi> which ly within our Ken, or which we can have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to enquire after; that is, all that we
<pb facs="tcp:62043:11"/>
have <hi>Notions</hi> of: provided those Notions be not meerly <hi>Accidental,</hi> or very <hi>Remote</hi> from one another, and therefore Incapable of being Connected.</p>
            <p>Yet still there is one Difficulty that sticks, and lies in our way; and which is more, seems hard to be remov'd. For <hi>LOGICK,</hi> or the <hi>Art of Reasoning rightly,</hi> being the Skill which is to teach us this <hi>Method to Science;</hi> and so many Logicks being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Learned Men, and studied by such Multitudes; how comes it that, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such Helps, men do still <hi>differ</hi> in their Tenets, that is, <hi>many</hi> or <hi>most</hi> of them do still <hi>err,</hi> as much as if they had never had such Proper Assistances. For, if Logick shows them the <hi>way</hi> to Science, and they <hi>take</hi> that way, and have a Natural <hi>Ability</hi> to follow it or walk in it, they must <hi>all</hi> arrive at Science; and their Thoughts center in the same Truths without any Disagreement; the contrary to which we do notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Experience. To give an Answer to this, I shall be hard put to it how to bear my self between the two Extremes of Modesty, <hi>Dissimulation</hi> and <hi>Boasting.</hi> For, if I grant those Logicks are as they <hi>ought</hi> to be, that is, <hi>Full</hi> and <hi>Evident,</hi> and <hi>follow'd</hi> by Men of <hi>divers</hi> Sentiments, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb facs="tcp:62043:12"/>
I know not how to reply, or solve the Objection. On the other side, to condemn all the Logicks since <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s time, or all Logicks which are not according to his Grounds, is to set up our selves, and savours of Arrogancy. In this porplexity I have no way to secure my self but to speak the plain <hi>Truth,</hi> and to hope it will bear me out. I must then, in behalf of <hi>Truth,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the Pretended Logicks themselves are in the greatest Fault. For, 'tis easie to observe, that they do indeed give many <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>unprov'd</hi> Rules and Maxims; they afford many Definitions, some right, some wrong, being oftentimes Illogical and fram'd out of Fancy; they pester their Books with many unnecessary Divisions and Subdivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they treat very largely of the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, of Single, Opposit and Aequipollent Propositions; they are prolix and superfluous in their Doctrine about Syllogisms, their Moods, Figures, several sorts of idle Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which look very Learned to New Beginners; who do, therefore, take much pains to lay them up in their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; I say <hi>in their Memory,</hi> for none of those passages being Demonstrated, they never sunk into or settled in their <hi>Reason.</hi> And therefore, notwithstanding all this, when they
<pb facs="tcp:62043:12"/>
have as it were got without Book all these particulars, the Readers are no wiser how to demonstrate any point practically, or how to set himself about it, than he was before he read those Treatises.</p>
            <p>I have studied many of those Logicks my self when I was young, and all of any note I had seen then, and consider'd them very attentively, till I had almost lost my <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason</hi> by dwelling upon them; yet notwithstanding (and I believe the same pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with other young Students) I knew no more how to go to work to demonstrate any thing, than if I had never seen them. They started now and then some curious, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musing (but jejune and useless) Questions about <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> Unions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and set many confused <hi>Ideas</hi> of the several parts of Logick in my <hi>Memory</hi>; but still my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> was not Enlighten'd, nor enabled to perform those fine things they had told me of. Nor was it any wonder; for they spoke not to my <hi>Reason,</hi> nor endeavour'd to ground their Discourse on the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Things</hi> in hand; nor to show demonstratively <hi>why</hi> every Step they led me, or Lesson they taught me, <hi>must</hi> be True; nor <hi>how</hi> it did influence True Knowledge, or advance dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly towards the Acquisition of <hi>Science;</hi> so
<pb facs="tcp:62043:13"/>
that it look'd more like a kind of <hi>History</hi> of what those Authours had <hi>said</hi> or <hi>writ,</hi> than like a <hi>Method</hi> to find out <hi>Truth;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that I came at length to suspect that the Intention of those kind of Logicians, was not to pursue the Knowledge of Truth, which is only to be had by Clear Demonstration; but that they meant to furnish young Wits with certain <hi>Modes of Talking</hi> with a <hi>show</hi> of Learning, and of signalizing themselves for being able to argue <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con</hi> indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scholastick Dissertations. It resembled the Tiring of a Hawk, serving only to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise its Nibbling Faculty, and whet the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, but had nothing of <hi>Nutritive</hi> in it to <hi>satisfie</hi> it. For, Reflexion will teach us very Evidently, that only that which is made <hi>Clear</hi> to our <hi>Reason,</hi> can <hi>Settle</hi> in it, <hi>Nourish</hi> and <hi>Dilate</hi> it, as being <hi>Proper</hi> and Connatural <hi>Food</hi> to a Rational Soul; and that whatever we take in or carelesly swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that is not such, but meerly <hi>Wordish</hi> only fills us full of <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Ayr,</hi> which breaks out in <hi>Insipid Talk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fault then lies evidently in the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks which have been us'd in the Schools hitherto, none of which have attempted to show <hi>Demonstratively</hi> the Way <hi>how</hi> to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, or given us a Connected Discourse
<pb facs="tcp:62043:13"/>
of the <hi>METHOD TO SCIENCE.</hi> 'Tis noted that the <hi>Practice</hi> of the Preacher go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> makes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it self more Edifying: and, by pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had the Teachers of Logick <hi>Practised</hi> Demonstration all the while they had taught how to Demonstrate, those Rules, so Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally imprinted, <hi>sinking deep</hi> into their Soul, and thence becoming as it were a <hi>Limb</hi> or <hi>Faculty</hi> of their <hi>Judgment,</hi> would have truly Enabled them how to <hi>act</hi> accordingly; whereas, while they <hi>swim</hi> only in their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> they serve for nothing but to pour out indigestedly what they had rawly taken in.</p>
            <p>But now, where is that Authour who has hitherto made such an Useful and Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Attempt? None that I know of. The Treatise call'd <hi>Ars cogitandi</hi> has divers Excellent things in it, and in some places has made many good steps towards <hi>True Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick;</hi> and the Examples it brings are very Illustrating. But yet, in the main, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more but <hi>The Schools Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd</hi> into Method and Elegancy. It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with many useless particulars: It does not bottom it self upon <hi>Nature,</hi> only which can give <hi>Solidity</hi> to our Reasons: It has many Unprov'd <hi>Suppositions,</hi> and bare <hi>Sayings</hi> without offering any <hi>Proof.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62043:14"/>
And, yet I do verily believe that, had not the Authours calculated it for that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sort of Philosophy they had espous'd, which could <hi>bear</hi> no Evidence, but had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the guidance of their own Natural <hi>Genius</hi> (which, doubtless, was very Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary) it would have much excell'd its present self. * Mr. <hi>Le Grand's Method says</hi> much, but <hi>proves</hi> little; and I believe, both <hi>Cartesius,</hi> and himself, did first consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and survey the whole Scheme of their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and then <hi>fitted</hi> their <hi>Logick</hi> to it. Which is Preposterous and Praeter-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; for the certain <hi>Way</hi> to the <hi>End</hi> of our Iourney should be <hi>foreknown,</hi> ere we set the <hi>First step</hi> towards it. Mr. <hi>Lushington</hi> has with much pains gone about to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate some particulars of the Summulist part of Logick, and chiefly that about <hi>Predicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But, there is nothing at all of <hi>Nature</hi> in his Grounds. He regards not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions of Mankind, nor in what they consist; and therefore his Discourses are so perfectly Artificial, that they have nothing to say to <hi>Nature,</hi> nor Nature to <hi>them.</hi> He imposes imprudently new Language and new Terms upon his Readers, which he might have assur'd himself they would never take pains to learn. He affects the way of A, B, C,
<pb facs="tcp:62043:14"/>
which makes a show of Science; but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Discourse is, oftentimes, no more but the bare Proposition he is to prove, onely drest up in a Mathematical Garb. His whole Book, in my judgment, might have been more clearly compriz'd in one Sheet of Paper: And, lastly, as for want of <hi>Nature</hi> to ground his Conceptions, his several Proofs can never enter into the <hi>Reason,</hi> so 'tis almost Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they should ever stay long in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</hi> Yet his Attempt to demonstrate in such a Sceptical Age, and his Industry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a fair Commendation, and may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke others to make the <hi>same</hi> Attempt with <hi>better</hi> Success. <hi>Burgersdicius</hi> is clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd for the <hi>Memory</hi> onely, and not for the <hi>Reason;</hi> and he confounds and over-burthens <hi>it</hi> too, with the Multitude of his Canons, Rules, and Divisions; for which he seldome or never gives any <hi>reason,</hi> but puts them to be <hi>Believ'd</hi> by his Reader if he pleases; and, so leaves him still <hi>in the dark.</hi> Yet he might be made Useful to New Beginners; were something of every thing, that is to purpose, pick'd out; Unnecessary things (in which he super-abounds) cut <hi>off;</hi> his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, which <hi>are</hi> not a few, Corrected by some Learned hand; and his shatter'd thrums<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends woven into <hi>some</hi> kind of Connexion,
<pb facs="tcp:62043:15"/>
and Dependence on one another; to do which, little Transitions from one passage to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other are Insufficient. But, as he is, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms not the Understanding of any one thing groundedly or solidly. He falls excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly short of <hi>Ars cogitandi</hi> in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards: How, he may please Climates of a duller <hi>Genius</hi> I know not; but I should much wonder if any Learned Englishman should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider or esteem him. Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> far exceeds him in good Sense, and in giving some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for what he says in many particular pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages. But, by his framing the Contexture of his Book out of Authours of different Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, his Discourses do sometimes appear Desultory, and like a kind of Elaborate Rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sody, laid well together by his own good Wit. He mistakes <hi>Aristotle</hi> now and then, by taking his Sentiments as represented by his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries; whose Interest and Principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to make them misconceive him. He abounds with many Reflexions not all condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to <hi>Science.</hi> A Fault, from which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> himself was not altogether free; which makes it more pardonable. For instance; To what purpose are his many Distinctions of his Propositions, especially those he calls <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponibiles</hi>? Let but the Learner know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and liquidly, what are the <hi>Subject</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62043:15"/>
and <hi>Predicate</hi> in any Proposition, which is easie to be discover'd by the <hi>Copula</hi> that is to come <hi>between</hi> them, and <hi>unite</hi> them; and have a care that the words that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them are Univocal; he will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with means to see the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,</hi> which is Essential to a Proposition, and is onely Conducive to <hi>Science,</hi> which wholly consists in the <hi>Connexion of Terms.</hi> His chief Misfortune is, that he does not seem either at the beginning, or in the Process of his Book, to <hi>know,</hi> at least to <hi>build upon</hi> this Truth and stand to it, that our <hi>Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or (as the Moderns have taken a Toy to call them) <hi>Ideas,</hi> are the <hi>very Natures of the Things in our Understanding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by Outward Objects</hi>; without which no Stability of those Notions or <hi>Ideas</hi> can be, with Evidence, asserted; nor any Solid know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge possibly be had of our <hi>Predications;</hi> nor the true Ground of <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falshood</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; nor, consequently, ean there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Firmness in our <hi>Judgments</hi> or <hi>Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> Whence, I could wish that every Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were at first well instructed and settled in this point; for, without this, all will be but Loose, and Ungrounded Talk in the Air. And, tho' I lose Credit with our late Wits, I must avow that <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s dry Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:62043:16"/>
that <hi>[Anima intelligendo fit omnia,]</hi> tho' it may seem to some a wild Paradox, has more Solid Sense in it, were it rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, and is more Useful to true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, than all the other Maxims that do not proceed upon it, and suppose it; which yet I see the Goodness of Nature <hi>intimates</hi> to many, and forces them to ground their Discourses on it <hi>Practically;</hi> even tho', while they speculate, they <hi>deny</hi> it, or, at least, seem to doubt of it, or disregard it.</p>
            <p>Observing therefore this great want un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Philosophy (which is the <hi>Study of Truth</hi>) labours, I have, out of my true Zeal of improving <hi>Science,</hi> and beating down <hi>Scepticism,</hi> (the profest Patron of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> and covert Parent of all <hi>Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) hazarded the Opinion of Singularity in endeavouring to write and publish a <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative Logick;</hi> at least I have given such Reasons, quite thorough it, as I judg'd to be Clear and Conclusive, in every piece of it that has any Influence upon Scientifical Knowledge. What my Reader may expect from me is this. I begin with our Natural Notions, the <hi>Bottom-Ground</hi> of all our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. I show them to be the very Natures of the <hi>Things;</hi> whose Metaphysical Verity being <hi>Establish'd</hi> by Creative Wisdom, does,
<pb facs="tcp:62043:16"/>
consequently, give <hi>Stability,</hi> and <hi>Solidity</hi> to all our Discourses that are built on them. I <hi>distribute</hi> those Natural Notions under those several Common Heads, and manifest why there must be so many and no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I trace Nature in all those nice and Immediate steps she takes to <hi>generate</hi> Knowledge in us <hi>at First.</hi> Coming to those Propositions that <hi>need Proof,</hi> and the <hi>Way</hi> of Proving them, I lay open the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Ground of the <hi>Force of Consequence,</hi> which gives the Nerves to every Act of <hi>True Reasoning,</hi> and of the Certainty and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of every Conclusion which we rightly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr.</hi> To perform which, I manifest that there can be but <hi>One</hi> Necessary or Natural <hi>Figure</hi> of a Syllogism, and but <hi>Four Moods</hi> of that Figure.

Term;</hi> by the Connexion of which with the <hi>Two Terms</hi> of the <hi>Thesis</hi> to be Proved, they must inevitably be joyn'd with one another, and so the <hi>Thesis</hi> it self must be rightly Concluded; and, therefore, Infallibly <hi>True.</hi> I show how to <hi>find out</hi> a Middle Term fit for our purpose, and thence prepare the way for Demonstration. I lay open how every <hi>Truth</hi> must have at the Bottom an <hi>Identical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> and every <hi>Errour a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as their First Principles, and how they may be <hi>reduced</hi> to those Principles of theirs: To do which (tho' more laborious) is the best Way of Demonstrating. I manifest thence how one Truth is <hi>in</hi> another, and what strange Consequences follow thence. Also, how Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Terms, Proper for Demonstration, may be taken from all the Four Causes. To clear better the Notion of <hi>Science,</hi> I treat of the Natures of <hi>Opinion,</hi> and (Human) <hi>Faith;</hi> their <hi>Grounds,</hi> and how the Former of these two last Deviates from Right Reason; and when the Later does, or does not. Then I consider the <hi>Effects</hi> issuing from all sorts of Proof; viz. <hi>Assent, Suspense, Certainty,</hi> and <hi>Uncertainty.</hi> And, to put in Practise my self what I do persuade, and recommend to others, I add Seven <hi>Demonstrations</hi> of the most Considerable <hi>Theses</hi> in divers Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
<pb facs="tcp:62043:17"/>
And, lastly, I lay open the Ways and Methods of <hi>Disputation;</hi> and detect the weak Stratagems, and inefficacious Attacques of <hi>Fallacies,</hi> or <hi>Paralogisms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Summ of my Endeavours in common. But, besides these, many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Knowledges light in on the by, (and, as I hope, very <hi>Useful</hi> ones) which it would be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to enumerate. The <hi>Manner</hi> I use to carry on the Scheme of my Doctrin, is, not to propose my Conceptions <hi>Magisterially,</hi> or to expect any one should assent to the least Tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of what I <hi>say</hi> upon my <hi>Word</hi>: But, I offer my <hi>Reasons</hi> for every Paragraph I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, if it can be conceiv'd to need any; by doing which I speak to the <hi>Reason</hi> of my Readers, and withall I <hi>expose</hi> my self to the Severe Examination of the most Acute and Iudicious Wits; of which, I doubt not, there are Multitudes in those Seminaries of Learning, our two Famous Universities; to whom I humbly dedicate this small Present. I neither strive to <hi>ingratiate</hi> my self by my <hi>Style,</hi> nor to <hi>surprize</hi> any by <hi>Plausible</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; much less to <hi>Impose</hi> upon their Understandings by Voluntary <hi>Suppositions.</hi> I draw now and then divers Useful Corollaries, and some that will seem, I doubt not, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxical; that so I may carry on my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

to farther Consequences, and show withall to what Unthought-of Conclusions <hi>Reason</hi> will lead us if we follow her <hi>close</hi> and <hi>home.</hi> Nor am I asham'd to declare openly, that I hold, that the Chief End of <hi>Science</hi> is to beget <hi>Virtue;</hi> and not onely to raise us to Higher Contemplation, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to comfort, and strengthen <hi>Divine Faith</hi> in us, and to make it more <hi>Lively</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative.</hi> Whence I have taken occasion to excite my Reader's <hi>Devotion</hi> out of the Reflexions on divers Points, that seem'd of themselves to be but <hi>Dry Speculations</hi>: making account that Good Thoughts arising, upon the Spot, but of Truths <hi>newly Clear'd</hi> to our Reason, do affect the Will most conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, <hi>raise</hi> Devotion, <hi>heighten</hi> Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and make it <hi>Solid;</hi> and, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, keep the Soul Clear from <hi>Idle Fancies,</hi> and set her above <hi>Light Bigotteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have not enumerated these Particulars to boast my Performances, (for these are yet to be Decided, by examining whether the Reasons I have all along produced will bear the Test) but to bespeak my Reader's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, if, travelling in an unbeaten Road, I happen now and then to stumble. Which as I am not conscious to my self to have done at all, so I shall hope I no where do in
<pb facs="tcp:62043:18"/>
any passage that substantially concerns the <hi>METHOD TO SCIENCE:</hi> Rather, I must positively avow that it is impossible for any Wit of Man to invent any <hi>other</hi> Way, than what I have propos'd, that is <hi>Solid</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident.</hi> For, 'tis granted by all Mankind hitherto (unless, perhaps, the <hi>Cartesians</hi>) that Truth is <hi>fundamentally the Conformity of our Judgment to the Nature of the Thing,</hi> and that it consists <hi>Formally</hi> in the <hi>Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Terms;</hi> both which I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>most exactly;</hi> and, as some Readers (I doubt not) will think, <hi>too superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, since <hi>Rectum est mensura sui &amp; obliqui,</hi> my Design engages me to show (as far as the Brevity of a Preface will allow) that the different Methods taken by Others do <hi>not</hi> lead us to true <hi>Science.</hi> And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there is a kind of Necessity laid upon me to make this Charge good: For, since we take Different Methods, if <hi>theirs</hi> be a <hi>Right</hi> one, <hi>mine</hi> must be a <hi>Wrong</hi>; and my Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing it no Advantage, but an Injury to Truth, and to my Greatest Neighbour, the World. The <hi>METHODS</hi> which I pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to examine, shall be of two sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Speculative,</hi> and that of <hi>Experimental</hi> Philosophers; The Former of which pretend
<pb facs="tcp:62043:19"/>
to proceed by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi>; the Later by <hi>Induction;</hi> and both of them aim at advancing <hi>Science.</hi> Looking about for an Instance if the Former sort, I did not think <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and his School worth my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of; for he who <hi>supposes</hi> all his Principles, bids Defiance to all <hi>Methods</hi> of <hi>Concluding</hi> any thing. And, as for our Modern School-Philosophers, they have so disputed themselves quite out of breath for want of any Certain Method, that they have brought all <hi>Science</hi> to an Indifferency of Opinions, or maintaining any thing with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Evidence (or rather No-Evidence) a thing absolutely impossible for those who lay any right <hi>Method to Science.</hi> And this Deficiency of theirs, losing their Credit with our late Wits, have given them occasion to east about how to model Philosophy a-new, and frame it wholly in another Mould: for the Schoolmen on the one side represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Aristotle</hi> wrong, and on the other side his (perhaps affected) Obscurity, won them rather to believe the Schools concerning his Doctrine, than to be at the Expence of Pains and Patience to understand him right, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by himself, or by his First Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62043:19"/>The Inconsiderableness then of other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to a <hi>Method to Science,</hi> and the Weakness of their Pleas, throws me forcibly upon examining the Method of that Great Man, <hi>Cartesius</hi>: It must be confess'd <hi>his Method</hi> is vastly <hi>different</hi> from <hi>mine.</hi> He pretends to a <hi>First Principle,</hi> and the <hi>Self-evidence</hi> of that Principle; which therefore I must either disprove, or give up my Cause, and condemn what I have written; since it is impossible that <hi>two</hi> Methods, contrary to one another, can both of them be the <hi>right</hi> one; or lay just Claim to Self-evidence in their Principles. But, with how Potent an Adversary has my Unlucky Audacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in attempting to lay a <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Method to Science</hi> oblig'd me to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple!

at the very beginning, when he made his <hi>first Doubt;</hi> since <hi>[Dubito ergo sum]</hi> is full as Conclusive of his own Existence as <hi>[Cogito ergo sum]</hi> can be pretended to be.

            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly,</hi> That, notwîthstanding all that can be alledg'd, it must be granted, he <hi>has inferr'd</hi> and <hi>prov'd</hi> that whole <hi>First Principle.</hi> For was not <hi>all</hi> that <hi>anteceded</hi> to the finding it so many <hi>Discourses</hi> or <hi>Reasonings</hi>?

<pb facs="tcp:62043:22"/>
because</hi> all else might be <hi>doubted</hi> of? If not, to what purpose did he pretend he might doubt of all else? For, if this was <hi>Evident of it self,</hi> and not needed to be <hi>Prov'd,</hi> he might have propos'd it at first, without making all that a-do.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4thly,</hi> Since he must necessarily grant that something or other is <hi>inferr'd</hi> or <hi>Prov'd</hi> by him, that is, <hi>follows</hi> from his <hi>Antecedent</hi> Discourses; and, it is evident that, in his opinion, something <hi>did</hi> follow thence, because he <hi>discours'd</hi> or Argu'd all the while, and us'd more than once the word <hi>[Sequitur;]</hi> and no such Discourse can be, but something must still <hi>follow</hi> out of what went <hi>before;</hi> he ought, in the <hi>First</hi> place, and ere he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Discourse, or went about to speak <hi>consequentially,</hi> to have been perfectly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd himself, and have shown his Readers, so as to put it past all Doubt, what the <hi>Force of a right Consequence</hi> is, and in what it <hi>consists;</hi> and that himself, while he discours'd, did make use of such <hi>right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences.</hi> And, he should the rather have done this, because Men do <hi>more frequently err</hi> in drawing <hi>Consequences,</hi> than in judging that they have a Body, that they see, feel, hear, or use their other Senses; all which he represents as possible to be doubted of.

<pb facs="tcp:62043:22"/>
he never starts or makes the least Doubt of his <hi>Consequences,</hi> which are to <hi>bind</hi> the parts of his Discourse together all along, and so bring him orderly to his First Principle; nor gives any Reason <hi>why</hi> they may not be Doubted of <hi>as well as the rest;</hi> nor takes care to settle that Doubt.

               <hi>5thly,</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> No man can have a Clear and Distinct <hi>Idea,</hi> (in which, according to him, all Knowledge consists) of any thing <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi> out of a First Principle, unless he have a Clear and Distinct Knowledge of that Principle <hi>it self:</hi> But <hi>Cartesius,</hi> when, in the Progress of his Thoughts, he came to the settling <hi>Ego cogito</hi> (or <hi>Ego sum</hi>) for his First Principle, had <hi>no</hi> Clear and Distinct Idea of that Principle <hi>it self;</hi> therefore he could have <hi>no</hi> Clear and Distinct <hi>Idea</hi> of any thing which <hi>follow'd</hi> out of that Principle; and, consequently, all that <hi>Method to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> laid by him is Useless to that End, and Fruitless. The <hi>Minor</hi> (which onely can need proof) is thus manifested. For, he had not, as soon as he had arriv'd at that Principle, as
<pb facs="tcp:62043:23"/>
yet any Clear and Distinct Knowledge of the <hi>Subject</hi> of that Principle (or Proposition) <hi>[Ego]</hi> and therefore he had no such Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Proposition or Principle <hi>it self.</hi> The Antecedent is confess'd by himself in the words immediately following the place lately cited, viz. <hi>[Nondum tamen satis intelligo quisnam sim ego ille qui jam necessariò sum]</hi> and thence he proceeds to find, <hi>after</hi> he had found his First Principle, what <hi>Ego</hi> means, and at length conciudes that he was <hi>praecisè res Cogitans, Mens, Ratio, &amp;c.</hi> which Clear and Distinct Conception of himself he had not <hi>before,</hi> tho' he pretended he knew his <hi>First Principle.</hi> Again, when he was newly come to the Knowledge of that First Principle, he is put to know nothing but barely <hi>that;</hi> nor could he gather this Clear Knowledge of <hi>himself</hi> from that Principle <hi>alone,</hi> while it was yet Unknown.

            </p>
            <p>He concludes the Soul to be a Distinct Thing from the Body, because the <hi>Idea</hi> he has of <hi>it,</hi> and of its Properties and Affections are <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different</hi> from the <hi>Idea,</hi> he has of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and its Modifications.

that <hi>a Four-squar'd thing has in it four sides and no more;</hi> of which he pretends he may yet doubt, because some most Powerful Agent may possibly make that appear to him to be so, tho' it be not true in reality.

<pb facs="tcp:62043:25"/>
to <hi>Corporeal Nature,</hi> in which (taking in all circumstances) things are carry'd on from <hi>Proper Causes</hi> to <hi>Proper Effects.</hi> Weak men are sometimes deceiv'd by their Senses; but Speculative or Learned men, who penetrate the Reasons <hi>how</hi> the Senses came to misinform them, are aware of those undue circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by that means easily prevent the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led by them into Errour.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly,</hi> No wise man builds his <hi>Judgments</hi> barely on the Impressions made on his Senses, being taught by their <hi>Reason,</hi> as well as by the Senses <hi>themselves</hi> better circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (that is, by <hi>Experience</hi>) that they <hi>do</hi> sometime, deceive us. Whence, they reserve in their Minds certain <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in <hi>what</hi> circumstances we <hi>may</hi> truly give Credit to their Testimony, in <hi>what,</hi> not. Now, since <hi>Exceptio firmat Regulam,</hi> to say their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is to be Excepted against in <hi>such</hi> Circumstances, is to acknowledge that in all others they are to be trusted.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly,</hi> As Art does preserve the Learned from being Deceiv'd by the Shortness of the Senses in some Cases, so (as was said late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the Senses themselves do generally correct the False Iudgments they may have occasion'd in Weak People. For example, (to use some of the Instances they object,) a <hi>Brand</hi> whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:62043:26"/>
round represents a <hi>Circle of Fire;</hi> a <hi>Stick</hi> in the Water looks <hi>Crooked;</hi> a <hi>Square</hi> Tower seen a far off appears <hi>Round,</hi> and <hi>Great</hi> Bodies <hi>Little.</hi> But when the Seer comes <hi>near</hi> the Brand, the Tower and those Great Bodies, or beholds the Stick <hi>out of</hi> the Water, he having now a more exact View of them in better Circumstances, is inform'd certainly by the same Sense, (and, if need be, by others conspiring with it,) that the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> representations were not sincere; whence he easily corrects his former Mistakes. Why then must the Senses be quite discarded as Useless Servants for Knowledge, and be bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for constant Lyers and Deceivers? since, if we apply them as we ought, they are the Proper Means to make us correct these too forward Iudgments, which in improper Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances they may have occasion'd. Nay, they <hi>advance</hi> our Knowledge accidentally even when they happen to <hi>misinform</hi> us; by stirring us up to enquire whence it came, that the right Impressions on them, from the Objects, which were Customary, was thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; which, doubtless has been the Cause of very many New Knowledges in Nature.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4thly,</hi> What is all this to <hi>Science,</hi> or to our purpose? For in the <hi>Method to Science,</hi> we neither <hi>need,</hi> nor <hi>do</hi> build our <hi>JUDG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62043:26"/>
on the Senses <hi>alone.</hi> All we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire is, that they convey into our Knowing Power right <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>PREHENSIONS</hi> or <hi>NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS</hi> of the things in Nature: And, this 'tis Evident they must do; for tho', as they object, a Large Square Steeple seen a far off seems <hi>Round</hi> and <hi>Little;</hi> and therefore who <hi>Judges</hi> it such is Deceiv'd; yet it imprints truly in my Mind the Notion of <hi>Little</hi> and <hi>Round;</hi> and, 'tis on these unmistakable <hi>NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS</hi> all our Science is built; and our <hi>Judging</hi> right in our Speculations is chiefly grounded on other Principles, as will be seen hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Themselves must either grant the Certainty of those Impressions on the Senses, or they must confess all their <hi>Ideas</hi> are nothing worth.

               </note> 
               <hi>Ingenit Ideas</hi> of such a Body are either Excited in the Soul, or else are, as <hi>Cartesius</hi> elsewhere expresses it, <hi>Elicited,</hi> that is <hi>Produced</hi> by it, upon the hint given it by such a Motion; in case the Impressions causing such Motions be not Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and do not truly inform her, a <hi>wrong Idea</hi> may come to be made use of, and so they can never have any certain Knowledge of any thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62043:27"/>Having thus got rid of the Senses giving us notice of <hi>outward</hi> things, by imprinting Notions in them, which Experience teaches us is the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Way of Knowing any thing; it follows of course, that they must recurr to <hi>Extraordinary</hi> ways by <hi>Inward</hi> means, or to <hi>Inward Light;</hi> which is the Method of Fanaticks in Religion, when they have rejected the <hi>Ordinary</hi> ways of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their Proper Teachers. And, hence, the <hi>Cartesians</hi> tell us, they know there is a <hi>God,</hi> by the Divine <hi>Idea</hi> of himself Which he has imprinted in them; which is in other Terms, to say, that they have it ky <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi> for Knowledge, according to them, being caus'd in them by those <hi>Ideas,</hi> nay, consisting formally in thoir having the <hi>Ideas</hi> of things in them; and <hi>GOD</hi> giving them those <hi>Ideas</hi> without the help of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Causes, it follows that <hi>GOD</hi> is the Immediate Cause of all our Knowledge; and, so, no thanks at all to the things in Nature, or to Natural Agents. These Ideas I can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve by <hi>Cartesius</hi>'s Discourse, are either of <hi>Propositions,</hi> or else <hi>Simple Ideas.</hi> Of the former they say, that whatever we clearly and distinctly <hi>conceive</hi> to <hi>be,</hi> is <hi>true.</hi> By which if they mean no more but that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we <hi>know</hi> to <hi>be,</hi> is; or that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:62043:27"/>
truly know that to <hi>be</hi> which <hi>is not,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more certain or more Evident by Common Sense; onely they run counter in their Discourse, and make not the <hi>Understanding</hi> to be True, because the Outward <hi>Thing</hi> is so, but they argue that the Thing is therefore <hi>thus</hi> or <hi>thus,</hi> because the <hi>Idea</hi> in the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such;</hi> and, so, they seem to make Truth consist, not in the Conformity of the <hi>Understanding</hi> to the <hi>Thing,</hi> but in the <hi>Thing's</hi> being Conformable to the <hi>Idea</hi> in my <hi>Understanding;</hi> as <hi>Cartesius</hi> himself affirms in his <hi>Answer to the Instances</hi> of <hi>Gassendus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How solidly he argues from <hi>Simple Ideas</hi> may be seen by his Demonstration of a Deity, which he concludes to <hi>be,</hi> because he has an <hi>Idea</hi> of a Being that has <hi>all</hi> Perfections in it, amongst which <hi>Existence</hi> is one; which <hi>Idea</hi> he contends he could never have had from the Things without us, and therefore it must have been imprinted by <hi>GOD</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Immediately. In making which proof passable, tho' <hi>Cartesius</hi> exerts the utmost of his Great Wit, yet this plain Discourse will manifest how untoward and Inconclusive it is. I can have a Notien or Idea of <hi>Finis,</hi> of <hi>non,</hi> and of <hi>Perfection,</hi> and <hi>Thing,</hi> and <hi>All,</hi> and lastly of <hi>Existence;</hi> and had I not such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct <hi>Ideas</hi> of all these, I could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb facs="tcp:62043:28"/>
the Meaning of those Words; for an <hi>Idea</hi> can be nothing but what's <hi>meant</hi> by those Words. Having distinct <hi>Ideas</hi> of all these, I can <hi>compound</hi> an <hi>Idea</hi> pf all these, or frame an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>a thing that has all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in it,</hi> and <hi>Existence</hi> among the rest: And this <hi>Idea</hi> is <hi>in</hi> my Mind, and the Effect purely <hi>of my Mind,</hi> already imbu'd with those Simple <hi>Ideas,</hi> and Compounding them; for I had it not from any one Thing <hi>directly,</hi> nor did I gather it by Discourse from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Things I was pre-acquainted with. But how comes it, or how can he argue that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have such an <hi>Idea</hi> fram'd by <hi>my Mind,</hi> it must exist <hi>without my Mind,</hi> or have a Reality <hi>there:</hi> unless my Mind could <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Create</hi> Beings at her pleasure, as oft as I have a desire to compound such <hi>Ideas</hi> together? He plays wittily upon the word <hi>[Existence.]</hi> But we may consider the Notion of <hi>Existence,</hi> or (which is all one) know the <hi>Meaning</hi> of that Word, and yet abstract whether it does <hi>actually</hi> put its <hi>Formal Effect,</hi> that is, whether that <hi>Existence</hi> is <hi>exercis'd</hi> or not <hi>exercis'd</hi> in the thing: which consideration alone spoils his whole Argument: Let us put a parallel. I have a complex <hi>Idea</hi> of these Words, <hi>My Debtor will pay me a Hundred Pounds to Morrow, at Ten a Clock, at his Goldsmiths;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62043:28"/>
that is, I have in my Mind the <hi>Meaning</hi> of <hi>all</hi> these Words; and <hi>Existence</hi> is necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly involv'd in the Meaning of <hi>those words,</hi> for they signifie Determinate Persons, Time, Place, and Action, all which involve <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence;</hi> will it therefore follow, that that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Paying me Money <hi>will be,</hi> because my <hi>Idea</hi> includes the <hi>Existence</hi> of that <hi>Action,</hi> so determinately circumstanc'd? Yet upon his Knowledge of a Deity by this Demonstration, depends, by his Discourse, all the Knowledge he has of any Truth, except perhaps of <hi>Ego Cogito.</hi> What need was there to run after Whimseys coyn'd in the Mint of our own Mind, to Demonstrate a <hi>Deity,</hi> when there are so many Clear Demonstrations of it from solid Grounds in Nature?</p>
            <p>It may seem harsh that I should resemble, tho' <hi>Cartesian</hi> Method to <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> or pretend they bring a kind of <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> into Philosophy. Let the so much applauded <hi>Malbranche</hi> be my Compurgator. That very Ingenious and Eloquent Person, who has a peculiar Talent of talking Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence as prettily and plausibly as any Man I ever read, in his Preface to the First Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of his <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> acquaints us with many Extraordinary things, which would no doubt (as <hi>Bayes</hi> says) very much
<pb facs="tcp:62043:29"/>
               <hi>Elevate</hi> and <hi>Surprize</hi> an ordinary Reader. In Common, he confounds all our <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Knowledges, which are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ordain'd to raise us towards Heaven, and advance <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Sanctity,</hi> with the <hi>Speculative</hi> Knowledges belonging to meer <hi>Philosophy;</hi> and most untowardly misapplies the sayings of the Scriptures and Fathers, which were never meant for his purpose, but in order to <hi>Devotion,</hi> or <hi>Mystical Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> (nay to the Beatifical State of <hi>GOD</hi>'s manifesting his Divine Essence to the Saints in Heaven) to the Maxims and Methods by which we are to attain <hi>Human Science.</hi> In particular, speaking his own sense, according to the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Doctrine; he tells us, <hi>we must judge of things by the pure Ideas of the Mind;</hi> whereas, I should rather have thought, that we ought to guide our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and judge of <hi>them,</hi> by the Conformity they have to the <hi>Things</hi> in <hi>Nature:</hi> since we are <hi>sure</hi> Creative Wisdom made <hi>them,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted Truth <hi>in them;</hi> whereas, 'tis <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi> whether <hi>GOD</hi> or our Whimsical Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies gave us our <hi>Ideas;</hi> and, 'tis certain they are the Off-spring of the later, if they be not conformable to the Things without us.</p>
            <p>He tells us farther that, <hi>All Sciences are learned by the Attention of the Mind,
<pb facs="tcp:62043:29"/>
which is nothing but its Return and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version towards God, who onely can teach us Truth by the Manifestation of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> I am heartily glad to know, that <hi>Euclid</hi> and <hi>Archimedes</hi> were <hi>converted</hi> to God, and that they were so infinitely Happy as to see <hi>God's Substance</hi> (which is his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence) so <hi>manifestly.</hi> He proceeds, <hi>Men must look</hi> within themselves, <hi>and draw near unto the</hi> Light <hi>that shines there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, that their Reason may be the more</hi> Illuminated. — <hi>The Mind ought to examin all Human Sciences by the</hi> Pure Light of Truth <hi>which guides it, without hearkening to the</hi> False, <hi>and confused Testimonies of the</hi> Senses. — <hi>Those that</hi> hear <hi>us do not</hi> learn <hi>the Truths we speak to their</hi> Ears, <hi>unless he that</hi> discover'd <hi>them to us,</hi> (he means <hi>GOD</hi> the Giver of <hi>Ideas) do</hi> reveal <hi>them at the same time</hi> to the Mind. So that all Science <hi>it</hi> seems, comes by <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> To what end then are Teachers, Professours, Schools and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, if, when we have done what we can by all our <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> must do the business, or gain us any Science. But now he advances to a higher point. <hi>The Mind</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62043:30"/>
(says he) is <hi>immediately, and after</hi> a very strict <hi>manner</hi> United to God; <hi>nay, after a stricter and more</hi> Essential <hi>manner than with the Body.</hi> Now, if this be true, I dare affirm that the Mind is <hi>more</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God <hi>Naturally,</hi> than our Saviour's Humanity was <hi>Supernaturally</hi> and <hi>Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously.</hi> For, This was but United <hi>Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically,</hi> or according to the <hi>Suppositum</hi> or <hi>Person</hi> of the Eternal Word; whereas, by this new Philosophy, every Human Mind is United <hi>Essentially</hi> to God, that is to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head it self. For, to be united <hi>Essentially</hi> is for one <hi>Essence</hi> to be united to another <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> that is, to be <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>same</hi> Essence with the <hi>Divine Essence.</hi> Was ever such <hi>Quakerism</hi> heard of among Philosophers! Or, plain honest Human Reason so subtiliz'd and exhal'd into Mystick Theology, by Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Alchymy!</p>
            <p>Yet, to say True, this is very Consonant to the Doctrine of <hi>Ideas.</hi> They slight the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Nature, they scorn to be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Senses, and Outwards Objects; which forces them upon <hi>Introversion,</hi> and to observe (as the same Authour says) what <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Truth tells us in the Recesses of our Reason;</hi> that is, in their Darling <hi>Ideas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62043:30"/>Now common Reason ever taught me, and every Man who did but reflect upon what passes within his Understanding, that the Proper and Effectual way to gain a Clear and Distinct Knowledge of our Simple Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is to make <hi>DEFINITIONS</hi> of them; and there are most Certain <hi>Rules of Art,</hi> how those Definitions may be fram'd. But, this was too Ordinary a way to please Minds so Extraordinarily Elevated as these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men pretend to be bless'd with. The highest Flights of Nature do flag, it seems, too low for their Supernatural pitch, nor can reach the Degrees of their Elevation above our dull Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon. They are <hi>Inspir'd</hi> with Heaven im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted <hi>Ideas;</hi> and, so, they have no more to do but retire their Thoughts into the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Recesses</hi> of their Mind, embellish'd and guilded with these Shining Innate <hi>Ideas,</hi> and their work is done without any need of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions</hi> made by sublunary Art. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I am apt to think, that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to those Spiritual Pourtraitures, out of despair of explicating any other way the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences</hi> of Things, or in what they consisted; and, I fear two of our Learned men lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, apprehend them to be Inscrutable and In-explicable. Whereas, speaking of Essences
<pb facs="tcp:62043:31"/>
in Common, I do assure them, that nothing can be <hi>plainer;</hi> and that every Clown were he interrogated orderly, could give us the true <hi>Essences,</hi> or (which is the same) the true <hi>Natures</hi> of the things he is conversant with. For, whatever makes Mankind <hi>call</hi> and <hi>esteem</hi> any Bodies, <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> Things in Distinction from <hi>all others,</hi> is truly their <hi>Essence;</hi> or, (to speak in the Language of a Philosopher) let but Matter be <hi>determin'd</hi> by such a Complexion of Accidents, with that Harmony or Proportion of parts, connected with that Constancy, that it is fit to act a Distinct part upon Nature's stage, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its Primary Operation; that Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Accidents, (I say) is truly the Essence of that Body, or the Form that constitutes it such an <hi>Ens,</hi> or such a Part of, or in, <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps the Cartesians will say, they allow Definitions to make their <hi>Ideas</hi> Clear and Distinct. But how can this cohere? <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are the Effects of <hi>Art,</hi> whereas these <hi>Ideas</hi> are imprinted by God's Hand who gave them their Nature, and <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Cartesius</hi> says ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, they are <hi>Ingenitae.</hi> This being so, and <hi>GOD</hi>'s immediate Works being <hi>Perfect,</hi> and those <hi>Ideas</hi> being intended to give them Knowledge, they can need nothing to make
<pb facs="tcp:62043:31"/>
them more Clear and Distinct; nor consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can the Users of them have any occasion for Definitions, unless perhaps to explain their <hi>Ideas</hi> to us; who think we have a firmer <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> to build them on, than those <hi>Ideas</hi> of theirs. <hi>Nature</hi> gives the <hi>Ground,</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> the <hi>Rules</hi> to make them: And they are such necessary Instruments to true and solid Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that I could wish for the Improvement of Knowledge, that our Universities would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Committee of Learned Men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile a <hi>Dictionary of Definitions</hi> for the Notions we use in all parts of Philosophy whatever. <hi>Monsieur de Furetiere</hi> has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to perform this for all words what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in Three Volumes; Out of which may be Collected those that make for our purpose; which being, by the Ioynt-labour and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Persons deputed, Examined; if faulty, Amended, and propos'd to the World; it could not fail of advancing Science highly. In carrying forward such a Noble Work, and so Beneficial to Mandkind, I should willingly contribute my <hi>Quota</hi> of Endeavours, nor think my pains better bestow'd in any thing I know of. For Definitions explicating or unfolding the <hi>Nature of the Thing,</hi> and all <hi>Proper Causes</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> being so near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:62043:32"/>
               <hi>ally'd</hi> to the Nature of the Thing, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that there lies involv'd in the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all Essential and Proper Middle Terms, to demonstrate whatever belongs to the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Defin'd, if Right Logick and studious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry be not wanting.</p>
            <p>He blames St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and <hi>wishes he had not attributed to External Bodies all the sensible Qualities we perceive by their means.</hi> And why? <hi>Because</hi> (says he) <hi>they are not clearly contain'd in the Idea he had of Matter.</hi> What <hi>Idea</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> had of Matter is little to purpose; but, if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded consequently to his Thoughts, he could not conceive the <hi>First Matter</hi> to be such as they put theirs to be. For, what Man of Common Sense can frame any <hi>Idea</hi> of a Thing that has onely <hi>Extension</hi> in it; but is not to any degree either <hi>Dense</hi> or <hi>Rare, Easie</hi> or <hi>Hard to be Divided, Fluid</hi> nor <hi>Solid, Soft</hi> nor <hi>Hard? &amp;c.</hi> And, if their Quaint <hi>Ideas</hi> and Clear and Distinct Conceptions, which seem to be the Ground of all their Witty Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or Divine Revelations (as <hi>Malbranche</hi> calls them) of Science, be no Wiser or Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than <hi>this,</hi> which is, or should be the chief Subject of their Physicks, I shall dare to affirm, that they are in plain Terms most
<pb facs="tcp:62043:32"/>
ridiculous and most unintelligible Fopperies; as I have shown at large in my <hi>Appendix.</hi> And, indeed, how should we make any Clear Idea of their Matter when themselves speak Contradictions concerning it; as may be seen hereafter, <hi>p. 417.</hi> where I shall hope I have demonstrated that their Forc'd Silence, Open Prevarications, and perfect Inconsistency in telling us the Intrinsecal Nature of that First Matter of theirs, has render'd them utterly Incapable of explicating any Body in Nature. Nor can we need any greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, that their Natural Philosophy is utterly Unprincipled and Unaccountable in the most Essential part of it, than to observe that neither <hi>Cartesius</hi> himself, nor <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Rohault, Regis, Le Grand,</hi> nor any of that School I have met with, have (as I <hi>must</hi> think) been <hi>Able</hi> to give us any Light of it; since they neither Attempt, nor Mention it; which shows they are at an utter Loss about the Primordial Constitution of their First Matter; of which, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they acknowledge all their <hi>Three Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and, consequently, all Nature was made.</p>
            <p>These few Particulars (omitting innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable others) I have thought fit to hint, to
<pb facs="tcp:62043:33"/>
show that the <hi>Method to Science,</hi> which the Great <hi>Cartesius</hi> follows is utterly Incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to attain it, and that the Scheme of his Doctrine is merely a piece of Wit. That which gives it most Credit is, that, his Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions granted, he proceeds consequently, in the subsequent parts of it, which are purely Mathematical. But, what signifies that, if he neither observes True <hi>Logick</hi> in laying his <hi>Principles;</hi> nor <hi>Nature</hi> in his <hi>Physicks,</hi> which he cannot pretend to do, unless he gives us a particular account of the Intrinsecal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of his First Matter, upon which all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. A Task, I say again, his Followers neither will ever attempt, nor can possibly perform by his Principles, as is shown at large in my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</p>
            <p>Yet it must be confess'd, that those kind of Discourses are very Plausible and Taking with the <hi>Middling</hi> sort of Readers; and with such who are much pleas'd with a Melodious Gingle of Words, prettily laid together with Neat Eloquence, Quaint Wit, and Unusual Remarks. For those kind of Embellishments do divert the Reader, make the Authours pass for Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and bear a fine Appearance of Truth; till they come to be scann'd Exactly, and grasp'd close by Severe Reason reducing them
<pb facs="tcp:62043:33"/>
to <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Connexion of Terms.</hi> Which done, it will be found that they afford to the Learner who sincerely seeks for Truth, nothing but certain <hi>Bright Flashes</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruscations;</hi> which do indeed for a time da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the Fancy, but they settle in the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no <hi>Constant Steady Light</hi> to direct them in their Way to true <hi>Science.</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I must declare, for the Honour of our English <hi>Genius,</hi> that, tho' we do not match the French in the Finery, Gayity, and Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their delivering their Conceptions (a Talent in which they are very Excellent) any more than we do in our Outward <hi>Garb,</hi> and <hi>Dress;</hi> yet, that there are more Solid Productions, well built Truths, and more Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and Ingenious Thoughts of his own in our Learned Countryman Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Treatise, Entituled, <hi>An Essay concerning Human Understanding,</hi> than (as far as I have observ'd) is found in great Multitudes of such slight Discoursers put together.</p>
            <p>We are come now to consider the Other pretended <hi>Method to Science,</hi> which is the Way of <hi>Experiments</hi> or <hi>Induction.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, (not to repeat what I have occasionally, by way of <hi>Reason,</hi> alledg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it in my following Book) I need say no
<pb facs="tcp:62043:34"/>
more, but that <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> shows evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that this Method, <hi>alone,</hi> and Unas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by <hi>Principles,</hi> is utterly Incompetent or Unable to beget <hi>Science.</hi> For, what one Universal Conclusion in Natural Philosophy, (in knowing which kind of Truths <hi>Science</hi> consists) has been Demonstrated by <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> since the the time that Great man, Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> writ his <hi>Natural Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>? The very Title of which laborious Work shows, that himself did not think <hi>Science</hi> was attainable by that Method. For, if we reflect well on what manner such pieces are writ, we shall find that it is, (as he calls it) meerly <hi>Historical,</hi> and Narrative of <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Observations; from which to deduce <hi>Universal</hi> Conclusions is against plain Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and Common Sense. To aim at <hi>Science</hi> by such a <hi>Method,</hi> may be resembled to the Study of finding out the Philosopher's Stone. The Chymist lights on many Useful and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising things by the way which feed him with <hi>false hopes,</hi> and decoy him <hi>farther;</hi> but he still falls short of his <hi>End.</hi> What man of any <hi>past,</hi> or of our <hi>present</hi> Curious Age, did ever so excell <hi>in those</hi> Industrious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Researches, as that Honour of our Nation, the Incomparable Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>? yet
<pb facs="tcp:62043:34"/>
after he had ransack'd all the hidden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of Nature, as far as that Way could carry him, he was still a <hi>Sceptick</hi> in his <hi>Principles</hi> of Natural Philosophy; nor could, with the utmost Inquisitiveness, practic'd by so great a Wit, arrive at any Certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whether there was a <hi>Vacuum</hi> or no: And certainly, we can expect no Science from such a Method that can give us no Certain Knowledge, whether in such a Space there be <hi>Something,</hi> or <hi>Nothing:</hi> which, of all others, should be the most easily <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishable</hi> and <hi>Knowable.</hi> Lastly, we may observe, that when an <hi>Experiment,</hi> or (which is the same) a <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> in Nature is discover'd, we are never the nearer knowing what is the <hi>Proper Cause</hi> of such an <hi>Effect,</hi> into which we may certainly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to leave other Men's Failings, and Return home to my Self. To obviate the <hi>Superficial</hi> ways of Reason, so magnify'd by other Speculaters, I have endeavour'd to take the quite <hi>Contrary Method;</hi> and have laid my Discourses as <hi>deep</hi> as I could <hi>possibly;</hi> and, perhaps, it will be thought I have <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done</hi> in those about <hi>Identical Propositions;</hi> for which yet I shall hope, the Reasons I have given there for that procedure, will bear me out and justifie me. For the same induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have very frequently drawn my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from <hi>Metaphysicks;</hi> being well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
<pb facs="tcp:62043:35"/>
that such <hi>Mediums</hi> do make the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, built on them, approach nearest to <hi>Self-evidence.</hi> Nor do I fear it should be objected, that, in a <hi>Logical</hi> Treatise, I bring such Instances and Corollaries as entrench upon, and make an In-road into divers <hi>other</hi> Sciences. Rather, I must profess that I held it a precise <hi>Duty</hi> in my Circumstances; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Logick,</hi> or the <hi>Art of Reasoning,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Common Instrument to attain <hi>all</hi> Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I was to show how it was, upon occasion, to be Apply'd to as many of them as I could; so I do not make unreasonable Excursions to hunt for them in Foreign Subjects, but that they light Naturally in my way. Lastly, I thought it became a Lover of Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among Christians to endeavour they should not wrangle about <hi>Equivocal Words,</hi> so their <hi>Meanings</hi> be justifiable.</p>
            <p>In a word, 'tis <hi>Connexion of Terms</hi> which I onely esteem as Proper to advance <hi>Science.</hi> Where I find not <hi>such Connexion,</hi> and the Discourse grounded on <hi>Self-evident Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> or (which is the same) on the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Verity of the Subject, which engages the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Thing, I neither expect <hi>Science</hi> can be gain'd, nor the <hi>Method to Science</hi> Establish'd. But, this done, I make

account both the one and the other may be hoped for. How well I have behav'd my self in attempting this, is left to the Iudgment of those who are the Proper Umpires in such Matters, I mean your selves.</p>

               <p n="2">2. We experience also, that those Impressions do not stay in the <hi>Outward</hi> Senses, but reach the <hi>Soul,</hi> and affect <hi>it.</hi>

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62043:38"/>3. Every thing being received according to the nature of the Subject that receives it, and the nature of the Soul being a Capacity of Knowledge; hence, those Impressions must so affect the Soul, as to cause some kind of Knowledge in her, how rude and Imperfect soever it may yet be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Impressions from Objects that affect the Senses, and by them the Soul, do carry the very <hi>Nature</hi> of those Objects along with them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print them in the Soul: which Prints, or, as it were, Stamps, as received in the Understanding, we call <hi>Notions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore <hi>Notions</hi> are the First and Rudest Draughts of Knowledge; being most <hi>Simple,</hi> and Naturally wrought in the Soul by the strokes of occurring Objects, without any Industry or Active Concurrence on our part.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That these <hi>Notions</hi> are the very <hi>Natures</hi> of the Thing, or the <hi>Thing</hi> it self existing in us <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectually,</hi> and not a bare <hi>Idea</hi> or Similitude of it, appears hence evidently, that when we say interiourly, or judge <hi>A Stone is hard,</hi> we do not intend to affirm, That the <hi>Likeness</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> of a Stone is <hi>hard,</hi> but the very <hi>Stone it self.</hi> And were it not so, the Proposition would be <hi>false</hi>; (for the Similitude of a Stone in our <hi>Mind</hi> is <hi>not</hi> Hard:) whereas yet we are well assur'd that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is <hi>True.</hi>

[There is in me the Idea or Likeness of a Stone.]</hi> Therefore there is <hi>in</hi> me something sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the word [<hi>Stone</hi>] not only distinct from <hi>Idea</hi> and <hi>Likeness,</hi> but moreover Relatively <hi>Opposite</hi> to it, as the thing Represented is to that which represents it; which can be nothing but <hi>the very Stone it self.</hi>

               <p>The word [<hi>Idea</hi>] is the least proper, because it seems to signifie a bare <hi>Similitude</hi>; unless the Users of it would express themselves to take it in that sence in which we take the word [<hi>Notion</hi>] here; or, as we use to understand it when we say, that the <hi>Idea's</hi> of all things were in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Intellect before they were created; that is, their very <hi>Essences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Notions</hi> are called <hi>Simple Apprehensions,</hi> not from the Fewness of the words that express them, nor from their not having any Grammatical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or <hi>Syntax</hi> in them: but, from the nature or manner of this Operation of our Understanding. For, since (as was said) they are called <hi>Simple Apprehensions,</hi> because by them we simply or bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend or lay hold of the Nature of the Thing intellectually; it matters not how <hi>many</hi> or how <hi>few</hi> the words are, so we do no more than meerly <hi>Apprehend</hi> or <hi>Take</hi> the Meaning of the Words, or the Notions, into our Minds, without <hi>Judging</hi> or <hi>Discoursing</hi> of them. Whence, we may have a <hi>simple Apprehension</hi> of a long Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, nay, of a whole Sermon or a great Book;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62043:39"/>
as long as we do not set our selves to <hi>Judge</hi> or <hi>Discourse</hi> of the Truth or Falshood of what's said or writ; but purely to <hi>Apprehend</hi> the Sence or Meaning of the Speaker or Writer.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Notions</hi> being the Natures of the Things in us, have neither Truth nor Falshood in them <hi>formally</hi>; since they do neither <hi>affirm</hi> or <hi>deny</hi> (only with Speeches are capable of <hi>Formal</hi> Verity or Falsity) any more than does the Thing it self as it stands in Nature, or out of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="13">13. All the Verity they have is their <hi>Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Verity, or their <hi>being truly what they are.</hi> And they partake this from the <hi>Idea's</hi> in the Divine Understanding, from which they unerringly flow, and which are essentially Unchangeable. By which we see how the God of Truth is the sole Author of all the Truth that is in us, and how he does (ordinarily) communicate it to us, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Fixing</hi> unalterably the Natures or <hi>Essences</hi> of Things; from which, being <hi>thus Establish'd</hi> and imprinted on our Minds by our Senses, all Science and Truth in us have their Certainty originally.</p>
               <p n="14">14. All true <hi>Science</hi> being thus built on the Immovable Stability of the Essences or Natures of Created Beings, it follows necessarily, that all Discourses that are not Agreeable to the Natures of Things, and <hi>Grounded</hi> on them, are Frothy, Incoherent, and False, and, if pursued home, must be found to have a Contradiction for their First Principle, in regard they make the Natures of Things <hi>to be what they are not.</hi>

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62043:40"/>15. Wherefore <hi>Notions</hi> being the Natures of the Things in our Understanding, the Method to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue True Science is, to attend and hold heedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and steadily to those <hi>Notions</hi> which the Things without us have imprinted or stamp'd in our Minds; and to be very careful lest Imaginations (which are the Offsprings of Fancy, and do oft misrepresent the Thing) do delude us, or the Equivocation of Words draw us aside, and make us deviate from those Genuine and Nature instill'd Notions.</p>

For they being caus'd by Natural Impressions on our Senses, those Men may as well pretend, that Water does not wet, or Fire burn, as that the Objects work not their several Effects upon our Senses. If they contend, that, every Man's individual Temper being different, our Notions must therefore differ <hi>to some Degree</hi> in every Man, they oppose not us, who say the same; nor will this break any square, in our Discoursing and our Understanding one another; for few Men (perhaps none) can reach these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Differences, nor consequently <hi>mean</hi> them or intend to speak of them when they discourse. But, if they say they are not the same in all Men (whose Senses o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. EVery individual Thing not only (as was said) <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Less.</hi> 1.2.</note> imprints a Notion of it self in our Minds, but <hi>many</hi> diverse Notions, according to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Impressions it makes upon the same or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Senses. This is manifest by Experience; for we find that an Orange (for example) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in us the several Notions of Yellow, Heavy, Round, Juicy, Hard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We can consider <hi>One</hi> of those Notions, without considering the <hi>Others.</hi> For we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that we can <hi>abstract</hi> the Notion of <hi>Round</hi> from the notion of <hi>Heavy,</hi> (or any of the rest) and Consider it <hi>apart,</hi> and Discourse of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>(3.) <hi>Note,</hi> That since the Object or Thing in our Understanding is capable of being consider'd diversly, hence [<hi>Notion</hi>] gets the name of [<hi>Considerability</hi>] and diverse <hi>Notions</hi> are said to be diverse <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities</hi> of the Thing; which yet is no more but <hi>the same Thing as diversly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:62043:42"/>3. Whether or no there be any Knower of a superiour Order, that can at one Intuitive View comprehend the whole thing, yet 'tis certain that our Soul, in this state, can have no Science of any thing, otherwise than by these <hi>Abstracted Notions.</hi> For since <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Less.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13, 14, 15.</note> our Notions are the <hi>Ground</hi> of all our Knowledge or Science, and (as will be seen shortly) we have <hi>no Notion</hi> of any Object, but by Impressions on the <hi>Senses,</hi> and those Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do <hi>differently</hi> affect us, and so breed <hi>Different</hi> or <hi>Abstracted Notions</hi>; 'tis manifest that we can no otherwise know any thing here, but by <hi>Different,</hi> that is, <hi>Abstracted,</hi> Partial or Inadequate <hi>Notions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis necessary to Science, that it be <hi>Distinct</hi> and <hi>Clear,</hi> and not <hi>Gross</hi> and <hi>Confus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d.</hi> This is evident from the very Terms; for <hi>Science</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a <hi>Distinct</hi> and <hi>Clear</hi> Knowledge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our Soul cannot in this state wield <hi>more</hi> Notions <hi>at once,</hi> nor <hi>consider</hi> them, or <hi>Discourse clearly</hi> of them <hi>together</hi>; or rather, indeed, <hi>not at all.</hi> This will appear evidently, by an easie reflexion on our Interiour: For, we shall find, that we can Discourse of each <hi>single</hi> abstracted No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in an Orange <hi>viz.</hi> on its Bigness, Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Colour, Tast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if we would go about to Consider or Discourse of us Roundness and Tast both together, (and the same may be said of any <hi>other</hi> two that are Disparate, or not included one in the other) we shall find our selves at a loss, and in Confusion, not knowing how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, nor how to proceed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We cannot in this state know, even singly, <hi>every</hi> particular Considerability found in the thing: For, tho' (for example) we can by our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62043:43"/>
Common Sight discern the Colour or Figure of a thing, or of its Grosser parts, yet a Microscope will discover to us innumerable Particularities which escap'd our Common View; and had we a Glass that magnified more, there would be found still more and more Particularities than did appear when we observ'd it formerly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, since every New Observation we can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly make begets a New Notion in us, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 1 <hi>S.</hi> 13, 14, 15.</note> and all our Knowledge is grounded on our Notions, we can no more know the last Considerability, which is in the thing, than we can know the least Part that is to be found in Quantity, or in the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Figure, Colour, and other Respects which each of those very least parts may have; and therefore they are not <hi>All</hi> knowable by us in this state.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Much less can we, in this state, know <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,</hi> or discourse <hi>scientifically</hi> of any <hi>Whole</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual thing, or (as the Schools call it) the <hi>Suppositum,</hi> taken <hi>in bulk.</hi> For, * since all the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derabilities that integrate it, and consequently the Notions it begets in us, are blended confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly in the entire Notion of the <hi>Suppositum</hi> or Thing. Again, since these are <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</note> innumerable, and many of them Unknowable by us; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>no one</hi> of them (that is, <hi>Nothing</hi> in that whole <hi>Suppositum</hi>) can be <hi>distinctly</hi> or <hi>clearly</hi> known, while we discourse of that which has them all <hi>in bulk</hi>; that is, while we discourse of them <hi>all at once</hi>; and consequently, the Notion of the <hi>Suppositum,</hi> which contains them all, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>clearly</hi> or <hi>perfectly</hi> known by us, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of <hi>scientifically.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62043:43"/>8. Wherefore we cannot know in this state any <hi>One entire</hi> Thing perfectly, since we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have any perfect Science of it, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>S.</hi> 7.</note> either taking it <hi>in bulk,</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>S.</hi> 6.</note> or by <hi>Detail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Wherefore all we can do in this state, is to glean from the Objects by our Senses so many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them as may suffice to distinguish them from one another; and may serve for our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Use, Needful Speculation; or, lastly, for our Contemplation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Notwithstanding this, the Science attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this State may arrive to be in a manner <hi>Infinit.</hi> For, since our Notions <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>S.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</note> are the very <hi>Natures</hi> of the Things, and the <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>S.</hi> 13, 14.</note> Natures of the Things are the Seeds of all Science, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Truths spring from them, and other Truths do still follow by Connexion with the former; and, <note n="‖" place="margin">See <hi>B.</hi> 3. <hi>L.</hi> 4. <hi>S.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</note> since no stint is assignable of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of Truths, or of our Deduction of one Truth from another; it follows that there is no Bound or Limit of our Science attainable here, but that (if Art and Industry be used) it may be in a manner <hi>Infinit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. 'Tis a most Fundamental Errour to fancy that there are many kinds of <hi>little Things</hi> in the Object, corresponding to all the different Notions or Considerations which we make of it. For, since the least Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ticle that is in it does ground diverse Notions of it, and every various Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of each Particle, either according to what is Intrinsecal or Extrinsecal to it, does still beget <hi>more:</hi> Again, since no Particle can be so small, but we can <hi>conceive</hi> or have distinct Notions of Two Halves, and many other proportionate Parts
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62043:44"/>
in it, and the Particles that are or may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to be in Quantitative Things are Numberless; it follows, that, were all the Distinct Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities in the Object distinct <hi>Things,</hi> we could never pitch upon any of those Things (they still including others in them) which we could say is <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Vndivided in its self</hi>; nor consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could we know what <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> meant in Corporeal or Quantitative Things, with which we converse; which would Fundamentally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy and pervert all Human Speech and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about <hi>any Thing,</hi> and make all Science im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
               <p n="12">12. From what's said 'tis deduced, that it is one necessary and main Part of the <hi>Method to Science,</hi> to <hi>distinguish</hi> our Notions <hi>Clearly,</hi> and to <hi>keep</hi> them distinct <hi>Carefully.</hi> For, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>S.</hi> 13, 14.</note> since all Science is grounded on our <hi>Notions,</hi> and Science must be <hi>Clear,</hi> and this cannot be <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>S.</hi> 5.</note> if any <hi>Two</hi> of them be confounded, or taken together <hi>at once</hi>; it is manifest, that 'tis one necessary and main part of the <hi>Method to Science,</hi> to <hi>distinguish</hi> our Notions <hi>Clearly,</hi> and to <hi>keep</hi> them distinct <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. The best way to do this, is to rank all our Notions under distinct <hi>common Heads.</hi> For, this done, it will be easie to know, to which of those common Heads they belong; and those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Heads being easily distinguish't from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, because they differ <hi>most vastly,</hi> or (as the Schools phrase it) <hi>toto genere,</hi> it will follow that the several Notions <hi>comprized</hi> under each of those Heads, must likewise, to a fair degree, be clearly known to be <hi>Distinct</hi> also.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62043:44"/>14. There is but one onely Notion that is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Absolute, viz.</hi> that of <hi>Existence,</hi> and all the rest are in some manner or other, <hi>Respective</hi>: For, since all Notions that are, must be either of the <hi>Thing it self,</hi> or of what <hi>relates</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it, and the Thing it self <hi>relates</hi> to <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,</hi> of which (since only a <hi>Thing</hi> can <hi>be</hi>) it is a <hi>Capacity</hi>; and <hi>Existence,</hi> as being the last Actuality conceivable in the Line of Being, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> to no <hi>other</hi> or <hi>farther</hi> Notion; it follows that only the Notion of <hi>Existence</hi> is <hi>perfectly Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,</hi> and all the rest are some way or other <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Whence it follows, that the Notion of <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence</hi> is imprinted in the Soul before any other in priority of Nature. For, since <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 14</note> all other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are <hi>Respective,</hi> and so consist in some (at least confused or rude) Comparisons, as it were, of that Notion to what it respects; to have which is much <hi>harder</hi> than to have that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>Absolute,</hi> more Simple and not Comparative at all; hence the Notion of <hi>Existence</hi> is the most Easie, and therefore the first in priority of nature. Again, since (as <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Less.</hi> 8. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.</note> will be shewn hereafter) the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all <hi>Operation</hi> is nothing but the <hi>Existence</hi> of the Object imprinted on the Patient, and the Soul must have a Notion of the <hi>Operation</hi> made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, that is, a Notion of the <hi>Existence</hi> of the thing imprinting it; it follows necessarily, that the Notion of the <hi>Existence</hi> of that thing is first in her.</p>
               <p n="16">16. From this last Reason it is evinced, that the Notion of the Man's own Existence is wrought in the Soul before the Notion of things <hi>without
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62043:45"/>
him,</hi> and this by the Man himself as his own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and is not imprinted by Outward ones. For <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Less.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1, 3, 5.</note> since the Soul has Notions of Objects, not by Emission of its Virtue to them, but by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Receiv'd in it, and Existing in it Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; nor could it have a Notion of them, that is, they could not <hi>exist in</hi> the Soul, without its having a Notion first (in priority of Nature) of <hi>its own</hi> or the <hi>Man</hi>'s Existence; it follows, that the Notion of the Man's Existence comes into the Soul before the Notion of other things, and consequently that it is imprinted by the Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as his own Object, and is not caused by Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ones. Again, since the Existence of the Man is Naturally <hi>in him,</hi> and consequently in the <hi>Soul,</hi> (when she has a Notion of him) after its manner, that is, intellectually; it follows, that it has (as it were) <hi>Naturally</hi> a Notion of the Man's Existence, and consequently, <hi>before</hi> it has the Notion of any other thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. To explicate <hi>how</hi> this is done, and why it <hi>must</hi> be so, Anatomists tell us, that the <hi>Embryo</hi> lies in a manner <hi>round</hi> in the Womb; whence some parts of it do continually and necessarily touch some others. Wherefore as soon as the Soul is infus'd, and it is now from a meer Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal become a <hi>Man,</hi> and has got an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Power capable to receive <hi>Notions</hi> of Objects; those Touches or Impressions of some parts of himself upon others, do naturally affect the Sense, and by it the Soul, and beget a blind Notion there of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62043:45"/>
the <hi>Man</hi>; and by a natural kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness or Experience, that he <hi>Operates</hi> thus upon himself, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 8. <hi>S.</hi> 7</note> of his own <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> Hence follows, against the <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> that there is no kind of Necessity of <hi>Innate Idea's:</hi> For, having once got, by this means, the Notion of <hi>Existence,</hi> and all other Notions being <hi>Respective</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative</hi> to it; and the Soul being of its own nature a Comparative Power, since (as will be seen hereafter) both our Acts of Judging and of Discoursing are Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Acts; hence the Soul becomes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Means to have all other Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notions whatever, by what it has from the Object, and by it self. But of this Point more towards the end of this Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Only it is to be remark'd, that it is not here intended that the Soul has only the Notion of Existence alone, and <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> others; for at the same time it has the Notion of the <hi>Man existing,</hi> and exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>thus</hi> by his <hi>operating thus.</hi> We only discourse which of those Notions is first in priority of Nature, that is, of its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture most Knowable or Perceptible.</p>
               <p n="17">17. All other Notions of the Thing besides Existence, being <hi>Respective,</hi> are either of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>Intrinsecally</hi> belonging to it, or else of something <hi>Extrinsecally</hi> refer'd to it by our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. This is evident; for we can have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62043:46"/>
no Notion of <hi>Non-Ens,</hi> or <hi>Nothing,</hi> nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of what belongs to it.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> Notions are but Four. For, since Existence is the only <hi>Absolute</hi> Notion, and can be refer'd to no other, all other Notions must either Immediately or Mediately refer to <hi>it</hi>; Wherefore all Intrinsecal Notions must either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Thing it self immediately to its Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, by considering the <hi>Ens</hi> to be of such an <hi>Essence,</hi> as it is capable to recieve it; and then <hi>Essence</hi> being the Immediate Power to <hi>Existence,</hi> they are Essential Notions, and belong to that Common Head we call <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Substance.</hi> Or else they refer the Thing to some <hi>Common</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or Modification (that is, Consideration) of it, in which <hi>all</hi> things we converse with do agree; that is, to its Bigness or <hi>Quantity.</hi> Or else they refer the thing to some Modification or Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration belonging to its own <hi>peculiar Nature,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting how it is <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> dispos'd in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; which Common Head is called <hi>Quality.</hi> Or, lastly, they refer some one <hi>Individuum,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to something Intrinsecal to it, to another <hi>Individuum</hi>; which constitutes the Common Head of <hi>Relation.</hi> And more Common Heads of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal Respects cannot be invented; therefore there are only Four Common Heads of <hi>Intrinsecal Notions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. Those Notions that refer not something that is Intrinsecal to the thing, but what's <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal</hi> to it, are conceiv'd to apply that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal to it either by way of <hi>Motion,</hi> or <hi>in Rest.</hi> If by way of <hi>Motion,</hi> then, since Motion has two terms, it may be consider'd either as coming from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62043:46"/>
the <hi>Mover,</hi> and 'tis the Notion of <hi>Action</hi>; or as affecting the thing <hi>Moved,</hi> and then 'tis called <hi>Passion.</hi> And, because the most Regular and most Equable, Motion, to our apprehension is that of the Sun, call'd <hi>Time,</hi> and therefore all Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Motions must bear a proportion to it, and be measur'd by it, being perform'd while such a proportionable part of it was Flowing; and Mankind is forced to need and make use of such a <hi>Measure</hi> to Adjust, Proportion, and Design all their Motions or Actions by, and to know the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate distance of them from known and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Periods; hence there must be a Common Head of the time <hi>When</hi> those Motions were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, which we call <hi>Quando.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Extrinsecal application be conceiv'd to be made to the Subject or thing <hi>in Rest,</hi> then, either that Extrinsecal thing is conceiv'd to be barely apply'd to the <hi>whole,</hi> that is, to be <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> to it, or meerly to <hi>Contain</hi> it, which grounds the Notion, and answers to the Question <hi>Where,</hi> or <hi>Ubi</hi>: Or, it denotes some certain determinate Manners <hi>how</hi> it is apply'd to the whole or to some parts of it; and then either the whole, or at least some Parts of the Subject or thing, must be conceiv'd to be ply'd and accommodated to the parts of the Extrinsecal thing, and 'tis call'd its Site or <hi>Situation</hi>; or else the Extrinsecal thing, or its parts, are conceiv'd to be Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Ply'd, or Accommodated to the Subject or Thing, and then 'tis call'd <hi>Habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62043:47"/>20. These ten Common Heads are call'd <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,</hi> that is, Common Receptacles, which <hi>Contain,</hi> and whence we may draw, all our <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates</hi> for the Common Subject, <hi>Thing:</hi> which we may briefly exemplifie thus: Peter<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, <hi>tho' but a yard2</hi> 
                  <hi>and half high, yet a Ualiant3</hi> 
                  <hi>Subject4</hi>, <hi>fought5</hi> 
                  <hi>and was wounded6</hi>

                  <hi>the Field, standing9</hi> 
                  <hi>upon his guard, armed10</hi>.</p>
               <p n="21">21. All these Notions, under whatever Head, if they be Corporeal ones, are <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to all Mankind. For, since they are made by Impressions on the Senses, which are Common to all Mankind, it follows, that the Notions which are the Effects of those Impressions, must be such also; since the same Causes upon the same-natur'd Subjects, must work the same Effects.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Our Soul has in it a Power of <hi>Compounding</hi> those several Notions together, of <hi>Considering</hi> them diverse ways, of <hi>Reflecting</hi> on its own Thoughts and Affections; and, lastly, of joyning a <hi>Negative</hi> to its Natural Notions if there be occasion; such as are the Notions of Indivisible, Immaterial, Incorruptible, Unactive, Insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which particularly happens when we would strive to frame Notions of spiritual Things.

or Affections; or else by joyning a <hi>Negative</hi> to our <hi>Positive</hi> natural Notions. And <hi>Mix'd</hi> or <hi>Compound</hi> Notions are framed by joyning our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer simple Notions. Wherefore, since there can be nothing imagin'd which is not either Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, Spiritual, or Mix'd, or Compounded of Former Notions, 'tis manifest, that all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have or can have, do arise from one of those Heads.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Wherefore 'tis hence farther shewn, that there is no necessity at all of making some Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be <hi>Innate</hi>; and consequently that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the <hi>Cartesians</hi> is Groundless, who affirm, That by a <hi>Motion</hi> made on the Senses, the Soul, by an unknown Vertue peculiar to its self, Excites or awakens such and such an Innate <hi>Idea,</hi> which till then lay dormant in it, because they find that that Notion is nothing like to the <hi>Idea</hi> it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites: For, first, how do they prove that only Motion is communicated to the Brain from the Object, or, that that Motion does not carry along with it different-natur'd Particles or <hi>Effluviums</hi> of these several Bodies, which are (as it were) little Models of their Nature? It is certain this passes thus in the grosser Senses, and no more is requisite to do it in the subtiler, but that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles emitted be more subtil; which cannot shock the Fancy or Reason of a Natural Philosopher, who knows well into what almost-infinite smallness <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> is Divisible: And, of all Men in the World, the <hi>Cartesians</hi> should not be startled at it: whose Principles do allow lesser Particles than those <hi>Effluviums,</hi> and to pass thro' far lesser Pores than those within the <hi>Nerves,</hi> or even than such as are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62043:48"/>
in the substance of the <hi>Nerves</hi> themselves. Now, this being granted, the whole contexture of this Doctrine of ours has a clear Coherence. For, such Particles bearing the nature of the thing along with them, are apt, when they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Seat of Knowledge, to breed in the Mind, or convey into it the <hi>Nature,</hi> (or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual <hi>Notion</hi>) of the Thing it self. To do which, there can need no more, than that <hi>every thing</hi> (according to the Maxim) <hi>be receiv'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature or Manner of the Receiver; viz.</hi> that those <hi>Effluviums,</hi> by affecting the Body <hi>Corporeally,</hi> do affect the Soul <hi>Intellectually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, How is it conceivable, or any way Explicable, that a Motion, which they confess is utterly Unlike the <hi>Idea</hi> in the Mind, should be the Proper Exciter of such an <hi>Idea?</hi> Indeed, were those Motions of the Nature of our <hi>Signs,</hi> that are voluntarily agreed on and fore-known to the Users of them, they might have a Power to make such a peculiar Excitation of those <hi>Ideas,</hi> as our Words do now; or as any odd and disagreeing Things are made use of by us when we practise the Art of Memory. But here things are quite otherwise; for we have no Fore-knowledge either by Agreement, nor by our volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Designation, that such Motions shall excite such <hi>Idea's</hi> or <hi>Notions</hi>; nor, as is confess'd, are they Naturally alike; wherefore it is altogether inexplicable how they should ever come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite such particular <hi>Idea's.</hi> Add, That this hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Virtue in the Soul, to make such a particular <hi>Idea</hi> start up as soon as that Motion is made in the Nerve, is both said <hi>gratis,</hi> and is as Obscure
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62043:48"/>
as an Occult Quality; and so far from Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that even themselves (as far as I can learn) have not so much as <hi>attempted</hi> to explain it: but it seems to be in part taken up <hi>gratis,</hi> to make good their Doctrine of innate <hi>Idea's,</hi> as the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of such <hi>Idea's</hi> is to prove the Soul is a distinct Thing from the Body.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Their Argument drawn from Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the <hi>Idea</hi> in the Mind is quite different from that Impression in the Senses or any Bodily Faculty, is shewn to be Inconclusive, by alledging, (as was said lately) that the Nature of the Object found in those emitted Particles, and the Nature of it found in the Soul Intellectually (or as stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Notion) are the <hi>self-same,</hi> and not so <hi>Vnlike</hi> as they imagin. Add, That their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment faulters in this too, that the makers of it did not duly reflect, when they advanced it, on that 'foresaid Axiom, <hi>Quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis:</hi> For, had they done this, they could not have wonder'd that an Affection of the Body (which is imprinted <hi>directly</hi>) and an Affection of the Soul which is spiritual (and known only by Reflexion) should have a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Appearance: The two Manners of Existing, with which the same Nature is vested, differing <hi>toto genere,</hi> that is as far as <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> (their subjects) can distance them.</p>
               <p>To explicate this more fully, and to shew the difference between Corporeal and Spiritual <hi>Idea's,</hi> I offer to their thoughts this Reflexion concerning the distinct nature of a <hi>Phantasm,</hi> which is a <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Resemblance,</hi> and the nature of the thing in the <hi>Mind</hi> (that is its <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Differences</hi> that divide each Common Head must be <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> to it. For, since <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Less.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</note> we cannot discourse of two <hi>Disparate</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at once; and since were those Heads divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Differences that are <hi>Extrinsecal</hi> to the Common <hi>Genus,</hi> (or taken from <hi>another</hi> Head) each <hi>Species</hi> of it would consist of two <hi>Disparate</hi> Notions; hence it is absolutely necessary to Science that the Differences which divide these Common Heads be such as belong to <hi>no other</hi> Common Head, but be <hi>within</hi> the Limits of that Head, or <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> to <hi>it.</hi> Again, since the <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> is most <hi>Formal</hi> in constituting the <hi>Species,</hi> and the <hi>Genus</hi> only <hi>Material</hi>; were the Differences <hi>Extrinsecal</hi> or Borrow'd from <hi>another</hi> Head, it would follow, that all the <hi>Species</hi> of the Head divided by such Differences would belong to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Head, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>that</hi> Head whence those Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences are taken: Which would put all our Notions into Confusion, and involve a direct Contradiction, as making <hi>Substances</hi> to be <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, Qualities,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> Differences can be no other but <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> of the Common Notion: For since, being <hi>Intrinsecal,</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>S.</hi> 1.</note> they cannot be taken from any <hi>other</hi> Head, it follows, that they must partake of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62043:50"/>
the <hi>Common</hi> Notion of <hi>their own</hi> respective Heads. Again, since, if they did partake of the Common <hi>Notion</hi> Equally, they would not <hi>differ</hi> in that Notion, and so would not be <hi>Differences</hi> of it; it follows, that they must partake of it <hi>Vnequally</hi>; that is, they must be <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> of the Common Notion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence the Common Notion of <hi>Ens,</hi> Thing or <hi>Substence</hi> being that which is <hi>capable of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,</hi> is Immediately, <hi>Intrinsecally,</hi> or <hi>Essentially</hi> divided into what's <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> capable of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence. Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Divisible</hi> and <hi>Indivisible,</hi> which constitute <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> are the proper and <hi>intrinsecal</hi> Differences of the Common Head of <hi>Substance</hi>: For, since Actual Division of the Entity makes the thing to be no longer <hi>indivisum in se</hi>; that is, to be <hi>unum</hi>; that is, to be <hi>Ens</hi>; that is, to be <hi>capable of Existence</hi>; it follows, that that <hi>Ens</hi> which is <hi>Divisible</hi> (or <hi>Body</hi>) is <hi>less</hi> capable of Existence, that is, has <hi>less</hi> of the nature of <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Substance</hi>; and the <hi>Ens</hi> that is <hi>Indivisible</hi> (or <hi>Spirit</hi>) has <hi>more.</hi> Again, since Things Divisible, or <hi>Bodies,</hi> can only have their <hi>own</hi> Being or Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, whereas Things <hi>indivisible,</hi> or <hi>Spirits,</hi> are capable of being <hi>Other</hi> things also, or of having in them the Natures and Existences of all the things they <hi>know</hi>; hence they have a <hi>greater</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Existence than Bodies have; since they have enough for themselves, and can impart it to Millions of Other things besides; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are constituted by <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> and <hi>Indivisible,</hi> as by the proper, immediate, and <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> Differences that divide <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Ens.</hi>

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62043:50"/>5. The <hi>Divisibility</hi> and <hi>Indivisibility</hi> that are the <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> Differences of <hi>Ens,</hi> are not those of being <hi>Quantitative</hi> and <hi>not Quantitative.</hi> For, were it so, it would follow, that some <hi>Intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Differences of <hi>Ens</hi> in Common would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from some <hi>other</hi> Head, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Quantity,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>S.</hi> 1.</note> so, the Differences being what's most For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal in the <hi>Species,</hi> hence those <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Ens</hi> would rather be under <hi>that</hi> Head than <hi>its own.</hi> Again, that <hi>Divisibility,</hi> which is of <hi>Quantity,</hi> may oftentimes be put into Act, and yet the <hi>same Ens</hi> remain; <hi>v. g.</hi> a Man may lose the Quantity of an Arm; a Tree, of a Branch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet remain still the same <hi>Things</hi>; whereas, if <hi>Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Divisibility</hi> were the Intrinsecal Difference which constituted it <hi>such an Ens, Quantitative Division</hi> must by consequence make it cease to be <hi>that Ens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, since Quantity (as will be <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Less.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2, 4.</note> short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seen) is <hi>Divisibility,</hi> and Divisibility in <hi>Vnity,</hi> in case Quantity did <hi>Intrinsecally</hi> divide <hi>Ens,</hi> and constitute <hi>Body,</hi> where-ever there were <hi>Quantity</hi> there would be <hi>Vnity</hi> under that notion; and so <hi>all</hi> Quantitative things would be but <hi>one Ens</hi> or <hi>one</hi> Body; which is the highest absurdity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Divisibility and Indivisibility which are the <hi>intrinsecal</hi> Differences of <hi>Ens,</hi> are not those of being <hi>Quantitative</hi> and not <hi>Quantitative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Therefore the <hi>Divisibility</hi> and <hi>Indivisibility</hi> which divide <hi>Ens</hi> Intrinsecally, must be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibility and Indivisibility of the Constituents of <hi>Ens,</hi> as such; that is, the Divisibility of it into <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> and Indivisibility of it into <hi>such</hi> Constituent parts: Which differences do
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62043:51"/>
Essentially divide the <hi>Genus</hi> of <hi>Ens,</hi> and constitute the <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> For, since we see Bodies <hi>chang'd</hi> into one another, and therefore, the former Body had really somewhat in it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining it to be actually <hi>what it was,</hi> which we call the <hi>Form</hi>; and somewhat by which it <hi>could be Another,</hi> which we call the <hi>Power</hi> to be another, or <hi>Matter:</hi> Again, since we see that the Form, which made the <hi>former</hi> Thing be what it was, is <hi>gone</hi> when 'tis made <hi>Another</hi> Thing, and a <hi>New</hi> Form succeeds into the same Matter; hence we can frame diverse Conceptions of <hi>Body,</hi> which belong to it as such an <hi>Ens, viz. Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi>; and have a Ground in Nature to say there is a <hi>Real</hi> divisibility between them. Wherefore since that <hi>Ens</hi> call'd <hi>Body,</hi> by being divisible into <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> becomes liable to have the <hi>Form,</hi> that constituted it such an <hi>Ens,</hi> separated from the <hi>Matter,</hi> and so to lose its being the <hi>same Ens</hi> it was, and incapable of existing any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and, for the same reason, a <hi>Spirit,</hi> by its <hi>not</hi> being divisible into Matter and Form, has <hi>not</hi> in its Essence any Principle giving it a Capacity <hi>not to Exist,</hi> as had the other; but <hi>has</hi> in its self, or rather <hi>is</hi> of its self a more simple and more perfect kind of <hi>Vnity,</hi> and consequently a more Noble kind of <hi>Entity</hi> or Capacity of exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than is the other; Therefore the <hi>Divisibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Indivisibility</hi> which divide <hi>Ens</hi> Intrinsecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, must be the Divisibility and Indivisibility of it into <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi>; which we call <hi>Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Divisibility,</hi> because it is the divisibility of the parts of <hi>Ens</hi> as such; that is, of <hi>Ens</hi> under the Notion of <hi>Ens.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. For the same reason <hi>Mixt Body</hi> is divided into <hi>Living</hi> Bodies, and not <hi>Living</hi> by Intrinsecal Differences; because Those are <hi>more</hi> mixt, These <hi>less.</hi>

Imaginary Space,</hi> by which they distinguish it from <hi>Real Space,</hi> confesses it not to be <hi>in re,</hi> but only in <hi>our Imagination:</hi> Which words can have no sence, unless they mean, that the Imagination is the <hi>Only Subject</hi> in which it subsists. Wherefore, to speak consequently, they ought to say, that our Imagination, in which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it has any Being, is some infinitely-extended Thing <hi>beyond the World</hi>; for <hi>there</hi> they put this Imaginary Space to <hi>bee</hi>; but this is so notorious a Banger, that they dare not say this neither; and, therefore, they can make no piece of their Tenet cohere, nor make any Sence of their own Words. But let them wriggle what way they will, their putting it to be <hi>without the World,</hi> and yet not to exist <hi>in re,</hi> but <hi>in our Imagination</hi> only, which is <hi>within the World,</hi> is so full fraught with variety of Contradictions, that they cannot even name it or talk of it, without speaking palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nonsence at every step of their Discourse. Moreover, they deny it to be a <hi>Thing,</hi> and yet they attribute to it the Properties of a <hi>Real Thing,</hi> by making it have <hi>assignable Parts</hi> in it; as also to be Extended, Measurable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est strain of Contradiction imaginable.

whatever is affirm'd of an <hi>Ens</hi> must necessarily be deny'd of <hi>Non-Ens</hi>; so that, if a <hi>Thing</hi> (a Body for example) can be extended, measur'd, pass'd through, or mov'd in; it must necessarily be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that a <hi>Non-Ens</hi> cannot be mov'd in, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, measur'd, or have Parts. Lastly, <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Space</hi> or <hi>Vacuum</hi> never affected our Senses; and therefore, since we can have no distinct No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it from outward Objects, neither can it, consequently, belong to any of those Common Heads of Notions; whence follows that one of these Heads, which gives Being to all the other, being <hi>Ens, Imaginary Space</hi> and <hi>Vacuum</hi> are meer <hi>Nothings.</hi>

The Essential Notion of Quantity is <hi>Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> into Parts; and, <hi>such</hi> a Divisibility as that each of its Parts, after Division, becomes a <hi>Whole.</hi> For, since the Essential Notion of it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in its having Matter and Form, which make it an <hi>Ens,</hi> and so fit it for Existence (as it was in a Divisible <hi>Substance</hi> or <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Body</hi>) the <hi>Essence</hi> of it (such as it is) must be taken from some Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration belonging to its <hi>own</hi> single Abstracted No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from that in the first place that best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses its Metaphysical <hi>Vnity.</hi> And, since nothing can be said to be <hi>Divisible,</hi> or capable to be made <hi>more,</hi> but it must be said <hi>eo ipso</hi> to be Actually and truly <hi>One</hi>; therefore <hi>Divisibility,</hi> or a Capacity to be made <hi>more,</hi> is the very Notion of its <hi>Vnity,</hi> only connotating that 'tis <hi>such</hi> an Unity as makes its subject Capable to be made <hi>more,</hi> or dissolved by <hi>Division</hi> into Parts.

and will more evidently be shown hereafter, that is the true Notion of any Nature to which the Sayings of Mankind do agree: But <hi>Divisibility</hi> is thus shown to be the Notion of <hi>Quantity.</hi> For example, ask what a Mile is, it will be answer'd, That it has so many Furlongs, Paces, or Yards in it. Ask what a Yard is, it will be answer'd, It consists of so many Feet; and so of the rest. And when we come to so small a Quantity, that we can no more give an account of it, or assign the <hi>parts</hi> into which it is divisible, we find our selves at a plunge, and know not how to define it, but seem to have lost the Notion of it. Therefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Extension, Measurability, and such others, may truly belong to Quantity as its <hi>Properties,</hi> yet only <hi>Divisibility</hi> is its Primary and Essential Notion, because 'tis this only denotes its <hi>Vnity.</hi> And, since it is not a Divisibility into such parts as could not remain <hi>Wholes</hi> after their separation, such as were <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> which are the Essential parts of <hi>Substance</hi>; hence the <hi>Divisibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> which Quantity gives to its Subject must be <hi>such</hi> as makes it remain <hi>so many Wholes</hi> after the Division is made; as Experience also shews us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Quantity is adequately divided into <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd,</hi> or Coherent; and <hi>Discrete,</hi> or <hi>Number.</hi> For, since 'tis impossible to ask any Question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Quantity of Things, but either <hi>how Many</hi> they are, if <hi>more</hi> Things; or, <hi>how great</hi> it is, (that is <hi>how much</hi> there is of it) if it be but <hi>One</hi> thing; 'tis evident that Mankind has no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other kind of Quantity but of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete</hi> and <hi>Continu'd</hi>; and, therefore, the Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62043:63"/>
of Quantity into these two <hi>Species</hi> is <hi>Adequate.</hi> Note, that <hi>Discrete</hi> Quantity is <hi>less</hi> Quantity than <hi>Continu'd,</hi> because 'tis <hi>less Divisible</hi>; or rather 'tis not so properly Quantity as is the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it has no <hi>Vnity</hi> to distinguish it from a mere Confused <hi>Multitude</hi> of Ones but by means of the Understanding, conceiving it to be so many U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nits terminated by the <hi>last</hi>; yet, because <hi>Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Paucity</hi> are <hi>More</hi> and <hi>Less</hi> of any one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Number, and that there is a Ground in Nature for our Understanding to consider <hi>many</hi> Scatter'd <hi>Ones</hi> and comprehend or bind them together into one Notion, and that such Notions are useful or necessary to Mankind; therefore this Order'd Multitude of <hi>discrete</hi> or <hi>shatter'd</hi> Ones, call'd <hi>Number,</hi> is rightly placed in the Predicament of Quantity. For, tis to be noted, that when 'tis said Quantity is <hi>Divisibilis in semper Divisibilia,</hi> it was not meant of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in Common, or <hi>all</hi> Quantity, but only of that <hi>Species</hi> of Quantity call'd <hi>Continued.</hi>
               </p>

The Unity proper to Extended Quantity is <hi>Continuity</hi> of its parts; For, if the parts of this sort of Quantity be <hi>Discontinu'd,</hi> either <hi>Nothing</hi> (or <hi>vacuum</hi>) comes between them, and then they are still <hi>Continu'd</hi> against the Supposition; for Nothing can <hi>do</hi> nothing and therefore cannot <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue</hi> the Parts of Quantity. Or else some <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> comes between them and Discontinues them; and then, since all Bodies bring their <hi>own</hi> Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities along with them, however the Bodies, A. and B. are distanced by C's coming between them, because every Body has its determinate bounds and Limits; yet, the <hi>Quantity</hi> of those

three Bodies, precisely consider'd, has <hi>none,</hi> but goes on Smoothly in the self same tenour thro' the whole Mass of Body, whether those Bodies be <hi>Different</hi> or the <hi>Same</hi>; without Notches or Nicks butting and bounding it here and there, or in the least diversifying it; what ever Variety is found in the Figure, Colour, Hardness, Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or in any other consideration belonging to those Bodies. Again, since this <hi>Species</hi> of Quantity has its peculiar Notion, Nature, or Essence, it must have some kind of <hi>Vnity</hi> too peculiar to it self: But, none is imaginable except <hi>Continuity,</hi> nor does any so directly subsume under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Quantity, which is <hi>Divisibility</hi> or <hi>Vnity</hi> of its potential parts, or sute so exactly with it. Nay, were the parts of Quantity <hi>discontinu'd</hi> quantitatively, they would be <hi>divided</hi> quantita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that is, not <hi>Divisible</hi> or <hi>One</hi>; that is <hi>none,</hi> or <hi>Not-Quantity,</hi> against the Supposition.

to the Essence of <hi>Individual</hi> Bodies.

Whence, whatever else we can conceive of the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Weight</hi> in any Body is nothing else but its <hi>Densi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; for this makes it apt to receive the full Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the descending Ayr, and <hi>better</hi> and <hi>more swiftly</hi> cut the <hi>medium,</hi> when its Motion is once determin'd; whereas <hi>Rare</hi> Bodies suffer the descending Particles to slip thro' them, and do but dully and slowly divide the <hi>Medium</hi> thro' which they are to pass in their descent.

               </p>
               <p>Besides, two Infinits, under what Notion so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>limit,</hi> and so <hi>destroy</hi> one another: nor can it be solv'd by saying, that <hi>Quantity</hi> may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into <hi>Finit</hi> and <hi>Infinit,</hi> and that <hi>Species</hi> that is Infinit be but <hi>one,</hi> or have <hi>no more</hi> of its kind but its single self; for, since Infinit in any Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on includes All that can belong to that Notion, nothing of the <hi>Genus</hi> would be left for its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-<hi>species</hi> to partake of; which makes <hi>Finite Number</hi> to be <hi>no Species.</hi> Lastly, As the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of <hi>Continu'd Quantity</hi> were <hi>Greater</hi> or <hi>Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> determinate parts, so the Differences of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> must be <hi>More</hi> or <hi>Fewer</hi> determinate parts; which can bear no Sense if one of the <hi>species</hi> have <hi>All,</hi> or be <hi>Endless</hi> or Indeterminate.</p>

Hence 'tis Logically demonstrated that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit Number is Impossible</hi> and Contradictory; since it contradicts the Methods and Maxims of all our Natural Notions. For, were it put, it ought to belong to the Common Head of <hi>Quantity,</hi> which we see is in many regards Implicatory.

               <p n="16">16· Therefore <hi>Continu'd Quantity,</hi> for the same reason, cannot be <hi>Infinit</hi>; that is, there cannot be an Infinit <hi>Extent</hi> or Expansion of Body; for, then the Subject would verifie it, that there must be in it an <hi>Infinit Number</hi> of Yards, which is now prov'd Impossible.</p>
               <p n="17">17. For the same reason there cannot have been Infinit <hi>Time</hi>; for then, again, there must have been an <hi>Infinit Number, viz.</hi> of Hours.

               <p>Examples of the Questions proper to <hi>Quality</hi> are such as these: How do you? To which is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, <hi>Sick</hi> or in <hi>Health,</hi> well or ill dispos'd. How is he as to his Understanding? <hi>Learned</hi> or <hi>Ignorant</hi>; which Answers we call <hi>Habits</hi> or <hi>Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</hi> How is he as to his Walking, or using his Natural Faculties? To which we answer, <hi>well able</hi> to walk, or <hi>Lame, &amp;c.</hi> which signifie his <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Impotency.</hi> How is the Milk that's over the Fire, or the Bread in the Oven? To which is answer'd, <hi>Hot</hi> or <hi>Cold; Dough-bak'd</hi> or <hi>Enough:</hi> which are <hi>Passible Qualities.</hi> How is <hi>he</hi> affected to me? To which is answer'd, <hi>Angry,</hi> which is <hi>Passion.</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may be ask'd, How he is as to his <hi>outward shape?</hi> To which is answer'd, <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill shap'd, Handsome</hi> or <hi>Vgly,</hi> which <hi>Quality</hi> is call'd <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Intrinsecal Differences of <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> in this Common Head of <hi>Quality,</hi> are more properly to be call'd <hi>Better</hi> and <hi>Worse</hi> qualified, since they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62043:68"/>
fall into the same as <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi>; only the <hi>latter</hi> Expressions sute better, having a <hi>qualifying</hi> sense.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Impotency</hi> are the <hi>First Species</hi> of Quality, because they spring im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately out of the <hi>Essence</hi> as it's <hi>Properties,</hi> and most meerly concern it as to making it <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> or <hi>Worse</hi>; as also, because they most <hi>dispose</hi> or <hi>indispose</hi> the Subject to the substance (as it were) of it's Natural Operations. <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> are the <hi>Second</hi>; because they Supervene to the Power, and only give it a <hi>better</hi> or <hi>worse</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility or Difficulty to Operate. <hi>Passible Quality</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> taken as such, are the Third; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, taken as such, they meerly qualify the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be <hi>Passive</hi> or <hi>Alterable</hi> by another. I say, <hi>taken as such,</hi> that is, as <hi>Passible</hi>; for, if they be consider'd as <hi>Active,</hi> as Heat in Fire is conceiv'd to be apt to <hi>effect</hi> Heat in another thing, then 'tis a calefactive <hi>Virtue,</hi> and has the Notion of <hi>Power.</hi> Lastly, <hi>Figure</hi> has the least share of the Notion of Quality, because it onely regards the <hi>Outward</hi> Lineaments and Appearance, which are the sleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of all other Qualities. Though it may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, (especially in Organical Bodies and their several parts,) contribute to their <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi>; as an <hi>Acute Figure</hi> in Dense Bodies makes them better divide the Ayre, and other Bodies, adding thus an <hi>Accidental</hi> perfection to their <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Dividing</hi>; and <hi>Splay-footedness</hi> hinders the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Walking,</hi> whereas <hi>Straightness</hi> helps it. <hi>Accidental,</hi> I say, for the, Essential Notion of <hi>Figure</hi> is onely to <hi>terminate</hi> thus, or thus the Quantity of Bodies, as will be shewn here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62043:68"/>6. Wherefore, the Intrinsecal Differences of <hi>Quality</hi> being to make the Subject of them <hi>better</hi> or <hi>worse,</hi> hence most Qualities may admit of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Degrees</hi> in each of it's Species, or, as the Schools phrase it, may be <hi>Intended</hi> or <hi>Remitted</hi>; whereas neither <hi>Substance</hi> nor <hi>Quantity</hi> can. Not <hi>Substance</hi>; because, as we no sooner step out of the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Ens</hi> in common but we plunge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Non-Ens,</hi> so we cannot depart from the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Hoc Ens,</hi> but we must fall into <hi>Non-hoc-Ens</hi> or Another <hi>Ens.</hi> Not <hi>Quantity</hi>; for, let us design any particular or determinate <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of Quantity (a <hi>Yard</hi> for example) and but in the least Increase or Diminish it quantitative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and immediately it becomes <hi>no yard</hi> but of an other <hi>Species</hi> really, tho' perhaps so little may be added or detracted that we may want a Name for it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Power</hi> differs from <hi>Habit</hi> also in this that Powers are <hi>Natural,</hi> and spring out of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences of things as their <hi>Properties</hi>; as the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Walking, Seeing, Hearing, Fancying, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Willing, Heating, Dividing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas <hi>Habits</hi> are generally, Acquir'd by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Acts.

               <p n="10">10 All <hi>Passible Qualities</hi> are Objects of the Senses, Otherwise they would not be Natural Notions, nor belong to any Common Head; and, consequently, we could not <hi>discourse</hi> or <hi>think</hi> of them, which yet we experience we do.</p>
               <p n="11">11.

               </p>
               <p n="13">13. No other <hi>Species</hi> of Quality but Passible Qualities has this Prerogative, Not <hi>Power</hi>: For Powers are <hi>Properties</hi>; and, so, are conceiv'd to <hi>follow</hi> the Essence constituted, and <hi>presuppose</hi> it; much less <hi>Habits,</hi> for they supervene to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Powers.</hi> And least of all Figure, for this is <hi>Extrinsecal</hi> to the Constitution of the Body; however in Organical Bodies they may help to determine the <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Individuum.</hi>

               <p n="15">15.

This Ground cannot be their having <hi>Dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> or <hi>Disagreeing Notions</hi> in them, or their being of Disparate Orders, which have nothing to do with one another: For, we find that we cannot <hi>Refer</hi> or compare <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Hard, Youthful</hi> and <hi>Transparent, Hot</hi> and <hi>Triangular,</hi> nor any other <hi>disparate Notions</hi>; nor yet a <hi>Writer</hi> and a <hi>Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>share,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Mill-stone,</hi> a <hi>Brother</hi> and a <hi>Handsaw, &amp;c.</hi> because they are in <hi>Disparate</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and have no Respect to one another, <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> our Referring them or Comparing them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as have a <hi>Writer</hi> and a <hi>Writing,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Son,</hi> a <hi>Baker</hi> and <hi>Bread, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Wherefore the <hi>Ground</hi> of Relation must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be some Notion agreeing to <hi>both</hi> the things related, that is, found to belong to <hi>both,</hi> either Intrinsecally or Extrinsecally, or else their having Communication with one another by way of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Passion.</hi> This is prov'd by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Section, and is evident, because there can be no other Considerations by which they can be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to one another, or be of the same Order, but their having some Intrinsecal Notion common to both, or else their Acting and Suffering upon and from one another, which is an Extrinsecal Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>

Relations of the <hi>first</hi> sort, which have one and the <hi>same</hi> Notion in them, are of as many kinds as there are Heads of Notions, since all these have a kind of Nature or Notion in them, and so some kind of <hi>Transcendent</hi> Unity. Thus, if they have the same Nature or Essence in them which belongs to the Common Head of <hi>Substance,</hi> the Relation between them is call'd <hi>Identity,</hi> which is their being

of <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> kind of <hi>Entity.</hi> If of one and the same Notion of <hi>Quantity,</hi> 'tis call'd <hi>Equality,</hi> which is their being of one and the same <hi>Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> If of <hi>Quality,</hi> 'tis call'd <hi>Likeness:</hi> if of <hi>Action,</hi> (singly consider'd) they are call'd <hi>Co-actors,</hi> as Fellow-Souldiers, Fellow-Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If of <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> (singly consider'd) Fellow-Sufferers, Fellow-Martyrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If of <hi>Place,</hi> (or <hi>Vbi</hi>) Bed-fellows, Chamber-fellows, Townsmen, Country-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If of <hi>Time,</hi> Contemporaries, Co-eve, or born at the same time. If of <hi>Habit,</hi> Fellow-Mourners, Fellow-Curassiers, Fellow-Souldiers of the Blew or Grey Regiment. If of <hi>Situation,</hi> Fellow-Assessors or Sitters; tho' such as this seldom occur.

               <p n="5">5. Of the second sort grounded on <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Passion, not singly</hi> consider'd, but with an Order to one another, or <hi>as Inferring one another,</hi> are such as these, <hi>viz.</hi> Father and Son, Master and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Prince and Subject, Tutor and Pupil; which are grounded on the <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and being Begotten, Commanding and being Commanded, Governing and being Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Teaching and being Taught, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. In both these sorts of Relations the things Referr'd must have their <hi>Correlates</hi>; that is, there must be a mutual Relation on both sides.

This Agreeing and Corresponding of the two things thus Related in those of the <hi>former</hi> kind of Relation, must be meant to be their Agreeing in the same <hi>Abstracted</hi> and <hi>Common</hi> or Specifical Notion, and not in the same <hi>Individual</hi> one. For, otherwise two Men could not have <hi>Identity</hi> in their <hi>Individual</hi> Essence, since then they would be the <hi>same</hi> and <hi>not the same,</hi> that is, <hi>Vnum</hi> and <hi>Non-unum:</hi> And, for the same reason, <hi>Intrinsecal Accidents</hi> being Identify'd with the Subjects in which they inhere, and having no Entity but <hi>theirs,</hi> they can have no Individuality but <hi>by them,</hi> and so the same <hi>Individual</hi> Intrinsecal Accident cannot be Common to <hi>two</hi> Subjects or Substances, but must be Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually <hi>Two,</hi> as <hi>They</hi> are.

The Relations of the later sort became Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual upon another score, <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>Action</hi> and its proper <hi>Passion</hi> corresponding to it, do <hi>infer one another</hi>; For, nothing can <hi>Act,</hi> but it must Act upon <hi>something</hi> that receives that Action, or <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi> by it; nor <hi>suffer</hi> or be Acted upon, but by something that <hi>Acts</hi> on it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There is a Third Mix'd sort of Relation, call'd, <hi>Of the thing Measured to the Measure</hi>; that is, when the Thing Related <hi>depends</hi> for its <hi>Essence</hi> or its <hi>Perfection,</hi> on <hi>Another,</hi> and that other does not at all depend for either on <hi>it.</hi> For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, When a Picture is drawn from the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, it depends on the Prototype for its Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and is, as it were, <hi>Measur'd</hi> by it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard 'tis only so far <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad</hi> as it resembles the Man it was drawn for; but the <hi>Prototype</hi> or the <hi>Man,</hi> gets Nothing, nor is in the least Better or Worse, by having a Picture drawn from him. Again, there is a common Notion of Lineaments and Colour found in <hi>both,</hi> which makes it seem to partake of the first sort of Relation; also the Prototype, by imprinting an Idea of it self in the Painter, enables him in some sort to draw him, and so contributes something to that Action which gives it to partake of the Second Kind: so that this Kind of Relation seems to be <hi>Mixt</hi> of the <hi>other two,</hi> and yet (as will be shown) is perfectly of <hi>Neither.</hi>

               <p n="10">10. This kind of Relation is not <hi>Mutual,</hi> but is found only on the side of the thing <hi>measured:</hi> For, since the <hi>Measure</hi> (<hi>v. g.</hi> the Prototype) has no natural Order of Agency or Patiency by which it respects the Picture, because the Man is not a

               <p n="12">12. Of this sort too is the Relation between GOD, as <hi>Creator,</hi> and his <hi>Creatures.</hi> For, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creature has received all it has, or can

               <head>LESSON VIII. Of the Common Heads of <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Passion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THERE are Two, and but Two, Common Heads of Extrinsecals conceiv'd to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to one another by way of <hi>Motion.</hi> For, since Motion has <hi>two</hi> Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> that thing from whence it <hi>comes,</hi> and that to which it <hi>reaches,</hi> and these are <hi>distinct</hi> Considerations; hence we have Two Common Heads of one Extrinsecal thing conceiv'd to be apply'd to another by way of Motion. Nor can there be <hi>more</hi>; for Motion, consider'd (as it were) in the Midway between those Terms, has no Notion but that of <hi>meer</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whence it is the very Notion of <hi>Successive Quantity,</hi> and belongs clearly to <hi>that</hi> Common Head, and therefore cannot belong to <hi>another,</hi> or constitute a <hi>new</hi> one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Notion of <hi>Motion</hi> is the most Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all our Notions, and most approaching to Non-Entity. For, since <hi>Motion,</hi> as it superadds to the Extensive Quantity of its Subject, is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made up of <hi>not being</hi> in this place, or that; or, of <hi>not being still here</hi> and <hi>not being yet there</hi>; nor has any thing of <hi>Permanency,</hi> which is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the same Notion with <hi>Actual Being</hi>; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that, besides the Common disadvantage
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62043:78"/>
other Accidents are liable to, of having no Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their <hi>own</hi> but what's <hi>borrow'd</hi> of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, it has moreover this, that neither it self, nor any <hi>part</hi> of it self, <hi>exists</hi> so much as for one Moment. Wherefore <hi>Ens</hi> being a Capacity of Existence, Motion seems to be (in a manner) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Existence, or a <hi>Non-Entity</hi>; and this out of its own <hi>peculiar Nature</hi> or <hi>Notion.</hi> Again, since in every part of Motion the thing moved is in a space <hi>bigger</hi> than it self, and <hi>Place</hi> (as will be shewn <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Less.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9.</note> hereafter) properly such, is but <hi>Equal</hi> to the thing it contains, and not <hi>bigger</hi> than it, hence Motion hinders its Subject to be, properly speaking, <hi>in any place,</hi> that is <hi>any where,</hi> which amongst Bodies seems next akin to <hi>not being at all.</hi> Lastly, Motion is destructive of Actual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in those things that are arriv'd to their full state of perfection; which shews its nature to be in some sense directly opposit to the Notion of <hi>Being,</hi> which has some kind of <hi>Constancy</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> in it. Nor can it be said that it gives Actual Being or <hi>Existence</hi> to the <hi>new</hi> Entities it helps to produce, for Existence <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Book</hi> 3. <hi>L.</hi> 7. <hi>S.</hi> 5. <hi>Prop</hi> 6, 7.</note> is the proper Effect of <hi>Self-Existence</hi> or the <hi>First Cause.</hi> Wherefore the Notion of <hi>Motion</hi> is the <hi>most</hi> Imperfect of all our Notions, and <hi>most</hi> approaching to <hi>Non-Entity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> I. Hence is demonstrated that, since every Agent produces an Effect suitable to its <hi>own Nature,</hi> and therefore an Agent <hi>infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> cannot be the <hi>Immediate</hi> Cause of what's <hi>most Imperfect</hi>; therefore Motion, being both <hi>most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,</hi> and withal most <hi>disagreeable,</hi> nay, directly <hi>contrary,</hi> to <hi>God</hi>'s Nature, which is pure Self-Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62043:78"/>
and <hi>Essentially Immovable</hi> and <hi>Vnchangable,</hi> was not <hi>immediately</hi> caus'd by <hi>God,</hi> but by <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>B.</hi> 3. <hi>L</hi> 6. <hi>S.</hi> 4.</note> some <hi>imperfect</hi> Agent, or some Creature, that is, by such a Cause as <hi>of it self</hi> is a <hi>Non-Entity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Notion of <hi>Action,</hi> as it superadds to meer Motion is, the <hi>Exercise of a Power,</hi> which is <hi>Effective</hi> of something. For, since to <hi>Act</hi> is to <hi>Do,</hi> and to <hi>do Nothing</hi> is <hi>not to do,</hi> it follows, that to <hi>Act</hi> is to <hi>Do something</hi>; but to <hi>do something</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposes a <hi>Power</hi> to do it; and this so as not to stay in the Notion of meer <hi>Power</hi>; for, if it stays <hi>there,</hi> it <hi>only</hi> denominates the Thing <hi>Able to do,</hi> which (again) is <hi>not to do</hi>; wherefore <hi>Action</hi> is not the Notion of a sluggish Power, but of a Power <hi>Exerted</hi> and <hi>Exercis'd,</hi> that is, <hi>Effecting</hi> something; whence the Power is call'd <hi>Effective,</hi> the Action <hi>Efficiency,</hi> and the Something it does is term'd an <hi>Effect.</hi> All which superadd to the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>meer</hi> Motion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Primary and Chief <hi>Natural Action</hi> is <hi>Division.</hi> For, since Substance is the Subject of all Accidents; and, which being changed, all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents do suffer a change with it; hence <hi>that</hi> Action that works upon a Body according to the <hi>Substantial</hi> Notion of it, has <hi>more</hi> of Action in it, as working a <hi>Greater</hi> Effect: But <hi>Division</hi> makes <hi>Two</hi> Things of <hi>One,</hi> and so destroys the former <hi>Vnum</hi> or <hi>Ens,</hi> and makes <hi>Two</hi> new ones, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Division</hi> is the Primary and Chief of all other Natural Actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:62043:79"/>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That this is to be understood of Perfect Division, which makes the thing <hi>Divided,</hi> and is therefore only properly to be call'd <hi>Division</hi>; for, Imperfect Division only alters the <hi>Figure.</hi> It may be objected, That Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Condensation, if they be in a great degree, change the Substance as well as Division does. <hi>Answ.</hi> This arises out of the nature of some particular sort of Bodies, and not out of the precise Notion of those Actions: For, 'tis evident that Rarefaction and Condensation import no more in their Notion but the <hi>altering</hi> the Subject accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some <hi>Quality</hi>; whereas <hi>Division</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports directly the taking away the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the Thing, and consequently its <hi>Entity.</hi> Again, meer Rarefaction does not change the Substance, but the <hi>Degree</hi> of it, when it comes to great height; and every Body ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Rarefaction a long time without losing its former Essence; whereas Division consists in an <hi>Indivisible,</hi> so that the <hi>Divisum esse</hi> is <hi>esse aliud,</hi> or <hi>esse duo ex uno</hi>; whereas the <hi>Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum esse</hi> may be without any such Effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condensation</hi> are the <hi>next</hi> Actions in Dignity: For, since (as was proved above) Rarity and Density are the <hi>First</hi> Intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Differences of <hi>Quantity,</hi> as it affects Body (in order to natural Action and Passion, it follows, that those natural Actions that cause Rarity or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62043:79"/>
Density, are the <hi>next</hi> in dignity to <hi>Division,</hi> which works more upon <hi>Divisibility</hi> their <hi>Genus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. These <hi>three</hi> sorts of Action take up the whole Head of <hi>Natural Action.</hi> For, since the <hi>Genus</hi> and its two <hi>Differences</hi> must needs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all under any common Head, as being Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to it, and <hi>Division</hi> answers to Divisibility, the <hi>Genus,</hi> and <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> and <hi>Condensation</hi> to the Intrinsecal Differences of <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> thus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; it follows, that <hi>these three</hi> sorts of Action do take up <hi>all</hi> that Head, so that there cannot be <hi>any kind</hi> of Natural Action, which is not reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to some of these, or not comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. Besides, all the First and Second <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Qualities,</hi> which generally are the Immediate Objects of Natural Actions, are comprehended in, or spring out of, Rarity and Density; as will be seen in Physicks.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Formal Virtue</hi> of Acting, or working any Effect, which we call its <hi>Causality,</hi> is the Agent's <hi>being what it is,</hi> or its very <hi>Existence</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by Motion to the Patient, and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to it, or (as it were) imprinted on it. For, since no particular Agent in Nature can do <hi>every</hi> thing whatever, the reason why such <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Causes work such <hi>particular</hi> Effects must spring hence, that the Effect has something in its Nature that is like the Cause, comes <hi>from it,</hi> and is <hi>Communicated</hi> to the Patient, or <hi>partak'd</hi> by it.

to another thing. The reason why a Seal makes such an Impression, is; because <hi>it self</hi> is of such a stamp. The reason why <hi>God</hi> Creates, or is the Cause of <hi>Being,</hi> is, because Being is <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to him.</p>

Hence Motion is only requisit to <hi>apply</hi> the Virtue or <hi>Existence</hi> of the Agent to the Matter or Patient; but the <hi>Substance</hi> of the Effect springs from the Cause's <hi>being what it is:</hi> Whence it happens, that the Effect from the same Causes is more or less perfect, according as the <hi>Existence</hi> of a Cause which is of such a Nature or Essence, or more or fewer <hi>parts</hi> of it, are apply'd <hi>better</hi> or <hi>worse</hi> to the Patient, or to <hi>more</hi> or <hi>fewer</hi> parts of it, by a <hi>feebler</hi> or <hi>smarter</hi> Motion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It follows from this discourse that there must be <hi>Four</hi> Sorts of Causes necessarily belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every Effect in Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> There must be an <hi>Acter</hi> which we call the <hi>Efficient</hi> Cause; a <hi>Subject</hi> for the Acter to work upon, called the <hi>Material</hi> Cause. The <hi>Effect</hi> wrought in that Matter or Receiv'd in it, which makes it otherwise than it was before, and therefore has the Notion of some <hi>Form</hi> newly accruing to it; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes the <hi>Formal</hi> Cause. And, since Corporeal Action is <hi>Motion,</hi> and no <hi>Body</hi> can move <hi>it self,</hi> and therefore all Motion in Nature must be <hi>caus'd</hi> (either Mediately or Immediately) by something that is <hi>not a Body,</hi> that is, by a <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> Being: and such Agents do <hi>design</hi> or <hi>act</hi> for an <hi>End</hi>; therefore, there must also be a <hi>Final</hi> Cause to make those Agents to move Bodies, and make
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62043:80"/>
them act as they do in every particular Action tho' never so minute; which grounds our Notion of <hi>Providence</hi> adequately Governing the World even as to the least circumstance of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there are to every Action in Nature <hi>Four</hi> Causes necessarily requisit; which will afford Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecters ample occasion for Speculation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. For example, When I write a Letter, the <hi>Efficient</hi> Cause is my Self; the <hi>Material</hi> Cause, Paper, which <hi>receives</hi> the Effect of my Writing; The <hi>Formal</hi> Cause, the Characters received in the Paper; the <hi>Final</hi> Cause, to gratify my Friend, treat of Business, or acquaint him with News.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There is no <hi>Fifth</hi> Cause call'd an <hi>Idea,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> affirms. For, either that <hi>Idea</hi> is conceiv'd as introduced in the matter and Receiv'd there, and then 'tis clearly a <hi>Formal</hi> Cause: or, as 'tis in the <hi>Mind</hi> of the Artificer; and then it concurrs to make him an <hi>Efficient</hi> Cause; for without such an <hi>Idea</hi> he could not produce such an Artificial Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

or Acts; And, therefore, these are not so proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd <hi>Actions,</hi> as <hi>Operations,</hi> in order to what they have of <hi>Effective</hi> in them; or else <hi>Acts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they <hi>Actuate</hi> or <hi>Inform</hi> the Subject <hi>in which</hi> they are as well <hi>Received,</hi> as they are <hi>Produced</hi> by it.

               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That since <hi>Action</hi> inferrs <hi>Passion,</hi> and referrs to it, hence whatever is discoursed here of <hi>Action,</hi> may, by turning the Tables (as it were) or considering Motion in order to its <hi>other</hi> Term, be understood likewise of <hi>Passion</hi>; for which reason we treat of both those Heads in the same Discourse.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>UBI</hi> or <hi>Where</hi> signifying [<hi>in what Place</hi>] the Notion of <hi>Place,</hi> must first be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood e're we can have a right Notion of the Common Head call'd <hi>Ubi.</hi> And the word [<hi>Place</hi>] being no Artificial Term but a Natural one, and us'd by all Mankind, we are to learn the true and proper meaning of it from the Users of it; that is, we must take the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Place,</hi> not from men of <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Speculaters,</hi> but from the <hi>Vulgar</hi>; and the surest way to do this, is to gather their Sense by <hi>reflecting</hi> on their Sayings and known Intentions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since then the Vulgar agree naturally to say a thing is <hi>in</hi> a Place; the Notion of <hi>Place</hi> is to be a <hi>Container</hi> of the thing that is <hi>in it</hi>; and, withal, <hi>such</hi> a Container as is not Intrinsecal to the Thing of which 'tis enquir'd where it is, but Extrinsecal to it; for it would be very odd and dissatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and look like a <hi>Jest,</hi> if when we are ask'd, <hi>Where</hi> such a man <hi>is?</hi> we should Answer, <hi>He is in his Skin.</hi> Whence, pursuing these Natural Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of theirs exactly, we shall find, that the <hi>Proper Place</hi> of any Body must be <hi>Another</hi> Body that is <hi>Immediate</hi> and <hi>Equal</hi> to it; for were it <hi>Distant</hi> from it, and so, <hi>Vnequal</hi> to it, or too wide for it, then (since there is no <hi>Vacuum</hi>) that too-large Container would be a <hi>Common</hi> Place to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62043:82"/>
other Bodies as well as <hi>it,</hi> and so would not be its <hi>Proper</hi> Place, (which was the Question that was ask'd) since it would be no more <hi>Its</hi> Place than that <hi>others,</hi> but a Common Place to both; which, therefore, would be no competent Answer to the Question where <hi>It</hi> was? Whence, by Reflexion, we shall discover, that <hi>Place,</hi> in proper and exact speech, is the <hi>Ambient Superficies of the next Body</hi>; for, this is <hi>Immediate,</hi> and therefore <hi>Equal</hi> to it, because an Indivisible (such as the Superficies is in respect to Body) can add <hi>no</hi> Quantity to it or make the Container <hi>Vnequal</hi> to the thing Contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But 'tis to be observed, that the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> whose only aym it is to <hi>find</hi> a thing by asking for its Place, do not reflect oftentimes upon their own Notion, or as it were <hi>refine</hi> it to an Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but content themselves to know <hi>near</hi> what Visible thing that which they look for is placed; as on the Cup-board, behind the door, under the Beds-feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is a Slubberd or Imperfect Notion of <hi>Place,</hi> even according to their own Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for these do put the thing sought for to be <hi>in</hi> that Place, whereas perhaps many <hi>other</hi> things are <hi>on</hi> the Cup-board, or <hi>near</hi> the Bed's feet, as well as the thing sought for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, since the Intention of Mankind in asking <hi>Where</hi> a Thing is? can be no other but to know how to <hi>find</hi> it, it follows that <hi>Place</hi> must be certainly <hi>Knowable,</hi> that is, such as does not it self need <hi>seeking for.</hi> Nor could it be such if it were still Subject to be <hi>Remov'd</hi>; for then we should be at a loss both to find <hi>It</hi> and <hi>other</hi> things <hi>by it</hi>: and our selves would be at the same plunge as are those that practise the Art of Memory; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

All <hi>farther</hi> Immobility being nothing to the purpose mankind intended, and therefore was no part of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore, there is no Necessity of having recourse to <hi>Imaginary Space</hi> or <hi>Subsistent Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> to find something which is Immoveable <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,</hi> which some do upon this account, because all things in Nature are subject to <hi>motion.</hi> For, we experience, that we can <hi>find</hi> any thing that we can have necessity to use or know well enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recurring thither. Besides, Place must be <hi>more</hi> Knowable then the thing we look for; whereas, these Imaginary <hi>Vbies</hi> are not Distinguishable or Knowable <hi>at all.</hi> So that such wild Conceits as these are Extravagant even to madness. We have prov'd <hi>Vacuum</hi> to be purely <hi>Nothing,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Vnknowable</hi>; and, therefore, to be in a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> is to be in <hi>no place</hi> or <hi>no where.</hi> And, as for <hi>Subsistent Dimensions,</hi> 'tis a plain Contradiction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another score; because it puts <hi>Quantity</hi> to be <hi>Substance,</hi> and capable of subsisting <hi>alone</hi> or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Subject.</p>
               <p n="5">5. 'Tis not much less ridiculous to invent little Entities call'd <hi>Vbies</hi> for Bodies, or for Spirits (which are incapable of being in place) of which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62043:83"/>
we can give no account. For, since the surface of the containing Body, in a Determinate distance from some Parts of the House, the Town, the Country, or the World, which to our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are <hi>fixt,</hi> answers all Questions that can be proposed about the <hi>Place</hi> of a thing, and we can be furnisht with this by our <hi>Natural</hi> Notions; it follows, that all other far-fetcht Conceits, invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to explicate <hi>Place,</hi> are Needless and Sensless. Such strange extravagancies capering wits are apt to fall into, when they relinquish Nature and the <hi>Solid</hi> Notions she imprints in them, to follow meer <hi>Fancy,</hi> the mint of a thousand ungrounded Capricio's and Chimera's.</p>

And, farther than this (or rather not so far) none of the Generality of Mankind can have occasion to enquire; tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Artists, or Geographers and Astronomers, may; nor needs there any more Immobility to be ascertain'd, to find out where that Skilful Doctor lives, since this may serve our purpose of finding him. And we may do this easily, (let the whole Earth move round never so swiftly) by getting an Answer to some of these Questions, without the help of Imaginary Space, Subsistent Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or those little Entities call'd <hi>Vbies,</hi> which

Hence is seen, that the <hi>Concave Superficies</hi> of a Body, consider'd as affecting its own Subject, is in the Head of Quantity; but, as <hi>Containing</hi> another Body, and connotating a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to some other things, so fixt and known, that by knowing them and It, we may know <hi>where</hi> the thing contain'd is; it constitutes the Common Head of <hi>Vbi,</hi> and consequently of <hi>Place.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> III. 'Tis seen also that Angels are not properly <hi>in Place,</hi> nor consequently have proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any <hi>Vbi</hi>; since they have nothing in them which can have any Commensuration to a <hi>Superficies,</hi> or be Contain'd within it. Wherefore their being <hi>in Place</hi> can only be understood of their <hi>working</hi> upon Bodies which <hi>are in Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. From what is said it will appear, that the true and proper Notion of <hi>Ubi</hi> is not <hi>Place</hi> it self, but <hi>the being in</hi> such or such <hi>a Place</hi>; that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62043:84"/>
is, it consists formally in the Application of one Extrinsecal thing to another, <hi>in Rest; viz.</hi> of the Body Contain'd to the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Body Containing, with a Connotation of the respects above-mentioned. Yet, because <hi>to be in a Place</hi> includes <hi>Place</hi> in its Notion, it was proper and necessary to treat of it under this Head, seeing it belong'd to it <hi>Formally,</hi> and to <hi>Quantity</hi> only <hi>Materially.</hi>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THere is some Motion that is <hi>Even</hi> and <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> at least to our Apprehension; and withal <hi>Knowable</hi> to all Mankind. For, every man sees that the Sun moves (at least it appears so to us) and if there be any Irregularity or Uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in its Motion, yet it is to us Undiscerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore this <hi>Regular</hi> and <hi>Known</hi> Motion is fit to be a <hi>Measure</hi> to all our other Motions. For, since there are but three things Requisit to compleat the Notion of a <hi>Measure, viz.</hi> that it be apt to bear a Proportion to the Thing Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, and to be <hi>compar'd</hi> to it, which all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have from being <hi>Quantities</hi> of the same kind,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62043:84"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> being <hi>Successive Quantity</hi>; and that its Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity be <hi>more Known</hi> than the Quantity of the thing Measured; and, lastly, that it be <hi>fix'd</hi> or <hi>Constantly</hi> the same, that so it may be a Standard to the others; and, since the Motion of the Sun has both these last Properties, as well as it has the First from its being of the <hi>same Kind</hi> of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity with <hi>other</hi> Motions, therefore this <hi>proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, known,</hi> and <hi>even</hi> Motion of the Sun is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way fit to be a <hi>Measure</hi> to all our <hi>less</hi> known and <hi>less</hi> regular Motions; which kind of Measure we call <hi>Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence Motion may be consider'd three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, and thence ground three several No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: One, as it respects the <hi>parts</hi> into which it is Divisible, and its peculiar manner of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>no two</hi> Parts <hi>at once</hi>; the former of which gives it the Notion of <hi>Quantity,</hi> the latter to be of that <hi>Species</hi> of Quantity call'd <hi>Successive.</hi> Next, it may be consider'd as it respects the two <hi>Terms</hi> or Things, <hi>viz.</hi> that from which it <hi>begins,</hi> and that on which it <hi>lights</hi> and where it <hi>ends</hi> its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer; which Considerations of Motion ground Action and Passion: And, lastly, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd as bearing a <hi>proportion</hi> to <hi>other</hi> Motions, and as having such other Properties as fit it to <hi>Measure</hi> them; and Motion, as conceiv'd to be furnish'd with these Requisites to Measure all others, is that which we properly call <hi>Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Notion of <hi>Time</hi> is a <hi>Natural</hi> Notion, and <hi>Common</hi> to all Mankind. This is evident; For all Mankind, the Rudest as well as the most Learned, (as we find by their expressions) <hi>has</hi> that Notion, must <hi>need</hi> it, and does <hi>use</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:62043:85"/>5. Tho' the Notion of <hi>Time</hi> be clearly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Nature, yet it needs some help of the Understanding to make it <hi>compleatly</hi> and <hi>actually</hi> a Measure: For, when I write an hour (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) that motion of Writing was really perform'd while the Sun did run the four and twentieth part of his Diurnal course; and so, that Motion of my Pen was <hi>in reality</hi> proportion'd to such a part of Time. On the other side, since every particular Measure bears in its Notion to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately <hi>thus much,</hi> and there is no Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in Nature of any part of the Sun's Motion, nor any part of it <hi>at once,</hi> and only my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing divides its Annual and Diurnal Motion into so many Proportionate and Determinate parts; and (tho' the Motion it self be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually fleeting) yet it resumes so much of it into one Determinate and Constant Notion (<hi>viz.</hi> of an Hour) without which Determination it could not actually be a <hi>Measure</hi>; therefore, tho' the Notion of <hi>Time</hi> be clearly <hi>grounded</hi> in Nature, yet it needs some help of the Understanding to make it <hi>compleatly</hi> and <hi>actually</hi> a Measure.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Notion of <hi>Time</hi> depends on our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the same manner that <hi>Relati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n</hi> did: For, the Ground, Reason, and Substance of Times being a <hi>Measure,</hi> is found in Nature; and yet the otherwise-Indeterminate parts of the Sun's Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be made Determinate by our compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing so much of them at once into one Notion, and then <hi>considering</hi> them as Proportion'd, that is, by our <hi>Referring</hi> or <hi>Comparing</hi> them to <hi>other</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, e're they can be Actually a <hi>Measure.</hi>

                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:62043:85"/>7. Hence may be collected, that the True and Genuin Notion of the Common Head of <hi>Quando</hi> or <hi>When,</hi> is not the meer precise Notion of <hi>Time it self,</hi> but of <hi>being in such</hi> a determinate <hi>part</hi> of Time; that is, its Notion consists in the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Extrinsecal Motion of the Sun to Sublunary (or perhaps in Artists who reach fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to subsolary or supersolary Motions; and the Answer to <hi>Quando</hi> tells us to what part of Time they belong, or are conceiv'd to be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd. For example, these Expressions; <hi>I writ yesterday, I will come to morrow, I will speak with you within an hour,</hi> and such-like, do Apply our Past, Present, or Future Actions to some different part of Time. Yet, because their being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd <hi>in such a Time</hi> includes <hi>Time</hi> in its Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that Time, tho' it be <hi>materially</hi> Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Quantity, yet taking it <hi>formally,</hi> 'tis not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd in order to its <hi>own</hi> Subject, of which it is an Intrinsecal Accident, but in order to <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; it was necessary to treat of it under <hi>this</hi> Head; since taken thus <hi>formally</hi> it can belong to <hi>this,</hi> and cannot to <hi>any other.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> I. Hence 'tis a meer <hi>Chimera,</hi> and as sensless as that of Imaginary Space to fancy Time <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the World. For, it is in direct terms to put Motion and Time to <hi>be</hi> when they <hi>are not,</hi> which is, to put it <hi>to be and not be at once.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> II. For the same reason meer <hi>Being,</hi> without Order to <hi>Motion,</hi> has nothing to do with <hi>Time,</hi> nor can be said to be <hi>in it,</hi> or <hi>subject to it,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:62043:86"/>
or <hi>measurable by it.</hi> For <hi>Being,</hi> precisely as such, has no <hi>parts</hi> by which it may be proportion'd to the Sun's Motion, or Commensurable to it: Wherefore, to fancy God's Eternity (which consists in the most Absolute Impossibility of his not-being) to be Commensurate to an Infinit flux of Time, is a Groundless and Sensless Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Tho' his never-altering <hi>Being</hi> does, even for its being such, eminently include all Possible <hi>Time</hi> and all <hi>Differences</hi> of Time, Past, Present, and Future, and this concenter'd in it all at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> III. For the like reason the <hi>Internal</hi> Operations of Spirits being <hi>Indivisible</hi> and <hi>Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous,</hi> can have no Commensuration to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun, or to Time; tho' their <hi>External</hi> Operation upon Bodies may; correspondently to what is said before of their being <hi>in Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The Questions of <hi>Quando,</hi> and their proper Answers, are such as these; When was Christ born? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1696 Years ago.

The Differences of <hi>Quando</hi> are <hi>Past, Present</hi> and <hi>Future.</hi> Tho' the Present is not in reality, it being an Instant and Indivisible; yet, since our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding can <hi>comprise</hi> such a portion of Time into one Notion, and consider it, and conceive it, and thence speak of it by a participle of the Present Tense, and as one entire Part of Time, and say <hi>'tis Running,</hi> till as much as we had fram'd a Notion of were run out or ended; hence we can
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62043:86"/>
truly say, something <hi>is doing</hi> this present Age, Year, Month, Day and Hour, nay, this very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taking <hi>Moment</hi> for some short Indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate part of Time.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Differences of Past and Future are <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> distant from the Present prefix'd Time; for <hi>Past</hi> signifies <hi>before it, Future, after it.</hi> Inferiour Differences also must be taken from some determinate point, (as it were) as, from the Creation, the first Olympiad, the Birth of our Saviour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That it is very nicely to be remark'd, that when <hi>Questions</hi> are ask'd, by <hi>how much</hi> or <hi>how little</hi> of <hi>Time?</hi> the Answer belongs to the Predicament of <hi>Successive Quantity</hi>; whence an Age, a Year, a Month, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are <hi>Quantita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Notions, divided by <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> of Successive Quantity or Motion, and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them; and only what answers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely to <hi>When,</hi> belongs to this Predicament of <hi>Quando.</hi> Thus, if we ask <hi>how long Time</hi> it is <hi>since</hi> the Invasion of <hi>William the Conqueror</hi>; the Answer is, Six hundred and thirty years; which is a quantitative Notion consisting of both Continu'd and Discrete Quantity. But if you ask, <hi>When</hi> was the first Olympiad? the Answer will be, In the three thousandth two hundredth twenty eighth year from the Creation; and so it will belong to this Head; for then it formally signifies, that the Motion or Action of the Games in the first Olympiad were celebrated while such a part of the Sun's Motion was passing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:62043:87"/>The Predicaments of <hi>Situation</hi> and <hi>Habit</hi> are of little use, therefore not worth the dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on them.</p>

               <head>LESSON XI. Of the Expression of Our Notions by Words.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NOtions being (as was said) the <hi>Meanings of Words,</hi> it comes next to be examin'd, what Advantage or Disadvantage may accrue to <hi>Science,</hi> by the expressing our Notions by <hi>Words,</hi> either distinctly or confusedly. If the word have but <hi>one</hi> Sense or Signification, either taken alone or as apply'd to other Notions, 'tis said to be <hi>Vnivocal,</hi> or to be spoken <hi>Vnivocally</hi> of them; because <hi>Vex</hi> or <hi>Word</hi> differing from meer <hi>Sound</hi> in this, that a <hi>Voice</hi> is apt to express our Inward <hi>Sense, Mind,</hi> or <hi>Notion,</hi> so that <hi>Sense</hi> seems to be the <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi> of a Word, and <hi>Sound</hi> only the <hi>material</hi> part or (as it were) the <hi>Body</hi> of it: Hence a Word is said to be <hi>Vnivocal,</hi> when it has but <hi>One Sence</hi> or Meaning, and <hi>Equivocal</hi> when it has or may have <hi>more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Since, as <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>B.</hi> 1. <hi>L.</hi> 1</note> was prov'd above, Notions are the <hi>Natures</hi> of the things in our Understanding, and so can have no Falsity, in regard they have their <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Verity; that is, they <hi>are what they are,</hi> and cannot be <hi>other</hi> than they are;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62043:87"/>
nor can they have <hi>Formal</hi> Falsity, for this consists in the <hi>Compounding</hi> two Notions together by Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming or Denying, neither of which is found in Notions or <hi>Simple</hi> Apprehensions, which are <hi>not</hi> thus Compounded; hence <hi>no Error</hi> can possibly proceed from the <hi>Notions,</hi> but all <hi>Truth</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were all Words <hi>Vnivocal,</hi> and had but <hi>One</hi> Notion or Meaning, there could be no more possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Error from <hi>Words</hi> than there could be from the <hi>Notions</hi> themselves, which are signified by those Words. Wherefore, on the contrary, if words be <hi>Equivocal,</hi> that is, Ambiguous, or liable to be taken in a <hi>double Meaning,</hi> or (which is the same) to signifie <hi>diverse Notions,</hi> and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that some of the persons that use them do take them in <hi>one</hi> sense, others in <hi>another,</hi> they must necessarily speak and discourse of <hi>different</hi> things, and, so fall into <hi>different sentiments,</hi> and contradict one another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence, supposing the Persons be <hi>sincere,</hi> and that there be no Fault in their <hi>Will,</hi> most of the Contests and Wranglings in the World do arise from the <hi>Equivocal</hi> Meaning of Words: For, since the Use of Words is Common to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and most Single Words are Equivocal, and the Contexture of them, or the whole Clause, may also be oftentimes taken in a different sense; hence, unless the double sense of the Words be Clear'd and Distinguish'd, Innumerable and End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Contests must necessarily happen from the <hi>Equivocal</hi> Meaning of those Words.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Written</hi> Words are far more liable to those Inconveniencies than words <hi>Spoken,</hi> especially if the Authors of those Written Words be <hi>Dead,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:62043:88"/>
and no Certain way of Interpreting them be agreed on by all Parties. For, if an Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on happen in Words <hi>spoken,</hi> the Speaker, if <hi>alive,</hi> may easily come to see he is misunderstood, and by a Pertinent Distinction shewing the <hi>double</hi> sense of the Word, and in <hi>which</hi> of the senses he means it, may come to a right understanding with his Opposit; which is Impossible in <hi>Written</hi> Words, when the Author is <hi>Dead,</hi> and there is no Certain way of Interpreting those words Agreed on; as it happens in the followers of <hi>Aristotle</hi> or any other Dead Authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> I. This <hi>Method</hi> or way of Interpreting such Words must either be Evident of it self, or made Evident by Proof; and it must, besides, be Agreed by both the contending Parties. <hi>Evident,</hi> because it is a kind of <hi>Principle</hi> to find out the true sence of the Author. And it must be <hi>Agreed on</hi>; for otherwise the Principle not been yielded to, all Contests which depend upon that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must remain <hi>Vndecided,</hi> and end (if they ever do so) in a meer Logomachy or <hi>Word-skirmish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. For the same reason, even the same person, if he be deluded by the Ambiguous Sound of a Word, and, thro' Inadvertence or want of Skill to keep his Thoughts steady, happen to take it now in <hi>one</hi> sense, now in <hi>another,</hi> must necessarily <hi>blunder</hi> in his Discourse, and speak Incoherently. For, since the true Notion of the Thing does Ground all our Knowledge of it, and all our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses concerning it; it follows, that he who proceeds now upon <hi>one</hi> Notion, then upon <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62043:88"/>
must needs vary and hobble in his Discourse, and talk Incoherently; having no Certain and Fixt Notion affording him Light to guide his Steps to the <hi>same End,</hi> or take the <hi>right Way</hi> to it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Meaning of those words that express <hi>Natural</hi> Notions is to be taken from the <hi>Vulgar</hi>; and the sense of <hi>Artificial</hi> Words from Men who are <hi>Learned</hi> in those respective Arts: For, the signification of Words can only be taken from the Authors and Users of them; which in the former sort of Words is the <hi>Vulgar</hi>; in the later, <hi>Men of Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Hence Criticisms, generally speaking, are Incompetent to give us the <hi>Certain</hi> Sense of Words. For, Criticks do very frequently ground the Sense of Words upon Etymologies, or the Derivation of them from other words: Or else, on the Sense in which some few learned Writers do take them; both which are Fallacious Rules to know their Sense <hi>certainly.</hi> The former, because the Reason <hi>why</hi> the word was Impos'd, and the Sense <hi>it self</hi> of those words are many times Different Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For example, a Stone (as some of them tell us) is in Latin nam'd <hi>Lapis, a laedend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pedes;</hi> but the <hi>Notion</hi> or signification of that word is the <hi>very Substance</hi> it self of such a Body. Nor is the latter Rule competent to give us the true Meanings of those words that express Natural Notions; first, because those Learned Men use to speak Learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Rhetorically with Tropes and Figures, and affect to deliver their thoughts neatly and finely, with quaint Phrases, Allusions, Metaphors, and other knacks of Language; all which are so many Deviations from the <hi>Natural</hi> manner of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62043:89"/>
Common to all Mankind, and, consequently, Unsuitable to our <hi>Natural</hi> Conceptions. Besides that, a <hi>Few</hi> Authors suffice the Criticks to build their Observations upon; All which falls infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly short of that Certainty and Plainness which the <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Constant Vse</hi> of the Generality of Mankind, or the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> affords us.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Equivocal</hi> Words are either Simply and <hi>Absolutely</hi> such, which we call Equivocal <hi>by chance</hi>; or <hi>Relatively,</hi> which we call Equivocal <hi>by design.</hi> Absolutely, when there is no kind of Reason or Ground why the same word should have two different senses; as when [<hi>Far</hi>] in English signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>a great way</hi>; in Latin, <hi>Bread-Corn</hi>; or any word in one Language happens meerly casually to have a different Signification in another. In which sort of Equivocation there can be no danger to Science, those two Senses of the Word being so vastly disparate: <hi>Relatively,</hi> when there is <hi>some</hi> kind of Ground <hi>why</hi> the same word should be <hi>transferr'd</hi> from one Notion to another. And this may be done for two different reasons. One, when it is referr'd to another for some <hi>Connexion</hi> with them as Cause and Effect; as, when the word [<hi>Healthful</hi>] which properly belongs to an <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> is; transferr'd to <hi>Meat,</hi> because it is the <hi>Cause</hi> of Health in the Animal; and to <hi>Vrine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is an <hi>Effect</hi> of its Health, and therefore a Natural <hi>Sign</hi> of it. Or, as when we say there is much <hi>Art</hi> in such a Picture or Poem, it means the <hi>Effect</hi> of Art; for <hi>Art</hi> in proper speech is to be found only in the Understanding of the Artificer. The other Reason of the words being Transferr'd from one to another, and consequently, Referr'd
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62043:89"/>
back to it again, is, when this is done for some <hi>Proportion</hi> or <hi>Resemblance</hi> between them: As, when we say of a <hi>good Governour,</hi> that he is the <hi>Pilot</hi> of the Common-wealth, to steer it into a safe Harbour, and preserve it from splitting upon the Rocks of Division. Where the word [<hi>Pilot</hi>] which in the First and Proper Meaning signifies a <hi>Director</hi> of a Ship, is transferr'd to a <hi>Governor,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he does the same <hi>in Proportion</hi> in a Common-wealth which the other does in a Ship. Thus <hi>Tranquility,</hi> which is properly said of the <hi>Sea</hi> in a <hi>Calm,</hi> is Transferr'd to a <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause its <hi>Peaceable</hi> Condition resembles or bears a kind of <hi>Proportion</hi> to the Undisturb'd Quiet found in a Calm Sea.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Words Transferr'd to another for some Proportion or Resemblance between them are call'd <hi>Metaphors,</hi> or <hi>Metaphorical</hi>; and the best Metaphors are, when the thing, from which 'tis Transferr'd, is Eminent under that Notion we intend to express. As when we call a Valiant Man <hi>a Lyon,</hi> and a Meek man <hi>a Lamb</hi>; because <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> and <hi>Mildness</hi> are Eminent in those <hi>Animals.</hi> A Continu'd Metaphor is call'd an <hi>Allegory.</hi> As, in the Example lately given, the word <hi>Pilot, steer, harbour, splitting</hi> and <hi>Rocks,</hi> are all Metaphors, and therefore the whole speech is <hi>Allegorical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. There is no Danger nor Detriment to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that such words are us'd in <hi>Common</hi> Speech, or <hi>Loose</hi> Rhetorical Discourses; but they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly pernicious to it when we are treating of <hi>Dogmatical Tenets,</hi> and searching for Truth out of the Words of <hi>Written</hi> Authors. For, since those Metaphors, however they be <hi>True</hi> while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62043:90"/>
to be meant in Proportion and Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance onely, yet are <hi>Literally Tals</hi>; and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering Doctrines or <hi>Dogmatical</hi> Tenets only <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> Truth is aim'd at; and, if the Reader happen to take a Metaphorical Expression for a Literal one, he will most certainly embrace an <hi>Errour</hi> for a <hi>Truth</hi>; or, if he takes a word Literally meant for a Metaphor, he will take a Truth for an Errour; hence, it must Needs be most pernicious to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence not to distinguish between the <hi>Metaphorical</hi> and <hi>Literal</hi> sense of the words, but mistake one for the other. And, therefore, unless some Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule be Establisht, by which we may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain'd when <hi>Written</hi> Words are to be taken <hi>Literally,</hi> when <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> 'tis impossible to be Certain of any Truth meerly by those Written Words.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Those Words which are Transferr'd from <hi>Corporeal</hi> to <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures are, by far, more highly Metaphorical than can be any Transferr'd from one <hi>Body</hi> to another; and therefore, the Misunderstanding them must needs be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to Science: For, since Corporeal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual are the First <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Ens,</hi> and the Division of that <hi>Genus</hi> into those <hi>Species</hi> is made by the <hi>Contradictory</hi> Differences of Divisible and Indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it follows demonstratively, that whatever, except the precise Notion of <hi>Ens,</hi> is properly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd of <hi>Body</hi> must be properly Deny'd of <hi>Spirit</hi>: and therefore the words Transferr'd from Bodies to Spirits which are in <hi>Different Lines</hi> are far more Improper than those which are Tranferr'd from <hi>one Body</hi> to <hi>another</hi>; they being in the <hi>same Line,</hi> and so less Disparate.</p>

                  <hi>Corol.</hi> IV. Hence also is demonstrated that all the Names and Words we can use when we speak of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and its Attributes,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62043:91"/>
are in the <hi>highest</hi> manner Metaphorical and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. For, since we can no other wise name or <hi>speak</hi> of a thing but as we <hi>Conceive</hi> it, and all our Conceptions are Notions taken from <hi>Natural</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and onely said of <hi>them</hi> with Propriety; and no otherwise said of <hi>Created Spirits</hi> but onely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically; and that <hi>God's</hi> Infinite Perfections do far more excel <hi>Created Spirits,</hi> than those Spirits do <hi>Bodies</hi>; it follows that all the Names and Words we can make use of to speak of the Divine Nature and its Attributes, are in the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> manner Metaphorical and Improper: as may be farther shewn in Metaphysicks.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Word <hi>Ens,</hi> as apply'd to <hi>Substantial</hi> and <hi>Accidental</hi> Notions is of the <hi>former</hi> sort of Equivocal words, and <hi>Analogically</hi> spoken of them; that is, <hi>first</hi> and <hi>properly,</hi> of Substance; and <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily or Improperly</hi> of Accidents. For, since (as was shewn above) <hi>Ens</hi> signifies <hi>Capable of being,</hi> and none of the Accidents is <hi>of itself</hi> Capable of Being, but onely comes to have some Title to Existence by the <hi>Substance,</hi> from whose Being they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely all the Being they have, and that <hi>Its</hi> being: it follows that the word <hi>Ens</hi> must be <hi>Analogically</hi> said of them; that is, Properly of Substance, and Improperly of Accidents.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Since it appears, from what is said hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that the Equivocation of words is most highly Prejudicial to Science, it is one necessary part of of the <hi>Method</hi> to <hi>Science</hi> to detect the Snares it lays in the way of our Discourse, that we may avoid them. And this may be done.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62043:91"/>14. First, by observing the <hi>Explication</hi> we make of the Word that is apply'd to different Notions, that so we may know which is the <hi>proper</hi> Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. For, by doing this we shall certainly find that the <hi>less proper</hi> Notion, when the word is explicated, will still include the Notion of the <hi>Proper</hi> one, and bear up to it. As if we would Explicate the word <hi>Strong</hi> as 'tis spoken of Ale or Wine, we shall be forced to say (if we be put to express our selves Literally, and tell what it means) that as he is call'd a <hi>Strong Man,</hi> who is able to overthrow his Enemy, so we call Wine or Beer <hi>Strong</hi> when it is able to overpower our Brain. Or, if we call a man <hi>Hard-hearted,</hi> it would be explicated thus, that his Humour is as <hi>Hard</hi> and <hi>Inflexible,</hi> considering the Temper of a Rational Creature which ought to be mov'd by Reason, as <hi>Hard</hi> things, which are very difficult to bend, are among Natural Bodies; for which reason they sometimes call such men [<hi>Stony-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>] or [<hi>Iron-hearted</hi>]; in both which we see that [<hi>Strength</hi>] is properly in <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Hardness</hi> in such Bodies as <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Iron,</hi> and improperly in <hi>Wine</hi> or the <hi>Heart.</hi> And the same may be observ'd in the word [<hi>Pilot</hi>] apply'd to a <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>; in [<hi>Moved</hi>] apply'd to <hi>God</hi>; in [<hi>Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>] to Meat or Urine. Thus the word [<hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Honour, Worship</hi> or <hi>Respect</hi>] is first and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehended as belonging or Due to <hi>God,</hi> the sole End and Author of <hi>all</hi> Religion, and Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically or Improperly to <hi>Holy Persons,</hi> either on Earth or in Heaven, as his Servants; and to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Books, Pictures,</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> as either Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, Exciting, Increasing or Belonging to the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62043:92"/>
                  <hi>Religious Honour</hi> due properly to <hi>Him</hi> Alone. Whence <hi>Religious Honour</hi> given to any other things cannot be Explicated, but in Reference to <hi>God,</hi> the only proper Object of Religion; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be found Included in the Explication of that Religious Honour which is given to any thing else. And yet what Endless Squabbles, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests and Animosities has this one Equivocation produced, while Passionate or Ignorant men will needs take the word [<hi>Religious</hi>] when spoken of those Different things, to be <hi>Vnivocal,</hi> which is most clearly <hi>Analogical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. The next way is, to observe the Notions any way Connected in our Common Speech with that Word whose Equivocalness we doubt of; that is, to consider the Causes, Effects, Antecedents, Consequents, Contraries, its Superiour and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Notions, its Circumstances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For, if some or any of these do <hi>not</hi> agree to the Meaning of any Word when spoken of <hi>more</hi> things, or found in diverse Contexts, then we may be sure 'tis spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>diverse Senses,</hi> and is Equivocal; and then, by the foregoing Rule we may certainly come to know its proper Signification. So, in the Notion of <hi>Religious Honour</hi> apply'd to <hi>God</hi> as properly due to him, and Adoration of him, the chief part of which is an humble Acknowledgment of him to be our Creator, Redeemer, Sanctifier, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord of Heaven and Earth, the Searcher of Hearts, and Judge of all our Actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> none of these are possible to be Connected, or Agree to any of the other Improperly called Objects of Religious Worship: So, when we stile any Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Person for Learning [<hi>a Great Man</hi>] we shall
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62043:92"/>
easily find it is Equivocal and Improper, because <hi>Greatness</hi> means, in Proper Speech, <hi>much of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> and has that Common Head for its <hi>Genus</hi>; whereas a <hi>very Little</hi> Man in Quantity may be <hi>Great</hi> in the sence in which we meant it.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The Third way is, to attend to what True <hi>Science</hi> or Faith teach us. For, since one Truth cannot contradict another, therefore we may be assur'd, that, in case we be Certain that what the Writer meant is <hi>True,</hi> his Words must be taken in that sence which is Agreeable to <hi>True Science,</hi> or Faith. Hence, when it is said that <hi>God made two Great Lights,</hi> the Sun and the Moon, it being Evident by <hi>Science,</hi> that <hi>Other</hi> Stars are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably Greater than the Moon, hence the words [<hi>Great Lights</hi>] in that place, cannot be meant of Great <hi>in it self,</hi> but as to their <hi>Appearance to us.</hi> But, care is to be taken that we have <hi>true Science</hi> of the thing exprest by such words, and that the Subject be not such as exceeds our pitch of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The <hi>Context</hi> may help much to give us the right Notion of the Words; especially when the <hi>Literal</hi> Truth is aim'd at, <hi>Axioms</hi> and evident <hi>Principles</hi> are laid, and the Discourse is perfectly <hi>Connected</hi> or Coherent. For, in that case the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry found in the parts of the whole Discourse forbids any word to be taken in a <hi>wrong</hi> significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as we experience in Mathematicks and other Close Discourses.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The <hi>Intention</hi> of the Author, and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> of the Book, avail much to direct us to the right sense of those words in it which are most Material and Significant. For, the Notions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62043:93"/>
meant by such words are as it were the <hi>steps</hi> which lye level all the way, and lead to the End at which the Author aim'd them; and, therefore, cannot easily permit a Deviation from their true Sence, or suffer their Meaning to be mistaken.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The Words in which <hi>Laws</hi> are conceiv'd are best interpreted by the <hi>Common Practice</hi> of those who are subject to those Laws. For, since those Laws are the <hi>Causes</hi> of the Common Practice, and the Common Practice is the <hi>Effect</hi> of those Laws, hence the <hi>sence</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> is demonstrated by the Common Practice <hi>a posteriori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. But the very best and most assured way to detect and avoid Equivocation in all words what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is to observe and examin, whether <hi>the same Definition</hi> agrees to the word as found in diverse places: For, since the <hi>Definition</hi> consists of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate <hi>Genus,</hi> and its Intrinsecal or Proper Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, it must needs give us the <hi>precise Notion</hi> or Meaning of the Word; since, if it be either under any Other <hi>Genus,</hi> or constituted by any Other <hi>Differences,</hi> the Essence which they constitute must needs be a <hi>different Essence</hi>; and, therefore, the Word which signifies it, must necessarily have <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meaning</hi> or <hi>Notion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> V. Words being invented to express <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Meaning,</hi> it follows, that those Words that have <hi>many</hi> Senses, and all of them <hi>True</hi> and coherent to one another, have the highest perfection that Words can possibly have. Wherefore those passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Holy Scripture that bear both a <hi>Literal, Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pological</hi> (or Moral) <hi>Analogical</hi> and <hi>Anagogical sence</hi> (or several of them) are of a more sublime nature than other Words are, and argue, that they were endited by a Divine Author.</p>

HAving treated of <hi>Notions,</hi> and of their Clear <hi>Distinction</hi> and <hi>Expression,</hi> to that degree as may be sufficient for <hi>Science,</hi> it follows of course that we treat next of <hi>Cognition,</hi> or the putting together of Notions; and this not joyning them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on any fashion, by rote as it were, in our <hi>Memory,</hi> as a School-boy gets a Latin Sentence without book, the meaning of whose words he understands and revolves in his Mind, but regards
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62043:94"/>
not whether it be <hi>True</hi> or <hi>no</hi>; nor yet, the putting them together according to Grammatical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, as is this Sentence, [<hi>Virtue and Vice are both equally Laudable</hi>] in which the <hi>Words</hi> do Cohere indeed according to Grammar Rules, but the <hi>Sence</hi> is False, and Incoherent: But (as the word [<hi>Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>] imports) it must be the Connecting or Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them together, in order to <hi>Knowledge</hi>; that is, with an Application of our Knowing Power to see whether they ought to be thus put together or no; or, (which is the same) whether the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be <hi>True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherefore, since we cannot <hi>know</hi> any thing to <hi>be so,</hi> but what <hi>is truly so,</hi> it follows, that all Knowledge must be of some <hi>Verity</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi>; and this not of a Truth which is <hi>materially such,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in our Mind, (for this amounts to no more but a Complex <hi>Notion</hi> or Apprehension) but to make up the Notion of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> we must <hi>see</hi> the Notions of which that Truth does <hi>Formally</hi> consist, to be <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> Connected. As, when we say [<hi>A Stone is Hard</hi>] we must <hi>see</hi> that what's meant by [<hi>Stone</hi>] and by [<hi>Hard</hi>] are some way or other Connected in the <hi>Thing</hi>; or, otherwise (all <hi>Truths</hi> being taken from the things) we cannot be said to <hi>Know</hi> it to be <hi>True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Judging,</hi> in proper speech is not meerly and precisely the <hi>Seeing</hi> or <hi>Knowing</hi> that the Notions are Connected, but the <hi>Saying Interiourly</hi> or <hi>Assenting</hi> heartily that they <hi>are so.</hi> Otherwise, since nothing can be <hi>Known to be so,</hi> but what <hi>is so,</hi> it would follow that there would be no <hi>False Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>Judging</hi> adds to the meer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that it is the subduing of all
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62043:94"/>
Hesitation, or the <hi>Fixure</hi> of our Intellective Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty about the Verity or Falsity of any thing. Whence <hi>Judging</hi> is the <hi>Effect</hi> immediately and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily resulting from our <hi>Knowledge</hi> that the Notions are really Connected, when 'tis a <hi>True Iudgment</hi>; or else from our only <hi>Conceiting</hi> them to be Connected, when the Judgment is <hi>False.</hi> Whence, this is a right consequence, I <hi>see</hi> or know the Notions cohere, therefore I judge the Saying or Sentence that signifies they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected to be <hi>True</hi>; which is the Method that all Rational or Judicious men take: Whereas Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or Ignorant men, who are blindly addicted to their own Sentiment, take the Contrary way; and will have the Notions to <hi>cohere,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to be <hi>True,</hi> because they had prejudg'd it so upon some other Motive than the <hi>seeing</hi> that the Terms themselves were indeed connected.</p>
               <p>It will be objected, that Knowledge also <hi>fixes</hi> our Understanding; and, therefore, Knowing is Judging. I answer, That to <hi>fix</hi> the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so as to acquiesce to what it sees, is to make it <hi>Judge</hi>; but the Notion of <hi>Knowing</hi> is compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bare <hi>Seeing</hi> the Terms Connected, and is terminated in regarding the Object or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that is Known: But <hi>Judging</hi> superadds to it, that it is moreover the yielding to reject all farther disquisition, and <hi>adhering firmly</hi> to that Knowledge; which (tho' the distinction between them be nice and delicate) is <hi>another</hi> Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion superadded to meer <hi>Knowing,</hi> and sinks and rivets the Object more deeply and unremovably in the Soul. Lastly, the Intuitive <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Pure Spirits is True <hi>Knowledge</hi>; but it is not made by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62043:95"/>
our way of <hi>Judging,</hi> in regard they neither Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract, nor Compound or Divide Notions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence is seen that to make <hi>Judgments</hi> of things out of True Knowledge, is the Greatest Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Perfection our Soul is capable of. For, since nothing can be <hi>Known</hi> to be so but what <hi>is so,</hi> or <hi>True</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all Judgments resulting from True Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not onely fill our Mind with <hi>Truths,</hi> but are, moreoever, a Firm Adhesion to Truths and the Secure Possession of those incomparable Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are the Best Perfections of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and make us like the <hi>God of Truth.</hi> Nor ends the Advantage we gain by Truth in meer <hi>Speculation</hi>; but, <hi>Truth</hi> excluding from its notion <hi>all Possible Errour,</hi> it makes it Impossible we should ever embrace any Errour while we thus Judge. Which, since <hi>Omnis peccans ignorat,</hi> and that every Sinner (as the Proverb is) <hi>has his blind side</hi>; must therefore, if Truth be <hi>Express</hi> in our Understanding, and <hi>kept awake</hi> there, Preserve such a mind from Sin; and by making right and Lively Judgments of our Present and Future State, and of our several Duties here, most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bring us to Eternal Happiness hereafter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That <hi>Speech</hi> that Connects Notions in order to Knowledge, or Expresses a Judgment, is call'd a <hi>Proposition</hi>; that is, such a Speech as proposes the Notions, and puts them into such a Frame or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of Connexion, as best serves for us to Judge whether they are <hi>really</hi> Connected or no. Whence it must consist of <hi>three</hi> parts, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>which</hi> is Affirm'd or Deny'd of another, which in an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial term we call <hi>Predicated,</hi> and that notion the <hi>Predicate.</hi> That <hi>of which</hi> 'tis Affirm'd or Deny'd,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62043:95"/>
call'd the <hi>Subject</hi>: and that Notion which <hi>signifies</hi> their Connexion, call'd the <hi>Copula.</hi> The two first are also call'd the <hi>Terms</hi> or <hi>Extremes</hi> of a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whence all <hi>Truth</hi> is said to consist in the <hi>Connexion of the Terms</hi>; and, if the Terms be not found to <hi>cohere,</hi> the Proposition is justly held to be <hi>False.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Since Propositions may be both in the <hi>Mind</hi> and in <hi>Words,</hi> and the <hi>Meanings</hi> of the Words are the same with our <hi>Notions</hi>; it follows hence (so the words be not Equivocal) that <hi>Mental</hi> and <hi>Verbal</hi> Propositions are the same thing; so that it is, in reality, all one to treat them under either of these Considerations. Therefore, in regard we must use <hi>Words</hi> in our Discourses concerning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and many times Artificial ones, we shall treat of them indifferently as taken in <hi>either</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and sometimes use the Word [<hi>Judgments</hi>] sometimes [<hi>Propositions</hi>] as it lights. Only let it be remember'd, that Judgments are onely in the Mind <hi>Formally</hi> and <hi>Truly</hi>: and in <hi>Verbal</hi> Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, only as in <hi>Signs</hi> of the <hi>Mental</hi> ones. Tho' even taking them as in our Understanding, they have, even <hi>there,</hi> their <hi>Subject, Copula</hi> and <hi>Predicate,</hi> as well as when they are Pronounced, or Writ in <hi>Words.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> I. Hence is deduc't, that the rude Vulgar, nay, even Children who cannot Speak or Discourse, may have <hi>Mental</hi> Propositions, and Consequently what answers to <hi>Subject, Copula</hi> and <hi>Predicate</hi> in their Understandings; tho' they cannot Reflect or Distinguish them, and (as it were) dissect and Anatomize their own Thoughts and Inward Acts,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62043:96"/>
as do <hi>Men of Art.</hi> For Example, when a Clown Knows or Judges that there is such a place as <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> or a Child that what it sees <hi>is Milk</hi>; they have in their Minds the <hi>True,</hi> tho <hi>Rough,</hi> draught of these two Propositions, [<hi>London is Existent</hi>] and [<hi>this is Milk</hi>] and, consequently, of what corresponded to the several parts of those Propositions, after a <hi>Natural</hi> manner; tho they cannot yet lick their rude Embryo Judgments into Form, or bring them to a perfect shape, by distinguishing in them these several parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> II. Hence also, tho' we cannot know the precise time in which Children begin to judge, yet we may be assured it must be as soon as they have <hi>Cognition</hi> or Knowledge of Common and Familiar Objects, and of their Agreeableness to their own Nature. And, first of all, of that which is <hi>next</hi> to them and <hi>most</hi> Knowable, <hi>Viz.</hi> that <hi>themselves exist</hi>; as will be seen hereafter. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Judgments</hi> are the Immediate <hi>Effects</hi> result<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Knowledge</hi>; and, therefore, as soon as they <hi>know</hi> any object is Agreeable or disagreeable to them, or that it <hi>Exists,</hi> they cannot but <hi>Judge</hi> so after their dull fashion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To proceed. As the Metaphysical Verity (of which onely our Notions are capable) is tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the <hi>Things,</hi> and Consists in <hi>their being</hi> truly <hi>what they are</hi>: so the <hi>Formal</hi> Verity of our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments must be also taken from the <hi>Thing's being such as we Iudge it to be</hi>; Whence Truth is by some defin'd to the <hi>Conformity of the understanding to the Thing,</hi> wherefore, when we affirm the Thing to be <hi>This</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:62043:96"/>
or <hi>That,</hi> or to be <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such,</hi> the true Meaning of that Affirmation is, that what corresponds to both those Notions of the Subject and Predicate is found or <hi>exists</hi> in the same <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Being</hi>; and, were not this so, it would be <hi>False</hi> to affirm that <hi>one</hi> of them <hi>is</hi> the <hi>other.</hi>

Wherefore the meaning of the word [<hi>is</hi>] which is the <hi>Copula,</hi> is this, that those Words are Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally Connected in the <hi>same Thing</hi> and Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with it Materially; however those Notions themselves be Formally Different, provided they be not Incompossible; for then the Proposition must, for the reason now given, be necessarily <hi>False.</hi> As when we say [<hi>a Stone is Hard</hi>] the Truth of that Proposition consists in this, that the Nature of [<hi>hard</hi>] is found in that Thing or <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum</hi> call'd a <hi>Stone,</hi> and is in part Identify'd with it; however the Notions of <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Hard</hi> be Formally Distinct.

               <p n="8">8. The Copula [<hi>is</hi>] has alwayes the sense now given, except when we are to Speak of <hi>Nothings</hi> which (the adequate Object of our understanding being <hi>Ens</hi>) we are forc'd to apprehend as <hi>Things,</hi> even when at the same time we Judge them to be <hi>otherwise.</hi> As when we say [<hi>Imaginary Species a Chimera</hi>] and yet, even then, it expresses a kind of Identity of the <hi>two Nothings,</hi> and affirms them to be the <hi>same Nonsense,</hi> and that to put a <hi>Space</hi> or Quantity to be <hi>no</hi> Quantity: or to put a <hi>Non-Ens</hi> to be <hi>Ens</hi> is Contradictory and ridiculous. And, indeed, these kind of Propositions are in effect no more than to say, that <hi>Non-Ens, Non est Ens,</hi>

or, What is not Capable of Being cannot be.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Copula [is] is the most proper to give us a Clear Intellectual Light; and, by consequence to fix our Judgment. First, because the Notion of <hi>is,</hi> or Actual Being, is impossible to admit any Explication (and therefore 'tis self-known) as any one may evidently experience, if he goes about to <hi>Explain</hi> it; for he will find that he must be forc'd to put <hi>is,</hi> or some word that imports Actual Being in its Explication; which makes the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be none, but leaves it as obscure as it was before; nay, <hi>more</hi> Obscure than formerly by adding other Notions more Obscure than it self was. For example, Ask what it is to <hi>be</hi> or Exist, all that can be said of it is, that 'tis <hi>Esse extra Causas</hi>; where (<hi>Esse</hi> being the same with <hi>Existere</hi>) we vainly endeavour to explicate the <hi>same thing</hi> by <hi>its self</hi>; and to make it look like an Explication, we add <hi>extra Causas,</hi> which two Notions are <hi>less</hi> Clear than <hi>Esse it self</hi> was. 2dly, The Notion of [is] is most <hi>Determinate</hi> of its own nature, and so most <hi>Fixt</hi> of it's self; and, therefore, most proper to <hi>fix</hi> the Judgment. 3dly, Because all other Notions having some Potentiality and Indifferency in them, are (as it were) wavering between two or more Notions; call'd Differences. Whereas the Notion of [<hi>is</hi>] having none, is only Absolutely <hi>Steady,</hi> Immoveable or Undeterminable to any other Notion. Lastly, Because hence, in Literal, and not Figurative, Speeches, the word that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses this Notion, can never be <hi>Equivocal,</hi> since 'tis impossible to distnguish it into this or that sence; all <hi>Distnguishing</hi> or <hi>Differencing</hi> Notions being evidently <hi>more Formal,</hi> Actual and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62043:97"/>
than the Notion <hi>to be Distinguisht:</hi> which is in this case, Impossible.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To proceed: There being (as was said) a Real Relation between those Notions which are the Subject and Predicate, the later being really in the understanding as That <hi>which is said</hi> of the Former, and the Former that of <hi>which 'tis said</hi>; and Relation being necessarily compleated and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such, by the Act of a <hi>Comparing Power</hi>; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that every Judgment is a <hi>Referring</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring</hi> one of those Notions to the other, and (by means of the <hi>Copula</hi>) of <hi>both</hi> of them to the same Stock of <hi>Being</hi> on which they are engrafted, or the same <hi>Ens</hi>; where they are Entitatively Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected (or the same Materially) before they are <hi>Seen</hi> or <hi>Judg'd</hi> to be so by our understanding.</p>

In Whole, as when we say <hi>Petreitas est Petreitas, Quantitas est Divisibilitas</hi>; In part, as, when we say, <hi>Petreitas est Humanitas</hi> or <hi>Animalitas</hi>; for then <hi>Humanitas</hi> and <hi>Animalitas</hi> are as Essential to <hi>Petreitas,</hi> and <hi>Petreitas</hi> as much <hi>includes</hi> and <hi>is</hi> the Subject of their Notions and of its own Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernces

The <hi>Self-Evidence</hi> belonging to First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples consists in this, that the two Terms must be <hi>Formally Identical.</hi> For, since (as was shewn above) the Terms in every Ordinary and Inferior Proposition, nay, in every Conclusion that is <hi>True,</hi> must be <hi>materially</hi> the same, and so the Proposition it self <hi>materially Identical,</hi> it follows, that the

                  </gap>s meant by <hi>Self-Existence,</hi> is a most infinitely <hi>Pure Actuality</hi>; it follows, that this proposition [<hi>Self-Existence is Self-Existence</hi>] is, <hi>of its self,</hi> the <hi>most supremely Self-evident Proposition</hi> that can be Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This Proposition [<hi>what is is</hi>] or [<hi>Existence is Existence</hi>] is the most Self-evident Proposition that can be imagin'd to be taken from <hi>Created</hi> things. For, since <hi>Existence</hi> is the most Evident Notion that can be found amongst all our Notions that can be had from Creatures, that Proposition must needs be the most Evident, (and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, amongst Self-evident ones, the <hi>most Self-evident</hi>)
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62043:104"/>
in which not only the Notion of the <hi>Copula,</hi> but of the <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Predicate</hi> too, is <hi>Existence.</hi> Again, since the Clearness of all Truths whatever depends on the Connexion of the Terms by the word [<hi>is</hi>] it follows, that unless the Nature or Notion of <hi>Existence</hi> be first immovably Fix'd or Establish'd, to be Coherent with its self, that is, unless this Proposition <hi>What is is,</hi> or <hi>Existence is Existence,</hi> be Self-evident, no Proposition whatever could be Absolutely Certain, Clear, or Coherent; and so, there would be no <hi>possibility</hi> of any Truth, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, or Evidence in the World. Lastly, since both the <hi>Essences</hi> of things, and the <hi>Existence</hi> they have are in the Divine Understanding, and the Essences which are only <hi>Capacities of Being,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to things as they are <hi>Limited,</hi> or <hi>apt</hi> to be <hi>Created,</hi> that is, belong to them according to the Notion of <hi>Creatures</hi>; which being only <hi>Potential</hi> as to <hi>Being,</hi> they can have no Claim thence to <hi>actual</hi> Being or Existence, but meerly by the Free Gift of Him who is Essential Being; hence the Nature of the Existence of Creatures, and their <hi>being such</hi> is taken purely from <hi>God</hi>'s side, and holds entirely of him. Whence it is <hi>most actual,</hi> and most <hi>Like him</hi>; that is, most defecated from all Alloy of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiality, most Pure, most Intelligibly Clear, and most Establish'd, above whatever else we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in Creatures; and therefore, <hi>It</hi> alone is able to give Certainty, Clear Light, and Establishment to all other Truths.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Equivalent to the Former, or perfectly Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with it, (abating the putting it in a diverse Logical Frame) is this Proposition, [<hi>Existence is not Non-Existence</hi>] or which is in effect the same,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62043:104"/>
[<hi>'Tis impossible the same thing should be and not be at once.</hi>] For, if the Notion of <hi>Existence</hi> and <hi>Non-Existence</hi> could at once belong to the same Subject, then, since the Notion of <hi>Existence,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most Simple and most Actual, can admit of no Distinction of being <hi>in part</hi> Existence, and <hi>in part</hi> Non-Existence; that is, of being in part such, in part not-such, as <hi>Potential</hi> Notions can; it would follow, that the <hi>entire</hi> and most simple Notion of <hi>Existence</hi> is <hi>Non-Existence</hi>; which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to this Principle now mentioned, and consequently, to the equivalent Proposition [<hi>What is is</hi>]; whence it would be unavoidably conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that all we could say must necessarily be <hi>False,</hi> because the <hi>Notion</hi> of Existence, by which only we can <hi>affirm</hi> or <hi>say,</hi> would involve a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in its own Bowels, as being Indifferent to <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>not Being,</hi> or rather as being <hi>both</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That the same may be said, in some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, (that is, as to the Extent of their own <hi>Notion</hi>) of all Propositions that are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to First Principles in any <hi>particular</hi> Subjects; as of <hi>Homo est homo, Aequale est aequale sibi, &amp;c.</hi> to which are equivalent <hi>Homo non est non homo, Aequale non est non aequale sibi, &amp;c.</hi> For, the same Inconveniences would follow in all Discourses upon those particular Subjects, as did in <hi>all</hi> Discourses <hi>whatever,</hi> by wronging the former Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Universal Propositions; that is, <hi>all</hi> that could be said of such Subjects would be Incoherent, Contradictory and <hi>False.</hi>

               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:62043:105"/>9. The next Self-evident Proposition is that of <hi>(Ens is Ens.)</hi> For, since the notion of <hi>Ens</hi> is most <hi>nearly</hi> ally'd to Existence, being wholly order'd to it, and a <hi>Capacity</hi> of it, it follows, that that Proposition which predicates <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Ens,</hi> is the next, in Self-Evidence, to those which predicate <hi>Existence</hi> of <hi>Existence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Hence all propositions consisting of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Notions</hi> that subsume under <hi>Ens,</hi> that is, such propositions which affirm that particular <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> to be <hi>what it is,</hi> are likewise Self-evident: For, since <hi>Ens,</hi> taken as Undistinguish'd, or in its whole Latitude, has the force of an <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,</hi> and is equivalent to <hi>all</hi>; and an <hi>Vniversal</hi> engages <hi>every</hi> particular under it, of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists; so that if the terms expressing those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars be not Self-coherent and Self-evident, it would follow, that neither would the terms of this proposition [<hi>Ens</hi> is <hi>Ens</hi>] be such: Hence all propositions consisting of <hi>particular Notions,</hi> that subsume directly under <hi>Ens,</hi> must be likewise Self-evident. Again, since the proposition (<hi>Ens is Ens</hi>) is for no other reason Self-evident, but because the <hi>Notions</hi> of the two terms are every way <hi>formally Identical</hi>; and this reason is found in those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, the notions of whose terms <hi>subsume</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Ens</hi>; it follows, that <hi>these</hi> also must, for the same reason, be likewise Self-evident.</p>

Hence <hi>Homo est Homo, Quantitas est Quantitas, &amp;c.</hi> being Self-evident, are the <hi>First Principles</hi> to all Discourses treating about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Quantity</hi>; that is, they are the <hi>last</hi> and most <hi>Clear</hi> propositions in that Matter or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

into which all that can be said of <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Quantity</hi> is finally resolv'd; and, moreover, the <hi>Test</hi> of the Truth or Falshood of all that can be said of them. So that if any part of those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses do hap to violate those Principles, that is, if it deviates from those Natures, or does, by consequence, make Man <hi>not to be</hi> Man, or Quantity <hi>not to be</hi> Quantity, 'tis most evidently convicted of <hi>Falsity:</hi> As, on the other side, if those Discourses do proceed <hi>Agreeably</hi> to these Principles, it must most certainly and evidently be <hi>True.</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62043:106"/>
the Existence of a <hi>Deity.</hi> For, since not only our Simple Notions or Apprehensions are taken from the Things, but also all Connexions of those No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Propositions are therefore <hi>True,</hi> because what's meant by the two Terms exists in the <hi>same Thing</hi>; so that neither this Proposition [<hi>A Stone is hard</hi>] could be True, unless what's meant by <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Hard</hi> were found in the same Entity; nor even could this Self-evident Proposition (<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo est Homo</hi>) be True, unless there were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or <hi>such</hi> a thing as, by being Fix'd in its determinate Nature, or by being <hi>the same with it self,</hi> had thence a power to <hi>verifie</hi> it; it follows, that neither could this Self-evident Proposition [<hi>Self-existence is Self-existence</hi>] be True, unless there were some <hi>most Actual Being,</hi> which, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most perfectly the same with it self, did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie that Proposition.

               <p>It may be reply'd, That we can <hi>compound</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and joyn <hi>Self</hi> to <hi>Existence</hi>; which done, this Compound Notion, having such a nature in our Understanding, has, consequently, a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Nature or Actual Being in our <hi>Mind only,</hi> and thence a kind of Metaphysical Unity or Verity <hi>there,</hi> which gives it to be predicated of it self; so that there is no necessity that such a Thing should be put to be <hi>in re</hi> to verifie it. 'Tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, That our Argument is not grounded <hi>meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> upon our having such a Notion; for we do not argue as <hi>Cartesius</hi> does, upon the <hi>Notion</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> of such a Subject; but we grant, that we may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound such a one, and yet remain <hi>Vncertain</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62043:106"/>
that Nature <hi>be</hi> or <hi>not</hi>; but our Argument proceeds <hi>also,</hi> and <hi>chiefly,</hi> upon our <hi>Verifying</hi> that Proposition, which is done <hi>formally</hi> by the <hi>Copula</hi>; and I affirm, that the Copula [<hi>is</hi>] could not <hi>verifie</hi> it, unless there were something <hi>out of the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> that oblig'd us to do so; which I explain thus: This Copula sometimes meerly puts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fictitious Notions,</hi> or <hi>Non-Entities,</hi> which (all Truth being grounded on <hi>Ens</hi> or the <hi>Thing</hi>) have consequently direct <hi>Opposition</hi> to Being, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Falsity</hi> in their very Natures, or rather No-natures; as, when we say [<hi>Imaginary Space is a Chimaera</hi>], for then, indeed, the Connexion is meerly in our <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> there being no <hi>Thing,</hi> nor any Terms, which have an <hi>Entitative Notion</hi> to be Connected or Verify'd: or rather indeed there was <hi>no</hi> Connexion <hi>at all</hi>; but, as the Terms were <hi>Mock-things,</hi> so they could only have a <hi>Mock-Connexion.</hi> In all other Cases, since the Copula [<hi>is</hi>] cannot signifie <hi>nothing at all,</hi> (for this would make it a meer <hi>Sound</hi> and no <hi>Word</hi>) it can only signifie the <hi>Actual Existence</hi> or <hi>Co-existence</hi> of what's meant by the Terms, in the <hi>same Thing</hi>; and this (as was <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>S.</hi> 7, &amp; 11.</note> said) whether that Co-existence be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Material or Formal. And, should it be deny'd that the Copula [<hi>is</hi>] has this signification, we can never know any thing which we say, or can say, is <hi>true</hi>; because we can never <hi>know,</hi> nor <hi>see,</hi> that the Notions are Agreeable or <hi>Conformable to the Thing.</hi> Since then the notion of <hi>Self-existence</hi> is so far from having <hi>Non-existence</hi> in its Notion (as the others had <hi>Non-ens</hi>) that it is the most perfect in that kind that can be imagin'd; the 'foresaid Proposition could not be <hi>true,</hi> unless there were
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62043:107"/>
                  <hi>actually</hi> something that has, in that Supreme Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Metaphysical <hi>Verity</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> in it self, to <hi>verifie</hi> it. In the same manner as [<hi>Homo est homo</hi>] could never have been True, had there not been Something which had such a Metaphysical Unity and Verity in its self, as grounded that Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that the Objecter must either find more significations and uses of the word [<hi>is</hi>] than we have assign'd (which is impossible) or alledge, that the Notion of Self-existence is <hi>Chimerical,</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of Existence, as <hi>Non-Ens</hi> is of <hi>Ens,</hi> which is as absurd as the other; or, he must be <hi>forced</hi> to grant our Conclusion, and acknowledge our Argument to be a true Logical Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I know it will run in the Objecter's Fancy, that we can connect Notions which our selves have coin'd; but he may easily correct these Miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, by reflecting, that this Proposition is <hi>True</hi>; and that Truth must not be grounded on our Aiery Fancies, but on the solid Nature of the <hi>Thing</hi> to which it is a <hi>Conformity.</hi> I know too he will fancy that the Copula [<hi>is</hi>] has an Office of <hi>meerly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting</hi> without any reference to the <hi>Existence</hi> of the Thing which is its proper signification; but he may see the Folly of such a Conceit, if he but consider that we cannot <hi>with truth</hi> conjoyn Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our <hi>Minds</hi> that are not Conjoyn'd before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in the <hi>Thing</hi>; and that when the Notions are of some <hi>Positive Being,</hi> or such as are not Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical and Contradictory, the Copula [<hi>is</hi>] must signifie <hi>Exists,</hi> and does but say <hi>in our Mind</hi> what <hi>is in the thing,</hi> if the Saying be <hi>true.</hi> Also, that that <hi>Copula</hi> cannot divest it self of <hi>all sence</hi> while
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62043:107"/>
it conjoyns such Terms; and he will do more than Miracle to invent any other for it but that of <hi>Exists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may yet be further Objected, that these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions (<hi>Rosa est Rosa, Animal est Animal</hi>) and such-like, are still <hi>True,</hi> tho' their Subjects do not <hi>actually Exist</hi> when we thus Predicate of them; and that therefore it is not necessary the Copula (<hi>est</hi>) should always signifie <hi>Existence,</hi> even tho' the Notions of the Terms be <hi>Positive Entities.</hi> 'Tis answer'd, that either the Subjects (<hi>Rosa</hi>) and (<hi>Animal</hi>) mean the <hi>Individuals</hi> of those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and then, if once they are perish'd, the Propositions are <hi>False</hi>; for <hi>haec Rosa</hi> is no longer <hi>Rosa,</hi> nor is <hi>hoc Animal Animal,</hi> when they are corrupted or turn'd into another thing. Or else these words mean the <hi>Abstracted Notions</hi> of <hi>Rosa</hi> and <hi>Animal</hi>; and then, since Abstracted Natures, or <hi>Vniversals,</hi> do (as such) no where exist but in <hi>the Vnderstanding,</hi> they have their Actual Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence where they <hi>ought</hi> to have it; and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula [<hi>est</hi>] signifies they have their Existence <hi>there</hi>; and so the Proposition is <hi>True.</hi> And it is to be farther noted, that they could not have been even <hi>there,</hi> unless there had <hi>actually been</hi> diverse Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals from which they might be Abstracted. But now, in our Case, it is quite otherwise; for <hi>Self-existence</hi> being the <hi>simplest</hi> Notion that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, nay, <hi>more Actual</hi> than any Notion of <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence</hi> found in Creatures, it is Impossible there should be any <hi>abstracted</hi> notion of it; both because that Abstracted Notion would have <hi>Potentiality</hi> in it, which would destroy that Notion, and make it Chimerical and Self-Contradictory; as also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62043:108"/>
(as Metaphysicks demonstrate) <hi>Self-Existence</hi> is Unlimited or Infinit in Existence, and so, can be but <hi>One.</hi> Wherefore the Copula (<hi>est</hi>) does not <hi>meerly Conjoyn</hi> such Positive Notions, but always signifies <hi>Existence,</hi> when the Notions it connects are not <hi>Chimerical</hi> or <hi>Opposit</hi> to Existence, as <hi>Non-Ens</hi> is to <hi>Ens</hi>; and consequently, if this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [<hi>Self-existence is Self-existence</hi>] be <hi>True,</hi> there must Actually <hi>be,</hi> and this <hi>out of our Vnderstanding,</hi> some Being that verifies it, which can be nothing but the <hi>Deity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be ask'd, What is to be said of these Propositions, such a Thing is <hi>Possible</hi> or <hi>Future.</hi> 'Tis answer'd, the word [<hi>Possible</hi>] signifies <hi>possible to be,</hi> or <hi>capable of Being,</hi> which is the very notion of <hi>Ens</hi>; and so, it means that such a Possible thing is an <hi>Ens</hi>; and then it might be true, could we Frame such a Proposition of a thing <hi>meerly possible,</hi> which is Impossible; for, if the thing be only [<hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be</hi>] it <hi>never was</hi>; and so (all our Notions being taken from the <hi>Thing</hi>) we could have <hi>no Notion</hi> of it; and therefore the Proposition would be <hi>none,</hi> since we want that Notion that makes the <hi>Subject.</hi> The Proposition [such a thing is <hi>Future</hi>] is in rigor <hi>False,</hi> (for that which <hi>is not at all,</hi> can have nothing predicated of it) and it can only be <hi>True,</hi> as it signifies that there are <hi>determinate Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> laid to <hi>produce</hi> it: which is to say, <hi>those Causes are,</hi> and so the Copula [<hi>est</hi>] still signifies <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. To settle this main point, that <hi>First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> must be such Propositions as are <hi>most formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Identical,</hi> in the manner declared above, many
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62043:108"/>
other Proofs may be alledged; as, that Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the <hi>First</hi> of <hi>Falshoods</hi>; therefore those Propositions that are directly <hi>Opposit</hi> to them must be the <hi>First Truths</hi> or <hi>First Principles:</hi> But only Propositions thus perfectly Identical are directly Opposit to Contradictions; Therefore <hi>these only</hi> are the First Truths or <hi>First Principles.</hi> To prove the <hi>Minor,</hi> we shall find by reflexion, that the two Contradictory propositions are comprizable into one which is equivalent to both; as to (<hi>Peter here and now runs, Peter here and now runs not</hi>) is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent (<hi>what here and now runs, does not here and now run</hi>). Whence is seen clearly, that only <hi>such</hi> Identical propositions are directly opposit to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions; since Man's Wit cannot invent a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position directly Opposit to (<hi>what runs runs not</hi>) but (<hi>what runs runs</hi>) which is perfectly Identical.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62043:113"/>
                  <hi>Body</hi> and a <hi>Spirit,</hi> is this only, that <hi>That</hi> is Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>This</hi> Indivisible, as also, that Quantity and Divisibility into Integral parts are (with them) the <hi>same</hi> Notion; it will appear Eyidently, that, according to them, this Proposition [<hi>Body is Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative</hi>] is perfectly equivalent to this [<hi>What's Divisible is Divisible</hi>] which is every way Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. I say, <hi>with them,</hi> for they deny all Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Divisibility of Body into <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</hi>
                  </note> by denying all Formal Mutation. The same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course holds, if they put for their First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple [<hi>Corpus est Extensum</hi>]; for, in that Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they hold that <hi>Extension</hi> is the Notion that Intrinsecally constitutes <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Matter,</hi> and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences it Essentially from <hi>Spirit.</hi> Whence the Proposition [<hi>Corpus est Extensum</hi>] is the same as [<hi>Ens Extensum est Ens Extensum,</hi> or <hi>Corpus est Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>] which are most Formally Identical.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the First Principle which grounds all Ratiocination in <hi>Logick</hi> is an Identical Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be shewn hereafter, Sect. 10. when we come to shew the <hi>Vse</hi> of First Principles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The First principle that grounds all <hi>Ethicks,</hi> or Morality, is, [<hi>A Will is a Will</hi>]. For, since all Morality (at least in its practice) consists in Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>for an End,</hi> and no man acts for an End but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it appears to him a Good, and therefore <hi>an appearing Good</hi> is the proper Object of that Active Power call'd the <hi>Will</hi>; and Powers are specified by their proper Objects, and have their Essences from them; it is as certain the Will cannot act when there <hi>appears</hi> to the Man <hi>no Good,</hi> and that it will act for what appears to him, taking him as thus Dispos'd, <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> a Good, as it is that <hi>A Will is a Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:62043:113"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> This takes away the <hi>Freedom</hi> of the Will, to tye it up to First Principles, or pretend that its Actions can be reduc'd to Rules of Science or Demonstration; for, this seems to hamper it, and lay a <hi>Necessity</hi> upon it, which destroys its <hi>Free</hi> Nature.</p>
               <p>I answer, that the Will has a Nature of <hi>its own,</hi> which it can no more forgo than <hi>Homo</hi> can not be <hi>Homo.</hi> Whenever then there is but <hi>one Appearing Good,</hi> the Will is <hi>not free</hi> in that circumstance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in such a Case its <hi>Essence</hi> is engag'd; and 'tis not in the power of the Will to chuse whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will be <hi>its self</hi> or no. In all other Cases where its Essence <hi>is not</hi> engag'd the Will is <hi>free,</hi> provided there be on the Object's side Variety enough for Choice: Yet, in the former Case, those Acts of the Will, tho' not <hi>free,</hi> are <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> because they are more according to what's Essential to it, or to its very Nature; and would, if the Will did not bear it self accordingly, make the <hi>Will</hi> to be <hi>no Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> I. Hence is seen, that the only solid way to perfect our Souls in <hi>Christian Morality</hi> or <hi>True Virtue,</hi> is by Wise Judgments or Frequentation of Devout Thoughts and Actions, to gain a Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Hearty Conceit of the Transcendent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Heavenly Goods, and of the Vileness of all Temporary Goods in comparison, since 'tis the very Nature of our <hi>Will</hi> to pursue that with her Interiour Acts which <hi>appears lively</hi> to be the Greater Good; that is, to be <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> a Good to him that wills.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:62043:114"/>4. Lastly, to omit others, the First Principles in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> are Identical. For example; At our first entrance into <hi>Euclid,</hi> we are met with those Famous and Useful Principles: <hi>Those things that are Equal to the same, are Equal to one another. If Equals be added to Equals, the Wholes are Equal. If Equals be taken away from Equals, the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are Equal. Those which are twice as big as the same, are Equals. Those which are Halfs of the same are Equals.</hi> All which are in effect but this Identical Proposition [<hi>Aequale est aequale sibi</hi>]; or else diverse Inferiour Identicals, subsuming under that Common one, as <hi>Homo est homo</hi> does under <hi>Ens est ens.</hi> For example, this Proposition [<hi>If Equals be added to Equals, the Wholes are Equal</hi>] is that common Identical Proposition thrice (as it were) Repeated; and is plainly as much as to say, the two supposed Equals are Equal to one another: the two Equals added are Equal to one another; and so the two Equal <hi>Wholes,</hi> made up of both those Equal <hi>parts,</hi> are Equal to one another.</p>
               <p>There are many other such Identical Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on which that great Mathematician builds as on his Principles; and among the rest [<hi>A Whole is greater than a part of it self</hi>] which I have shewn above to be, in sence. <hi>Formally Identical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. As for the <hi>Vse</hi> that may be made of First Principles; First, they cannot be the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> for that is the thing <hi>to be proved,</hi> and First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are <hi>above Proof,</hi> as not being to be <hi>made Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> because they are <hi>Self-evident.</hi> Nor can they be either of the <hi>Premisses</hi>; for (as will be more clearly shewn hereafter) the Middle Term must be Connected with <hi>one</hi> of the Terms of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62043:114"/>
in <hi>one</hi> of the Premisses, and with the <hi>other</hi> Term in the <hi>other</hi>; which could not be, if the self same Notion were us'd twice in one of those Premisses; for then the Syllogism must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be fram'd thus, [<hi>Omnis Homo est Homo, Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod Animal est rationale,</hi> ergo <hi>aliquod Rationale est Homo</hi>]; or thus, [<hi>Nullus Homo est Irrationalis</hi>; Ted aliquis <hi>Homo est Homo,</hi> ergo <hi>Aliquod irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale non est Homo:</hi>] where we see (to omit other faults) that the Notion of <hi>Homo</hi> is taken thrice, whereas in a Legitimate Syllogism no Term ought to be taken more than twice; and, so the whole Discourse is Preternatural and Absurd.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence follows, that since the <hi>Vse</hi> of First Principles cannot be the bringing down or <hi>deducing</hi> Truths, which are yet unknown, <hi>from them</hi>; therefore the Use of them must consist in the bringing up or <hi>Reducing</hi> Truths <hi>to them</hi>; which is done by Resolving less-clear Truths into <hi>others</hi> still Clearer, till we arise to those which are the Clearest of all, that is, to <hi>Self-evident Principles</hi>; to shew which by Instances, or lay open the way how this is done, is not proper for this place, but belongs to the next Book, where we shall treat of Rigorous Discourse or Demonstration.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To make this use of First Principles is no more, in effect, but to attend heedfully to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the <hi>Thing,</hi> and not to <hi>deviate</hi> from it. This is Evident; for, to <hi>Deviate</hi> in a Discourse about <hi>Homo</hi> or <hi>Corpus,</hi> from their Natures, is, by consequence, to make <hi>Homo</hi> not to be <hi>Homo,</hi> and <hi>Corpus</hi> not to be <hi>Corpus</hi>; which Propositions are Contradictory to <hi>Homo est Homo</hi> and <hi>Corpus est
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62043:115"/>
Corpus,</hi> which are the First Principles in those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Quaere.</hi> It may be ask'd, if there be no more in the business but to attend to the Metaphysical Verity or Nature of the <hi>Thing,</hi> why we keep such a pother about putting it into such nice, and dry, and seemingly Insignificant Identical Propositions, since we may attend to our Notion, or the Nature of the Thing, without framing Formal Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about it, or saying <hi>It is what it is?</hi> 'Tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, Because all our <hi>Discourses</hi> are made up of <hi>Propositions,</hi> without which we cannot <hi>say</hi> or <hi>affirm</hi> any thing; and therefore those Sayings into which we do finally resolve their Evidence and Truth, as into what's most true and evident, must be <hi>Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> also. Besides, Self-evident Propositions, which advance the <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Verity of the thing into <hi>Formal</hi> Verity, do reflect and redouble (as it were) the Notion of it upon it self by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing its <hi>being what it is</hi>; and thence gives an advantage to our bare Single Notion, by not only <hi>having had</hi> (as had the Single Notion) its Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Verity in it, but by <hi>expressing</hi> that Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Verity, so as to make it more fit to be discours'd of.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Tho' First Principles cannot be any Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Legitimate or Regular Syllogism, yet this hinders not but that those particular Identical Propositions which subsume under <hi>Ens est Ens</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>B.</hi> 2. <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>Corol.</hi> 2.</note>, may in some sort and improperly be Deducible from that Common one. For, since a <hi>Common Notion,</hi> taken without restriction, is Equivalent to an <hi>Vniversal,</hi> and includes <hi>All</hi> that have that Notion, and <hi>All</hi> includes and signifies <hi>Every</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62043:115"/>
one, as a Whole does its parts; hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that if <hi>Ens</hi> be <hi>Ens,</hi> then <hi>Homo</hi> is <hi>Homo, Lapis</hi> is <hi>Lapis</hi>; and the same may be said of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing that is comprehended under that Universal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That this is not perform'd by virtue of those Terms orderly plac'd and connected, as 'tis done in a Syllogism; but by vertue of some Logical Maxims applying or referring the Common propositions to those particular Identical ones, as appears in the proof of this last Section.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> II. Hence is seen how Metaphysicks give the Principles to all <hi>Inferiour</hi> Sciences that treat of <hi>particular Subjects</hi>; and how they establish both the Truth, Certainty and Evidence of those respective Principles.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The other main Use of First Principles is to Establish all our Ratiocination or Deduction of <hi>New</hi> Truths out of <hi>others</hi> formerly known: this is evident, because all Inference, Concluding or Proving is perform'd by Identifying the <hi>two</hi> terms of the proposition to be Concluded with a <hi>Middle</hi> term in the premisses; and if it be found that they are both of them the same <hi>with it,</hi> it is thence In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd that they are the same <hi>with one another,</hi> and that the Conclusion is <hi>true.</hi> But, what if that Middle term be not the same with its <hi>own self,</hi> but <hi>Divided within it self?</hi> Why then it must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow, that we could Inferr or prove No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: For if that Middle term were divided in it self, as <hi>Hirco-cervus, Chimera,</hi> and all Non-Entities
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62043:116"/>
are, then <hi>one</hi> of the terms of the proposition to be prov'd might be Identify'd with it according to <hi>one</hi> of those Considerations, and the <hi>other</hi> term Identify'd with it according to the <hi>other</hi>; and so, it would not follow that the terms of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to be proved are at all <hi>Identified</hi> or Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the <hi>Conclusion</hi> by being both of them Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with it in the <hi>Premisses</hi>; but rather it will follow, that they would be <hi>Diversify'd</hi> or Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, because that Middle term had Diversity and not Identity in it self. Wherefore all the Force of Inference, nay, all possibility of Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or proving any thing is entirely grounded on this Self-evident proposition, <hi>Idem est Idem sibi ipsi,</hi> or, <hi>a Thing is the same with it self.</hi> Which shews how Useful First principles are, and how they are both the First Truths <hi>in themselves</hi>; and, besides, the Bottom-Ground to <hi>all Others</hi> which are not Evident in themselves, but need <hi>Proof</hi> to make them so; how Dry and Insignificant soever they may appear at first sight, or seem ridiculous to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Talkers, or some Men of more Witt and Fancy than of Exact Speculation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> III. Hence is seen that the <hi>Light of Reason</hi> or the Light by which we draw New knowledges out of foregoing ones, is the Light that shines in this Self-evident proposition: <hi>A thing is the same with it's self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> IV. Hence also, if the Terms be Univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally understood, and do agree to the Middle Term in the Premisses, we may be as Infallibly Certain our Conclusion is True as we are that <hi>The
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62043:116"/>
same is the same with it self.</hi> Which will give a great Encouragement, to the Laborious Pursuers of True Science, and comfort the pains they take in Seeking after Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> V. Hence, lastly, if any Discourse be so fram'd as to <hi>thwart</hi> this First Principle or <hi>clash</hi> with it: 'tis Self-evidently Absur'd, False and Contradictory; as will be particularly seen when we come to treat of <hi>Discourse</hi> or <hi>Ratiocination.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The next Judgment is, that [<hi>He is struck</hi>] or affected by some Object without him; for, since the Course of Nature is <hi>Motion,</hi> and therefore Objects are continually <hi>moving</hi> where the Man is, and, so, do light and act on his <hi>Senses,</hi> that is, do work Experimental Knowledge in him that he is <hi>acted upon</hi> or <hi>struck</hi> by them, it follows, that he must, after he comes to frame Judgments, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily and frequently <hi>know,</hi> and, consequently, <hi>Judge</hi> he <hi>is struck.</hi> Nor can this be the first Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both for the Reason lately given Sect. 2. as also because in this Proposition [<hi>I am struck</hi>] the Proposition [<hi>I am</hi>] is most Simple, and manifestly antecedes [<hi>I am struck</hi>]; the Notion of [<hi>struck</hi>] being clearly superadded to it.</p>

These Judgments had, we are furnish'd by Nature with Means of Knowing in some measure the <hi>Distinct</hi> Natures of <hi>all</hi> things that affect us.

And our <hi>Soul</hi> having the power of <hi>Comparing</hi> them to themselves, and to <hi>Other</hi> Natures that are also in her, we hence become capable of framing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable <hi>Judgments</hi> concerning them, or <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> of them.</p>

These Knowledges of all things that affect our Senses being gain'd, to a fair degree, by the Different Impressions of Objects, are made more Express, and Improv'd very much by <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Reflexion.</hi> For, since Study and Reflexion are not the <hi>Inventing</hi> New or Counterfeit Notions or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of our own coyning, but the <hi>Receiving</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and minding heedfully the true and solid Notions of the things which Nature had imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there before; it follows, that, as in Corporeal Sight, by our Regarding the Object frequently, wistly and attentively, we come to observe more and more in it; so, by often Reflecting on and Revolving Intellectual Objects, or the Natures of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62043:121"/>
things <hi>in us,</hi> the Eye of our Mind must needs <hi>look deeper</hi> into them, make <hi>new</hi> Discoveries of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Considerations in them which escap'd a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> Cursory view, and gain <hi>more</hi> exact and <hi>more</hi> penetrative Knowledge of them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. By <hi>Methods</hi> of Discoursing or Ratiocination made evident by Maxims of <hi>Art,</hi> this Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Knowledge (were not <hi>vita brevis</hi>) might come to be in a manner <hi>Infinit.</hi> For, all this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by Evident Connexion of Terms, both in <hi>some</hi> propositions which are Truths, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing others by necessary consequence from <hi>them,</hi> and so forwards. Since then there is no <hi>stint</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signable of the Connexion of Truths, and (as will be shewn hereafter) there are Rules or Maxims of <hi>Art</hi> to teach us <hi>how</hi> to connect Terms Aptly and Evidently; it follows, that there can be <hi>no Bounds</hi> of the Improvement of Knowledge.</p>
               <p n="8">8. From what's said above, 'tis manifest that this proposition [<hi>Ego cogito</hi>] cannot be the <hi>first-known</hi> Truth whence all our Science is <hi>Generated</hi>; for, since this proposition (<hi>Ego cogito</hi>) if put entirely or explicitly as it ought, is (<hi>Ego sum cogitans</hi>) and in the order of Nature the proposition (<hi>Ego sum</hi>) is antecedent to (<hi>Ego sum cogitans</hi>) and more sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than it; so that if <hi>it</hi> be not suppos'd to be known, the <hi>other</hi> cannot possibly be known; 'tis most Evident that <hi>(Cogito)</hi> or (<hi>Ego cogito</hi>) or, which is the same (<hi>Ego sum cogitans</hi>) cannot be the first-known Proposition or First Truth that can be laid in the Method of <hi>Generating Science.</hi>

               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:62043:122"/>9. The proposition (<hi>Ego sum cogitans</hi>) is <hi>less</hi> clear and evident than many other propositions that have for their predicate Notions directly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on our Senses such as are; I am <hi>Heated, Hurt, Extended, Moving, &amp;c.</hi> For, since all our first-known notions (the Soul being <hi>Rasa Tabula</hi>) come by Impressions of Objects on our Senses, those propositions are <hi>most Clear</hi> whose predicates are the Immediate Effects of those Impressions, and, joyn'd with <hi>Ego sum</hi> (which is the first Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) do compound those propositions. But such are the predicates abovesaid, and not the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate (<hi>Cogitans</hi>). Therefore the proposition (<hi>Ego sum Cogitans</hi>) is less clear than are the propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have those directly imprinted Notions for their Predicates. That the other predicates are notions <hi>more known</hi> than is <hi>Cogitans,</hi> I prove thus. The notion of <hi>Cogitans</hi> is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and therefore could not be imprinted in the Soul by a <hi>Direct</hi> stroke of the Object on the Senses, as are the Others, but must be known by <hi>Reflexion</hi>; but what is known by Reflexion is less easily and less early known, that is <hi>less Evident</hi> to us, taking us as not yet imbued with <hi>other</hi> Knowledges, than that which is known by <hi>Experience</hi> or <hi>Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>; therefore the notion of (<hi>Cogitans</hi>) is less known than are those other predicates; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently this proposition <hi>(Ego sum Cogitans)</hi> is less Clear than the propositions <hi>(Ego sum Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, vulneratus, movens, &amp;c.</hi> Again, were the predicate <hi>(Cogitans)</hi> known experimentally, or by Impressions on the Sense, which it is not at all but as it is joyn'd with the Imagination (the most Fallacious Faculty we have) co-operating
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62043:122"/>
with the Understanding; nay, were it an Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Man,</hi> and its Notion directly imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, and, so, as easily and early known as any of the rest; yet the proposition (<hi>Ego sum Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitans</hi>) could not be the First or Second in the Order of <hi>Knowable:</hi> for, since (as was shewn) [<hi>I am struck or Affected</hi>] antecedes [I am affected <hi>thus</hi>] or have <hi>such</hi> an affection in me, and <hi>Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> is not barely to be Affected by Objects, but to have <hi>such</hi> a manner of Affection; hence the proposition <hi>(I am affected by Objects)</hi> is more Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore, in priority of Nature, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes (I am affected <hi>thus</hi>) or (I am <hi>Thinking</hi>) and is more Clear than <hi>it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Hence the proposition (<hi>Ego cogito</hi>) is also <hi>less Certain</hi> than multitudes of <hi>other</hi> propositions, whose predicates are experimentally known by Direct Impressions on the Senses. For Certainty follows Evidence as its <hi>Proper Cause,</hi> as Judging does Knowing. Wherefore, if that proposition be <hi>less Evident,</hi> it is also <hi>less Certain.</hi>

               <p n="12">12. If it be alledg'd, that it is Certain by way of <hi>Evident Proof</hi> that this proposition <hi>(Ego cogito)</hi> is the most absolutely firm Ground we can relye on to generate and principiate all our other Knowledges, because tho' we would voluntarily divest our selves of all other Knowledges, and call them into doubt; that is, were all the rest <hi>Vncertain,</hi> and my self <hi>Insecure</hi> whether I think <hi>True</hi> or <hi>False</hi> in holding them; yet it is Unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionably Certain, and Impossible to be doubted of, but that, whether I think <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong,</hi> still I <hi>think</hi>; whence follows, that the proposition (<hi>Ego cogito</hi>) seems to be a firm <hi>basis</hi> to ground all the

rest upon. I answer, that the whole Discourse seems to me to be a Paralogism, and a kind of <hi>Fallacy</hi> of <hi>non causa pro causa</hi>; for, the Question is not whether it be not more Certain that I <hi>think</hi> than that I think <hi>wrong</hi> or <hi>right</hi>; for, 'tis granted that this proposition [<hi>I think</hi>] is more Simple, and therefore antecedes, and is presuppos'd to the propositions [I think <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong,</hi> or <hi>thus</hi> and <hi>thus</hi>] and, consequently, it is more Evident and more Certain than <hi>These</hi> are. But the true point is, whether I am more Certain that I <hi>think at all,</hi> than that I am Certain that <hi>I am</hi>; since if it be not presuppos'd that <hi>I am,</hi> 'tis most Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it is Impossible that I should be Certain that I <hi>am thinking,</hi> or any thing like it. The Objecter then slides over the Certainty of this proposition <hi>(I think)</hi> as compar'd with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position (<hi>I am</hi>) and other Judgments experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally known; and compares it with other propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions subsequent to <hi>(I think).</hi> Wherefore he first <hi>supposes</hi> it to be most Certain, that is, more Certain than <hi>they</hi> are, and prefers it <hi>before</hi> all others, without Comparing it with <hi>those others</hi>; which is to suppose it so <hi>gratis,</hi> and (which is yet more strange) he grounds all Knowledge what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever upon it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. 'Tis yet a worse Error, that whereas <hi>Ens</hi> or Being is the <hi>Basis</hi> of all other Notions, so that if no <hi>Thing</hi> be, <hi>They</hi> cannot be; the Alledger, by arguing thus [<hi>Cogito ergo sum</hi>] does by a strange <hi>Hysteron proteron,</hi> put an <hi>Operation</hi> to be <hi>Antecedent</hi> to <hi>Being</hi> it self; and that [<hi>to be Thinking</hi>] is a more Simple, Clear, and Distinct Notion than [<hi>to be</hi>]. And then, from an Operation found out

determin'd; and, so, <hi>all</hi> the parts of the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism will be placed and ordered as they ought to be.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The <hi>Middle Term</hi> is then placed rightly, when 'tis placed <hi>in the Middle,</hi> or between those other two Terms which it is to conjoyn with one another. This is evident by the Light of Nature; for, were it not <hi>joyn'd to both,</hi> it could not be the Means of <hi>conjoyning</hi> them; nor could it be joyn'd to both, unless its Notion were in the <hi>middle</hi> or <hi>between both</hi>:</p>

                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:62043:130"/>For Example, in this Syllogism.</p>

               </list>
               <p>The Proposition (Courtesy is Laudable) is the Conclusion, and to be Proved; and so, the placing of it's Terms is already determin'd: The middle Term [Virtue] is plac'd <hi>in the middle,</hi> being <hi>subject</hi> to, or <hi>under</hi> Laudable in the <hi>Major,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> or <hi>Superiour</hi> to Courtesy in the <hi>Minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Tho' the place of the Terms of the <hi>Conclusion</hi> were not determin'd, yet the reason lately given would determin it. For if Laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble be <hi>above</hi> Virtue, and Virtue <hi>above</hi> Courtesy, it must follow <hi>à fortiori</hi> tht Laudable must be above Courtesie, which is the lowest of the Three; or, that <hi>Laudable</hi> must be the <hi>Predicate</hi> in the Conclusion.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Wherefore the <hi>other</hi> two Figures are Unnatural and Monstrous; For, since Nature has shown us that what conjoyns two No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought to be placed in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, it is <hi>against</hi> Nature and Reason to place it either <hi>above</hi> them <hi>both,</hi> as is done in that they call the <hi>Second Figure,</hi> or <hi>under</hi> them <hi>both,</hi> as is done in that Figure they call the <hi>Third.</hi>

as appears § 13. the Extreme which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated of the middle Term in the <hi>Major,</hi> has thence a title to be the Predicate in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, because it is above the Middle Term, which is the <hi>Predicate</hi> or <hi>above</hi> the <hi>other</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme in the <hi>Minor</hi>; it follows that, if the Middle Term be <hi>twice above</hi> or <hi>twice below</hi> the other two Terms in the Premisses, that Reason ceases; and, so, it is left indifferent which of the other two Terms is to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or Predicate in the Conclusion; and the Indeterminate Conclusion follows not from the Artificial Form of the Syllogism, but meerly from the material Identity of all the three Terms; or from this, that their Notions are found in the same <hi>Ens.</hi> Wherefore from these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,

So that to argue on that fashion, or to make use of these aukward Figures, is not to know certainly the End or Conclusion we aim at, but to shoot our bolt at no determinate Mark, since no determinate Conclusion can in that case follow.</p>

               <head>LESSON II. Of the several Manners or <hi>Moods</hi> of a Syllogism; and of the Laws of Concluding.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Right Figure or <hi>Position</hi> of the <hi>Lesser</hi> Parts of a Syllogism, (<hi>viz.</hi> it's <hi>Terms</hi>) being shown to be but <hi>one,</hi> and the force of it's <hi>Consequence,</hi> in which consists it's Essence, being still the same; the Variety of Syllogisms, or the several sorts or <hi>Moods</hi> of them can only be taken from its <hi>greater</hi> Parts, the Propositions, or from something belonging to them. This is manifest, because there is nothing, besides <hi>these,</hi> from which the Distinction of those Moods can be taken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Moods</hi> of Syllogisms may be in part taken from the <hi>Quantity</hi> of the several Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For, since the Essence of a Syllogism, or the force of Consequence does consist in the Connexion or Identification of <hi>Two</hi> Terms with a <hi>Third</hi>; and, to be <hi>universally</hi> or <hi>particularly</hi> Identify'd, are evidently divers <hi>Manners</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Identify'd; 'Tis manifest that the variety of Syllogisms may be in part taken from the <hi>Quantity</hi> of the Propositions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Moods,</hi> or several manners of Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisms must be taken also <hi>in part</hi> from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions being <hi>Affirmative</hi> or <hi>Negative:</hi> For,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62043:132"/>
since Affirmative Propositions do express the Agreement of the two Extremes with the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Term, and those which are Negative their Disagreement with it; and this Agreement or Disagreement with it have equal Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Consequence,</hi> and diversifie it, or make it follow after a <hi>diverse manner</hi>; it follows that the <hi>Moods</hi> or Manners of a Syllogism must also be taken from those Propositions being <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> or <hi>Negative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As it is self-evident that <hi>the same is the same with it self</hi>; so it is <hi>equally</hi> self-evident that what is Different or <hi>Diverse</hi> from another is <hi>not the same</hi> with it, or different from it. This is Evident both by the Rule of Contraries, as also because this Proposition is Identical as well as the other.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Quantity and Quality which ought to be in the several Propositions of the Syllogisms of each Mood, are by a kind of Art of Memory, signifi'd by these four words, <hi>Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> in which the three <hi>Syllables</hi> corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond to the three Propositions found in a Syllogism; and the <hi>Vowels</hi> in each Syllable tell us the Quantity and Quality of each Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A and E signifying an Universal Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Negative; I and O a Particular Affirmative and Negative.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We are also to reflect on what was shown above, that, in the way of Predication, an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal is consider'd as a kind of <hi>Whole</hi> in respect of the Particulars contain'd under it, and the Particulars are conceiv'd to be <hi>Parts</hi> of that Whole; whence an Universal Proposition expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62043:132"/>
the Identity of its Terms in the <hi>Whole</hi> or <hi>Totally,</hi> and a Particular one but in <hi>part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The distinction of <hi>Moods</hi> may also in some part be taken from the <hi>Conclusions</hi> in the several Syllogisms. For, since those Conclusions are all of them Propositions, and all Propositions (Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ones excepted, as not belonging to Science) must be either Universal Affirmatives or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Negatives, Particular Affirmatives, or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Negatives; and the <hi>Vowels</hi> in the <hi>last</hi> Syllable of those four Words do answer to all these several <hi>Conclusions,</hi> and the two <hi>Vowels</hi> in the two <hi>former</hi> Syllables of each word do tell us of what Nature the <hi>Premisses</hi> must be, if we would conclude <hi>such</hi> Propositions: it follows that the number of those several <hi>Moods,</hi> or several manners of Concluding, may, in some sort, be taken from the Propositions that are to be prov'd or <hi>Concluded,</hi> as from the <hi>End</hi> we aim at, and by which we are to contrive or cast our <hi>Premisses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Hence, as we shew'd before there ought to be but <hi>one</hi> Figure, so 'tis shown here, that there can be no more <hi>Moods</hi> of that Figure Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary but these Four now mentioned; because these do fully direct us (as far as concerns the Form of a Syllogism) how to <hi>Conclude</hi> or Prove all the several Questions or <hi>Theses</hi> that can be ask'd, or propos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to be Prov'd. And, since all these <hi>Moods</hi> do belong to that which they call the <hi>First Figure,</hi> hence also, by the way, is farther confirmed what we prov'd above, that there cannot need, and therefore ought not to be, any more than <hi>that one</hi> Figure.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:62043:133"/>9. But, because in treating of the <hi>Method to Science,</hi> we ought not to deviate from that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod our selves while we are shewing it to others; hence, we become oblig'd not barely to tell the Reader, as it were by rote, how the Syllogisms in each Mood <hi>do</hi> conclude, or by pretty Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to help their <hi>Memory</hi> how to do this; but we are bound to inform their Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and to shew them <hi>why</hi> such Premisses must necessarily inferr such Conclusions as those four Words do hint to us; or, which is in a manner the same, <hi>why</hi> or <hi>for what reason</hi> such Conclusions <hi>must</hi> follow from such Premisses.</p>
               <p n="10">10. As the substance of the Connexion of the Terms in the Conclusion depends wholly on the Connexion of them with the Middle Term in the Premisses, so the <hi>Degree</hi> of their Connexion in the Conclusion must depend on the <hi>Degree</hi> of their Connexion with it in the said Premisses. This is evident, because all the Connexions those <hi>Extremes</hi> have, is from their Connexion with the <hi>Medium</hi>; wherefore, if they be <hi>more</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the Middle Term in the Premisses, they must be <hi>more</hi> Connected with one another in the Conclusion; if <hi>less,</hi> less Connected.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Hence, from two Premisses which are both of them Universal Affirmatives must follow a Conclusion <hi>Vniversally Affirmative</hi>; because the Middle Term in the Premisses was <hi>Totally</hi> or Universally the same with <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Extremes,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> Extreme <hi>Totally</hi> or <hi>Vniversally</hi> the same with it; whence follows, that those Extremes must be <hi>Totally</hi> or <hi>Vniversally</hi> the same with one another in the Conclusion.

For, since we experience that our Soul is not only Capable of having Universal Notions, but that 'tis her peculiar Nature to <hi>Abstract,</hi> that is, to draw Singular Notions to Universal ones; and, since Notions are the <hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>all</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and, consequently, Universal Notions of Universal Knowledges; and Science is a Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Mind according to her Nature; and, therefore, does dilate and enlarge her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Capacity by Extending it to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Vniversal</hi> Truths: Wherefore, since, on the other side, an Expository Syllogism, as consisting of <hi>Singulars</hi>; can Conclude, or gain the Soul knowledge of no more but some <hi>one Singular,</hi> it Cramps, Contracts or makes <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> her Natural Capacity; whence it follows, that such Syllogisms are far from <hi>Perfecting</hi> the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62043:137"/>
Soul, or from generating <hi>Science,</hi> which is her <hi>Natural Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. Hence follows, that such Syllogisms are good for <hi>Vse</hi> and <hi>Practise,</hi> and only for That: For, since such Syllogisms are True Discourses, and, therefore, are not <hi>wholly in vain,</hi> but must be good for <hi>something</hi>; Wherefore, since they conduce not at all to <hi>Speculation</hi> or generating <hi>Science</hi>; it follows that they must be good for <hi>Vse</hi> or <hi>Practise,</hi> and for that <hi>only.</hi> Again, since all Outward Action, Use and Practise is wholly employ'd about such Subjects as <hi>Exist,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Exists but <hi>Suppositums, Individuums,</hi> or <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars</hi>; it follows, that Singulars are the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> Subjects of Artificers, or such as work Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly upon <hi>Determinate</hi> Matters; and the Knowledge of the Nature of those Singulars is Useful and Necessary for such men; for, by this, they know how to <hi>work</hi> upon those Subjects and Manage them accordingly. For example, an Architect by knowing the certain Quantities and Proportions of his Materials (Wood, Brick, or Stone,) may build a House; but he cannot, without the Science of Mathematicks, have a Clear knowledge (out of the Natures of those Quantities) <hi>why</hi> it must be so <hi>always,</hi> though it <hi>hit</hi> to do so once, or <hi>hic est nunc.</hi>

Next, because to Argue from some <hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> to the <hi>Whole,</hi> is Inconsequent. Wherefore, we cannot thence Inferr an <hi>Vniversal</hi> Proposition or gain Science of any <hi>Nature,</hi> unless we could enumerate all the Singulars in the World, that is, <hi>all the Parts</hi> so to make up an Equivalent to the Whole, which is Impossible.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Hence follows immediatly that some <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi> Proposition must be taken in if we would Conclude any thing from a <hi>Singular</hi> one.

               <p n="26">26. Further, 'tis collected from our former Discourse that <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> or Conditional Syllogisms are, in proper Speech, no Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Syllogisms; nor, consequently, can they generate <hi>Science,</hi> but by seeing, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and confusedly, they are the same in sense with <hi>Categorical</hi> ones. For, since we cannot see Evidently the Truth of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion or have <hi>Science</hi> of it, but by seeing Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the Connexion of the Two Extremes with the Middle Term; and, this cannot be seen Evidently unless all the Terms be posturd in their <hi>right place,</hi> as is done in the First Figure; therefore, since neither this Clear Position of the Terms, nor any thing like it, is found in Hypothetical Syllogisms, they are not in proper

Speech, Syllogisms; any more than are some sort of more concise Rhetorical Discourses, which have oftentimes <hi>virtually</hi> the sense of a Catego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Syllogism in them, though the parts of it be disjoynted and out of that due Order that ought to be in a Syllogism.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Wherefore all <hi>Hypothetical</hi> Syllogisms ought in Disputes to be reduced to Categori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ones.

               <head>LESSON III. Of the <hi>Matter</hi> of a Conclusive Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism; or, what <hi>Middle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Term</hi> is proper for Demonstration.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>right Manner</hi> of framing a Conclusive Syllogism, or of drawing a <hi>Consequence</hi> right, which is the <hi>Form</hi> of it, being thus laid open from its Grounds; there remains no more to be done as to the Attainment of Science, but to shew what is the proper <hi>Matter</hi> of such a rigorous Discourse: For, since the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> do constitute the whole Essence or Nature of every thing; if both these be made known, there can nothing more be wanting for us to conclude or prove Evidently; which is the sole
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:62043:139"/>
end and aim of the <hi>whole</hi> Art of Logick. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all the elaborate Rules that occurr in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Logicians, which conduce not to this end, are Frivolous, and meerly invented for vain Show and Ostentation; and are so far from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing Science, that they pester the way to it by making in more Perplext and Intricate, which obstructs the attainment of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such a <hi>Middle Term</hi> as is Proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the other two is the <hi>only Matter</hi> of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive Syllogism. For; since there can be in a Lawful Syllogism but Three Terms, and Two of them are given to our hands in the <hi>Thesis</hi> to be proved, and the right Placing of those Terms belongs to the <hi>Form</hi> of it; there is no Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion left that can be conceiv'd to be the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, or which, joyn'd with the Former, makes it Evidently Conclude, but such a <hi>Middle Term</hi> which is apt to conjoyn the other Two in the Conclusion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore, such a Term being found and order'd in the <hi>right Form,</hi> nothing more can be requir'd to gain Science of any Proposition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. For, this done, the Conclusion so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follows, that it is as Impossible it should not be True as it is that an Identical Proposition should be False; or (which is the same) that a Contradiction should be True, which are the highest Impossibilities. Wherefore, since to have <hi>Science</hi> of any thing, is to know evidently the thing <hi>is so</hi> and <hi>cannot but be so,</hi> and this is known by the means now mentioned; it follows that no thing more can be requir'd to gain Science of any Proposition whatever.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:62043:140"/>4. Hence such a Syllogism is <hi>Demonstrative,</hi> and to produce or frame such a Syllogism is to <hi>Demonstrate</hi>: For, since a Demonstration bears in its Notion that it must be the most Certain and most Evident Proof than can be; and <hi>no</hi> Proof can be more Certain than that which renders it absolutely <hi>Impossible</hi> the Conclusion should not be True; nor more Evident than that which engages immediately the highest Evidence of an Identical Proposition; and all this (as has been prov'd) is found in a Syllogism consisting of <hi>such</hi> a Matter and <hi>such</hi> a Form, it follows that such a Syllogism is a <hi>Demonstrative</hi> one, and that to Prove by such a Syllogism is to <hi>Demonstrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. All <hi>Middle Terms</hi> that are Proper for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration must be taken Originally from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Thlng</hi> or from it's Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Verity, For, since all Inferiour Truths are therefore such because they are finally resolvable into Identical Propositions which are the First Truths; that is, because those First Truths are <hi>virtually</hi> in them; and Identical propositions are therefore true (because the thing <hi>is what it is,</hi> in which consists its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical verity; it follows that the Verity of all Inferiour Truths (such as are the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses) on whose Truth all Demonstration and Truth of the Conclusion necessarily depends, is taken originally from the Metaphysical ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Subject and Predicate. Again, since (as has been shown) the force of all Consequence is grounded on this that the Middle Term <hi>is the same with it's self,</hi> or <hi>what
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62043:140"/>
it is</hi>; It follows that the Force of all Middle Terms that any way conduce to Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must be taken originally from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing, or from it's Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Verity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We can have no Demonstration of the Whole Thing taken <hi>in gross.</hi> For, the Whole Thing, as was said, may be consider'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse wayes, and so ground many Notions, and contains in it confusedly what corresponds to all those Notions we can frame of it; since then we cannot have <hi>at once</hi> a Distinct and Clear knowledg of what corresponds for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally to any two Notions, it follows that we can have no Demonstration (or Distinct and Clear Knowledg) of the whole thing taken <hi>in Gross.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Wherefore, if we would demonstrate the Nature of the Thing according to what's Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to it, we must take in pieces, Unfold, Explicate, and, as it were, Detail the Thing into it's <hi>Essential Parts,</hi> that so we may look more clearly thro' it's Nature or Essence; which is done by <hi>Definitions</hi> of the <hi>Whole</hi> first, and then of it's several Essential Parts, till we come to those Parts of it which are most known, or to the Common Head. For, we experience that we have but a Confused No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Thing while it is exprest but in <hi>One</hi> Word; but, when Many Words are used to tell the Nature of it, our knowledg of it grows Clearer, and still more Clear and Distinct after each of those Words also has It's Meaning told, or is <hi>Defind.</hi> For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62043:141"/>
ask what such a Thing is, it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd a <hi>Man</hi>; which gives us, indeed, a True but a Confused Knowledg of it. Whence we may have occasion to ask <hi>farther</hi> what is a <hi>Man?</hi> and the Answer is a <hi>Rational Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>; which clears the Notion of Man to a fair degree. But, the word <hi>Animal</hi> is also Confused, tho' less than <hi>Homo</hi> was; wherefore, to gain a more Distinct Knowledg of it, we set our selves to define <hi>It,</hi> and we find it to be a <hi>Living</hi> or Self-moving Thing that is <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,</hi> or which is mov'd by Impression on the Senses. And thus still to gain Clearer Light of more and more Essential Notions or Considerations of <hi>Man,</hi> we may drive on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Definitions of the ascending <hi>Genus</hi> till we come to <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Substantia,</hi> which is the Supreme in that Line, (and the Clearest of any except <hi>Existence</hi>) which stints our quest. By which way of defining still upwards, we gain many Distinct Notions of <hi>Man's Essence,</hi> which were before confusedly blended in the single word [<hi>Man</hi>]. And, were the Collateral Differences, which constitute the Inferiour no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to <hi>Ens,</hi> Defin'd too as well as each <hi>Genus,</hi> descending in a right Line from it, we should gain a most Distinct and clear Essential No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Man.</hi>

It remains to define the Difference [<hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>] which is the other Essential Notion that compounds the Entire Notion of <hi>Man.</hi> If we ask then what <hi>Reason</hi> is, it will be answer'd that it is a Faculty of Deducing some new knowledg out of foregoing ones; or (to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press

Another use to be made of Definitions in order to Demonstration is this; when two Notions, by being <hi>Remote,</hi> seem in a manner <hi>Disparate,</hi> and, so, the Proposition is <hi>Obscure</hi>; we are to pursue home the Definitions of <hi>each</hi> of the Terms till something that is <hi>Formally I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentical</hi> appears in <hi>both</hi> of them, Which done, all farther disquisition ceases, and the Point is demonstrated. For example; If we would prove that Virtue is Laudable, we shall find that the word [<hi>Laudable</hi>] signifies [<hi>deserving to be spoke well of</hi>] and Practical Self-Evidence, as well as Reason, telling us, that, our Speech being nothing but Signes agreed on by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to express their <hi>thoughts,</hi> that thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be <hi>spoken well of</hi> which deserves to be <hi>thought well of</hi>; and that what's according to the true Nature of him that speaks or thinks, or to true <hi>Reason,</hi> deserves to be judg'd by him <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> that is, <hi>thought</hi> well of, To which add that <hi>Virtue</hi> is nothing but a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to Act according to <hi>True Reason,</hi> it comes to appear that [<hi>Virtuo</hi>] and [<hi>Laudable</hi>] have something couch't in their notions that is <hi>Formally Identical</hi>; and that this Proposition, [<hi>Virtue is Laudable</hi>] is full as Certain as that <hi>What's according to right Reason is according to right Reason, or what's Laudable is Laudable</hi>; which seen, perfect Knowledg is had of the Truth of [<hi>Virtue is Laudable</hi>] that is, 'tis the Proposition; Evidently Concluded or Demonstrated.</p>

do not alwayes need, but Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the two Notions (or of the Meaning of the Words that express the two Terms) may serve, so they be <hi>True and Solid</hi>; since no more is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in this case but to resolve the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Truths, and the Notions that compound them, into Superiour ones. For which reason also Practical Self-evidence, or a Knowledg agreed on by all Mankind in their Natural Thoughts, through Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with those Natural Objects, is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: For this is a <hi>Solid</hi> Knowledg, tho' it be not lick't into Artificial shape.

               <p n="1">1.

Wherefore as <hi>Deducing</hi> is nothing but Deriving <hi>downwards</hi> the verity which was in some <hi>Higher</hi> Truths to the <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> ones; so <hi>Reducing</hi> is the carrying <hi>upwards</hi> or <hi>Resolving</hi> those <hi>Inferiour</hi> Truths into those

                  <hi>Higher</hi> ones on which they Depend, and the showing them to be <hi>by consequence</hi> the Same; or that the Inferiour <hi>Thesis</hi> must needs be True, if the Identical or Supreme one be <hi>so</hi>; and that the Supreme one <hi>cannot</hi> be True, unless the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour one be such <hi>also:</hi> So that the verity of the <hi>Supreme</hi> Truth does <hi>by consequence</hi> stand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in the Patronage of the <hi>Inferiour</hi> one.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Hence an easie way is chalkt out how to Reduce any Truth to an Identical Proposition or any Errour to a Contradiction. For, let but the Subject of the Discourse (<hi>Homo</hi> for example) be <hi>Defin'd,</hi> and the two parts of its Definition be Defind <hi>likewise,</hi> and so forwards; we shall have gain'd a clear and distinct Notion of the Subject, and of all its Essential parts. If, then, the Discourse be about the Nature or Essence of <hi>Homo</hi>; all the Divisions of the parts of that Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which are <hi>Common</hi> Notions, being (as
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:62043:146"/>
they ought) made by Contradictory Differences, and this from the Notion of <hi>Ens</hi> to the very Notion Discours'd of; consequently, that Discourse must either evidently <hi>clash</hi> with and <hi>Contradict some</hi> one of those <hi>Essential</hi> Parts, or Agree to them <hi>All.</hi> If it contradicts any <hi>one</hi> of them, then, since Essences consist in an Indivisible, it does, by consequence, destroy the <hi>whole</hi> Essence of the Subject, and make <hi>homo</hi> not to be <hi>homo</hi>; and, if it Agrees with <hi>All</hi> its parts, then, since, <hi>All the parts</hi> are evidently the <hi>whole,</hi> 'tis by consequence <hi>as Certain</hi> as it is that <hi>Homo</hi> is <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi>; since to say that <hi>Homo</hi> is an <hi>Ens,</hi> and such an <hi>Ens</hi> as is <hi>Corpus,</hi> and such a <hi>Corpus</hi> as is <hi>Compounded,</hi> and such a <hi>Compound</hi> Body as is <hi>Vivens,</hi> and such a <hi>Vivens,</hi> as is <hi>Sensitive</hi> or an <hi>Animal,</hi> and such an <hi>Animal</hi> as can have <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in it, and can <hi>Compare</hi> one Notion to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and two to a <hi>Third,</hi> is evidently to say in Equivalent Terms <hi>Homo est Homo:</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Another Method of Resolving all Truths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Identical Propositions is to Define both the Subject and Predicate, and to pursue their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions till some Notion that is perfectly Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical appears in both; as is Instanced in this proposition [Virtue is Laudable] in the last Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son §. 15.</p>

All Truths <hi>whatever</hi> that concern the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences of things, if we have but Notions of the Terms of the Propositions which express them, do come within the Compass of this Method, and are <hi>Demonstrable.</hi> For, since <hi>all</hi> Truths, whose Terms we understand, do consist of Notions; and, its not hard to know to what <hi>Common Head</hi> those Notions do belong, nor insuperably hard to <hi>Divide</hi> by Proper Differences that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Head; nor the less General Notions under that Head, till we come to the very Notions whose Connexion is in question; it follows, that <hi>all</hi> Propositions belonging to <hi>any</hi> Head, are, for the same reason, <hi>equally</hi> Reducible to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Identicals</hi>; since all the Predicates in the nine last Common Heads, which are Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally <hi>Entia,</hi> have also their Analogical <hi>Essences</hi>; of which we can have as <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as we have of the First Common Head which is properly <hi>Ens</hi>; and, so we can as easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly define their Abstract Notions as we can the other, (or rather much more easily) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Reduce them to their Identicals.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hence we can Discourse Scientifically, or have true <hi>Science,</hi> not only of <hi>Quantities,</hi> which are the Subject of Mathematicks; but, with <hi>equal</hi> reason, of <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices,</hi> which are
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:62043:147"/>
the Subject of Ethicks. For, we can equally Abstract the Notions of the several <hi>Virtues,</hi> have a <hi>Distinct</hi> Conception of them, equally <hi>define</hi> them, and by that means equally Reduce them to their Identicals. And the same may be said of other Qualities that affect our Senses very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, as Heat, Cold, Moist, Dry: <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, that in such as these, if it be too labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to arrive at their Definitions by dividing the Common <hi>Genus,</hi> as it often happens when the Dividing Members are more than Two, and are not Contradictory to one another; then we may frame our Definitions of them by observing the carriage of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> towards them, or their Sayings concerning them, For such Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, being sensible ones, are the Objects of the Senses of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and do imprint Lively and Distinct Notions of themselves <hi>in all men.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their <hi>Sayings</hi> being the Effect of the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have of them, they (if enow of them be collected) must give us the true <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them; or which is all one, of what they <hi>mean</hi> by the Word that expresses them, which is equivalent in Sense to a perfect Definition. For example, when they speak of those Qualities we call <hi>Dry</hi> and <hi>Moist,</hi> we shall observe that they are sollicitous lest <hi>Moist</hi> things should squander and run about, and therefore they are careful themselves to put such things in some Receptacle or Vessel that may keep them from doing so; or they bid their Servants do it. On the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they bid them set <hi>Dry</hi> things on the Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, or on a Shelf; and never put them in a Vessel, or be at the needless labour of pounding
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62043:148"/>
them into a Pot or Tub, out of fear they should squander about. Which sayings and behaviour of theirs gives us the Definitions of both those Qualities; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Moist</hi> is that which <hi>difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keeps its own bounds</hi> or Figure, and <hi>is easily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the bounds of another thing</hi>; and <hi>Dry</hi> is that which <hi>easily retains its own bounds</hi> or Figure, and is <hi>Difficulty accommodated to the bounds of another</hi>; which are the very Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which that great Observer of Nature, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi> gives us of those two Qualities.</p>
               <p>Note II. Whence we may, with a humble Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and Thanks, reflect on the Infinite Goodness of the <hi>God</hi> of Truth, who unenviously bestows knowledge on all, who will dispose themselves to receive it; that, where-ever Art, by reason of our Shortness, is at a plunge, he supplies it by Practical Self-evidence, or the naturally instill'd Knowledge of the Vulgar: whence it is a high Pride in the greatest <hi>Men of Art,</hi> to conceit that they are above being still the <hi>Children of Nature</hi>; whereas 'tis the best Title they have to True and <hi>Solid</hi> Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. — <hi>Sus Minervam</hi> —</p>
               <p n="8">8. All Conclusions are <hi>virtually</hi> in the Premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; For, since the Premisses, by Means of the <hi>Middle Term</hi> and the <hi>right Placing</hi> of it, have in them the whole force of the <hi>Consequence</hi>; and the Consequence cannot be of <hi>nothing</hi> but must be of some Determinate Proposition, which can be nothing but the <hi>Conclusion</hi>; it follows that all
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:62043:148"/>
Conclusions are <hi>virtually</hi> in the Premisses. Again, since, before we Conclude Determinately and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly we must know <hi>what</hi> to Conclude, and we know <hi>what</hi> to Conclude by knowing the Premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and the Conclusion is that Proposition which is to be Concluded; it follows evidently that, since we <hi>know</hi> the Conclusion, e'er we Actually In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr and Express it, to be <hi>in</hi> the Premisses, it is <hi>there</hi> virtually.</p>
               <p n="9">9. All <hi>Deduced</hi> Truths are <hi>virtually</hi> in one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. For, since all Deduced Truths are <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,</hi> and the Conclusions are <hi>virtually</hi> in the Premisses; and the same reason holds for <hi>all</hi> the <hi>following</hi> Conclusions as for the <hi>first,</hi> or for one <hi>single</hi> one; it follows that, let there be never so many orderly-succeeding Syllogisms necessary to prove any point, the Conclusions are still <hi>in</hi> the Premisses and the <hi>following</hi> ones <hi>in</hi> those that went <hi>before</hi> them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. All Truths are <hi>virtually</hi> in the <hi>Identical Propositions</hi>; and, consequently, in the <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> For since all Truths are <hi>taken from</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Things, and from their Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal verity, and consequently are in the Nature of the Thing fundamentally; and This is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and Exprest in the <hi>whole</hi> by Identical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and <hi>in all its parts</hi> by the Definitions; it follows that all Truths are Virtually contain'd in <hi>Identical Propositions,</hi> and, consequently, in the <hi>Definitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. From what's lately said, 'tis evinced that, if a Middle Term be taken which is a <hi>Proper Cause</hi> or <hi>Proper Effect,</hi> the Conclusion is seen to be <hi>in</hi> the Premisses. For, though the Proper
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62043:149"/>
Causes and Effects be not the very <hi>Essence</hi> of the Thing; yet, since an Effect is a Participation of the Cause, and so is apt to manifest the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Proper Cause that produced it; and, the Operation of a Proper Cause is nothing but the <note n="*" place="margin">B. 1.

                  <hi>Existence</hi> of such a Cause (which is sutable to its <hi>Essence</hi>) imprinted upon the Patient; hence, such <hi>Mediums</hi> do Demonstrably and Mutually inferr one another; and therefore nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but that the Conclusions may be seen to be <hi>in</hi> the Premisses as well in <hi>such</hi> Syllogisms as in those which have an <hi>Essential</hi> Notion for their Middle Term.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Hence all Natural Truths, and this throughout the whole Course of Nature, from the very Creation, are <hi>virtually</hi> in one another, For, since, as will be more clearly seen hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all those Natural Effects were Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative of their Proper Causes, and those Causes Demonstrative of their proper Effects; and this from the First starting of Nature into Motion; and so were apt to Inferr one another <hi>all along</hi>; that is, new Conclusions were still apt to spring from such Middle Terms Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the two Extremes in the Premisses; and, consequently, the Truth of those Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were all along <hi>Virtually</hi> in those several Premisses; it follows that all Natural Truths are <hi>in one another,</hi> and this throughout the whole <hi>Series</hi> or Course of Nature from the very Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Causes wrought those several Effects, and had been endowed with Capacity Sufficient for such a performance, and not been diverted with other thoughts from Application to that work; we might have <hi>actually</hi> Demonstrated those Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects by their Proper Causes or those Causes by their Proper Effects, through the whole <hi>Series</hi> or Course of the World, from the beginning to the end; except Miracle had alter'd that Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Course.

For, since all Nature is carry'd on by Proper Causes, and Proper Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and those Mutually inferr one another; that is, the Truth grounded on the <hi>one</hi> is seen to be in the Truth grounded on the <hi>other,</hi> as being <hi>Virtually in one another,</hi> and we experience that the Capacity of the Soul to know Truths is not <hi>fill'd</hi> by knowing <hi>many</hi> Truths, but is <hi>Enlarged</hi> and Enabled to know still <hi>more</hi>; and, being clear of the Body, she is not distracted by Objects working upon the Senses and the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but intimately and necessarily present to <hi>her self,</hi> and, consequently, to what is <hi>in her self</hi>; and so is Addicted, Apply'd and Naturally Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to know the Nature of her <hi>Body,</hi> and,

consequently of her self, as being the <hi>Form</hi> of that Body, and fitted for it; and, <hi>by</hi> her self to know <hi>all</hi> the Truths <hi>Connected</hi> with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her self, that is (as was shown) <hi>all Nature</hi>; and this, not Successively, <hi>one</hi> Truth <hi>after another,</hi> as she did when she was in the Body and needed the Fancy, and so accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated her manner of working to its <hi>slow pace,</hi> but, being now a Pure Spirit and Indivisible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so not commensurable to Time, or to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> and <hi>after,</hi> which are the Differences of Time, she is to know <hi>all</hi> she <hi>could</hi> know in the first instant she was a Pure Spirit, that is, at the Instant of her Separation.

Hence we may frame some imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Conception how <hi>our</hi> Science differs from that of <hi>Angels,</hi> and how Angels must know things <hi>Intuitively.</hi> For, since they have <hi>no Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> they can have no Abstracted Notions by different Impressions from the Objects on the Senses; nor, consequently, can they <hi>Compound</hi> any two Notions to frame a Proposition; much less can they <hi>Discourse,</hi> or Compare Two No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a Third, and so deduce thence <hi>New</hi> Knowledges, call'd <hi>Conclusions</hi>: It is left there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they must a tone view, comprehend entirely the Metaphysical verity of the <hi>whole Thing,</hi> and all that is in it, which we express

by an Identical Proposition. Whence this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or <hi>Intuition</hi> of theirs, abating the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition found in an Identical Proposition (which too is the <hi>least</hi> that is Imaginable) is the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est a-kin to that which we have of these Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticals.

For, though the <hi>Substance</hi> of a Separated Soul's Operation be Intuitive, as is the Angels; yet, because her natural Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius led and forced her <hi>here</hi> to <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>scourse</hi> and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one Truth by another, that is, to see one Truth <hi>in</hi> another; hence, she <hi>retains</hi> a modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or a kind of tang of the Discoursiveness she had <hi>here,</hi> though she cannot in that State <hi>exercise</hi> it; and that, though she cannot then actually deduce new Truths, yet she sees all Truths as Deducible from one another, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one another by Consequence.</p>
               <p>We may frame some imperfect conception how this passes by this course Similitude. When we look upon a Picture call'd a <hi>Prospective,</hi> all the parts of it are <hi>equally near</hi> our Eye <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> and we see them too <hi>all at once</hi>; yet, they appear to us as if <hi>one</hi> of them were far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of than <hi>another,</hi> even to a vast distance; observing still a perfect Order and <hi>decorum</hi> in their greater Propinquity or Remoteness, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as those parts are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> Shadowed
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:62043:151"/>
or Luminous. So the Soul knows <hi>all at once</hi> whatever is Knowable by her, and they are <hi>equally near</hi> the Eye of her understanding; yet, because of her acquiring them <hi>here</hi> by way of <hi>Discourse,</hi> that is, by proceeding from more-Clear to less Clear Truths, she sees them <hi>as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one another,</hi> or, as it were, <hi>beyond one another</hi>; because they were not to her in this state so clear as the other <hi>in themselves,</hi> but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending</hi> on the <hi>others</hi> for their Evidence.</p>

it is hence seen demonstratively, that <hi>God</hi> is as much the Giver of that Good, by laying such a steady Course of innumerable Causes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it to us, as if he had given it by his own hand Immediately; nay, it ought more to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our Gratitude, to see that he has Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered such an Infinity of Causes, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, to be Instrumental to our Good.</p>

Hence, lastly, is shewn the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christianity; which instructs all its Followers to express in their Common Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and to put in practise all the Substance of those Truths, which we have, with so much labour, Speculatively Demonstrated. As when they say that, Every thing that happens is <hi>Gods</hi> Will; pray his Will may be done; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to it; Acknowledg that all the Good they have comes from <hi>God,</hi> thank him for it, free him from all Imputation of Injustice when any Harm lights to them, and bear it with a Humble Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

There is a certain Order, or priority of Nature, in our Notions taken from the <hi>same</hi> subject, by which one of them (or which is the same, the Subject as grounding one of those Notions) is conceiv'd to be kind of Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Cause of Another of them.

Speaking of Mankind, we can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate some <hi>Acts</hi> of his <hi>Will</hi> from the <hi>Final</hi> Cause supposed, and a Final Cause from the supposed <hi>Acts</hi> of his Will. For, since the Will is a <hi>Power,</hi> and all Powers are specify'd or have their particular <hi>Essence</hi> from the respect they have to such or such <hi>Objects</hi>; and the Object of the Will is an <hi>Appearing Good,</hi> it follows that it is Essential to the Will to act for an Appearing Good, Wherefore, if we can demonstrate (as we may often) that such a particular Object must (all things consider'd) <hi>appear a Good</hi> to a Man in such circumstances; it will both follow <hi>â pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori</hi> that, if his Will <hi>acts,</hi> it is for an Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good; and also <hi>â posteriori,</hi> that, if there be an Appearing Good, there will follow an <hi>Act</hi> of his Will. The Proof of both is plain, For, since the Will is a <hi>Power</hi> to Act for an Appearing Good, if it did not (in due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) <hi>act for it,</hi> it would follow that <hi>the Will is not a Will</hi>; or else it must follow, that an Appearing Good is not the <hi>Object</hi> of the Will. Whence, since it can have no other Object Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, it would follow again that the Will is <hi>no Power</hi>; and consequently, <hi>no Will.</hi> Nor does this take away the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Will, which is exercis'd in Chusing <hi>one</hi> out of <hi>many,</hi> but esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth the <hi>Essence</hi> of it.</p>

Amongst the other differences between them this is one, that if an obstinate Adversary denies any Link, in the Demonstration of the Second kind, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected to the Other part of the Chain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course must be forcibly had to the Syllogistick Method, to convince him by plain Self-evident Principles of our Understanding, on which all <hi>Force of Consequence</hi> is built, We shall give here some few Examples, of either Method.

But, their wonder will cease if they reflect that those Bad Angels had <hi>far more</hi> Knowledg, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently more perfect Deliberation (such as they can have) in that one Single Instant than We could have had tho' we have been a thousand years Considering and Deliberating e'er we had made our Choice of our last End, and fix our Resolution to adhere to it Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So that it never lay in the power of any Man to have so Clear a Knowledg of his Duty, and so perfect and full sight of all the Motives to continue in that Duty, as the Devil and his Angels had in that one Instant. Whence, the Crime of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and his Adherents, was a Sin of pure Malice, and not mere Frailty, or mixt with Frailty; much less of Inadvertence, Speculative Ignorance, or suggested by the Soul's deprav'd Companion, the Body; as are the Sins of the Generality of Mankind, some Inconsiderable number of them excepted, whose Souls are thorowly poison'd with Spiritual Sin's

And this is the reason why <hi>GOD's</hi> Wisdom, Goodness and Justice laid so many Miracles of Mercy to save poor <hi>weak</hi> Mankind; and left the Faln Angels in the sad condition, in which they had so wilfully and desperately engulft themselves. Wisely and Justly placing it in the Order of Causes, that that Sin, which was so perfectly, and (in despite of all Motives to the contrary) so Wilfully Resolute, should be Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retractable; whereas, on the other side, Sins of mere Frailty are not hard to be repented of, when the alluring circumstance is past and gone; The same Faculty which permitted them to <hi>fall,</hi> leaving them likewise in a <hi>Plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness</hi> to reform and retract what their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, abus'd by Passion, had; perhaps either by surprize or after much struggling, (that is half unwillingly) yielded to.</p>

We can conceive them to know Themselves as <hi>most fit</hi> (under God) to preside over Humane Nature, ere they knew that <hi>a Man,</hi> by the Incarnation of the Word was to be their <hi>Head,</hi> and (as it were) take their office out
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:62043:175"/>
of their hands, and be Lord of <hi>themselves</hi> too; We can conceive them to know <hi>This</hi> (which was the cause of their Aversion from GOD) ere we can conceive them to <hi>have had</hi> that Aversion from him, for his thus Ordering things. We can conceive <hi>Lucifer,</hi> their Ring-leader, to <hi>have had</hi> that Aversion ere he <hi>propos'd</hi> his Seditious thoughts to other Angels, to debauch them from their Allegiance. We can conceive him to <hi>have</hi> Debaucht them, ere we conceive the Contrast and Battle <hi>was</hi> between <hi>Michael</hi> and his Loyal Angels, and <hi>Lucifer</hi> with his Rebellious Troops. Lastly, we can conceive this Battel fought, ere the latter black Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons were cast down from their Sublime Height into Hell. All these, I say, may be Conceiv'd to have had certain Priorities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to one another, such as those Causes and Effects use to have which are in the <hi>same Instant</hi>: So that this <hi>Single</hi> Instant of theirs is, (tho not <hi>Formally,</hi> yet) <hi>virtually,</hi> and in order to the many Indivisible Effects producible in it, Equivalent or (as we use to say) <hi>as good as</hi> a Long <hi>Series</hi> of our Time: Not by way of Quantitative <hi>Commensuration</hi> of one to the other, but by the <hi>Eminency</hi> of the <hi>Angelical Duration</hi> or Aeviternity, which is of a Superiour Nature to Body, and consequently Bodily Motion or Time; and Comprehending it <hi>all</hi> Indivisibly and Instantaneously.</p>

their Fall, can be <hi>no way</hi> Solidly explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and conformably to the nature of <hi>Pure Spirits,</hi> but by those Priorities of Nature: For since Comparisons can only be made of those Natures which are <hi>ejusdem generis</hi> we cannot Compare, or Commensurate those Actions which are <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> to the Succession found in the Actions of Bodies, which are Measurable by Time, any more than we can their <hi>Essence</hi> to the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Body</hi>; and it would be an <hi>odd</hi> Comparison to say, an Angel is as Knowing as a Horse is Strong, or as a Wall is Hard: Wherefore, [Before] and [After] which are Differences of Time or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Motion, can never be with good Sense apply'd to the Operations of Pure Spirits. Again, should we allow such Instants Succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one another, it would avail nothing: <note n="†" place="margin">B. 8.

to gratifie and please the Fancy of the Vulgar which is startled at such uncouth propositions: And this is one mane Hindrance to the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Science, when men are afraid of their own Conclusions; because the herd of vulgar Philosophers will dislike and decry them: A Fault which, I hope, I have not been Guilty of in this former Treatise; but have both <hi>avoided</hi> it my self, and have Indeavour'd to <hi>prevent</hi> it in others; by holding firmly, and directing others to hold to the right Notions or Natures of the things, and to pursue steadily the Consequences that do naturally Issue from them; how Auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward soever the Conclusions may seem, to those who take their Measures from <hi>Fancy</hi> how to frame their <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Logick,</hi> which are to direct their <hi>Reason.</hi>

with it's <hi>not-being</hi> or <hi>being False.</hi> The Former part is prov'd, because <hi>Proper Mediums</hi> only make the Conclusion <hi>Certain</hi>; and therefore such as <hi>these</hi> can only render it <hi>Probable</hi> or <hi>Likely.</hi> The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part is prov'd by every days Experience, which shows us how often we are Deceiv'd in <hi>Likelihoods</hi> or <hi>Probabilities,</hi> even though Great ones; and that the Contrary <hi>frequently</hi> happens to what such slight Grounds made us <hi>expect.</hi>

Thus Merchants venture their Effects to Sea, even in the time of War, because their State of life requires it; yet, even then, they must have Evidence that 'tis <hi>best to venture</hi>; otherwise their Reason is some way Defective.

our Neighbours; next, not to trust to Casuists whom we apprehend to have <hi>Large</hi> Cases <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to our Interest</hi>; nor to make choice of a Lawyer who is a Crafty Knave; but rather one who is reputed Honest, so he be Intelligent.

               <p n="16">16. Experience may be so Circumstanced, that it is Impossible the thing Experienced should be <hi>otherwise.</hi> For, since the Senses of Mankind, in due circumstances, are as apt to convey sincere Impressions of Sensible Objects into our Minds, as other Natural Causes to produce their Effects, they being design'd and fitted by <hi>God</hi> and Nature for that end: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that (if other Circumstances be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) it is Impossible but they should give us

such Experiential Knowledg of Sensible Matters of Fact, or Particulars, as may <hi>assure</hi> us of the things <hi>being as</hi> we Experience it. The Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances requir'd to this Absolute Assurance is, that the Object propos'd be of a thing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Sense; that it be within a Convenient Distance; and, that the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="17">17. Besides <hi>Knowledg</hi> in the Attester, there is also requisit Veracity in him to ground <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faith.</hi> For, let the Attester <hi>know</hi> the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject never so well, if we cannot be Certain he tells us <hi>True</hi> when he <hi>sayes</hi> he knows it, his Original Knowledg cannot have any Effect on us, or beget a Second-hand Knowledg in us, derivable from his Pretended Knowledg of that Object.</p>

rather than <hi>Another.</hi> And, this because Reason is our Nature given us by <hi>GOD</hi>; and, therefore, every Act of our Soul that is not <hi>for</hi> some Reason and <hi>according to</hi> Reason, is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally <hi>without Reason</hi>; that is Unnatural, that is Irrational, that is Brutal or Unbecoming a <hi>Man.</hi>

For, their Knowledg and Veracity must either be made known by <hi>Intrinsical Mediums,</hi> or by <hi>Extrinsical</hi> ones; that is by <hi>Another Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>; and the same question recurrs, How
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:62043:181"/>
we are Certain of the Knowledg and Veracity of that <hi>other</hi> Authority, and so <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Whence we must come to be certain of the Knowledg and Veracity of Authority by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsical Mediums,</hi> or we can have <hi>no</hi> Ground <hi>at all</hi> to believe any Authority. Moreover, the proper work of Reason is to <hi>Demonstrate,</hi> which is done by <hi>Intrinsical Mediums</hi>; and, unless they be <hi>Conclusive,</hi> they prove <hi>nothing,</hi> and so are <hi>good for nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. The Knowledg of the <hi>First Attesters</hi> is ascertain'd by what has been prov'd. §. §. 15.16. Their <hi>Veracity</hi> must be prov'd by shewing there <hi>could be no Apparent Good</hi> to move their Wills to deceive us; and the <hi>best</hi> proof (omitting the Impossibility of joyning in such an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Conspiracy to deceive, the Certain loss of their Credit to tell a Lie against Notorious Matters of Fact <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is the <hi>seen</hi> Impossibility of Compassing their Immediate End, which was to <hi>Deceive.</hi> Which reason is grounded on this, that no <hi>one</hi> man, who is not perfectly Frantick, acts for an End that he <hi>plainly sees</hi> Impossible to be compassed. For example, to fly to the Moon, or to swim over <hi>Thames</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Pig of Lead. Thus it is Demonstrable that all <hi>England</hi> could not Conspire to deceive those born since, in asserting to them that there was a King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, or a Long Parliament which rais'd a Civil War here; because they <hi>must see</hi> it is impossible to gain Belief of it, which was their <hi>Immediate</hi> End; (whatever <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> End they might propose to themselves) So many Records, Practices, Laws, and other
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:62043:182"/>
Consequences Issuing thence, giving them the Lie; besides the Histories of our own and other Countries; and the Concatenation of Causes and Effects in the Political part of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, all conspiring unanimously and appositly to detect the Cheat. Wherefore, the End being Evidently Impossible to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiev'd; it could never be an <hi>Apparent good</hi> to them in such a case to <hi>act</hi> for <hi>such</hi> an End, or to attempt to deceive us by Attesting it; and, therefore, they <hi>could not</hi> tell <hi>such</hi> a Lie in <hi>such</hi> a Case; therefore they were <hi>Veracious</hi> while they Attested it.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Tho' both the Knowledg and Veracity of the Attesters be Demonstrated, and, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, the thing Attested by them be most Certainly and necessarily True; yet our <hi>Assent</hi> to the Truth of that thing is neither <hi>Science</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Opinion.</hi> It cannot be <hi>Opinion,</hi> because the <hi>Medium</hi> that begets Opinion is not <hi>Necessarily</hi> Connected with the Extremes, as is found here. Nor can it be <hi>Science,</hi> because our Knowledg of the thing is not taken from the <hi>Thing it self</hi> that is attested, causing such a Notion or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in us <hi>directly</hi> by it's self, or by Reflex Knowledges upon those Direct ones (on which kind of Impressions all <hi>Science</hi> is built) but it is a Knowledg <hi>Reflected</hi> to us from <hi>Anothers Knowledg</hi> of it, or a kind of Second-hand Knowledg. Nor is the Knowledg which even the Attesters had of the Object at First-hand, a <hi>Proper Effect</hi> of the <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> which is the Object of that Knowledg. Nor is the Thing, as an Object, the <hi>Proper Cause</hi> of that Knowledg; only which can beget <hi>Science.</hi> For,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:62043:182"/>
a <hi>Proper Cause</hi> has a <hi>Real</hi> Order or Relation, to it's <hi>Proper Effect</hi>; whereas the <hi>Objects</hi> have no Real Relation at all to the <hi>Senses</hi> or our Knowing Power, as was shown above where we treated of <hi>Relation</hi>; By which we may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more clearly discover the <hi>Essential</hi> Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between <hi>Science, Faith,</hi> and <hi>Opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be objected that Intelligibility is a <hi>Property</hi> of <hi>Ens</hi>; therefore every <hi>Ens</hi> is a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> Cause of Knowledg. 'Tis answer'd that it is only a Property of <hi>Ens</hi> Negatively (as it were) in regard nothing can be understood but <hi>Ens; Non Ens</hi> not being able to cause any knowledg in us. Or, it may mean that 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Property of <hi>Ens</hi> in order to an <hi>Extrinsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> thing, not a <hi>true</hi> Property, Perfecting it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsically; as Properties due to a thing by Nature, and Springing from their Essences, do. It may be objected farther that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Powers are true Properties tho' they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>Extrinsical</hi> things on which they are to work. 'Tis answer'd, that they perfect those Entities <hi>Intrinsically,</hi> or give them some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in their Intrinsical Nature, which, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibility does not; for nothing is Intrinsically <hi>better,</hi> or <hi>otherwise</hi> than it would be, for being <hi>Known</hi> or <hi>Vnderstood.</hi> To explicate this better, we may consider that every Entity, being a <hi>Part</hi> of the World, has some Office or Place there, and some part which it is to act on the Stage of Nature. And, accordingly, Metaphysicks teach us that every Body is constituted such by it's having some <hi>Primary Operation,</hi> which 'tis fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to produce; as Fire to heat, Water to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:62043:183"/>
Cool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whence, what ever fits it for such an Operation is either Essential to it, or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty immediately Connected with it's Essence; such as are those Natural Powers objected. Now 'tis Evident that those Powers do perfect each Nature <hi>Intrinsically</hi>; since without them it would be <hi>Imperfect</hi> and <hi>Impotent</hi> to perform that which it was Essentially Ordain'd for; and so the whole course of Nature, carry'd on by such Proper Causes to Proper Effects, would be quite out of frame and Order; whereas, 'tis manifest it would suffer no detriment at all in it self, whether those Proper Causes or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects were <hi>Vnderstood</hi> or no. Which shows that their being <hi>Known</hi> by the First Attesters, or <hi>made known</hi> to us by their Knowing them, is not a <hi>Proper</hi> Effect of those Causes, nor <hi>Intrinsical</hi> to them as they are parts of Corporeal Nature, but Accidental to them as such; but yet <hi>so</hi> Accidental that it is <hi>Inseparable</hi> from them; and, so, does <hi>Necessarily</hi> infer the Conclusion.</p>
               <p n="23">23. <hi>Testimony</hi> on which Human Faith relies, is adequately divided into <hi>Living</hi> and <hi>Dead</hi>; that is into such Attesters as speak <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> and those that speak by <hi>Writing.</hi> Because there is no Common or Ordinary way but <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Written</hi> or <hi>Printed Characters</hi> by which Men can relate <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> to others, or <hi>testify</hi> to them their Knowledg of such things.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Matters of fact done long a go, if very Concerning to have the Knowledg of them Continu'd, and that they were <hi>known</hi> at first by the Experience of a <hi>great</hi> portion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, may be made known to us who live <hi>now,</hi>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:62043:183"/>
by a Delivery of them down from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Age to the succeeding One. Which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi> Testimony or Delivery of them is call'd <hi>Tradition.</hi> For, since the Generality of First Attesters, who liv'd in the same time when they happen'd, could not but <hi>know</hi> them; and the Continual Concern of them could not but still prompt and provoke <hi>Foregoers</hi> to speak of them to their <hi>Descendents</hi>; it follows, that the <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance</hi> of those Causes may still <hi>continue</hi> the same Effect, and bring the Knowledge of them down to our times.</p>
               <p n="25">25. <hi>Practise,</hi> if <hi>Frequent,</hi> and <hi>Obligatory</hi> to be Continu'd, will most certainly bring down the <hi>Tradition</hi> of Former Matters of Fact.

Such a Tradition of <hi>such</hi> Matters of Fact is <hi>Equally</hi> Certain tho' the thing Attested had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd some Thousands of Years ago, as if it had happen'd but an Hundred Years since. For, since it is equally <hi>Easie</hi> for the succeeding Age to understand the Attesters, Witnessing still all along that they had been <hi>told</hi> it, as it was to understand the First Attesters relating they had <hi>seen</hi> it; Their Testimony, as far as concerns their <hi>Knowledge</hi> of what was transmitted, has <hi>equal</hi> force as had the <hi>First</hi> Attestation: And, since the Wills of the Intermediate Attesters

No <hi>Dead</hi> Testimony or <hi>History</hi> has any Authority, but by virtue of <hi>Living</hi> Testimony or <hi>Tradition.</hi> For, since Falshoods may be <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> or <hi>Printed</hi> as well as Truths, it follows that nothing is therefore of any Authority, because 'tis Written or Printed.

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:62043:185"/>
prudence Contradict them, but let them pass as if they were Truths, till some good occasion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakens our Doubt of them: The reason is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in our last Paragraph, from this, that all Particulars are of slight Credit that were not Abetted by a <hi>Large</hi> and <hi>well-grounded</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Tradition thus qualify'd as is above-said, <hi>viz.</hi> So that the Matters of Fact were Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Experienced by <hi>very great</hi> Multitudes of the First Attesters; that they were of <hi>great</hi> or <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Concern,</hi> and so prompting them still to relate them to the next Age; that they were Abetted by some <hi>obligatory Practise</hi>; and, lastly Impossible to gain a Belief, if they had not <hi>been</hi>; and thence, <hi>Obliging</hi> the Attesters to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity: <hi>Such</hi> a Tradition, I say, is <hi>more than Morally,</hi> that is, <hi>Absolutely Certain.</hi> To omit the foregoing reasons, which have evinc'd the force of each of these particulars. This will be Evidently <hi>seen,</hi> or rather Experientially <hi>felt</hi>; by Reflecting on our own Interiour; and by observing how <hi>Nature</hi> works in Mankind and <hi>forces</hi> them <hi>to Assent firmly</hi> to the points which such a Tradition recommends, and to <hi>Suspend</hi> as to the other. For Instance; Let us take some Particular that is only <hi>Morally Certain</hi>; as, that I shall not dye this Night; or, that when I walk abroad a Tile shall not fall from a House, and kill me; or, that the House I live in shall not fall down and crush me; or such like. I find at first sight, that these are <hi>highly Vnlikely,</hi> because it <hi>very seldom</hi> happens; and many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may occurr why <hi>I think</hi> it will not be;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:62043:185"/>
Yet if I severely call to account my most Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Deliberate thoughts to find any <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely Certain</hi> Reason, why that may not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to me which has happen'd to others; I shall perceive that I can find <hi>none</hi> such. Whence, I can entertain <hi>some Degree of Suspence,</hi> whether it may not possibly happen to me or no; which <hi>restrains</hi> me from Assenting <hi>absolutely</hi> that it <hi>will not.</hi> This duely reflected on, let us propose to our selves Another Particular, to be scann'd likewise by our most strictly-examining Thoughts: <hi>viz.</hi> whether there was a <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> a <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> or that <hi>Alexander</hi> conquer'd <hi>Asia.</hi> Which being propos'd to our Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let us again consult our Thoughts, and put on the most Sceptical Disquisitiveness we are able, to find out some reason, why these may not <hi>possibly</hi> be False, as well as the others might. And, in despight of all our most Exact search, and our utmost endeavours to put our selves upon <hi>doubting</hi> of these said particulars, we shall still find the Affirmative of <hi>each</hi> of them writ in our Breast in such <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> Characters, and so <hi>Solidly</hi> Imprinted there by Nature (I say, by <hi>Nature,</hi> for that Certainty was not Acquir'd by <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>) that we can never be able to invent <hi>any</hi> kind of Reason that can breed in us the <hi>least degree of Suspense,</hi> as to the Verity of these, and such like Matters of Fact; or <hi>unfix</hi> us from our <hi>most stedfast</hi> Adherence to them as <hi>most Certain Truths.</hi> Which shows Evidently that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were only <hi>Morally Certain,</hi> that is, had <hi>some</hi> Contingency in them, and so, might <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly</hi>

be otherwise than we, till we came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, <hi>deem'd</hi> them; whereas those Latter were <hi>more than Morally,</hi> that is <hi>Absolutely</hi> Certain; because, after the most accurate Reflexion, we could not invent, and heartily embrace, <hi>any</hi> Ground or Reason to admit the <hi>least Suspence</hi> as to their Truth; nor <hi>how</hi> or <hi>why</hi> they might <hi>possibly</hi> be False, or (which is the same) that the Testimony or <hi>Tradition</hi> for them could be <hi>Fallacious.</hi>

Hence we may make a farther Discovery of the force of Practical Self-evidence instill'd by Nature without Study: and, that it is a <hi>solid</hi> Knowledge of the <hi>An est</hi> of the thing Attested, and, consequently, of the Conclusive Force of Tradition, as also of many other Truths; the <hi>Quid est</hi> of which (or the Grounds on which our Rational Nature Unreflectingly, and as it were, <hi>at unawares</hi> proceeded,) is to be Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by Learned Men, looking exactly into <hi>Intrinsecal Mediums</hi>; and thence discovering how this Effect, <hi>viz.</hi> such a <hi>Firm Adhesion,</hi> was wrought in us Connaturally; or <hi>why</hi> such an Authority <hi>could not</hi> deceive us in Attesting such Particulars.</p>
               <p>Note, That some of these Matters of Fact now mention'd, do fall short as to some of the best Qualifications found in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse <hi>other</hi> Traditions; <hi>viz.</hi> as to that of their being <hi>Practical.</hi> Which gives us farther light to discern the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Strength of <hi>Tradition,</hi> and how

               <head>LESSON IX. Of <hi>Assent,</hi> Suspence, Certainty and Uncertainty.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Notion of Potentiality, Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Indetermination, and Uncertainty, <hi>as conceiv'd to be in the Thing,</hi> are one and the <hi>same</hi>; For, if the Thing be consider'd meerly as a <hi>Power</hi> to be <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That,</hi> or to be <hi>thus</hi> or <hi>thus,</hi> 'tis evident from the Terms that it is not (as thus conceiv'd,) Actually, Particularly, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately or Certainly <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>thus</hi>; since all Difference, Determination, and, consequently, Certainty in the <hi>thing</hi> (which, if well refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on, <hi>are</hi> no more but it's <hi>being what it is</hi>) do spring from the <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Form</hi>; as all Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, Indifferency, Indetermination and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of being <hi>this,</hi> or being <hi>thus,</hi> does from the <hi>Matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Existence, as being the <hi>Last Actuality,</hi> takes away all Potentiality, Indifferency, and Uncertainty of being <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>thus</hi> that can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be in the Thing. This is as Evident as 'tis that Perfect Light takes away Darkness, or, that any Opposit is Inconsistent with the other Opposit in the same kind; or, to come nearer our point, that <hi>what is,</hi> has, while <hi>it is,</hi> lost all Potentiality or Power of <hi>not being</hi> while it is.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:62043:187"/>3. Wherefore, considering the Thing <hi>as it is in our Vnderstanding,</hi> it remains <hi>Indeterminate</hi> and <hi>Vncertain</hi> to us; that is, our Understanding, which is Inform'd by it, is <hi>Potential</hi> or <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate</hi> it self; and consequently, <hi>we</hi> are <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Intellectually</hi> till we <hi>see it is.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because all our Knowledg is <hi>Intirely</hi> and Adequately taken from the <hi>Thing,</hi> which makes the Understanding Conformable to it according to the degree of Clearness or Obscurity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is represented to us, or affects us: Whence follows, that, when we <hi>see</hi> the Existence of the Thing, or that <hi>it is,</hi> our Understanding is <hi>ultimately Determinate,</hi> that is, we are <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Certain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore, on the contrary, while we see the Thing <hi>may not be</hi> for ought we know, our Understanding is Indeterminate as to it's <hi>Being</hi>; that is, we must remain <hi>Vncertain</hi> that <hi>it is.</hi> For, 'tis against a First Principle of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that the Thing <hi>may not be</hi> and <hi>be</hi> at once.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore, [<hi>Assent</hi>] being the Judging that a thing <hi>is,</hi> all that passes in us (if we act Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally) is <hi>Suspence</hi> till we come to a Proof that Concludes <hi>it is.</hi> This is manifest from the Terms; For the Words [Suspending of Assent] do show that, take away <hi>all</hi> Suspence, <hi>Assent</hi> succeeds: and, consequently, that (unless it so happens that we see a thing to be clearly False) <hi>all</hi> is <hi>Suspence</hi> till we come at <hi>Assent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore all Common and Remote <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums,</hi> which are only apt to ground <hi>Opinion,</hi> being unable to conclude the Thing <hi>is</hi>; they
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:62043:188"/>
are, consequently, unable to <hi>Determin</hi> the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that the Thing is, and, therefore, they must leave it (if it works rationally) in <hi>some degree</hi> of Suspence; Indetermination or (which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> same) in <hi>Vncertainty.</hi> This is Evident; because such Proofs do reach only to show the thing <hi>Likely to be,</hi> which falls short of it's Being <hi>really</hi> and <hi>Indeed</hi>; for <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood to be</hi> is not the Notion of <hi>Being,</hi> since [what <hi>is,</hi> most <hi>Certainly is</hi>] which goes beyond <hi>all</hi> Likelihoods, how great soever they may be imagin'd to be.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Suspence may be consider'd as Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently <hi>hovering</hi> between the Things <hi>being</hi> or <hi>not being,</hi> or without Inclining to <hi>either</hi> of them. For, sometimes we have <hi>no</hi> kind of Reason inclining us to the Likelihood of the <hi>one</hi> more than of the <hi>other.</hi> As we experience it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to us as to our Determining whether the Number of the Stars be Even or Odd.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Hence Assent consists in an <hi>Indivisible</hi> (as does also <hi>Dissent,</hi> or a Judgment that the thing <hi>is not</hi>) but all <hi>Suspense</hi> is <hi>Divisible</hi> or Capable of Different <hi>Degrees.</hi> The former part is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, because it's proper Object, [<hi>is</hi>] or [<hi>being</hi>] is Indivisible, as is also the Object of Dissent [<hi>is not,</hi>] whereas the Objects of <hi>Suspence</hi> are seeming Distances from the things being <hi>so</hi> Actually, or Approaches towards it; or in Dissent, Approaches towards it's seeming <hi>not to be so</hi>; that is, Removes from it's <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:62043:188"/>
from, or Approaching to, the Actual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Thing. For this Indifferent Suspense, by it's being Indifferent, is a kind of <hi>Genus</hi> to the others, and abstracts from them both; and therefore, the Differences of it must be <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> in that kind.</p>

                  <hi>Corol.</hi> I. The Disinclining towards Assent or Inclining towards Dissent that the thing <hi>is,</hi> is call'd <hi>Doubt</hi>; and, if the Being of that Thing is our <hi>Good,</hi> it grounds that Passion call'd <hi>Fear</hi> of loosing it. And, the Inclining towards Assent in such a Case, or Disinclining to Dissent, causes a disposition in the Understanding <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to Doubt</hi>; which, (tho we want a name for it) is a certain chearing Glimpse in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, which was in perfect Darkness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and grounds that Passion which we call <hi>Hope.</hi> Both which Passions are Rational or Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational, according as the <hi>Likelihoods</hi> on which they are built are <hi>Great</hi> or <hi>Slight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Those Different Inclinations or Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Understanding towards the Things <hi>being</hi> or <hi>not being</hi> may be taken from Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Heads: <hi>viz.</hi> From the meer Frequency or Seldomness of the things Happening; from Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical Relations unabetted by Tradition; from Rumour and Common Talk; from Writers of Uncertain Authority, or proceeding upon Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation or Opinion; from the Multitude of such Authors as do not so much as <hi>pretend</hi> to know, yet are of great Name or Authority; from the bare Sentiments of Antiquity; from relying on our Nurses, Parents or Tutors; from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:62043:189"/>
Monuments, Inscriptions, Fables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From Misconceits deluding our Fancy; from Equivocation of words; from Interest and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; from ill-agreeing Observations made by our selves of the same happening in a like case; from Mistakes of Proper Causes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which agree in this that they are <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Remote Mediums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Some Degrees of Suspense are so <hi>small</hi> and Indiscernable, that they are not easie to be discover'd, so that they <hi>counterfeit</hi> an Assent even in the Wisest, and cause a <hi>Real</hi> Assent in Weak People. Such as are the Instances of Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty mention'd <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 3. §. 30.</note> above.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The way to discover whether they be <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents</hi> or <hi>Suspences</hi> is to <hi>Reflect</hi> on our own Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and to study better our careless thoughts, by asking our selves what <hi>Certain Ground</hi> we had for them. For, 'tis Evident that we have many Effects wrought in us by <hi>Nature,</hi> which, for want of Reflexion, we are not aware of; in regard our Thoughts, and the several natures of them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly be known but by <hi>Reflexion.</hi> For, to use our former Example, we seem to Assent Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely that we shall <hi>not dye</hi> this Night; and even the Wisest Men, if they be now in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, do seem to take it to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Certain,</hi> or (to speak more properly) that themselves are Absolutely Certain of it; yet, upon recourse to their Grounds, finding themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to fathom the <hi>Series</hi> of Hidden Causes and the multitude of Casualties that may occur, which they habitually knew <hi>before-hand</hi> that they did not certainly know; we shall find
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:62043:189"/>
that, notwithstanding this <hi>seeming</hi> Assent of theirs, they yet retain'd some small <hi>Degree</hi> of Suspence whether it might happen or no, which hinder'd them from truly Assenting.</p>
               <p n="13">13. From what's said it appears that <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> is a Qualification of Assent, giving it it's best perfection by <hi>Securing</hi> it from <hi>Errour</hi>; and making it, at the same time, Incapable of <hi>ever</hi> admitting the <hi>least</hi> Degree of Suspence. For, since our Assent may hap to be, and oft-times is, upon Irrational and Inconclusive Grounds; which expose it, when discover'd, to the shame of a future Retractation; but <hi>Certain</hi> Assent, cannot be liable to that Hazard and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, because what's <hi>Certain to us,</hi> is <hi>True beyond all Peradventure</hi>; it is evident that <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> superadds to Assent the <hi>highest</hi> Perfection that can be.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Certainty may either be consider'd as it is in the <hi>Object</hi> or the <hi>Thing</hi>; or else, as it is in the <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Person</hi> who is Ascertain'd by by that Object.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Certainty on the <hi>Objects</hi> side is nothing but the Things being Determinately <hi>what it is,</hi> or <hi>as it is.</hi> This is in a manner Self-evident; For every thing that <hi>is,</hi> is <hi>Determinate</hi>; and it's being Fixt to be <hi>such,</hi> is to be <hi>Certainly</hi> such of it's own Nature; independently on any thing but on the First Cause Establishing that Nature <hi>to be what it is</hi>; or ordering it, by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Causes, to be <hi>as it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. Certainty on the <hi>Subject</hi>'s side is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of our Understanding to this Objective Certainty. For, we can neither be Certain nor

               </p>

               <p n="19">19. Hence follows, that that Certainty they Nick-name [<hi>Moral</hi>] is in reality, <hi>Vncertainty.</hi> For, since all Certainty has for it's Object or Cause the Existence of the Thing on which all true Assent is grounded; and this, consisting in an <hi>Indivisible</hi> has <hi>no Degrees</hi>; it follows that as when you step never so little out of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of [is] which is its Object, you plunge into [is not] so you no sooner relinguish (tho' never so little) the true Notion of <hi>Certainty</hi> but you fall into <hi>Vncertainty,</hi> in regard the Object of it permits <hi>no degrees</hi> of passing from <hi>one</hi> to the <hi>other,</hi> or Approaching to it nearer by little and little. Wherefore, since Moral Certainty imports some <hi>Diminution</hi> of True Certainty, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be <hi>some kind,</hi> or <hi>some degree</hi> of Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, Whence to say [<hi>I am morally certain of a Thing</hi>] is, in rigour, the same Nonsense as it is to say <hi>I am Vncertainly Certain,</hi> or (which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to it) <hi>I ignorantly know, I suspendingly</hi> or hoveringly <hi>Assent, I diffidently believe</hi> or can <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably demonstrate.</hi> Wherefore, when in common speech men use to say they are <hi>morally certain,</hi> 'tis a Catachrestical phrase, and signifies only that the thing is <hi>highly likely,</hi> or that they <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline strongly</hi> to think 'tis True.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Hence follows, that <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> are all one, or the <hi>self-same</hi> Notion. For, since Nothing sounds more contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense of Mankind than to say, we are <hi>Certain of any thing peradventure,</hi> Certainty must be such a <hi>Fixure</hi> of the Mind, as to the Existence
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:62043:192"/>
of the Thing, as is <hi>beyond</hi> all Peradventures of being Deceiv'd in that thing, or beyond all Contingency that it may happen to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than we are Certain <hi>it is.</hi> Again, since Certainty is the Immediate Effect of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Thing, and the thing is <hi>Infallibly,</hi> what <hi>it self is</hi>; and our knowledg of a Thing (it being Essentially a Conformity to that thing) is Infallibly <hi>as the Thing is</hi>: it follows demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively that <hi>Certainty,</hi> which <hi>determins</hi> and <hi>fixes</hi> our Understanding by such a Knowledg, or a Knowledg so grounded, must be likewise <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</hi> Lastly, (to omit many other Conclusive Proofs) If Infallibility and Certainty be not the <hi>same</hi> Notion, then they are <hi>different</hi> Notions; that is, [Infallible] is one of the <hi>Differences</hi> of Certainty, distinguishing it from other sorts or <hi>Species</hi> of Certainty; wherefore there must (in that supposition) be another <hi>species</hi> of Certainty which is <hi>not Infallible</hi>; that is, (since what is not Infallible must be Fallible) there must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Species</hi> of Certainty which is <hi>Fallible Certainty</hi>; But this is against the <hi>Common Sense</hi> and Language of Mankind; nor can there be greater Nonsense than to say, <hi>I am Fallibly Certain</hi> of such a Thing; nor, (though there could not want occasions to use such words) was it ever <hi>heard</hi> or <hi>read</hi> since the Creation that any man did ever joyn these two words [<hi>Fallibly</hi> and <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>] together in their Discourses and Writings. Therefore, [<hi>Infallible</hi>] is not a <hi>Difference</hi> of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as its <hi>Genus</hi> or (which the same) a Notion <hi>Different</hi> from it; whence 'tis Logically demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated

that it is the <hi>same</hi> Notion with it, or that <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> are all one.</p>
               <p>Quaere. Why is [Infallible] then added to [Certainty] if it have no <hi>Different</hi> Signification from it, or do not add <hi>some degree</hi> of Certainty to it? Or why does Mankind use such a needless Tautology? 'Tis answer'd; We may observe that though to say <hi>I am Infallibly Certain of such a Thing,</hi> sutes very well with the Notions and the Sense and Language of Mankind, yet men never use it but when some Circumstance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it to put others out of all <hi>possible Doubt</hi> of the Thing in question: And then Nature puts them upon Redoubling, as it were, their Words or Expressions to assure them of their Certainty of that Thing. Thus in such Cases, they use to say, <hi>I know it, I tell you once again, I know it to be so</hi>; or, they think it not enough to say bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>I saw it,</hi> or <hi>I heard it,</hi> but they express them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thus, <hi>I saw it with my own eyes</hi>; or <hi>I heard it with my own ears</hi>; which, were it not on such an occasion, would seem foolish and Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical; since no man can see but <hi>with</hi> his <hi>own Eyes,</hi> nor hear but <hi>with</hi> his <hi>own Ears:</hi> Or, it may be answer'd that some men use in such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to joyn [<hi>Infallible</hi>] to [<hi>Certainty</hi>] to signifie <hi>True Certainty,</hi> and to distinguish it from that <hi>Mock-Certainty</hi> call'd <hi>Moral</hi>; which must be a <hi>Fallible</hi> Certainty if it be <hi>any</hi> Certainty <hi>at all,</hi> that is, an <hi>Vncertain Certainty.</hi> Whence, since Mankind never us'd such a phrase as <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly Certain,</hi> though they might have had many occasions to do so, had it not been Chimerical and Nonsense, and against their Natural Notion
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:62043:193"/>
of Certainty; we may hence farther demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate (in confirmation of our 19th. Sect.) that <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> being (if any) a <hi>Fallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> is <hi>no</hi> kind of Certainty <hi>at all</hi>; and that 'tis as great Non-sense to say <hi>Morally Certain</hi> (meaning by those words such a Certainty as we may be Deceiv'd in) as to say <hi>Fallibly Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>; and it would be as much abhorr'd by Mankind, were not the Phrase cloak'd, and the sense of it clouded by the Unintelligible Notion of the word [<hi>Moral</hi>] which, as they use it, has no <hi>determinate</hi> Bounds; and so it cannot be <hi>Defin'd,</hi> nor Consequently <hi>distinctly Vnderstood.</hi> Nor (as far as I have observ'd) do we read such an Expression in the Antient Latin Authors, either Heathens or Christians, but the word <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risimilitude</hi> or <hi>Likelihood</hi> only; which is not so apt to impose upon Learners or Readers; till some late Speculaters being most of them <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> and blundering between Certainty and Uncertainty, invented this odd Mixture call'd <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> which should be partly the <hi>one,</hi> partly the <hi>other.</hi> To which they were forced by their bad Speculation, and the Care of their Credit: For, it was highly opprobrious to say they had <hi>No Certainty at all</hi> in their Writings; and it was Impossible for such Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Discoursers to show any thing <hi>truly Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> because they durst not undertake to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate</hi> any thing; and, therefore, to uphold their Repute on some fashion, they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to advance this Ambidextrous Notion of <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> which might be either <hi>Certain</hi> or <hi>Vncertain</hi> as occasion serv'd. Whereas, (as
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:62043:193"/>
has been shown above) they might with full as much reason have invented a Compound of [<hi>is</hi>] and [<hi>is not</hi>] which would have done a great kindness to Scepticism, and have been a most excellent ground to verifie Contradictions. Nor is this spoken in the air; Diverse of them have made many great steps towards this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Exploit to un-man Mankind by their put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Vacuum,</hi> Imaginary Space, Subsistent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions, Negative Entities and such Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras to have a <hi>being</hi>; tho', either directly or by consequence, they have been manifested to be <hi>Pure Nothings.</hi> And as they dealt with the Notion of <hi>Ens</hi> by confounding it with <hi>Non En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,</hi> so they labour hard to do the same with the Notion of <hi>Existence</hi> too, as is seen above. For they are utterly destroying the Notion of [<hi>is</hi>] and the Truth of this Proposition [<hi>what is, is</hi>] while all their Sceptical Discourses would have those best Perfections of our Understanding (I mean Certainties) that are Immediately grounded on, and correspond to, the <hi>being</hi> of the Thing, to be <hi>possible not to be</hi> as the thing <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>possible to be False</hi>; which they must be, if the Notion of <hi>Certainty</hi> may be compounded with <hi>Moral.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Note that this Proposition [what is True can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be False] does hold in <hi>all</hi> Truths, but those which are in <hi>materia contingenti</hi>; as, when we say to day [it Rains] this Proposition may be False <hi>to morrow,</hi> when it is <hi>Fair</hi>; because the <hi>Matter</hi> or Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> the Temper of the Air on which it is built, is <hi>Alter'd.</hi> But, this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception has no place in <hi>Speculative</hi> Truths; which Abstract from such Contingency, and are grounded on our <hi>Natural</hi> Notions, or the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

               <p>DIsputation must be fitted to the Occasions, and to the Ends, we aim at; which may be either to <hi>clear Truth</hi> by combating our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary with <hi>down-right Reason</hi>; or only to gain a <hi>Victory</hi> over the Defendant by <hi>Stratagem.</hi> The manners of Disputing may be shown by putting Four Cases or Circumstances which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Method of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the Defendent holds a <hi>False Thesis,</hi> the way to convince him will not be Difficult, if the Doctrin deliver'd above be well consider'd and dexterously made use of. For, if a fit Middle Term be taken and rightly placed, the Conclusion will necessarily follow against him; so that he will be certainly overthrown, and his Cause lost. But, if the Disputant be so Skilful as to Reduce his Discourse to Identical Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, he will not have the face to own his Position any longer; the First Lights of Nature standing so Evidently against him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To know in what Mood we are to frame our Syllogism, we must take the Proposition which is Contradictory to the Defendents Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; and, by the Certain Rules given as <note n="*" place="margin">B. 2. L. 2.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, it will be easie to know in which of the Four Moods such a Conclusion is to be prov'd.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:62043:195"/>
For Example, suppose the Defendent holds that [Some Body is Unchangeable] you must take and prove the Contradictory to it, <hi>viz.</hi> [No Body is Unchangeable] which being an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Negative, and withal the Proposition which is to be the Conclusion, it can only be prov'd in <hi>Celarent</hi>; as
<list type="syllogism">
                     <item>Ce-No Divisible thing is Unchangeable; but</item>
                     <item>la-Every Body is a Divisible thing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</item>
                     <item>rent-No Body is Unchangeable.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The same Method must be taken if the Defendent absolutely denies any of the Premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the First Syllogism, or any of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ones; or, if, by Distinguishing, he alters the more Universal or Ambiguous Proposition, to a more Determinate one; Only you must not now take the Contradictory to it, as you did at first, for then it was your <hi>Adversary's</hi> Proposition which you were to <hi>disprove,</hi> now 'tis your <hi>own</hi> which you are to <hi>prove</hi>; and, therefore, you must take your Measures now from it self. For example; if he Denies the <hi>Minor,</hi> which was an Universal Affirmative, you must prove it in <hi>Barbara,</hi> thus.</p>
               <list type="syllogism">
                  <item>Every Quantitative thing is Divisible, but</item>
                  <item>Every Body is a Quantitative thing; therefore</item>
                  <item>Every Body is Divisible.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:62043:196"/>4. Besides the having a <hi>Middle Term,</hi> and knowing in what <hi>Form</hi> to argue, some other Rules must be Observ'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Get an Exact <hi>Notion</hi> of the Terms of the Proposition under debate; that is, consider well in <hi>what</hi> Common Head they are, and <hi>how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd</hi>; which is the same as to look attentively into the Nature of the Thing. For this will best furnish you with Proper <hi>Mediums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Agree before-hand with the Defendent about the Meaning of the Words which express those Terms; which is the most Solid way of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Question,</hi> and of avoiding Wordish Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. See the <hi>Mediums</hi> be <hi>Proper</hi> or <hi>Immediate</hi>; otherwise, not being well connected, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>Conclude</hi> certainly, although the Form be <hi>right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Take heed of Equivocation of Words; For, otherwise, you will hazard to be carry'd aside from the True State of the Question, and lose sight of the true Nature of the Thing by mistaking one Notion for another; and, so, you will be certainly non-plust. And, the <hi>longer</hi> you dispute, the <hi>farther</hi> still you will <hi>err.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Observe well the Doctrin of <hi>Dividing</hi> right, and be sure that each Member of the Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he brings, has in it the true Notion of the Term Divided or Distinguisht. Otherwise he will baffle and confound you with impertinent Distinctions, introduce a new Question, and put you besides your Argument. For example, if he distinguishes Space into <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Imaginary,</hi> and obtains of you to admit Imaginary Space
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:62043:196"/>
for <hi>one kind</hi> of Space (which is in reality No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) he will defeat your Argument, and put you to fight against the Air; while, by getting you to admit <hi>Non ens</hi> for <hi>Ens,</hi> he may answer or say any thing. You have lost all your strength when you forego <hi>Nature,</hi> and suffer your Natural Notions to be <hi>perverted.</hi> The same may be said of the Distinction of <hi>Ens</hi> into <hi>Positivum</hi> and <hi>Negativum</hi> which is plainly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish <hi>Ens,</hi> into <hi>Ens</hi> and <hi>Non Ens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. When the Defendent grants any thing, then to lay up in careful memory his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, and make use of them against him to force him to <hi>admit Truth</hi> or <hi>retract.</hi> For, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, he may perhaps in the beginning of the Dispute yield candidly to diverse things; which, afterwards, when he finds himself pincht and reduced to streights, he will flatly deny.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To be true to your Cause, and to seek the Victory of <hi>Truth</hi> over <hi>Error,</hi> rather than your <hi>own</hi> over your <hi>Adversary</hi>; that is, to <hi>hold</hi> him still <hi>to the Point,</hi> and to pursue the Eviction of that; and not, leaving that pursuit, to catch the Adversary at advantages, and follow on that game to show him Weak and Self-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory; (tho' it is not amiss to hint, and then wave it) as is the less-laudable way of those who fall to argue <hi>ad hominem.</hi> Yet, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the Person happens to weigh more with his Followers than the Strength of his Reasons, and that he is held <hi>Obstinate</hi> and to want Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; it may be a Duty to Truth, and to the Cause, to Expose him to Contempt by Baffling him.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:62043:197"/>8. To reflect that, tho' the Words in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon have the same Sence; yet, as standing in the Context, it may have diverse Constructions, and so cause that Fallacy we call <hi>Amphibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. That not only <hi>Single</hi> words and Sentences may be Ambiguous, but there may lurk an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation even in the <hi>Connexion</hi> it self; as when the Middle Term is Accidentally joyn'd to one Extreme by [<hi>is</hi>] and Essentially to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thus far of Disputation when the Defendent holds a <hi>False Tenet</hi>; which is the only Method an Honest Man, whose sole End is to evince Truth and beat down Error, ought to take. The following ways are more becoming vain <hi>Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> whose aim it is to <hi>combat Truth</hi> on any Fashion.

               <p n="5">5. The second Case then is when the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent holds a <hi>True</hi> point. v. g. [that <hi>there are Angels</hi>] and yet holds a <hi>False</hi> one Inconsistent with it. v. g. that [That which is <hi>no where</hi> (or in no place) <hi>is not.</hi>] The Disputant, if craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may make use of this False <hi>Thesis</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the True one, Thus

The Third Case is, when the Defendent does not hold an Inconsistent <hi>Thesis,</hi> yet he is Ignorant of the <hi>Antecedents</hi> and <hi>Consequents</hi> of his Tenet. In which case, if the Defendent can be brought to <hi>deny</hi> some Truth necessarily Connected with his <hi>Thesis,</hi> he will be forc'd to deny the <hi>Thesis</hi> it self. As, put case the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent holds that <hi>GOD,</hi> our Creator, is Infinitly Perfect in himself; yet, through want of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, is Ignorant that <hi>GOD</hi> has no <hi>Real</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Creatures; and therefore that the word [<hi>Creator</hi>] apply'd to him is meerly an Extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Denomination, and no ways Intrinsecally perfecting Him or affecting him; such a Man may be in danger of foregoing his Christian Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net by this Argument.</p>

The Fourth is, when the Defendent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands only his <hi>own Thesis,</hi> and is in a manner Ignorant of <hi>all others.</hi> For example; Let us suppose that some Defendent by the Language of Christianity, with which he is imbu'd, or by some Solid Discourse he has accidently heard, and (though not Learned yet) having a good Mother-wit is made well Understand, does
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:62043:198"/>
hold that <hi>GOD</hi> is <hi>Vnchangeable</hi>; but yet, being not us'd to Disputes or Speculative Reflexions, he is little verst in other points; as in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Christian Language</hi> in Spiritual Points, of which, consequently, we have no Natural Notions; and therefore is not aware that all our Words we use when we speak of them are Equivocal and Improper; and, especially, when we speak of <hi>GOD, highly Metaphorical</hi>: Such a man, no better qualify'd, may be stumbled and perhaps made forego that Evident and True Tenet by a Contentious alledging things very Forrein which he not skilful in, and then backing them with Authority, on this manner. What is not GOD <hi>Pleas'd</hi> when we do well, and when we Sin becomes <hi>displeas'd</hi>; that is, <hi>changes</hi> from being Pleas'd to be Angry; and, when we repent, is he not <hi>Pleas'd again?</hi> Will or dare you deny that which Scripture, Fathers, Catechisms, Prayer-books, and Sermons do so often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and the Consent of all good Christians does Unanimously and Constantly avow? Why are we afraid of <hi>Sinning,</hi> but for fear of losing <hi>GOD</hi>'s Favour, and of a Friend making him become our Enemy? Will any but a Heretick deny this? Again; is not <hi>GOD</hi> Omnipotent? cannot he do all things? 'Tis an Article of our Creed he both <hi>is</hi> and <hi>can</hi>; since then <hi>to change Himself</hi> is to do <hi>Something</hi>; will you <hi>stint</hi> GOD's Omnipotence, and say there is Something he <hi>cannot do?</hi> Such Insulting Talk as this, tho' there be never a wise word in it, working upon the Weakness of half-witted People, may hap to make them forego their True Tenet; and even fright them

These three last Cases inform us how dangerous it is that any man be allowed to be <hi>Truth</hi>'s <hi>Champion,</hi> and to undertake her cause, unless he be thorow-pac'd in Logick, and such other knowledges as are requisit to defend her; lest Truth it self Suffer for the Confident Weakness of the Unable Undertaker.</p>

                  <hi>Corol.</hi> II. This last Case belongs to such Disputants, who, to maintain Absurd and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible things, do use to argue from Divine Omnipotence; by alledging and magnifying <hi>which,</hi> they hope to fright the Piety of a well-meaning, but <hi>weak,</hi> Defendent to admit any thing though never so Senseless or Ridiculous. The way to answer these men, is to show the Effect to be contrary to our Natural Notions, and, consequently, to the Wise Conduct of the World, which was the Cause of those Notions; And, therefore, what <hi>GOD can do,</hi> or <hi>cannot do,</hi> is nothing to the purpose, unless the thing in question be Agreeable to his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> which determin his <hi>Power</hi> to act; and without which it cannot be that he should act. Whence it is generally more Safe, more Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and more Proper, to say in such Cases; that <hi>it cannot be that GOD should will to do such a thing,</hi> than bluntly to say <hi>GOD cannot do it.</hi> For, This flatly <hi>limits</hi> Omnipotency; That only <hi>restrains</hi> its exerting it self <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> because of some Attribute of the Divine Nature to which 'tis Disagreeable.

               <p>The Common answer is to distinguish the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> both; and to say, that what

which, in easier Language, is the attempting to <hi>prove</hi> what's <hi>not in question</hi>; or, putting upon our Adversary to hold a Tenet he never own'd nor held; as it usually passes among Passionate Discourses and Scolds, when they object to others what they neither held nor thought, that they may the more easily confute them or render them Odious. This is avoided in disputes by <hi>Stating the Question right,</hi> and by <hi>Agreeing</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand in the Signification of the <hi>Words</hi> in which the Question is conceiv'd; as was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the second and third Rule.

it must be perform'd <hi>one</hi> of the ways Assign'd; when, perhaps, there is <hi>Another</hi> way how that thing may be done, which was never assign'd, but either Unthought of or Neglected. As, if it should be asserted that Motion must either happen by Atoms descending in an Immense <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or by the Impression of so much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Mass of Matter at First by GOD, and his Continuing it ever since; when as a third way may be assign'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that a <hi>Created Intelligent Being</hi> Causes, and all along, Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, the Motion of the first-moved Bodies, which move the rest.

               </p>
               <p n="14">14. The Fifth is called <hi>non causa pro causa.</hi> That is, in plain terms, the bringing a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> that does not Conclude; or the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Conclusion follows from a <hi>Medium</hi> that cannot necessarily inferr it. This Fallacy, if it must be call'd so, happens chiefly to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philosophers; who, going by meer Induction, and laying no Evident or Certain Principles of Nature, <hi>a priori,</hi> to guide their Thoughts by, but Hypothetical ones only; do, hence, refund all the Effects of Nature into false-pretended Causes; whence every man who sets up a <hi>new Scheme,</hi> does still assign new Reasons or Causes, according to which he strives to Explicate Nature, and into which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to Resolve all the several Productions and Effects of it. But, why this should be call'd
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:62043:201"/>
a <hi>Fallacy,</hi> I cannot comprehend. At this rate every Argument that does not Conclude may be call'd a <hi>Fallacy.</hi> For, since the Premisses in a Demonstrative Syllogism are the <hi>Cause</hi> of the Conclusion; whoever argues <hi>ill,</hi> argues <hi>Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously</hi>; and assigns a wrong Cause, by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing an Incompetent <hi>Medium.</hi> But, in case the Disputant puts it upon the Defendent to have made use of such a Ground as he never meant, it is then enough to <hi>deny</hi> it; and put him to <hi>prove</hi> that that was <hi>indeed</hi> his Ground, as was pretended.</p>

The Seventh Fallacy is when the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent argues <hi>à dicto secundum quid ad dictum sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter.</hi> Which kind of Fallacy is the Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principle that begets the Vice of <hi>Pride,</hi> and therefore is peculiar to all Proud People. For the sin of Pride does not consist in Knowing what Endowments any one <hi>truly has,</hi> or Estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himself as having such Endowments; for this is a Truth; and did he not <hi>know</hi> it, and what degree of Perfection it adds to him, he would neither strive to perfect himself, nor know how much he is particularly bound to Love and Thank GOD, who bestow'd on him those Accomplishments or Advantages above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But Pride, (as all other Vices have) has a <hi>Lye</hi> for it's Principle; and consists in this, that a Proud Person <hi>over values</hi> himself, and Preferrs himself <hi>Absolutely</hi> before all others; that is, <hi>Concludes</hi> himself to be the very <hi>Best,</hi> or <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> than others, and to deserve more Esteem than they, because he is Good or Estimable <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid,</hi> or in some particular which is far short of rendring him so highly Estimable. Thus, some self-conceited Lady Esteems or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes her self to be the Best Woman in all the Country, because she has a New-fashion'd Gown, or is Finer, Handsomer, or Richer than others. Thus a King or Lord preferrs himself <hi>absolutely</hi>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:62043:202"/>
before all others, because he has more Power, or can reckon up more Titles than others can. Thus a Great Scholar who is <hi>Proud,</hi> values himself <hi>absolutely</hi> to be Better than those who are Unlearned. Whereas a Poor, Ignorant, Ragged Beggar, who has more Virtue or Love of GOD in him, has more Intrinsick Worth in him, and is, <hi>absolutely speaking,</hi> more Valuable than any or all of them; notwithstanding their Gayness, Beauty, Riches, Knowledge, Honour and Power. All the rest are but only Good <hi>secundum quid,</hi> and he is for his Sanctity, Good and Valuable <hi>simpliciter.</hi>

THE main Hinge on which the greatest Contests between the Peripateticks and Anti-Peripateticks turn, is, Whether or no there be that Composition and Division in Natural Bodies, call'd <hi>Formal</hi>; and, consequently, FORMAL MUTATION. The Corpuscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larian Philosophers and Atomists deny there is any Mutation in the Thing it self, either in the <hi>Whole</hi> or any <hi>Part</hi> of it; and they affirm that
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:62043:204"/>
there is only an Extrinsecal Application of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles Figur'd, Mov'd and Plac'd in various man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and, consequently, that the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of Natural Bodies is a meer <hi>Mechanism.</hi> On the contrary, the Peripateticks (by which word I do not mean the Common School-men, but those who take pains to understand <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> either by his own Books, or by his First Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters) do grant some kind of Particles and <hi>Minima Naturalia</hi>; that is, some Least Size of Bodies, which are (generally) no farther Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible because there want Natural Causes <hi>little enough</hi> to pass between their parts and divide them; but they say, moreover, that there is not only <hi>Local</hi> or Situal (which are <hi>Extrinsecal</hi>) but also <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> or <hi>Formal</hi> Composition and Division, and, consequently <hi>Formal Mutation</hi> in them, either in <hi>Whole</hi> or in <hi>Part</hi>; that is, a Change in them according to the <hi>Form,</hi> and not according to the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Subject</hi>; and they deny that any Solid Discourse or Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either of Nature or Transnaturals (which we call Metaphysicks) can possibly be made, unless this be admitted.</p>

The reason they give for this Assertion is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause each of them is a <hi>Distinct Ens</hi> from the Others, in regard it can subsist <hi>alone,</hi> and so, <hi>is Capable</hi> of a <hi>Distinct Being</hi>: whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there must be Somewhat in every Body and every Atome, by which it is <hi>Distinguisht</hi> from all Others, and somewhat in which it <hi>Agrees</hi> with them. That which <hi>Distinguishes</hi> them they call the <hi>Form,</hi> and that in which they <hi>Agree,</hi> the <hi>Matter.</hi> And they think that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Adversaries may quarrel the <hi>Words,</hi> yet they must allow the <hi>Sense</hi>: Nature and daily Experience teaching us that <hi>One Thing is made of Another</hi>; which cannot be, unless Somewhat of it <hi>remains,</hi> and Somewhat be <hi>lost.</hi> For, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, one Thing could not truly be said to be <hi>made of another</hi>; but the Former <hi>Ens,</hi> of which <hi>Nothing remains,</hi> would be <hi>Annihilated</hi>; and the <hi>Ens</hi> or Body, newly produced, would be <hi>made of Nothing</hi>; that is, <hi>Created.</hi>

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:62043:206"/>
that <hi>Wood</hi> is One <hi>Thing</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> Another <hi>Thing</hi>; hence, (<hi>Essence</hi> being the Form that constitutes an <hi>Ens,</hi> or makes it Formally a <hi>Thing</hi>) they do farther affirm, that that which was in <hi>Fire,</hi> and made us denominate it such a <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Ens,</hi> is an <hi>Essential Form.</hi> And, because the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Wood <hi>had,</hi> (or rather <hi>was</hi>) a <hi>Power</hi> to have such a Form as made it now to be <hi>Wood,</hi> (and also a <hi>Power</hi> to be afterwards <hi>Fire</hi>) hence they say that that Thing, <hi>Ens</hi> or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance we call'd <hi>Wood,</hi> did consist of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> or was <hi>Compounded</hi> of them; that is, <hi>Wood</hi> had truly <hi>in it</hi> what corresponded to both these Natures or Notions. Lastly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Wood</hi> was Chang'd according to <hi>One</hi> of them only, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Form,</hi> hence they conclude there was <hi>Formal Mutation</hi> made in the <hi>Wood</hi>; which, therefore, was a Change according to somewhat that was <hi>most Intrinsecal</hi> to it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it chang'd it's <hi>Essence</hi> by making it become <hi>Another Thing</hi>; and, consequently, that Change was an Essential one.

               <hi>Forms</hi> are Compounded with the <hi>Intire Thing</hi> as with the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Subject</hi> of them. For example; We say a piece of Wood is Round, Hard, Long, Green, and such like; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, since Wood has in it, besides it's <hi>Essential Form,</hi> these <hi>Accidental Forms</hi> of Hardness, Length, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is therefore a Real Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of <hi>Wood</hi> (which is a Complete <hi>Ens,</hi> and their Subject) with these <hi>supervening</hi> Forms; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Thing has really in it what grounds and answers to all these several Conceptions. Farther (say they) there is, consequently, a Real <hi>Divisibility</hi> between the Wood and these Additional Forms; in regard the Causes in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can <hi>work</hi> upon and <hi>Change</hi> the Wood accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it's Length, Roundness, Hardness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet not change the <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> of Wood. Therefore (say the Peripateticks) the Wood, which is the Subject, can be <hi>Chang'd</hi> according to these <hi>Accidental</hi> Forms; that is, there may be <hi>Formal Mutation</hi> in it according to those <hi>Accidental</hi> Notions or Natures, tho' it remains <hi>Substantially</hi> and <hi>Essentially</hi> the <hi>same.</hi> And, since the <hi>Form,</hi> of what nature soever it be,<note place="margin">

            <p>The <hi>Minor,</hi> only which can need Proof, is thus Evidenc'd. For, since a Contradiction is no where but <hi>in our Vnderstanding,</hi> there can

But, this cannot be in our case: For the Notions of the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of each Atome (as has been in the last §.

In which case, it will be impossible to conceive how that smallest Point, perhaps a million of times less than a Hair can be able to resist such a stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Pressure.

can a Dense body be chang'd into a Rare one, or a Rare into a Dense; or, what Causes do we find in Nature Proper to produce such an Effect? And, it must be confest the Question is very Pertinent. For to put the Operations of Rarefaction and Condensation without any Proper Agents to cause those Operations, is a thing unbecoming a Philosopher. We answer then, that all <hi>Compressive</hi> and <hi>Divulsive</hi> Agents, which we experience are Frequent and almost continually working in Nature, are as Proper to work upon Quantity <hi>as such,</hi> and to make the Subject of it Rarer or Denser, as <hi>Dealba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is to work upon a Subject as 'tis <hi>Colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> or <hi>Combustion</hi> upon a thing as 'tis <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible,</hi> or any other Action to produce or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr it's Proper Effects, or, to cause the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that correspond to it.

So that we must either say that those two Common Words, importing <hi>Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> and us'd by all Mankind, to have no sense in them, or they must allow them their Proper Effects, which are to <hi>Shrink</hi> or <hi>Dilate</hi> the Quantity of the thing, which is to make it <hi>Rarer</hi> or <hi>Denser.</hi> Granting them that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times and even very often those Effects are

there is manifestly a Divisibility between the Essence of that Matter and its Rarity or Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity; and therefore, by the same argument we brought formerly against <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that Matter might have been Chang'd according to either of those Qualities, and not according to its <hi>Essence,</hi> and yet no Contradiction ensue; which demonstrates it to be <hi>Possible.</hi> Again, that Matter being Indifferent to either Rarity or Density, had GOD Created some part of it <hi>Rare,</hi> some <hi>Dense,</hi> the course of Nature (as was lately shown) had gone on more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally: Wherefore, since GOD, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature, and abstracting from Miracle, does always act most connaturally or agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Nature of Things; it follows that he <hi>did actually</hi> order that <hi>some</hi> parts of the First Matter, of which the World was to be <hi>Form'd,</hi> should be Rarer, and some Denser than <hi>Others,</hi> and not of an Uniform or homogeneous Nature.

I know it will be repli'd, that all Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies are <hi>Compound</hi> Entities, or made up of many little Particles; which, put together, Mov'd and Plac'd Commodiously, do enable them to perform those several Operations pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to each; and that these do occasion our saying in our common Speech, it is <hi>such an Ens.</hi> And that, therefore, all our Discourse concerning Formal Mutation falls to the Ground; since all may be Explicated by the Taking away, Adding. Ordering and Moving those Particles after such or such a manner. But, this comes not up to the Point, nor can serve them to escape our Argument, but rather plunges them into a more manifest and Direct Contradiction. For, admit that each <hi>Compound Ens</hi> (as they are pleas'd to call those <hi>Many</hi> Entities) or at

least a great part of it, be made up of those little Particles; I am still to ask them whether those Particles do really conspire to make it <hi>One Thing</hi> or no, after the Composition? that is, whether <hi>after</hi> the Composition there remains only <hi>One Actual</hi> Thing, or <hi>Many</hi> Actual Things or Entities? If the First, then our Discourse proceeds with the same Force; for then, since this <hi>One Ens</hi> or Body is Dissolvable or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, it must (as was prov'd above) have somewhat in it that remains in the Compound w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is to be made out of it, which we call <hi>Matter,</hi> and Somewhat which Formally Constituted the Former Body to be <hi>what it was,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, which does <hi>not</hi> remain in the <hi>New</hi> One; which is what we call the <hi>Form.</hi> And, because it did not cease to be or was Corrupted in an <hi>Instant,</hi> the Former Subject or Body ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of <hi>Alterations</hi> first; and, consequently, there was <hi>Mutation</hi> in it, both according to those <hi>Substantial</hi> and those <hi>Accidental Forms.</hi> But, if they say, (as I fear they will, because they <hi>must</hi>) that after Composition there is no <hi>Ens</hi> which is truly <hi>One</hi> but <hi>Many</hi>; or, if they say that, after Composition, there is <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Many</hi> which are properly and Formally Entities; then they must say that the <hi>same Thing</hi> is both <hi>One</hi> according to the Notion of <hi>Ens,</hi> and yet <hi>not One</hi> according to the Notion of <hi>Ens,</hi> which is a plain Contradiction; for it Affirms and Denies Contradictories of the Thing acording to the <hi>same respect.</hi> Whereas in the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Doctrin, there is but <hi>One Ens</hi> Actually, tho' made up of Potential Parts which have a Formal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibility

Now, to make the Subject consist of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential</hi> parts, Destroys not the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Compounded Ens</hi> but Establishes it; for, to say it is <hi>Potentially Many,</hi> is the same as to say it is <hi>Actually One</hi>; and, to Compound an <hi>Ens</hi> of <hi>Potential Parts</hi> proper to the Notion of <hi>Ens,</hi> neither of which were <hi>One Actual Part</hi> before, is to make that <hi>Ens</hi> truly <hi>One</hi> tho' it had no other Titl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, to put them past this Evasion and all hopes of eluding the force of our Discourse by alledging that Natural Bodies are <hi>Compounds,</hi> I have purposely drawn my Chief Arguments from the Atomes or <hi>Molicellae</hi> (as <hi>Gassendus</hi> calls them) of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and from that Original Mass of <hi>Matter,</hi> of which the <hi>Cartesians</hi> affirm their Elements were made, which the Antiperipate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks must be forced to confess are perfectly <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compounded.</hi> And, I farther alledge, that as <hi>Many Quantums</hi> cannot compound <hi>One Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> unless they be <hi>Vnited Quantitatively</hi>; so neither can <hi>Many Entities</hi> (such those Distinct Atomes and Particles must be) compound <hi>One Ens,</hi> unless they be United <hi>Entitavely.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

those parts can be only <hi>Potentially in</hi> the Compound (as our <hi>Matter</hi> and its <hi>Essential</hi> and <hi>Accidental Forms</hi> are) for, were they <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> there, they would be <hi>Entitatively Many.</hi> Whence the <hi>Ens,</hi> made up of those <hi>Many</hi> Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Entities, could not be Entitatively <hi>Vnum</hi> or one <hi>Ens</hi>; but it would be an <hi>Vnum</hi> which is <hi>Divisum in se</hi>; and which is worst, (to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Nonsence and make it a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction) it would be in the <hi>same</hi> respect <hi>Divisum in se</hi> in which it is <hi>Vnum</hi> or <hi>Indivisum in se,</hi> viz. <hi>in ratione Entis</hi>; which is to be perfectly Chimerical.</p>

For, the Word [<hi>Compounded</hi>] is in reality a kind of Transcendent, and therefore in the highest manner <hi>Equivocal</hi>; whence, while out of slightness of Reasoning and not heeding where the Question pinches, they take the word in an <hi>Vnivocal</hi> signification, they come to apprehend that the compounding many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities together according to some <hi>Extrinsecal</hi> respects (such as are Situation, Motion, joynt-Action and such like,) is the same as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them according to that most <hi>Intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> respect call'd <hi>Substance</hi>; and is sufficient to make them One <hi>Entitatively,</hi> or One <hi>Ens.</hi>

[<hi>Form</hi>] is to be <hi>Receiv'd in</hi> the Subject or Matter, and those Particles <hi>advene</hi> to it already Existing, they are hence call'd <hi>Accidental Forms of it</hi>; and either give it such an Alterableness as is agreeable to their nature, as is seen in Passible Qualities; or, sometimes, if they suit with the Primogenial Constitution of that Body, they strengthen and belong to some Habit, Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, Power or Property of it; and piece out (as it were) those Qualities, and, in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or other denominate the Subject thus or thus <hi>Qualify'd.</hi>

            <p n="34">34. But to make it yet more manifest how industriously the <hi>Cartesians</hi> do wave the giving any account of their First Matter, of which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they hold <hi>all</hi> their three <hi>Elements,</hi> and consequently <hi>all Nature,</hi> was made, we will take notice of one prevarication of theirs more; which does evidently bewray at what a plunge they are about it; by omitting that Consideration, which, even by their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, was the Chiefest and most Necessary. They affirm that Matter of theirs to have been Divided first by God into greater parts, which again being <hi>moved</hi> or jumbled one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did <hi>shave</hi> or <hi>wear</hi> off every small particles of several sorts of which their First Element was made: <hi>Division</hi> then was the first and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Physical Action, and that which most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to frame all Nature: Nay, in case there be no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> (as they grant there is not) it is manifest that the First Motion, and which was exercis'd <hi>Immediately</hi> upon their Matter, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so all the following Motions exercis'd upon the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:62043:225"/>
said Matter, was <hi>Division.</hi> Now, <hi>Divisibility</hi> of the Matter being the Proper Power that answers to the Act of <hi>Division,</hi> or (which is the same) to <hi>Motion,</hi> and withal directly spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the nature of their Matter as apt to be wrought upon by those Causes: how was it possible they should slip over that, and regard only the <hi>Extension</hi> of it? <hi>Divisibility</hi> is a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notion, and imports an Order to Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Action; whereas <hi>Extension</hi> is a dull slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish Notion, and meerly Mathematical; that is, it does Abstract from Action and Motion both; For an Extended thing is never the more or less Extended whether it <hi>Moves or stands still</hi>; but its whole Nature and Notion is taken up in affecting its own Subject, or Extending it, <hi>equally</hi> and <hi>all one</hi> whether <hi>it Acts</hi> or <hi>not acts.</hi> But, the reason of this willful neglect is this, that, tho' they grant it to have been Divided, yet, should they tell us it was thus <hi>Divisible,</hi> Common Reason would lead us to pose them with asking whether it were <hi>Easily</hi> or <hi>Hardly</hi> Divisible, that is <hi>Rare</hi> or <hi>Dense</hi>; of which Qualities in their Matter, antecedently to Motion, and the Contexture of the particles made by that Motion, their Principles can give no kind of account, nor possibly explicate them.</p>
            <p n="35">35. I am apt to think that they foresaw this Rub in their way, which hindred the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of all their Doctrin of Physicks; and, seeing they could <hi>not remove</hi> it, they very fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let it alone; Yet, for a show they take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the <hi>Word,</hi> but they turn it to a quite

               <note n="*" place="margin">Entire Body of Philosophy Part 4. ch. 4 §. 11.</note> coming to give us account of the <hi>Divisibility</hi> of this Matter, where it was the Proper place to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us to what degree it was Divisible into particles by Natural Causes, he starts aside to tell us that, being Quantitative, 'tis Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>in Infinitum</hi>; which is quite besides our purpose. This is a <hi>Mathematical</hi> Divisibility; whereas a <hi>Physical</hi> Divisibility, or a disposition to be divided by the Motion of the first-made parts, is only that which can concern his Scheme or do it any service. For had it been insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably <hi>Dense</hi> or <hi>Hard</hi> (as <hi>Epicurus</hi> fancies his Atomes) they could not have been Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at all, nor consequently, his Three Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been made. Or, had it been <hi>Rare</hi> or <hi>Soft,</hi> one part would have stuck to another, and could not have been shatter'd and crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into those most subtil parts which make his First Element. To declare then <hi>how</hi> and of <hi>what nature</hi> it was, <hi>in this respect,</hi> should have been one of the First Principles in his Physicks, his whole <hi>Hypothesis</hi> depending on it; whereas it was not a straw's matter whether it were Divisible <hi>in Infinitum</hi> or no, so it were but Divisible into parts little enough to make their First Element and the rest. I must then, in behalf of Truth, declare that their Avoiding this point, so necessary to their own Scheme, and to the explication of Nature, is a most manifest prevarication, arising hence that they cannot, notwithstanding they are Men of great Wit, make <hi>any sense</hi> of it according to their Principles.</p>
            <p n="36">
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:62043:226"/>36. But tho' they do not treat of the Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their Matter <hi>de professo</hi> and <hi>purposely,</hi> as they ought, yet it is scarce possible but they must, against their Wills, be forc'd to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at unawares of the Intrinsecal Nature of their Matter as either Easily or Hardly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, while they go about to explicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Errour then being the best Confuter of it self, let us see what they say of it. The Ingenious Gentleman, now mention'd, <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. ch. 6. §. 6.</note> tells us that their <hi>First Element is made of Particles,</hi> which, <hi>like shavings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are rubb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d off by Motion from Bodies.</hi> Now, since their Matter is held by them to be Homogeneous or Uniform, a man would verily think by those expressions, that the Nature of their Matter is <hi>Dense, Hard</hi> or (in a Manner) <hi>Friable</hi> or <hi>Crumbling.</hi> For what is <hi>Rare, Soft</hi> and <hi>Tenacious,</hi> cannot be conceiv'd Proper or Fit to be <hi>Crumbl'd</hi> or <hi>Shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd</hi> into such very small dust by <hi>Rubbing.</hi> Yet the same Author <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. §, 6.</note> tells us the particles of their First Elements are <hi>slender and Flexible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate themselves to the Figures of the Bodies they are contiguous to.</hi> By which expressions one would verily imagine them to be <hi>Fluid, Soft, Moist</hi> or <hi>Yielding,</hi> rather than of a <hi>Solid</hi> or <hi>Hard</hi> Nature, for only such can accomodate themselves to other Bodies on all occasions. So that he makes it at once to be both <hi>Hard</hi> and <hi>Soft</hi>; as being very apt to <hi>break,</hi> and yet at the same time very apt to <hi>ply</hi> and <hi>bow</hi> too; that is, he puts <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> qualities in the same Uniform Matter: Which shews manifestly that they know not what to
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:62043:227"/>
make of it, nor how to speak coherently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; and, withal, that, (which is the true Genius of Hypothetical Philosophers) they blow and sup at once; and <hi>say any thing</hi> that suites with their present occasion. It was for their turn to make them <hi>very Flexible,</hi> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it had been impossible to avoid <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> whenas Millions of those Atomes were jumbled together; which, had they been So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, had retain'd their Figure, and then <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> must have fill'd the little Interstices: And, it was very fitting too they should be <hi>Hard</hi> and <hi>Friable</hi>; otherwise they could never have been Shatter'd by <hi>Rubbing</hi> into such minute dust, as they had design'd to make their First Element of. So that they play fast and loose with their Reader; and, no wonder we know not where to have them, when they do not know where they are themselves.</p>
            <p n="36">36. The same untoward way they take in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing themselves, sometimes as if they and we did perfectly agree in our sentiments. And because the Goodness of our common Reason teaches us that the <hi>Nature</hi> of a Thing is <hi>in it,</hi> they do therefore allow our well-meant words, and talk of <hi>Intrinsecal Forms</hi> both <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential</hi> and <hi>Accidental</hi>; which granted they cannot deny Formal Mutation. Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi> Part 6. cap. 24. § 9, 10, 11. gives us all these good words, tho' he chuses sometimes <hi>rather</hi> to use the word [<hi>Modification</hi>] than [<hi>Form</hi>] and in his § 10, 11. he discourses al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as if he were an <hi>Aristotelian.</hi> But,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:62043:227"/>
alas! what trust is to be given to meer <hi>Words!</hi> For, coming to the § 12. he tells us plainly his true Meaning, which is as opposit to ours (tho' using the same Words) as the two Poles are to one another, viz. <hi>that in the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Plants and Beasts a new Substance is no more produced, than in the Framing a Statue, or buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a House:</hi> which he there exemplifies in some particulars, and then concludes that <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is nothing but the Translation or new Ranging of the parts of the Matter,</hi> and that <hi>This is alike in Natural and Artifieial Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> But, by his leave, if he that builds a House does not know the <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Consistency of his materials, viz. that <hi>Stones are Dense or Hard,</hi> and therefore most fit to be the Foundation; that <hi>Wood</hi> is <hi>Dense,</hi> and Lighter, and so more fit for the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structures: Lastly, that Mortar is <hi>Soft</hi> at first, but <hi>Hard</hi> when it comes to be dry, and so is most fit to bind the Stones together; I am afraid that if he be ignorant of these and such like particulars, he will make but a ruinous and bungling piece of work of it, tho' he be never so well verst in the Act of ranging the parts of the several Materials artificially or mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically. And, as has been shown, no man living, no not themselves, can give any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Consistency of their <hi>Matter,</hi> which is the only Material of which they build (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Bull they force us to) their <hi>Natural-Artificial</hi> Structures.</p>
            <p n="37">37. This then being his true sense, and, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the true doctrin (if we may believe him)
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:62043:228"/>
of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> School; and the word [<hi>Form</hi>] bearing in its notion that it is <hi>in</hi> the Matter, and therefore is <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> to the Thing, and makes it either <hi>Another</hi> if it be an Essential Form; or Intrinsecally <hi>otherwise</hi> or <hi>Alter'd,</hi> if it be an <hi>Accidental</hi> one; and, it being likewise Evident that the <hi>Ranging the parts of Matter,</hi> is only an Outward Application of them to one another, which is meerly an Extrinsecal Notion; we may hence clearly discover, that they do not <hi>use</hi> the words [<hi>Form</hi>] and [<hi>Intrinsecal</hi>] in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Natural sense, but utterly pervert and <hi>abuse</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="38">38. By these expressions of his lately mention'd, and their putting nothing but <hi>Extension</hi> in their Matter, which abstracts from Motion and Natural Action, one would think they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in stead of Physicks to give us a piece of meer Mathematicks, for bare <hi>Extension</hi> fits it for no other Science. Nor are we mistaken in thinking so; for he tells us expresly <note n="*" place="margin">Part 4. chap. 3. §. 24.</note> that <hi>Natural Philosophy is one part of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> Tho' the Abstraction which, in the place now mention'd, he assigns to Quantity as a <hi>Genus,</hi> is very odd and Illogical; For the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction of Quantity from the <hi>Thing</hi> or from <hi>Motion,</hi> is an Abstraction of the <hi>Accident</hi> from the <hi>Subject,</hi> or from <hi>Another Accident</hi>; and therefore is quite another kind of Abstraction than that of the <hi>Genus</hi> from the <hi>species</hi>; and it looks as if they hanker'd after <hi>Plato</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded conceit of a <hi>Subsistent Vniversal</hi>; and that they would have their <hi>First Matter,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Logick and good sense, to be a
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:62043:228"/>
               <hi>Body in Common</hi>; and therefore the <hi>Genus</hi> to all particular Bodies: Nor can any thing sound more awkwardly then to make a <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Treatise of <hi>Physicks.</hi> But <hi>Cartesius</hi> was a Greater Master of Mathematicks than he was of Physicks; and therefore had a vast Design to reduce all Nature and all Philosophy within the Purlew of his own Art; in which it must be confest he was very Excellent.</p>
            <p n="39">39. But, to lay yet a Greater Force upon their backwardness to admit a Formal Change in Bodies, we come now to more Palpable and Plain Instances, not fetch'd from Metaphysicks but from obvious Effects in Nature; which every man sees, and themselves cannot but acknowledg. Let us then take into our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration a young lately-planted Oak growing in a Nursery; which in the space of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, spreads it self into a vast Tree; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating it's large and massy Branches on all sides, and over-shadowing a spacious Extent of Ground. Can any man deny but that this is the <hi>same Thing,</hi> or the <hi>same Tree</hi> it was at first? And yet 'tis most evidently <hi>not the same</hi> in <hi>Quantity,</hi> it being now a thousand times Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it was formerly. 'Tis manifest then that here is a Real Divisibility between it's Quantity and it's Entity or Substance; and a Real <hi>Mutation</hi> according to the <hi>Form</hi> of the Quantity, and not according to the Notions of <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Thing.</hi> The same may be said of an <hi>Infant</hi> grown up to be a <hi>Man</hi>; which, when 'tis now Bigger in Quantity, should they deny to be
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:62043:229"/>
the <hi>same Thing</hi> or the <hi>same Man,</hi> it would make mad work in the World by taking away Titles of Inheritances, and altering the Right of Succession. The Infant might, perhaps, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Title for some very small time; but the Identity of it being lost by the accruing of new Matter and new Quantity, he has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his Estate, e'er he comes at age to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand or manage it, by losing his Essenee.</p>
            <p n="41">41. I know that our late Philosophers will hope to evade this last Instance by alledging that the Numerical Identity of a Man springs from his having the same <hi>Soul.</hi> Which Tenet, (were it proper to confute it here) would prove as Unreasonable and ill-grounded as any of the rest. I only note, on the by, that, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes God's Wisdom, as he is Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to carry on the Course of Causes by fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Dispositions to the Production of farther and more Noble Effects; and consequently, to sute and proportion what <hi>Supervenes</hi> to what <hi>Prae-exists</hi>; and the <hi>Embryo</hi> in our case Praeexists, and, by having such Dispositions in it as made it fit to concur (on it's part) to work Rationally <hi>to such a Degree,</hi> made it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to have for it's <hi>Form such</hi> a Rational Soul joyn'd with it, and, thence, determin'd the Author of Nature to infuse it; it follows that the thing is quite contrary to what they imagin; viz. that the Soul was to be adjusted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to the Exigency of the Bodily part; and that, therefore the Soul is Determinately <hi>such,</hi> or of such a Determinate <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality</hi>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:62043:229"/>
(which Essentially and Numerically distinguishes <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> from one another) as was fit to be infus'd into and work with such a Body. And were not this so, it would be impossible to explicate how Original Sin is connaturally transfus'd from <hi>Adam,</hi> or how the Soul becomes tainted by being united to a Body made <note n="*" place="margin">Job. 14.4</note> 
               <hi>ex immundo semine.</hi> But, this is not the only ill Consequence that springs from this Extravagant Tenet of the Soul's being a Distinct Thing from the Body, or that Man is in reality compounded of Two Actual Things, and therefore not to be placed in any one Line of the Predicament of Ens or <hi>Substance.</hi> For, that odd Opinion does, besides, very much favour (at least, very well consist with) the Praeexistence of Souls: Because, if the Soul be not proportion'd to the Disposition of the Corporeal part of Man, and so, be truly the <hi>Form</hi> of it, but a kind of <hi>Assistant Spirit,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apt to joyn with it, and promote it in it's Operations, it might as well Exist <hi>before</hi> the Body as <hi>after</hi> it. Whence it will be very hard for them to assign any solid Reason from the Nature of such a Spirit, (since it might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently fit <hi>other</hi> Bodies or assist more of them) why there might not be also a Transmigration of Souls from one Man to another; for it would be, in that case, no more but shifting their Office and <hi>assisting</hi> now <hi>one</hi> of them then <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Not to mention how this Doctrin (as is discourst in the Preface) tends to introduce a kind of Fanaticism into the Philosophy Schools,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:62043:230"/>
by making all their thoughts run upon nothing but Spiritual Conceits and Innate Ideas, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Spiritual communication with God, when they know any Natural Truth, after an unintelligible manner. Not considering that Man, in this Mortal State here, is truly one part or piece of Nature; and subject to the Impressions of Natural Causes affecting him, both as to his Corporeal and Spiritual Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, according to the Different Natures of those Different Recipients.</p>
            <p n="41">41. But, to return whence we diverted; Letting Man and his Individuality alone, what can they say to the former Instance of a young Oak (or of any other Vegetable or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal</hi>) increast to it's Full Growth, which all Mankind agrees to be still the <hi>same Thing,</hi> and yet <hi>not the same</hi> in <hi>Quantity</hi>? It is not hence unanswerably Evident, that there is a Formal Mutation according to it's <hi>Quantity</hi> and not according to it's Entity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Formal Composition and Divisibility in it according to those two Respects? They cannot say they are the same <hi>Physically,</hi> or the same Physical Compound: For, since all Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies, according to their Doctrin, are made <hi>solely</hi> of their First Matter, or of the Particles made of it; where there is incomparably <hi>more</hi> Matter, there must be a <hi>New-Compound</hi> or a <hi>New Body</hi>; in regard <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> must be the Differences of every Notion in the same Line, as has been demonstrated: Wherefore <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> of the <hi>Matter</hi> (it being inform'd, and, so tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an <hi>Ens</hi> or a <hi>Body</hi>) ought to outweigh, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting

Particular Bodies or Entities, all consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Accidental Notions or Modifications of it, which are not properly Entities but only Modes of <hi>Ens.</hi> 'Tis a Folly to alledg the Figure or Extension of those Particles; for, if the Subjects, (I mean the Particles) be not the <hi>same,</hi> all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which belong to those Numerically diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Subjects, must be Numerically different like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and, so, cannot constitute a Thing to be Numerically <hi>One,</hi> but only add more Numerical Things to it to make it Numerically <hi>Many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension</hi> is held by them to be the <hi>only Essential</hi> Form of their Matter; they so, ought, if they go to work Logically and consequentially, to say that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Extensions</hi> of that Matter which come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with those Particles, does give a <hi>particular Essence</hi> to each of those compounds which are made of that Matter; and so make the Generical Notion hold in every <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>Individuum</hi> of that common Body; as <hi>Entity</hi> which is the Form of <hi>Ens</hi> is found in every Individual Thing in the whole world; and not to make the Essential Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of those Bodies consist in such respects as are <hi>not Essential.</hi> They will tell us of many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications of each Compound: But they should consider that Modifications of the <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> do <hi>supervene</hi> to it; and therefore the Thing must first be supposed to <hi>be,</hi> e'er it can be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be <hi>Modify'd</hi>; and it looks odd to talk of Modifying what <hi>is not,</hi> or of modifying a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Yet tho' it strains good sense, they tell us of other <hi>Essential Modifications</hi> of the Matter in each Compound; as if <hi>Res</hi> were not, by all Mankind and by the Light of Nature, <hi>presuppos'd</hi>

to <hi>Modus rei.</hi> But this <hi>Catachesis</hi> they are forced to by their pique against Essential <hi>Forms</hi>; the Sense of which the Goodness of Rational Nature forces them to admit; tho' out of Aversion to the <hi>Word,</hi> they generally change it into a <hi>worse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="42">42.

I never yet could hear of any man that could <hi>define</hi> it; and it is as easy for the Taylor in the Fable to fit the Moon with a Coat, as to fit <hi>it</hi> with a Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, we will do what we can to show the different senses it may have in our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; and that none of them can serve their purpose. Either then [<hi>to be Morally the same</hi>] Signifies that the <hi>Thing</hi> does <hi>seem</hi> to us to be the same, tho' it it be not so <hi>Really.</hi> But, this comes over to us instead of opposing us; for, our Question is what <hi>is,</hi> and not what <hi>seems</hi>; nor is such an Expression to be Tolerated amongst Philosophers, whose Duty 'tis to consider what passes <hi>Really</hi> in Nature, and not what only <hi>Appears</hi> so.

Ch. 27.</note> Our ingenious Country-man, Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> goes more solidly to work, by making it <hi>to be the same Plant</hi> as long as it partakes <hi>of the same Life, in a like continuing Organization, conformable to that sort of Plants.</hi> For, Life speaks something <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> and <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> (which the meer <hi>Ranging of Particles</hi> thus or thus, does not) unless we will say that a Watch or Clock <hi>lives</hi>; And therefore it argues some Formal Mutation of the Matter, while it is disposed, fitted and (as it were) <hi>digested</hi> so as to continue that Life by Nourishing the Vegetable. For, it will seem incredible to any Considerer, that Particles of all sorts should be found, in such vast Quantities, in every little spot of Ground where so many several Plants and Trees do grow, as are <hi>Proper</hi> to each, and <hi>Sufficient</hi> to nourish them up, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll they increase to such a Prodigious Bigness. yet, this must be asserted, if <hi>Formal Mutation</hi> be deny'd. But, <hi>I</hi> can by no means allow what he sayes there that the <hi>Principium Individuationis is Existence.</hi> For, since Created Entities have not <hi>Existence</hi> from their being <hi>Entia</hi> or Things, or (which is the same) <hi>Individuums</hi>: all we can say of them is that they are <hi>Capable of Existing</hi>; and this they must have antecedently, in priority of Nature, to their <hi>Actual</hi> Existence. Wherefore their Individuation must be <hi>presuppos'd</hi> to Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence;
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:62043:232"/>
and, so, cannot depend on it as on its Principle. Again, since <hi>Plato</hi>'s Flash of <hi>Ideas</hi> existing in <hi>common,</hi> is now hist out of all Schools (if indeed that Excellent Man meant them as his Opposers apprehend him,) and that neither Man nor Horse <hi>in Common</hi> can Exist, but it must be determinately, and particularly <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That</hi> Man, Horse, &amp;c. It must be suppos'd to be constituted Determinately <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuum</hi> ere it can be <hi>Capable</hi> of Existing. Wherefore <hi>Existence</hi> is an Accidental Formality, supervening to the Individuum already Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd and made fit to Exist, that is, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuum <hi>already Constituted</hi>; and therefore Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence cannot cause nor constitute it. Had I leasure, and were the place Proper, I would show my respects to the Learned Author by giving him my thoughts of his Chapter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Identity and Diversity</hi>; for it is an Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Subject, and I see it is treated by him more elaborately than are some other parts of that worthy Book.</p>
            <p n="43">43. Lastly, to say no more of Formal Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>Bodies,</hi> let us cast a short view upon what passes in <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures. When a Soul that before was <hi>Ignorant</hi> becomes <hi>Knowing,</hi> or a Wicked Soul <hi>Virtuous,</hi> can it be deny'd that those Souls are Chang'd according to that Form call'd <hi>Quality,</hi> and yet remain the same according to their <hi>Essence?</hi> Surely, they cannot say that this is done by <hi>New Atomes</hi> aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that Soul, or by any other of those odd Requisites they put to induce a new Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Form. And, if not, they must see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:62043:232"/>
that <hi>Formal Mutation</hi> is, beyond all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, found in Spiritual Natures. Much more then may it have place in <hi>Bodies</hi>; which, being Subject to <hi>Motion,</hi> which is <hi>Essentially Change,</hi> are, consequently, of a nature far more Change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than Spiritual Beings are. What can be answer'd to those pressing Arguments I cannot in their behalf imagine; nor, I am confident, can themselves give any Reply that is <hi>Solid,</hi> or taken from the known and acknowledg'd Natures of <hi>Things</hi>; however they may shuffle it off wittily, by throwing in some Unprov'd Supposition, plainly exprest; and endeavouring to make that pass upon their Readers. But 'tis Impossible they should even attempt to perform this by bearing up to any Evident Principles, or by Deductions connected by such Principles, or Reducible to them: only which can satisfy the <hi>Judgments</hi> of Learned Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and true Philosophers.</p>
            <p>From what is said hitherto is Establisht this Grand Conclusion, that FORMAL MUTATION <hi>must unavoidably be granted.</hi> Which evinc't, all the <hi>Corpuscularian</hi> and Atomical <hi>Hypotheses</hi> fall to the ground, and can need no farther Confutation.</p>
