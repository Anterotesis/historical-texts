            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Some desire to passe their life in Epicures pleasures, others would have <hi>Croesus</hi> riches, the rest <hi>Caesars</hi> fortune, all <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> years, which varietie of motions in mens minds, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undertaken to discourse upon this subject, occasioned mee to use the helpe of learned Authours in searching out wherein the felicitie and <hi>Summum bonum</hi> of man doth consist. And as I was seeking for this felicitie and the way to it, I fell into the company of certaine Philosophers, who dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted me to the branch that riseth on the right side out of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> letter; which said they, would conduct me to the path that leadeth to the thing I sought. But some of them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advised, taught that the Felicitie of man, his soveraigne good and beatitude, is to bee joyned with God in the life to come, &amp; cannot be enjoyed in this life, &amp; the meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is the purgation and perfection of life, by entring into our consciences, and searching our sins, and confessing them to God: Which caused me not a little to wonder, how men by reason only and by instinct of nature, could bee capable of so divine knowledge. But when I saw them there to stay, and could proceede no further, and except I left their companie and followed a better guide, they would leave me in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the way (for of the confession of our sinnes followeth damnation, except God bee pacified and made mercifull to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I have therefore rejected the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers opinions (of whom neverthelesse I think reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) as not sufficiently conformable to Christianity, though I

have applid many of their sayings to my purpose. And I have laboured to discover the error of them by many examples, that in the course of their life seeme to set their felicity in those things that bring men to infelicity. And I have enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the narration of some histories more than the due me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of writing requireth, which I might with lesse labour have abridged: it may serve neverthelesse to that common end of the Poets, either to profit or delight:

I desire rather to be taken for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator of other mens sayings and opinions, than to arrogate such sufficiency as to be Author of any thing my selfe. Many things written by divers Authors, dispersed into sundry vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, serving to divers ends, I have simply collected and applyed to my purpose, without any affected stile.

For how is it possible among such an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of bookes, which daily increase beyond measure, that any thing can be alledged, though it come to him from his owne invention, but the same by some man hath been written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though in another forme &amp; order, and to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?

In doing whereof I was driven to examine the principall estates of life, not in any particular Countrey or Common wealth but generally through the world, and to discover the evill I found in them; and yet not all that I have found written in other Authors, nor that may truly be spoken, but so much as I thought sufficient to make for my purpose. For whon I note the abuses of some estates of life and manners of men, as not sufficiently furnished with the things that should lead men to felicity, my meaning is, the abuses of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, reported by credible Authors, and not of mine owne, saving when I name our Nation, (where neverthelesse I wish that all things were so well as there were no cause to finde any fault.) And yet nothing is so generally spoken, but it doth admit some exception.

               <p>When God had determined to create natures of <note place="margin">The Creation of Angels and Men.</note> vnderstanding after his owne image, of whom hee would be knowne and worshipped in the same sort as he would appoint them; some he made of a spirituall essence without bodies, others of a spirituall essence and a bodily substance; the body being made of clay, most excellently compact together with a wonderful and vnspeakeable wisedome, in which hee inclosed with a maruellous league of societie, another spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all nature, that is the Soule; the one sort hee called Angels, the other Men. Both which he endued with a singular wisdome &amp; knowledge. To this man he gaue for his habitation this goodly great Theater, adorned with such variety of excellent things; and placed him in the most delectable and pleasant place of all the earth, which in respect of the florishing and fertile soyle, beautified with goodly riuers and fountaines;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:896:11"/>
was called Paradise, not to bee an inhabitor onely of this lower part of the world, but to bee a spectator of his Creators wonderous works, thereby first to know the great glory of his parent and progenitour, and then to loue him aboue all things; and the time being expired in which hee had appointed him here to liue, hee should passe from hence to him, where hee should continually enioy his glorious presence and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting. But some of those Angels being puffed vp with pride through the goodly gifts wherewith God had adorned them, so much forgot their due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they thought themselues equall with him that made them. Whereby they so greatly prouoked his displeasure, that he expulsed them from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his ministers, and reiected them from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. This fall was so grieuous to them, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <note place="margin">The fall of the Angels.</note> so great which they conceiued against God for the same, that they presently began to doe all things contrary to his commandement, by all manner of meanes to offend him, to derogate from his glory what they could, and as much as they might to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and corrupt this goodly frame of the world, which hee with so great wisedome had made. And when man persisted yet in the same estate in which he was placed from aboue, supposing they had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meanes to detract from the glory of God, than if they could lay a plat to take man from him, and draw him into their societie; they presently put their deuice in practice, and fraudulently deceiuing him with false promises and hope of greater preferment, they made him reuolt from God, and breake his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which he had giuen him to make proofe of his obedience, and to follow that course and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell

When man had thus shaken off his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, where before he led in this pleasant Paradise a most happy life, free from all euill and hurtfull things, the earth of its owne accord bringing forth all things plentifully, hee was driuen out of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable place, and with heauie cheare enforced to seeke another dwelling, where hee must get his liuing with the labour of his body, and with the sweat of his browes; and fell into the punishment appointed by God for breach of his commandement, that is, death and damnation, bereft of that rule and dominion, and of all the principall ornaments which he had bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon him. And where all the meane causes of things, euen from the vppermost heauen vnto the lowest part of the earth, depended each vpon other in such an exact order and vniformitie to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of things in their most perfection and beauty, so as it might well bee likened to that <hi>Aurea Catena,</hi> as <hi>Homer</hi> calleth it, by the grieuous displeasure, which God conceiued against man, hee withdrew the vertue which at the first hee had giuen to things in these lower parts, and now through his curse the face of the earth and all this elementatie world, doth so much degenerate from his former estate, that it resembleth a chaine rent in peeces, whose links are many lost and broken, and the rest so slightly fastened as they will hardly hang together; by meanes whereof the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens and second causes do now farre otherwise work in mans corrupt nature, and in this elementary world, than they did before.</p>
               <p>But the son of God, hauing compassion vpon man <note place="margin">The Mercy of Christ.</note> that had thus grieuously sinned and was fallen into
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:896:12"/>
this miserable estate, though by his own will, yet not through pride or ambition, nor by contempt of Gods commandement, but was deceiued by the fraud and subtilty of the diuell; cast himselfe down before his Father with all humilitie, and besought him for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and obtained this fauour, that they should not be condemned to perpetuall punishment. And yet to satisfie the iustice of God which was immutable, hee offered himselfe to fulfill all that obedience which God required of man: and so pacified his Father, that hee procured him to make a decree to send him to bee a protector and defendor of mankinde against the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of the diuell. When man was thus restored into fauour againe, yet not with recouery of those goodly gifts and ornaments which he had lost, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell beginneth to rage, and to practise all manner of meanes to intrap him againe: and when he perceiued that hee could not deceiue all, hee handled the matter so, that the benefit of this promise might come to a very few, and that the greater part of the world should perish with him, by drawing them from the true knowledge and worshipping of God to supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and idolatrie.

               <p>But first, before wee come to shew our opinion of this soueraigne good or felicitie, let vs peruse the course of mens liues, that by obseruing what the things bee that men most desire in this life, they may the more plainely discouer their errour, and direct themselues to a better course. <hi>Diogenes</hi> in a great as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of people going backward of purpose, and seeing euery one laughing him to scorne, asked them alowd if they were not ashamed to mocke him for going backward when hee walked, whereas they did so all the daies of their life. As if hee should say, that no man followed the right course of life, but rather that all liued contrary to that they ought. For all men desire to be in a happy estate.

               </p>
               <p>But few take the right course to attaine to it. It is commonly said, that wise men differ from fooles in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:896:13"/>
this, that they set vp a marke to shoot at, these shoot their arrows vp into the ayre at random, without any certain marke. And again, that good men differ in this <note place="margin">How good distict slow wicked.</note> from the wicked, that some propose to themselues a good end, others an euill end; some that which is good indeed; others that which is good in shew on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Many set vp no marke or end at all, to which they should direct the course of their life, but fall from one kinde of life into another, as chance offereth, without any certaine end or purpose. Some direct the course of their life to some end as to a marke, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they mistake one thing for another, they neuer attaine to that they desire. Others, though they see what the marke or end is to which they should direct the course of their life, which is felicitie, yet as men who vse to take vpon them blind-folded to finde out a post or hillocke, or such like, wander vp and down, without finding that they secke: so they, being made blinde by their affections, which (as <hi>Plato</hi> saith) bee very euill counsellers, and clogged with worldly cares, and carried away with vnsatiable desires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow their labour in vaine, and can neuer finde that they seeke for. And though all men desire one thing, that is, a happy estate, yet the great difference we see in the course of their liues, argueth their mistaking some other thing for that they secke after; by meane whereof they can neuer attaine to the end of their desires. Let vs looke into mens labours, and consider what the things bee, for the obtaining whereof they imploy all their trauell and study: for that seemeth the thing which they take for felicitie, or a great meane to the attaining of it. For euery man naturally desireth that which he thinketh to be good.</p>

Three things I obserue that the most part of men <note place="margin">Three things in which men ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine selicitie to consist.</note> greedily hunt after, and leaue no stone vnturned, as the prouerbe is, to attaine to them. Some desire to liue in pleasure, many seeke for riches, others labour for honour and glory; in these things according to their seuerall inclinations they put their felicitie. But how farre they are from the true felicitie, shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after (if God will) appeare, rather by the common iudgment of men that will vse reason for their guide, than by Logicall arguments, and by examples of them whose miserable estate and vnfortunate end hath discouered the error of their disordered and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious life; that by seeking felicitie where it was not, they found in felicitie where it was. By whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample after <hi>Diogenes</hi> counsell, wee may become wise by another mans harme, for he is wise very late that is made wise by his own harme. For as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, <hi>Longum iter per praecepta, brene &amp; efficax per exempla,</hi> The way by precepts is long, by examples short and pithy.</p>
               <p>And first to beginne with Pleasure, wherein some <note place="margin">Of Pleasure.</note> learned men of account among the ancient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, as <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and others, seeing how willingly men are drawne to pleasures, held that felicitie or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne good should consist. They reasoned thus: That action is the end or felicitie of man, to which by nature of his own accord he is most willingly ledde: But all men of their owne accord are most willingly led to pleasures: Therefore Pleasure is the end or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of man. But the Epicures were in this greatly deceiued: for man, as in the substance of his body, participateth with brute beasts; so in his spirituall es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which is a reasonable soule, hee participateth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:896:14"/>
with Angels. And though hee be by the worst part of his nature giuen to pleasure, yet reason reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and blameth his brutish affections. But the cause of this dissention in mans nature the Philosophers saw not, only Christian Religion sheweth why his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are repugnant to reason. If felicitie (as the Philosophers affirme) bee the proper action of man, then can it not bee in Pleasure; for that is common with him and brute beasts, but after them it must bee an action peculiar and proper to him alone. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that man is made of two distinct natures, though by the great wisedome of the Creatour wonderfully vnited together, it is more reason that his felicitie should bee agreeable with the best part of his nature, which is a reasonable soule, and resembleth the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that are made after the image of God; than with the worst part of his nature, which resembleth, and is of the like substance to brute beasts. But he that will enter into the due consideration of mans felicitie, must haue respect to both his natures, the body and the soule, both which it must in a sort touch; yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion and difference of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie that is betweene them, the one representing the image of God being immortall, the other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating with brute beasts, being subiect to death and corruption. Such a felicitie as consisteth in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany pleasures of this life, the Indian captiues may challenge.</p>

that hath taken him, and there place him in a house of some man that was lately slaine in the warres, as it were to re-celebrate his funerals, and giue vnto him his wiues or sisters to attend vpon him, and to vse at his pleasure. They apparel him gorgeously after their manner, and feede him with all the daintie meats that may be had, and giue him all the pleasures that can be deuised. When hee hath passed certaine moneths in all manner of pleasures, like an Epicure, and is made fat with daintie and delicate fare, like a Capon, they assemble themselues together at some festiuall day, and in great pompe bring him to the place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, where they kill him and eate him. This is the end of this poore captiues pleasures, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his miseries; whose case is nothing inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to theirs, who, enioying the pleasures of this life for a small time, wherein they put their felicitie, are rewarded with death and perpetuall torments. For as <note place="margin">The Application.</note> he was taken prisoner by his enemies, so are they cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued by the Diuell, who feedeth their humours with variety of pleasures, that he may at length deuoure and destroy them both body and soule.

Hee would somtimes sit in his chariot starke naked, which should be drawne through the Citie of Rome with foure of the fairest yong women naked likewise that could be found. He was in his expences about his person, his diet, and his house, and other superfluous toyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurably sumptuous; which to declare will haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the credit of the reporter.

Hee would not weare a garment twice, or drinke twice of one cup, whether it were gold or siluer, but he should haue it that waited that day vpon his cup. And what ring soeuer he once drew from his finger, he would neuer put it on againe. The tables, stooles, coffers, and

whatsoever else belonged to his chamber, kitchin, or any other part of his house was of pure gold, even to that thing which serveth to the most base use. In place of oyle for his lamps, he used excellent balme brought from Iurie and Arabia. Not so much but his urinals were made of rich precious stones. When he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to take the ayre in the fields, he would have with him sixe hundred chariots and litters driven with infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous yong wenches and boyes, and with bawdy ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals. When he was neare the sea coast, he would never eate fish, but daintie birds that were brought farre off. And when he was far from the sea, then he would eate nothing but fish brought alive by post with an excessive charge. Whensoever he tooke his horse to ride, the ground from his doore to his horse must bee covered with the dust or scraping of pure gold &amp; silver, because he disdained to touch the ground with his feet as other men did. Neither did he make this provision of dainty meats for his own mouth only, but for all his houshold; <note place="margin">Excesse,</note> who should feede upon egges, and heads of Partridges, popingayes, fesants and peacokes.

All things were done by this Emperour <note place="margin">Disorder.</note> in such disorder, that it is not possible to set it down in order. He commanded for the better government of Rome, that all those works which were used to be done in the day time, should be done in the night: and those which were used to bee done in the night, should bee done in the day. And himselfe used to rise from his bed when the Sun went down, &amp; had morning salutations accordingly: so that the world seemed to go backward. His baths were filled with precious oyntments, wherof
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:896:18"/>
he had great store, because he would never bathe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe but once in any of them. If he chanced to be in any haven of the sea, hee would cause all the ships there with their merchandise to be sunke; &amp; being reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of one of his friends, that told him these excessive expences were sufficient to bring him into povertie; he asked him what could happen better to a man, than to be heire to himselfe? Hee wasted in these kinds of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences <note place="margin">Prodigality</note> all the revenues which now all the Princes Christian and Heathen doe possesse.

Hee also made a very high Tower, covered and compassed about with gold &amp; silver, &amp; within were sharp points of rich &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable precious stones, to throw himselfe headlong upon them, if it chanced him to bee driven to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. He prepared also swords and daggers of gold &amp; silver wherewith to be slaine; &amp; a pond full of Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water wherein to be drowned. But all these preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons served not his turne, for the souldiers of his guard having long before conspired his death, after they had slaine all those of his adherents that were in his palace, they found him hidden in a privie, where without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him leave to chuse his own death, they slue him; &amp; after they had drawn him like a dog through the streets <note place="margin">His infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous end.</note> &amp; lanes of Rome, they cast him into the river of Tiber, that his body might never be found again, nor have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other buriall: which was done with the content of all the people.</p>
               <p>Such another was <hi>Nero,</hi> many of whose ontragious <note place="margin">Of Nero.</note> actions so far exceeded the bounds of humanity, that they are not meet to bee spoken. After he had reigned certaine years with good fame, he could no longer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble his vile nature, addicted to all manner of disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutenesse; as the Poet saith,
<q>
                     <l>Naturam expellas furca licet usque recurret:</l>
                     <l>Though thou expellest nature with a forke, it will returne to the againe.</l>

               </p>
               <p>but songht all means with excessive charge &amp; intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble villanie to passe his time in luxuriousnes &amp; pleasure. He cooli such delight in shedding of bloud, that besides a great many innocents of the Nobility and others, he put his owne mother to death, &amp; caused nor to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:896:19"/>
that he might see the place where he lay. The city of Rome where he dwelt, head of the Romane Empire, W<hi rend="sup">th</hi> was then the goodliest, &amp; most flourishing, and best peopled citie in the world, he caused to bee set on fire, &amp; would suffer none to quench it in sixe daies &amp; seven nights; he in the meane time beholding this lamentable spectacle, with great pleasure in a high tower singing certaine verses of <hi>Homer,</hi> W<hi rend="sup">th</hi> contained the burning of Troy; to whom the Poets saying may be wel applied;
<q>
                     <l>Libertas scelerum est virtus &amp; summa potestas.</l>
                     <l>The Libertie to sinne, and to offend</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And as one of his pleasures consisted in unmeasurable prodigalitie, hee built an house that contained a great <note place="margin">His Palace.</note> part of the citie of Rome, in which were galleries of a mile in length; the stuffe and the workmanship of such curiositie and charge, as it was inestimable; the house gilded with pure gold, it was of that circuit, that there was within the compasse of the house, lakes represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a gulfe of the sea, environed round about with buildings; and besides orchards &amp; gardens, there was within that compasse of the house hils &amp; woods repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting a forest replenished with divers kinds of wilde beasts: it had also within it hot bathes &amp; cold, &amp; many other wonderfull things, which argueth the monstrous largenesse and sumptuousnesse of the house, and the outragious minde of the maker; whereof to avoyde profixitie, I will surcease further to speake. Besides the inestimable expence of this house, and many other buildings, hee was as sumptuous in his apparell, and unmeasurably wastefull in all things wherein he tooke <note place="margin">Ridiculous prodigality.</note> any delight. When for his pastime hee would walke by the sea or rivers to see fish taken, the threeds of his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:896:19"/>
nets must bee of gold, and the lines of excellent filke. When he went out of Rome, which was often, besides an infinite number of followers, he had never lesse than a thousand chariots of mules, for his provision, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull costly furnished, and those that drave them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled in cloth of silver, and gold, and silke, in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of charge, even to the shooes of the mules, which were of silver. His pastimes, feastes and gifts which he bestowed upon the people, were of such ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable charge, that it surmounteth all imagination: at such vanities the Poet might well cry out;
<q>
                     <l>O curas hominum! O quantum est in rebus inane!</l>

               <p>Hee was in all things given to please his senses; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the rest of his abominable vices, extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted to the pleasure of women, and to leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <note place="margin">His luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</note> which because it will abhorre all modest eares, I will forbeare to recite, and draw towards his end, which was as miserable and shamefull, as his life was dissolute and beastly. His tyrannous and licentious life was become so odious to all men, that divers of his Lievtenants in sundry Countreyes revolted against him at one time. The Senate likewise by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent determined to forsake him, and to deny him their obedience. Which things being known unto him, hee beganne to despaire, and to be utterly out of hope to be able to make head against them. And as a guiltie conscience easily falleth into extreame feare and <note place="margin">Repeatance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

After some pawse,

that he was come to himselfe, he tooke a boxe of gold, wherein he had put poyson, and walked into his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, where hee deliberated with himselfe, what course were best for him to take to escape from this imminent mischiefe. But as <hi>Guicei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sometimes hee thought best to flie to some forraine Prince, sometimes to yeeld himselfe to some of them that were comming against him, and to desire mercy, other-while to shew himselfe openly to the people, arrayed in base apparell like an abject, and to desire pardon for his wicked life past; and if they would not suffer him any longer to bee Emperour, yet that they would give him the governement of Egypt. And to this purpose there was found among his writings after his death an excellent Oration. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he durst not put this device in practice, fearing to bee slaine of the people, who were now all in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare. Thus having passed that day, and part of the night in this perplexitie and feare, tossed up and downe betweene hope and despaire, hee withdrew him into a Chamber, though with very small rest, determining the next day to follow that course which then should fall into his head. And after a little sleepe, about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, newes was brought him that the bandes of souldiers that guarded his Palace had forsaken him. This newes so much amazed him, that hee sent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently for some of his best friends; but as in such cases faithfull friends are no whereto be found, (neither did <hi>Nero</hi> deserve it) so had hee no good answer from any
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:896:20"/>
of them. And therefore with a few of his servants, covered with the darkenesse of the night, hee wear in person to divers of their houses, but the doores would not bee opened, nor any answer made him. Thus hee that a little before was feared and adored of all the world, returned with sorrow in contempt and feare of every man. And when hee came to his Palace againe, hee found it risted, and all his goods stolen away, even to his boxe of poyson, which hee had reserved for his last refuge. Which when he saw, he despaimed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Despaire.</note> of life, and was desirous of death; and calling a gladiator, prayed him to kill him: which when hee and others also refused, he cryed out, saying, "Thus now he had no friend nor enemy; and in a fury ready to cast himselfe into the River of Tiber, "he asked of some few that were with him, where hee might hide himselfe, untill he might bee advised who were best to doe: whereupon a servant of his undertooke to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vay him forth of the Citie in the night and with much feare and trauaile, hee brought him to a house toure miles from Rome: where he cast himselfe upon a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bed, and being hungry and thirsty, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to bee had but a little browne bread and water.

This beast it seemeth God hath created to the shame of gluttonous men, that passe whole daies and nights in eating and drinking, &amp; when they have filled themselves so full that their bodies wil hold no more, they vomit up that they have taken, and

                  <hi>Lavater</hi> reporteth a Historie of a Parish Priest in Germanie, that disguised himselfe with a white sheete about him, and at mid-night came into the chamber of a rich woman that was in bed, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioning <note place="margin">A counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit spirit.</note> himselfe like a spirit, hee thought to put her in such feare, that shee would procure a conjnrer or exorcist to talke with him, or else speake to him her selfe. The woman desired one of her kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to stay with her in her Chamber the next night. This man making no question whether it were a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or not, in stead of conjuration or exorcisme brought a good cudgell with him; and after hee had well drunke to encrease his courage, knowing his hardinesse at those times to bee such, that all the Divels in hell could not make him affraide, hee lay downe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:896:24"/>
upon a pallat, and fell asleepe. The spirit came into the chamber againe at his accustomed houre, and made such a rumbling noyse, that the exorcist (the wine not being yet gone out of his head) awaked, and leapt out of his bed, and toward the spirit hee goeth, who with counterfeit words and gesture, thought to make him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid. But this drunken fellow making no account of his threatnings, Art thou the Divel, quoth he? and I am his Damme; and so layeth upon him with his cudgell, that if the poore Priest had not changed his divels voyce, and confessed himselfe to be <hi>Hauns,</hi> and rescued by the woman that then knew him, he had bin like not to have gone out of the place alive.</p>
               <p>This vice of drunkennesse, wherein many take over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great pleasure, was a great blemish to <hi>Alexanders</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. <note place="margin">Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the roote of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viccs.</note> For having won a great part of Asia, he laid aside that sobrietie hee brought forth of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and gave himselfe to the luxuriousnesse of those people whom he had conquered.

And the King himselfe first, and after his guests and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines set fire on the Palace, by whose example others burnt the whole Citie. Thus the famous Citie of <hi>Persepolis,</hi> head of the East countries, from which so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nations had before fetched their lawes, the royall seat of so many mighty kings, the only terror somtimes of Greece, the sender forth of navies and armies that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowed all Europe, that had done many notable acts, was utterly destroyed by the enticement of a drunken strumpet, to the perpetuall shame of the King, and all his nation.

many in these daies, that live like swine, shall one day be made a prey for the Divell: for seeing they will not be the temple of God, and the house of the holy Ghost, they must of necessitie be the habitation of the Divell.

Such swine be some flatterers, that all their life time doe nothing but entertaine Princes and great States in their errors and pleasures, and that hold for the first article of their fayth, that their is no other God but their belly: for all their religion is turned into carnall libertie. As for the law of Iesus Christ, they will none of it, it is too ful of prickes, too heavy and hard for them.

When day was come and he gone, she sent presently for her father, her husband, and kinsfolkes, letting them to understand that a great misfortune had happened to her. When they were come, perceiving by her sad countenance, that all was not well, her husband asked whether all things were safe in the house; shee like one in a trance stood silent, unable to answere them a word. But they urging still to know the cause of her heauinesse, and what had befallen her, after a little pause beeing come to her selfe, her cheekes wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with abundance of teares; What (sayd she) can bee accounted safe to a woman when her chastitie is lost? Thy bedde, my husband, that hitherto hath been kept unspotted, is now defiled by the kings sonne, who comming to me yester-night to supper, was curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously entertained of me as a guest, &amp; lodged in my house as a friend, altogether ignorant of his intent: but when wee were all at rest, he brake into my chamber, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by my bed side with his dagger in his right hand,

and his left hand upon my brest, hold thy peace (quoth he) <hi>Lucretia,</hi> I am <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> if thou speake any word, this dagger shall be thy death. Then began hee to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his villanous minde, and mingling threats with amorous words, shewed me what paine and torment he had suffered for my sake. But the Gods that never faile to strengthen them that carrie an honest mind, gave me sufficient power to resist his treacherous temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by contempt of death, to preferre an honest same before a shamefull life.

Then the feare of perpetuall shame and infamie to me, and to all you my kinsfolkes, prevailing more with me, than the terror of death, though my heart consented not, my body yeelded to fulfill his lust. And albeit I absolve my selfe of the fault, yet I wil not remit to my selfe the paines of death, lest any matron of Rome should hereafter take occasion, by mine example, to live when her honour is lost.

This man according to his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, claimed her openly in the Court, and sayd, that she was borne in his house, and stolen from him, and conveyed to the house of <hi>Virginius,</hi> who falsely tooke

There was a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of people to see the end of this tragedy, and much murmuring against <hi>Appius,</hi> whose wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they began to conjecture. And as her friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him, that for as much as her father was absent in service of the common-wealth, the matter might bee stayed untill his returne; <hi>Appius</hi> answered, that he was contented to deferre judgement untill the next day, yet so, as he that challenged her might receive no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; which would be, if he should lose the possession of her: and therefore hee would take order that hee should put in sufficient suretie to bring the damsell in place againe, when her father was come, and then hee would judge her to him that should have best right. At these words, he that should be her husband, pressed to come neare to lay hold upon his wife, but beeing kept out by <hi>Appius</hi> commandement, hee cried out upon his unjust sentence, and told him hee would rather dye, than suffer his wife to be taken from him; and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hot words, <hi>Appius</hi> perceiving the discontentment of the people, set her at liberty untill the next day, and sent secretly to the campe, to some of his friends, to stay her father there. But <hi>Virginins</hi> friends having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him, he came to Rome the same night. The next day when <hi>Appius</hi> had sitten a while in the place of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before he that challenged the yong woman for his slave, spake any word to demand her, and before her father could come to answer for her, hee adjudged her to the yong man that challenged her.

Then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one departed with great sorrow and anger, and left the yong virgin alone with her master.

For, in the Reigne of King <hi>Roderick,</hi> there was a Prince in Spain, called <hi>Iulian</hi> Earle of <hi>Cepta,</hi> who had a daughter of excellent beautie &amp; wisedome, called <hi>Caba:</hi> this damsell being sent to the Court to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Queen, the King fell so extremely in love with her, that perceiving shee would not be enticed to agree to satisfie his inordinate desire, he took her away by force, and defloured her in his Palace. The which when Count <hi>Iulian</hi> understood, hee received thereof such griefe, that hee determined to revenge so great an injurie upon the Kings owne person. But dissembling the matter, that hee might have the better opportunity, when the King sent him with an armie to make warre upon the Moores, who then invaded the borders of Spaine, hee practised with the King of the Moores, to send over an Armie, promising to bring all Spaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his obedience; which being done, the Moores with

the Counts ayd, joyned in battell with King <hi>Roderick,</hi> and after great spoyle done to the country, overthrew him, with all his nobilitie and armie; so as the King could never after bee found quicke or dead: and the Moores not long after became masters of all Spaine.</p>

And as hee was musing with himselfe how this matter should come to passe, the Courtisan (who had untyed secretly the lincks, and stolen part of the chaine away) made shew as though shee marvelled why hee looked so sad, and asked the Gentleman whether hee felt any griefe: It seemeth (quoth shee) you have taken some cold, because your head is waxed great, and your face swollen; and therewith she put a glasse in his hand of that sort that maketh things shew greater and larger than they are indeed.

               <p>These passions of love doe worke wonderfull and strange effects, in many that yeeld themselves to bee overcome by them. Historiographers report of a yong <note place="margin">The like we reade of Rygnialion.</note> man in Athens, of very good parentage, and rich, that was so enamoured upon an Image of Marble, very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially made, and set up in a publicke place, that he would embrace it, and make love to it, as though it were a living Creature; and could not endure it to be out of his sight, but alwaies remained by it. And if it chanced him to be from the Image, he would weep and lament so grievously, that it would pitty any hard heart to behold him. This Passion grew so strong in him, that hee made sute to the Senate to sell the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to him, for such price as themselves would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that he might remove it from thence to his own dwelling place. But the Senate denying his request, because it was a publicke thing, he caused to be made a rich Crowne of gold, with other jewels and sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons attire, and put it upon the Image, which hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and adored in such extremitie, that the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved at his folly, forbad him to come any more neare it: whereat he conceived such griefe and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that he killed himselfe.

               <p>And though this bee very strange, yet that which cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Authors write of the King <hi>Xerxes,</hi> is more strange, or rather monstrous.

               <p>The desire of this fleshly pleasure brought forth a most vile and wicked sect, among the Friers and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men at Naples, in the time of Pope <hi>Egidius.</hi> As <note place="margin">Lecherous Friers.</note> there happened a dissention among the Popes, these Friers, in contempt of Christian Religion, would as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble themselves together in the night, both men and women, in caves and secret places, fit for their purpose: where, to cover their villanie with some shew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, the Priests that were among them would sing Psalmes, after the manner of Christians. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finished, the Priests, as it were beginning a Sermon, would say something to confirme their wicked errour; the effect of whose speech should bee, That above all things Charitie ought to bee embraced: which, by the testimonie of holy Scripture, was the head of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and that the principall exercise of this Charitie among men, (God himselfe being Author thereof) <note place="margin">Horrible blasphemy.</note> consisted in the coupling together, by the holy Ghost, of male and female, in the worke of <hi>Venus.</hi> And when every man had defiled that woman (the lights being put out) whom before hee had set his eyes upon, then the divine service was finished. These men taught pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that this was not the Testimonie of Christ, <hi>My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave unto you:</hi> But this, <hi>Increase and multiply, and replenish the earth.</hi> And if any of these women happened to be with child, the Priests
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:896:37"/>
commanded the childe to be brought to them, who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling together in a place appointed for their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, after a solemne sort, would burne the infant to ashes, which they would gather up and keep in a pot, as a holy thing. And when any new Priest was to receive Orders by them, he must drinke of those ashes in wine. And when their chiefe Bishop happened to dye, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd envie, and that a new might seeme to bee chosen to supply his roome, rather by some divine power, than by themselves, they would command the mother of some childe borne in that wicked sort, to bring it to some of their secret places appointed for that purpose, and the Priests as they sate (the people standing by) would take the childe, and deliver it from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every one brusing it with his hands, continuing this order still, untill the poor wretch were killed: then in whose hands it dyed, that was the man that must bee the chiefe Bishop. These be the effects that the desire of fleshly pleasures bringeth forth.

               <p>Many lewd devices have beene invented by them, to effectuate their purpose, that have given themselves to satisfie their lusts with the pleasures of the flesh. In a village not farre from the mountaines of Savoy, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited with a rude and ignorant kinde of people, there was one chosen to bee their Parish Priest, only because hee could reade, more meete to drive the cart, than to serve in the Ministerie. This man grew in such favour with those rude people, that almost all the women used to make him their gossip; with whom by that means he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:896:37"/>
became very familiar, but especially above all the rest, he was in favour with a poor mans wife, called <hi>Lisetta.</hi> This man was much troubled in minde, to see his wife so great with the Parish Priest, and being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous not without cause, hee forbade his wife all Priests companie. Sir <hi>Morice</hi> (for so hee was called) being much out of quiet, for lacke of his gossips companie, sent an old Witch to consult with her, how they might come together againe after their accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med manner. My daughter (quoth she) I see your minde is much troubled, your friend is in the like perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, because hee cannot enjoy your companie as hee hath done; and I my selfe having felt the like passions in my youth, seeme to feele in my selfe the paines of your sorrow. But now the matter standing upon these termes, some remedy must be found: Dare you faine, that you are possessed with a spirit? O my mother (said the young woman) I could willingly play that part ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially enough, if I thought that could bring our purpose to passe. When the old Witch had instructed <note place="margin">A wicked imposture.</note> her what to doe, <hi>Lisetta</hi> at the time the Priest was at Masse, began to stare with her eies, to wring her hands, to fome at the mouth, and to howle like a wolfe. The foolish people beholding this unwonted sight, ranne to wonder at her, supposing she had been possessed with a spirit. Her husband likewise lamenting her miserable estate, supposing her to suffer great torment, laid aside all suspicion, and ran, like one that had beene out of his right minde, to the Priests house, desiring him to take the paines, by his exorcismes, to drive this wicked spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit out of his wife. Sir <hi>Morice</hi> counterfeiting great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for her torments and paine; O my Gossip (quoth he) your over-much frowardnesse to your wife and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:896:38"/>
without cause, hath brought her to this; the like whereof happeneth somtimes to women of greatest honesty: and so taking his stole and other instruments for his conjuration with him, to the sicke woman hee goeth: and after hee had mumbled softly to himselfe many prayers, he asked the spirit who he was. <hi>Lisetta</hi> being sufficiently instructed by the old bawde, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a low hoarse voyce; I am the spirit of this young womans father, condemned to this penance for ten yeares to passe out of one bodie into another. The husband hearing him to bee the spirit of his father in law, besought himearnestly to depart out of his wife, &amp; to torment her no more. The spirit answered him; I wil go forth of this woman, and I wil change my lodging, and enter into thee. Then the poore man, terrified with <note place="margin">Silly men soone fool'd</note> this hard sentence, embraceth the Priest about the neck, and lamentably desired him to shew, whether he knew any way how hee might avoyde this severe sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, by prayers, by fasting, by almes, or by any other good deeds. <hi>Lisetta</hi> being glad to see this matter frame so well to her purpose; My friend (said she) your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty will not suffer you to doe that were requisite to avoyd this sentence, and therefore in place thereof, you must visit forty Churches, and say many prayers in every of them with good devotion, by which meanes you shall obtaine pardon of God for your sins, otherwise you can never escape Gods ordinance. This penance <hi>Lisetta</hi> layd upon her husband, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the farre distance of those Churches one from another, in that pilgrimage, there might bee time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to quench the furie of the spirit. But that all things might be done without feare and suspicion, in her counterfeit voyce shee blameth him for the wrong
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:896:38"/>
hee hath done his gossip, suspecting him without a cause, a holy man, whose prayers were greatly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable before God, and advised him whilest he was in his pilgrimage, to commit the charge of his wife to this holy man. The poore fellow hoping in this sort to bee released from the paines of Purgatory, desired forgivenesse upon his knees of the Priest: which being without great difficultie obtained, hee proceedeth on his pilgrimage, lest some worse matter might happen to him. In the meane time, Sir <hi>Morice</hi> imployed all his diligence, both day and night, that this spirit being chased out of her, another might supply his roome. Which being turned into the forme of a young living childe, her silly husband thought himselfe, after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from his pilgrimage, to bee thereof the naturall father, that had least interest in it. Thus are they carried away from all respects and duties both to God and men, that give themselves to satisfie their lusts with fleshly pleasures.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest there was one <hi>Lucius</hi> extremely enamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon a faire young maiden, daughter to a man of good account: and that hee might have his pleasure of her, hee procured the tyrant to command her parents to send her to him.

The young virgin that had bin vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously brought up, fell downe at her fathers feete, and

in lamentable wise embracing his legges, besought him with teares, that hee would not suffer her to bee disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. She would preferre her honour before her life, and would rather chuse to suffer any kinde of death, than to bee so shamefully dishonoured. The father and mother being greatly moved with the lamentation of their daughter, wept bitterly, and made some stay of their resolution. <hi>Lucius</hi> perceiving her not to come, unpatient of any delay to fulfill his beastly lust, went to her fathers house, where hee found her upon her knees, holding her fathers legges fast in her armes, and with great threatnings he commanded her to arise, and to follow him; but the young maiden renewing her lamentable complaints, and refusing to goe with him, hee tare her clothes in pieces, and stripped her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and beat her cruelly. The parents beholding this <note place="margin">Lust turnes to Tyranny</note> wofull sight, besought him upon their knees, that hee would have compassion upon her, and them. And when they saw no hope of favour in this cruell man, they called upon the gods and men for help: wherwith hee fell into such a rage, seeing hee could not have his will, that hee drew his sword, and thrust it through the young woman, as she held her fathers legges in her armes. But this beastly fact so little offended the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that such as shewed any mislike to the matter, hee eyther put to death, or banished: which purchased him such hatred of all men, that certaine of his subjects not willing any longer to endure his tyranny, conspired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and slue him.

And comming to the king, who was desirous to heare whether hee had found the cause of his sonnes sicknesse; he told him, that his son was in love with a woman, but such an one as hee could by no means have, which was the only cause of his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Then he being glad it was no worse, hoping that whosoever she was, he would by some meanes obtaine her for him, though it cost him a great part of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, desired to know who it was that his sonne was in love with.

Doest thou not consider <note place="margin">An holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</note> that the nearer thou approachest to it, the farther thou departest from thy God? the more thou thinkest to winne without, the more thou losest within; that is, thy self which is or greater price? the more careful thou art of temporall things, the more want thou hast of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things? Thou settest all things in good order, and makest none account of thy selfe. There is not a beast but thou tamest, and thy selfe remainest without a bridle; thou art vigilant in all things, but in thine owne matters thou art fast asleepe. The desire of base

things hoyleth in thy heart, and in the meane while heavenly things lyeth quenched. The nearer thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest to thy death, the sarther thou goest from thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Wee should take heed lest that curse fall upon us, that the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> speaking of the carelesse nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and gentrie of the Iewes, that gave themselves to banquetting and pastimes, without consideration of their duties towards God, a matter usuall enough, and too much in these dayes: The lute and harpe, saith hee, and timbrell and shalme, and good wine aboundeth in your banquets, but the workes of God you respect not, nor have any consideration of his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And that it may appeare, how many that give their delight to pleasures and vaine pastimes, through their owne vanitie and foolishnesse, are brought strangely to their ends, when they are in the midst of their jollitie. The French King <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth, his minde being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered, committed the governement of his Realme to others, and gave himselfe to pastimes: there chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a marriage to bee solemnized in his Court, where <note place="margin">Carriage not beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a King.</note> the King was disposed to make himselfe and others merrie, he put off all his apparell, and disguised his face like a Lion, annointing his body with pitch, and flatned staxe so artificially to it, that he represented a monster, rough, and covered with haire. When he was thus atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and five others as wise as himselfe, they came into the chamber among the Lords and Ladies, dauncing and singing in a strange tune, all the Court beholding them. The Duke of Orleance, whether that hee might

               <p>The Emperour <hi>Commodus,</hi> among other his vain toyes &amp; pleasures, when he beheld the Goddesse <hi>Ifis</hi> painted with naked breasts, hee caused the breasts of the Priests of that Temple to be scratched with a horse comb, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it were no reason their Goddesse should have <note place="margin">Vaine curl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ositie.</note> naked breasts, and theirs to bee covered. And seeing the Goddesse <hi>Bellona</hi> painted with a broken Arme, hee caused the right armes of the Priests that guarded her Temple, to be put out of joynt, affirming, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as their Goddesse had a broken arme, her Priests ought not to have their armes whole and sound. But his vaine pleasures, joyned with tyrannie, was so offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive to the people of Rome, that the night before hee intended to celebrate the feast of their God <hi>Ianus, Commodus</hi> determining to shew himselfe in the habit not of an Emperour, but of a Gladiator, or sword play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was murdered. Many of all estates be so addicted to please their senses with the vaine pleasures of this world, that they will not trouble their heads with any thing but sports and pastimes; of whom it is written, They esteeme this our life to bee but a play-game.

The old Romanes had a Law, that a wise man being a publike loose-liver, should bee more grievously punished than a secret mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer; because hee killed but one, with the sword of his anger; the wise man killed many, with the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his life. And one said, that there are three things which hasten a man to his end before his time; a yong woman, excesse of eating and drinking, and unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some ayre.</p>
               <p>Beware therefore thou bee not allured by their false shewes, to seeke felicitie in Pleasures: for hee that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custometh himselfe to them, will hardly be brought to forbeare them; and then is hee throughly in the estate of infelicitie, whom unhonest things doe not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, but also please: for there is no place left for reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, when vices be converted into manners. Wherefore if thou find thy self affected or addicted to any of these Pleasures that draw men into infelicitie, withstand them at the first, after the Poets counsell, before they have taken root, and growne into a custome.

               <p>But the felicitie of man, or his greatest good, cannot consist in Riches, which is subject to so many adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures &amp; accidents of fortune, and so easily lost; it must be some other thing that is more stable and permanent. Coine of gold and silver was but the invention of man, for the commoditie of life: for, a time there was when <note place="margin">That age was called the golden.</note> the use of money was not knowne, but exchange was made of one thing for another, and possessions were not divided, but all things were common; and in some countries it is so at this day. Yet the felicity of man was then the same as it is now. If riches were good, it would make them good that possesse it, but none are made good by it, many are rather made worse; which being gravely considered of <hi>Licurgus</hi> King of <hi>Lacedamon,</hi> he banished gold &amp; silver out of his kingdome, and turned his coyne into iron. By which act he delivered his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from two notable vices, and enemies to a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; besides many other, from theft and briberie; for who would steale that which was little worth, and could not be carried away, but in the sight of all men? For he had so ordered the matter, that a great masse of Iron turned into coine, should be of small value. And therefore no Magistrate could receive any bribe,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:896:43"/>
but every man must see it, a cart loade being of very small value. Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> in his <hi>Vtopia,</hi> preferreth Iron, as a more necessary metall to a Common-wealth, before gold or silver, which he imployeth to base uses. This English Poet curseth, not without cause, the first finder of this scurfe of the earth, which hath beene the occasion of an infinite number of mischiefes.

               <p>Our Saviour Christ teacheth us, how farre they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acoived that set their felicitie in riches, by the similitude of a Camell, that may as easily passe thorow the eye of a needle, as a rich man may enter into the kingdome of heaven. And againe, <hi>Lay up your treasure in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Riches is rather desired for some other thing, than for it selfe: of some the rather thereby to attaine to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; of others to live in pleasure: and then cannot felicitie be said to be in riches. For that thing, wherein felicitie doth consist, must be the last end, and greatest good; and all other things must serve for that.</p>
               <p>Let us looke into the estate of such as wallow in wealth and riches, and that of a poore husband-man, that hath no more than is sufficient to serve his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie uses, and by comparing them together wee shall see, that his countenance is more chearefull and merry, and laugheth more heartily and often, than the rich; he eateth his meate with a better appetite, and digesteth it with a better stomacke; hunger is his sauce, biefe and <note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of temperance</note> bacon is as pleasant in his taste, as the partridge &amp; fesant is to the rich; small drinke is to him, as delicate wine to the other: because the appetite, &amp; not the meat &amp; drink
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:896:44"/>
giveth difference to the taste: as appeared by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that mighty Monarch <hi>Darius,</hi> who flying from <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, being very dry, dranke very foule water, and said afterward, he never dranke better drink; the reason was, because hee never thirsted throughly before. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This poor mans bodie is <note place="margin">Hunger the best lauce.</note> more healthfull, and free from many diseases, to which the rich man is subject by his casie and delicate life; his head is not so full of cares, and if any happen, they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish away quickly, like a thin cloud; whereas they who by their riches are called happie, rather make shew of mirth, than are so from the heart; their minds being oppressed with continuall cares, to keep, or bestow that they have gotten, and to get more; which maketh him wake, when the other sleepeth soundly. And so much the more unhappy the rich man is, that hee must some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dissemble his sad and troubled minde, and make shew as though hee were in great happinesse, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is rather in miserie. What wealth and riches is comparable to health of body, and quietnesse of mind? It is better, saith <hi>Phocion,</hi> to live lying upon the ground with a good and quiet minde, than troubled in a bed of gold: which the Poet seemeth to confirme;

There is no greater <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> signe of a base and wretched mind, than to love riches. One great hinderance to felicitie, besides many other, riches bringeth, for the most part, to them that possesse it, that they are never content with that they have, but alwaies desire more. <hi>Qui mulium habet, incipit plus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Soneca.</note> 
                  <hi>posse:</hi> He that hath much, beginneth to be able to have more; and then a will never faileth to joyne with abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: whereof ensueth the notorious vice of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, a capitall enemy to felicitie; for without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, no man can enjoy that happinesse wee looke for in this life. Great travell have the poore men that want all things, but much more have the rich men that are content with nothing. Riches were greatly to be desired, if felicitie were to be bought. But a minde free from all perturbations, and content with his owne estate, cannot be bought with gold nor silver. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation is not procured by abundance of riches, but is rather gotten by taming and mastering our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and affections. Hee is not happy (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) whom the common sort calleth happy, that hath great store of goods, but he whose goods are in his mind; that seeth no man with whom he would change him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his fortune; that estimateth a man by that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:896:45"/>
part, by which he is a man of a sound judgment; not to be terrified or made affraid with every winde, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not upon the uncertaine accidents of fortune, but upon himselfe. <hi>Socrates</hi> espying a very rich man, and proud withall, but endued with no vertue; Here is (quoth he) a horse covered with a caparison of cloth of silver. And <hi>Diogenes</hi> likened a rich man unlearned, to a ramme in a golden fleece. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, If riches be a possession to bee desired in this life, what is richer than wisedome, that worketh all things? A Senatour of Rome said to <hi>Sylla,</hi> that vaunted of himselfe in the Senate; How can you be a good man, that had little or nothing left you by your father, and yet in so short time are become so exceeding rich? The life of a poor man is compared to a navigation made by the sea coast, where they may at their pleasure get them into safe harborough, and cast anker when they see any danger at hand: And the life of a rich man, to them that sayle in the maine sea, farre from land; who if a tempest chance to arise, are in danger to bee swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of the sea, without any meanes to save themselves: which the Poet seemed to espie, when he said;

By which answer, to him that so insolently gloried in the glittering shew of his riches &amp; possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the god gave to understand, that he allowed better of a poor cottage, possessed with a light &amp; merry heart, than a sad Princes Court, full of cares and pensivenesse; and of a little ground without feare, than the fertile fields of <hi>Lydia</hi> full of terror; &amp; of a yoke or two of oxen casie to bee ruled, than an army of men combersome with excessive expence; and a barne serving for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie uses, of no man greatly desired, than riches and treasure, subject to all mens snares, &amp; covetous passions. But because we shall have occasion sometime to speake of this Oracle, a briefe description of the place will give some light to that which shall be said.</p>
               <p>There was a steep hill in <hi>Photis</hi> a Country in Greece called <hi>Parnassus,</hi> by which was built the famous citie of <hi>Delphos:</hi> this hill was full of craggie rockes, and so fortified by nature, that there needed no supply of Art for defence. In the middest of the hill there was a little plaine, wherein was a deepe hole, (the habitation of Sathan) out of that hole issued a certaine cold breath, which strake the Priests and Virgins that were there resident, into a frenzie, and compelled them to give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the questions demanded; which was called the Oracle of <hi>Apollo.</hi> Because in this plaine was a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple builded (as some say) by <hi>Agamedes</hi> and <hi>Trophonius,</hi> and dedicated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> one of the Heathens gods.

O <hi>Cyrus</hi> (quoth hee) thy prosperous fortune, and my evill destiny brought mee to it; chiefly encouraged to make this warre upon thee, by the Grecians god: For who is so madde that without such a principall author dare preferre warre before peace? seeing that in peace

Answer was made by the Oracle, that whatsoever was fatall, was inevitable to the gods themselves: That <hi>Croesus</hi> was thus punished for the offence of his grandfather <hi>Gyges,</hi> that slew <hi>Candaules,</hi> king of the Lydians: And as touching the Oracle, that it was not to bee reproved for a lye, having expressed his meaning in plaine termes, that if <hi>Croesus</hi> by the greedie desire to enlarge his dominion, would make warre upon the Persians, he should destroy a great king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which was the kingdom of Lydia, and it so came <note place="margin">Salust.</note> to passe.

things necessary for his journey. When this Provost had provided him a ship, and all things necessary, and beheld him but simply apparelled, he prepared for him divers garments, in the most honest and comely sort, that Philosophers then used: But <hi>Origen</hi> would receive no part thereof, not so much as hose or shooes, but like as hee used alwayes to goe from his child-hood (that was, in a single garment of cloath, and bare-foot) so went he to Rome. And when, at his arrivall, there were brought to him a Mule, and a Chariot to use, which hee best liked; he answered, That he was much lesse than his master Christ, who rode but one day in all his life, and that was upon a silly asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Emperour asked; which is the living God? and why hee so called him. <hi>Origen</hi> answered, that hee did put that distinction, for a difference from them, whom men (being long drowned in errour) did call their gods; whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to be mortall once, and to have died. But the God whom he preached, was ever living, and never died: and is the life of all things that bee, like as hee was the

And when the Emperour had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him, to declare the unitie of God the creatour, hee devoutly lifting up his eyes, after a short medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with an incomparable and compendious elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, forthwith opened that mystery, in such wise, that as well to the Emperor &amp; his mother, as to all the standers by, it seemed they were brought out of a long sleepe, and then began to see things, as they were indeed, and that which before they honoured, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, were but vaine dreames and imaginations. The Emperour after a little pawse, sayd to <hi>Origen,</hi> that hee much marvelled, why men of such great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull knowledge, should honour for God a man that was crucified, being but of a poore estate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

And notwithstanding all this torment and ingratitude, hee never grudged, but lifting up his eyes to heaven, hee prayed with a low de voyce, saying, Father forgive them, for they know not what they doe. This was the charitie most incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Sonne of God, employed for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, who by the transgression of <hi>Adam,</hi> the first man that ever was created, was taken prisoner by the Divell, that is to say, kept in the bondage of error and finne, from actuall vision of Gods majesty, untill
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:896:56"/>
he were in this wise redeemed, according as it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained at the beginning. At these words of <hi>Origen,</hi> they that were present, were wonderfully astonied, and therewith the Emperour, with a sturdy countenance, sayd to <hi>Origen:</hi> You have wonderfully set forth a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable history, but yet notwithstanding therein bee things darke and ambiguous, which require a more plaine declaration: for what maketh you bold to affirme, that Iesus which in this wise was crucified, was the Sonne of God, and God, as you have called him? Sir (sayd <hi>Origen</hi>) sufficient testimony, which of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures reasonable ought to bee beleeved, and for most certaine proofe, to be allowed. What testimony is that? (sayd the Emperour.) Truely sayd <hi>Origen</hi>) it is in divers things. First the promise of God, by whom this world was made: also by his holy Scripture, speaking by the mouthes of his Prophets, as well Hebrewes, as Greekes, and other, whom ye call <hi>Vates,</hi> and <hi>Sybillas.</hi> Thirdly, by the nativity of Iesus of a pure virgin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out carnall company of a man: the most pure &amp; clean forme of his living without sinne: his doctrine divine and celestiall: his miracles most wonderfull and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable: all grounded on charitie onely, without osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: his undoubtfull &amp; perfect resurrection the third day after he was put to death: his glorious ascension up into heaven, in the presence and sight of five hundred persons, which were vertuous and of credence: also the gift of the holy Ghost, in speaking all manner of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and interpreting the Scripture, not only by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <note place="margin">Installable proo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>es.</note> but also afterwards by his Apostles and Disciples, and given to other, by imposition of their hands. And all these ordinarily followed according to the said pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and prophecies. I omit to speake of the confession
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:896:56"/>
of Divels, which by Iesus, and his Apostles in his Apostles were cast out of people which were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and answeres of them, whom ye untruely call gods, doe remaine in confirming this testimony. And when <hi>Origen</hi> had sayd all this, he forthwith began there and disclosed the answers of <hi>Apollo,</hi> made at Delphos, affirming Iesus to be God. And alterward hee recited and declared the prophecies, as well of the Hebrewes, as of the Sybilles, and other. Last, the promise of God to the Patriarkes, by the which it manifestly appeared, that Iesus was Christ, and God; and that by his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nativitie, he was king of Israel; and that the Iewes were his naturall subjects. Which declaration of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> was so evident and plaine, and set forth with such wonderfull eloquence, devotion, &amp; learning, that it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the Emperour, and divers other that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to embrace the profession of Christs faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And for that time, the Emperour licenced <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> to returne to Alexandria. And when this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour on a time perceived some to wonder at the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Origen,</hi> whereby they were induced to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Christian profession: Truely (quoth he) the <note place="margin">Which was in those dayes, not now.</note> humilitie and charitie of the Christian people, which I have heard of, and doe dayly behold, doth much more stirre me to beleeve, that Christ is God, than the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of his perswasion. And another time when two Christians contended proudly together, and accused each other for speaking reprochfull words against the Emperour, hee called them before him, and prohibited them to name themselves Christians, saying, Your pride &amp; malice do declare, that ye be not the followers of him whom ye professe: wherefore though ye sinde lacke in mee, which I will gladly amend, yet will I not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:896:57"/>
let you, against justice, reprove him by your acts, whose life and doctrine you all doe affirme to be uncorrupted and without any lacke. Thus was this noble Emperor &amp; his mother, with divers others by the learned speech of this man (agreeing with the simplicitie and single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his life, voyde of all pride and pompe, and the humility and charity used in those dayes among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians) induced to embrace Christian profession. But the pompe and pride, that riches hath sithence that time engendred in the corrupt minds and manners of men, hath rather diverted than converted men to Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For when reverence and majestie failed, that was bred in mens hearts, by the holinesse of their life that went before, it was not to be hoped for, that such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratictie of maners &amp; examples of them that followed, should bring forth the same effects. The Christians of those dayes seemed to preferre vertue before riches, with <hi>Solon,</hi> that said:

               <p>EXamples of contempt of worldly pompe &amp; riches are not so rare to be found among the Heathens, as among the Christians, <hi>Democritus</hi> a Senator of Abderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, entring into the due consideration of the vanitie of worldly goods &amp; cares, determined to alter the course of his former life, and give himselfe to contemplation. Hee used often to goe alone up to the top of a hill that joyned to the Citie of Abderita, where hee would kill dogs and calves, &amp; rip them up, &amp; make Anatomie of them, &amp; ever as hee saw how aptly nature had compact the intrailes &amp; members together, to serve the necessary uses of the creature, he would fall into a great laughing. Hee used this so often, that the Senatours marvelling what he meant to goe so much up this hill, sent one se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly after him to watch what he did. This fellow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding covertly his manner, how he cut up dogs and calves, and laughed at he knew not what, brought word to the Senatours what hee had seene. They supposing him to be mad, or become foolish, were very sorry, and lamented his case to one of the Sages or Philosophers of Greece, that was newly come to Towne. They
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:896:58"/>
told him what a great losse they had of so grave and wise a Senatour, that was now become a foole, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him to examine the cause of his sudden alteration, and to perswade him, if he could, to leave off those foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish manners, &amp; to reduce him againe to his former gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie and course of life. This man watched when hee went up the hil, and followed secretly after. And when hee had beheld him a while quartering his dogs, and laughing after his usuall manner; he came to him, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending him for his laughing, admonished him to recall himselfe to his former gravitie. <hi>Democritus</hi> after he had ended his perswasions, leadeth him to the side of the hill, where they might looke into the Citie, and Countrey round about.

And look on the other side, how that young man that married yonder old woman for her goods, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a drink to dispatch her, that he may marry a young woman. At the end of everie of these questions <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi> after his usuall manner, would fall into a great laughing. When he had ministred divers of these kinde of questions, whereby he noted the ordinarie vices, and lewd behaviour of many, which were too common in Cities and other places, where is much concourse of people, as though they had beheld them in action; Is there any man (quoth hee) that seeth these things, that can forbeare to laugh? After this man that was sent by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:896:58"/>
the Senatours had some farther discourse with <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi> hee returned to them: who, hoping that hee had perswaded him to bee of another minde, made haste to meet him, and were desirous to know what had passed between them: You are deceived (quoth he) in <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi> that think him to be mad or foolish, for he is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise, and all you be fooles. He withdraweth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the companie of you and others, because hee is out of his right mind; but hee looketh into the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world with a sound and upright judgment; and hath in contempt this worldly wealth, &amp; honours, &amp; pompe, esteeming those things as the frumps of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which ye exalt above the skies, and take for felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and giveth himselfe to the studie of Philosophie, and contemplation of the works of God, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the true felicitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diogenes</hi> after his accustomed scoffing manner, which hee used to reprehend vice, and to draw men from over-much care and estimation of worldly matters (for there is no cause to let men from speaking the truth, though in jest) on a time, as hee sate in his tub upon the side of the hill that looketh into the Citie of Syracusa, which was situate at the foot of the hill, beholding eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man occupied in ramming up their gates, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring things necessarie for defence of their Citie against their enemies that were comming to besiege it, hee rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his tub from the top of the hill to the bottome, and from thence up to the top againe, and then overthwart the hill, from one side to another; and being asked what he meant to labour so hard: Look (quoth he) what a stir yonder is, pointing downe to the towne, it is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that I be idle, when my Citizens are so occupied. By which scoffe hee would give men to understand, what

advantage they had that con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I carry (quoth he) all my goods with me: accounting nothing appertaining to him, but the goods and gifts of his minde: as the Poet saith;

As certain Fishers were drawing their nets to land, one bought their draught at adventure, not yet knowne what was within them. It chanced them to draw up enclosed within their nets, a table of gold, of great weight and value. The Fishers, desirous to reserve to themselves the golden table, said; that they sold only the fish: the other affirmed, he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:896:59"/>
bought the fortune. The contention grew so vehement, that the matter was brought before the people of the Citie, to give their censure. They considering the strangenesse of the matter, and the great value of the thing, referred the judgement to their god <hi>Apollo</hi> at Delphos. And when answer was made by the Oracle, <note place="margin">A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full modesty in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But in what countrey would the like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, and contempt of gold bee found in these later daies? In <hi>Vtopia</hi> only, and in no other common-wealth of the world. Who is he that thinketh so simply of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that being once possessed of such a thing, would yeeld over his interest to any other, as the worthier man? A cleane contrary course would be taken; the one to keep the possession, the other to recover it from him would never leave contention in law, untill their Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates by a certaine sympathie, and attractive vertue, as the load stone draweth iron, have drawn to themselves the gold, leaving peradventure to the other a Table of lighter substance. A matter grown too common in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny countries; which made <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of Spaine, when he first made conquest of the West Indies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly to forbid, that no Lawyers should passe into those countries, lest they should sow seed ofcontention among those simple people, whereof they were then free, which hee perceived, by their meanes was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much used in his own, and other Countries.</p>

The Cardinall according to his custome, came in the darke for his oates: whom when the horse-keeper espied (not knowing who it was) ranne to him with a staffe, and did so beate his master the Cardinall, that hee was faine to bee carryed away with foure men, halfe dead; Sufficient penance for such a fault.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Iohn Maria</hi> Duke of Millane punished with more severitie a Priest, that through covetousnesse denied a poore widow the execution of his office, in burying her husband, because she had not wherewith to defray the charges of the buriall. For, the Duke going in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the funerall of the dead bodie, caused the Priest, that would have sold, and made merchandise of the gifts of God, to bee fast bound to the corps, and so cast them both into the pit together.</p>
               <p>But the covetous man was never more hardly matched, nor cunninglier over-taken, than by the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man in the Poeticall figment, which aptly setteth forth the conditions of envions and covetous men;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:896:61"/>
both which vices are enemies to felicitie. The Poets fained, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> being disposed to understand the estate of the world, sent downe one of his Angels in the forme of a man; whom hee appointed to fall into the company of two Travellers, whereof the one was a covetous man, the other an envious man. After they had travelled certaine daies journeyes together, in which time the Angel had learned many things of them, and was throughly satisfied of the things he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know, hee discovered himselfe whose messenger he was, and having power from <hi>Iupiter</hi> to bestow his liberalitie upon them, he offered to recompence them presently for their good companie: Hee willed them to aske what they would, and he that made the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand should be fully satisfied of that he asked, and the other should have double so much. This liberall offer bred much contention betweene the Travellers. The covetous man, whose desire of gaine is alwaies unsati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, observing the Promises of the Angel to bee dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble so much to the second, as the first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The envious man, whose propertie is to wish no good to any other, used silence; determining rather to lose the benefit of the first demand, than his fellow should have double so much. After much courtesie betweene them, who should first aske, the envious man perceiving that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand must of necessitie bee made, to the end by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring a simple harme in himselfe, hee might bring double so much to his companion, hee desired of the Angel, that one of his eyes might bee put out; which being done, his companion was made blinde of both his eyes.</p>

And in the time of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> there were many persons that lived by usurie, which brought many to extreme povertie and lacke. The Emperour commanded great diligence to be used, to search out those contracts, and a memoriall of the most notable griefes to bee given him. Which when he had considered, hee punished the Usurers, and gave libertie to the poore men that were oppressed. A covetous man, saith <hi>Seneca,</hi> doth nothing well, but when hee dyeth; for then that money which he had long hoorded up, without imploying it to any use, is dispersed abroad into many mens hands, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for necessary uses.</p>

               <p>Gold and silver, of it selfe, is neither good nor evill; but the use, or abuse, maketh it good or bad. Money was not ordained to bee hoorded up in coffers, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous men use, but to bee imployed, to serve our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie.</p>
               <p>To this purpose I remember a Storie of an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of Venice (which wee call a Counsellour at law) that had gotten much money by his facultie, and was sent by the State of Venice to Rome, to bee there agent with the Pope. Before hee tooke his journey, hee came to take his leave of his Father, who dwele
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:896:62"/>
in the Countrie, not far from Venice, and was but a man of meane estate, and brought his money with him, which hee locked up in a coffer, and delivered the key thereof to his father, to bee kept untill his returne. After hee was gone towards Rome, the Father, desirous to see what the sonne had locked up so fast in his coffer, openeth it, and findeth a great many bagges full of money: he taketh out the money, and filleth the bags full of sand, and locketh fast the coffer againe. In his sonnes absence hee buildeth his house with his sonnes money, which before was old and ruinous, and stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth it handsomely, and apparelleth himselfe, his wife, and children in decent sort, which before were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bare; and augmented his fare with better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so as all things with him was greatly amended. After some two or three yeares, when the Advocate was returned to Venice, and from thence to visit his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he marvelled to see such an alteration. Hee began to consider with himselfe, how his fathers estate could bee thus suddenly amended; and desirous to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his money were safe, hee receiveth the key of his father, and openeth his coffer, and finding the bagges full, mistrusted nothing, but thought all had been well as hee left it. After a few daies, having occasion to use money, hee opened his bagges one after another, and finding sand in place of his money, being greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, hee ranne downe to his Father, and told him that hee was robbed: his Father seemed to marvell; How can that bee sonne (said hee) seeing I kept the key of your coffer during your absence? it is not possible that you can bee robbed. The Advocate affirming it earnestly; Come (said his father) let us goe see, I cannot beleeve it. When the coffer was opened, Looke (quoth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:896:62"/>
the father) bee not your bags as full as you left them? I knew you could not be robbed. Yea Father (said the Advocate) the bags be full, but it is sand, the money is gone. It is all one to thee my son, (quoth he) so the bags be full. Thou wouldest but let it lye here fast locked in the coffer; I have taken forth the money, and imployed <note place="margin">Money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slowed as i ought to be</note> it to those uses for which money was ordained. Thou seest how I have built my house, and apparelled my selfe, thy mother, and thy brethren and sisters. Thus aptly he taught his sonne, by an extraordinarie kind of demonstration, how money should be used.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dionysius</hi> used the like means, but with lesse severity, to make known that money was to be imployed, and not to bee hoorded. For, hearing of a rich man that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved miserably, and hid his money under the ground, hee commanded him upon paine of death to bring his money to him. The man not with standing kept some part of it backe, and brought him the rest, and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another towne to dwell, where hee imployed that money that was left in buying of land, and houses, and such things as hee lacked; and lived better with that part, than hee did before with the whole. Which when <hi>Dionysius</hi> heard, hee sent for the man, and told him, that seeing now hee knew the use of money, hee would restore his money to him againe; and delivered all he tooke from him.</p>

His souldiers fighting very faintly in his defence, because hee had layd up all his treasure in a tower, and would not pay them their wages: hee was by <hi>Allan</hi> imprisoned in the same tower, with these words; If thou haddest not kept this treasure so cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously, but distributed it among thy souldiers, thou mightest have preserved thy selfe and thy Citie. Now therefore take thy pleasure, and eate and drinke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, seeing thou hast loved it so well. And so suffered him to dye for hunger, in the middest of all his riches.</p>
               <p>O that covetous men were as covetous of their own good fame and honour, as they are greedy of other mens goods! The wise man saith, there is nothing more wicked than a covetous man: and nothing worie than to love money. And therefore hee forbiddeth men to take great labour and care to get riches. It is truly said, that men ought not to be more careful to gather riches for their children, than to get renowne among the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous; seeing it is a rule that never fayleth, That of the wicked gaine of fathers, commeth just losse to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And this is the difference betweene the covetous man, and him that is of a noble minde; that the one ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not how he come by riches, so he have them: the other can take no pleasure in any thing hee holdeth wrongfully from another. For that to remember, by what means it was gotten, taketh away contentment of the thing he hath. For, where the conscience is not quiet (saith one) there the residue of the man is nothing but ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

than if they supposed cunning playing on the Herpe came from the instrument, and not from the art. For as a body is not said to bee perfect, because it is richly arrayed, but rather because it is well proportioned, and healthfull: so the mind well instructed, is the cause that both her selfe and the body are happy. Which cannot be said of a man, because he is rich in gold and silver. It is not possible (saith <hi>Plato</hi>) that a man should bee good indeed, and very rich, both at one time: but he may wel be happy &amp; good both together. And to say that a rich man is happy, because he is rich, is foolish and childish, and unhappy are they that beleeve it. Beleeve me (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) thou canst not be rich and happy. And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie is joyned to the riches and possessions of this world, that seldome it happeneth to men long to enjoy those goods, which with much travel they have gotten. The labour to get them is long; but their use short. And he that taketh greatest pains to gather them, hath often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times least use and pleasure of them.

And those goods that are gotten by shift, are (for the most part) lost with shame. For it falleth out by daily experience, that what the wicked father getteth with care and sorrow, the unthrifty sonne wasteth with pleasure and negligence. And the wicked children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her it the worst of the fathers, that is, Riches: and are dis-inherited of the best, which are Vertnes. Riches (saith one) and honestie seldome dwell together under one roofe. And yet what is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly said? He is an honest man, for he is worth five hundred pounds, or a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:896:65"/>
thousand pounds: as though it were a strong argument, to prove a man honest, because hee is rich. Which by the opinion of these and other wise and learned men, and by daily experience falleth out, for the most part, cleane contrary. I have great possessions (saith <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>) &amp; all men call me rich; but no man calleth me hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but hee that is rich. Men (said <hi>Thales</hi>) are by nature inclined to vertue, but riches allure them to vice: and in stead of happinesse they bring care and sorrow. And as they that are sicke of the dropsie, the more they drinke, the thirstier they are: so the more men abound in riches, the more they desire to have. Povertie is the nurse of vertues, and riches of vices. <hi>Democritus</hi> was wont to say to him that desireth not riches, a little wil seeme much: for the desire of small matters maketh men rich. Which agreeth with the Poet;
<q>
                     <l>Qui nibil affectat, mirum, omnia possidet ille:</l>
                     <l>He that covets nothing, possesseth all things.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For no man ought to esteeme himselfe happy, for that he hath more than others; or that for the same hee is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed more worthy of honour, though hee bee lifted up with a wind of vaine glorie by men of little vertue, for his power and patrimonie: if he look throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter, he shall find himselfe the slave of his own riches. For little availeth it to happinesse to have large territories, &amp; great store of land, and sumptuous houses richly furnished, and to have his minde oppressed with cares, and his desires corrupted with coverousnesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> which bringeth infamy to the owner, and little good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to the necessitie of life. <hi>Socrates,</hi> to one that said, It were a great thing if a man might have all things that he desired, answered, But it were much greater, not to desire at all. He that will make himselfe rich, must not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:896:65"/>
adde more money to that he hath; but must decrease and diminish his desire of having, and thinke that it is <note place="margin">Guev.</note> all one to have, and not to desire. For it is no paine to lacke, but to him that hath a desire to have. And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other evils, is incident to rich men, who having gotten reputation or honour by their riches, the care they have to maintaine themselves and their credit in their estate, is greater than the pleasure they take in possessing them. For every small matter they thinke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth much from their reputation, &amp; when they lye dying &amp; disposing their goods gotten with such toyle of their bodies, and care to their minds, danger to their lives, and hazzard many times to their soules, there is such gaping for that they have, that they have more trouble to please all, than they took pleasure to possesse all. But improperly &amp; untruly are riches called goods, when they bring with them so many evils. For greater is the number without comparison, of such, as being good, become evill by riches, than of them that being wicked, are by riches made good.</p>

I that desire nothing but my tub, and a little bread; or thou that art King of Macedon, and doest hazzard thy selfe to so many dangers to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large thy dominions; so as the whole world seemeth too little to satisfie thy ambitious and covetous minde? <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> had <hi>Diogenes</hi> in such admiration for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of worldly goods, that he said with alowd voice, If I were not <hi>Alexander,</hi> I would be <hi>Diogenes.</hi> He said further, that there was no other felicitie in this world, than either to bee King <hi>Alexander</hi> that commandeth all, or to be <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For the King demanding of him, how he durst pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume so to molest the seas without authoritie: Because (quoth he) I rob but with one ship, and thou doest the same with a great navie, I am accused and called a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and thou a King. But if I had a navie, and thou but one ship, I should be called a King, and thou a Pirate. But the iniquitie of my fortune and poore estate, and <note place="margin">A resolute answer.</note> thy intolerable pride and unsatiable avarice, hath made us both theeves. If my bare estate were something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, peradventure I should become better; but the more thou hast the worse thou wilt be. The King par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him, and his libertie of speech; considering with himselfe, that a great navie which is prepared with riches, maketh not the right difference between a King and a poore Pirate that hath but one ship, if the end of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:896:66"/>
their enterprise be one; that is, to take by violence that which is none of theirs. But the justice and equitie of the cause maketh the true difference, and is appropriate to the dignitie &amp; qualitie of a King. The same <hi>Diogenes</hi> before named, being taken for a spie, and brought to King <hi>Philip, Alexanders</hi> father, when hee made warre upon the Grecians, and examined, said; I am indeed an espie of thy covetousnesse and madnesse, that commest hither to hazzard thy selfe and thy Kingdome. <hi>Iulius Casar</hi> passing by a little village, said, that hee had rather bee the first in that little towne, than second at Rome. By which sayings of these men it may be gathered, that they esteemed him not poore, that was not endued with worldly goods and possessions, and contented himselfe with that he had; but that he rather was poore that had much, and yet desired more: which is a thing common to all rich men.</p>

               <p>And where the greedy desire of riches hath taken roote, there is no prohibited meanes, neither by the lawes of God, nor by the ordinances of men, that can restraine them; if all other means faile, to feck for help of the Divell, to findeit out. There was a Priest but few yeares past, in the yeare one thousand five hundred thirtie, to whom the divell had shewed treasure in a chrystall glasse, at Norimberg. And when the Priest, <note place="margin">Magicians punished.</note> taking one of his friends with him, went to seeke for it without the towne, he saw in the hole where he digged, a chest, and a blacke dog lying upon it. And as he went down into the hole, the earth fell upon him, and killed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:896:67"/>
him, and filled up the hole againe. Like wise there was one that sought for money by Magicke neare Paris, and as hee would have taken up the coffer where it was, a whirle-winde carried it away, and a peece of the wall fell upon him, and made him lame all his life. A just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and good example for men to beware how they trust to the Divels helpe. And this was a strange thing, <note place="margin">Mercur.</note> that happened of late in the yeare of grace, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand five hundred ninetie one: there was one <hi>Mark Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadin</hi> that professed himselfe to bee an excellent Alcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, but indeed a notable Magician. This man came from Venice into Baviere, and there practised to make gold in such abundance, that he would give his friends whole lumps of gold; making no more estimation of gold than of brasse or iron: he lived stately like a Prince, kept a bountifull house, and had servants of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and was saluted with a title of dignitie, and drew many Princes into admiration of him; insomuch, as he was accounted another <hi>Paracelsus.</hi> And after hee had long exercised his art, made himselfe knowne to all the Princes, &amp; was desired of them all, hee came at length into the Duke of Bavieres Court, who finding after a while his fraud &amp; illusions, committed him to prison. And when the Duke had commanded him to bee exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and put to the torture, he desired he might suffer no such paine, promising that he would confesse of his own accord all the wickedness that ever he had c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and exhibited accordingly to the Duke, in writing, the whole course of his lewd life, desiring neverthelesse that it might not be published. Hee confessed, that hee was worthy to dye, but yet made humble sute that his concubine <hi>Signora Caura,</hi> and his whole familie might returne untouched into Italie. Not long after sentence
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:896:67"/>
was given against him. First, that his two dogs, whose help he had used in his Magicke matters, should be shot through with Muskets, and himselfe should have his head stricken off. For this milde sentence hee gave thanks to the Prince, alledging he had deserved a much more severe judgement, and at least was worthy to be burned. The next day a new gallowes was set up, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with copper, &amp; an halter tyed in the middest, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red likewise with copper, signifying his deceit in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king gold. Hard by the gallowes was set up a scaffold aloft, covered with blacke cloth: upon the scaffold was placed a seat, wherein this Alcumist sate, arrayed in mourning apparell. And as hee sate the Executioner strake off his head. The Poet cryeth out, not without cause, upon this love of riches:

Wee had a Cardinall here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the time of <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixth, so exceeding rich, that hee thought nothing was able to prevaile against him. And when he lay on his death bed, and perceiving that hee must dye, hee murmured and grudged; If (quoth he) the Realme of England would save my life, I am able to get it with policie, or buy it with my riches.

               <p>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith; Now <hi>goe to, ye rich men, weepe and howle in your miseries that come upon you: Your riches are rotten, and your gold and silver are rustie, and the rust thereof shall be a testimonie against you: it shall feede on your flesh like fire: You have hoorded wrath for your selves in the last day.</hi> This the holy Ghost pronounceth, to signifie unto us how vaine and dangerous a thing woldly wealth is, and how foolish they are that labour so earnestly for it, to the perpetual perill of their soules. <hi>Iob</hi> saith; <hi>Wee came naked into this world, and naked wee must goeforth againe.</hi> Yet some have beene so wedded to their riches, that they have used all the meanes they

could to take them with him. <hi>Atheneus</hi> reporteth of <note place="margin">Examples of avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men.</note> one, that at the houre of his death devoured many peeces of gold, and sewed the rest in his coate, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that they should be all buried with him. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrates</hi> being loth that any man should enjoy his goods after him, made himselfe by his will heire of his owne goods. The Cardinall <hi>Sylberperger</hi> tooke so great a pleasure in money, that when hee was grievously tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the gowt, his onely remedy to ease the paine, was to have a bason full of gold set before him, into which hee would put his lame hands, turning the gold up-side-downe. <hi>Hermon</hi> was so covetous, that dreaming on a time hee had spent a certaine summe of money, for very sorrow he strangled himselfe. And one <hi>Phidon</hi> was so extremely overcome with that passion of covetousnes, that being fallen into desperation through a losse received, he would not hang himselfe, for spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of three-halfe-pence to buy him an halter, but sought a way to death better cheape. One <hi>Antonio Bati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stei,</hi> an Italian, having lost in a ship that was drowned five hundred crowns, determined like a desperate man to hang himselfe; and as he was about to fasten the rope to a beame for that purpose, he found by chance there hidden, a thousand crownes. And being very glad of this good fortune, hee exchanged the halter for the crownes, and went away. Not long after hee was gone, the owner came thither to see his gold; but when hee perceived the crownes to bee gone, hee fell into such extreme griefe, that hee presently hanged himselfe with the halter that he found in their place. <hi>Antippus</hi> the Philosopher following a contrary course, <note place="margin">Examples of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</note> having turned all his patrimonie into ready money, went to the sea side, and there cast it into the water,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:896:69"/>
saying; Hence with a mischiefe ye ungracious desires; for I drowne you, because you should not drowne me. <hi>Ancrates</hi> a Theban, being weary of worldly cares, and houshold affaires, forsooke his patrimonie, that was of the value of foure thousand and eight hundred crownes, and betooke himselfe to a staffe and a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers bagge, and departed. Hee that desireth over-great riches, or possessions, seemeth to be wiser in the choyce of his garment; which hee will rather have to bee meete for his body, than too long or too large. Hee that is wise will content himselfe with that which is sufficient, and feeleth no want; but the foolish man troubleth himselfe with cares and thoughts, and though hee wallow in abundance, yet hee is never satisfied. So as his riches and over-great plentie breeds him extreme penurie, and maketh him leade a miserable life.</p>
               <p>A Knight of Malta, despising riches, and delighting in a solitarie life, caused this to bee written before his garden:
<q>
                     <l>He is rich enough that needeth not bread:</l>
                     <l>Of power enough, that is not compelled to serve.</l>
                     <l>Ye civill cares, get ye farre from hence.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sabbas Cast,</hi> a solitarie man, being content with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, doth dwel in these little secure gardens. Whether he be poore or rich, if thou be of an upright judgment, consider. Farewell.</p>
               <p>The greatest wisedome (saith one) and felicitie in this world is, to live quietly, and deale in his owne matters, rather than in other mens. Then, in both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, whether thou must doe or suffer, to have regard rather to God than men, and upon him only to depend. To despise the world; to despise none; to despise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:896:70"/>
to despise that he is despised: these foure things (saith one) maketh a man happie. <hi>Celius</hi> saith, it is a great gladnesse and rejoycing to the soule, when thou dost not oncumber thy selfe with the care of many things, but art perswaded that thou mayst live quietly with a little, and hast cast under thy feete the world and all the pompe thereof. Take away luxuriousnesse and excesse of earing and drinking, and the lusts of the slesh, &amp; no man will seeke for riches. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the fifth was so liberall to the poore, that hee left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to himselfe: whereupon hee would often take occasion to say merrily: That he was a rich Bishop, a <note place="margin">Few such Popes.</note> poore Cardinall, and a beggerly Pope. God will not suffer him to live in lacke that is bountifull to the poor, and useth mony to that end for which it was ordained. The Emperour <hi>Tiberius Constantine</hi> spent upon the poore, and other good uses, great store of treasure, which his Predecessor <hi>Iustinian</hi> had hoorded up.

A covetous man falling grievously sicke, and perceiving hee must dye, and that hee could

carry nothing with him into another world, turned to his friends and kinsfolkes that were about him, and said; Take you example by me (my deare friends) to the end, that in heaping up of riches, you trouble not your selves more than honestie requireth. For I that have spent all my time in scraping goods and treasure together, must now leave this life, and of so much land, and costly apparell that I have, I shall possesse nothing else, but five foote of ground, and one old sheete.

                  <hi>Hee that loveth money</hi> (saith <hi>Ecclesiastes) will never bee satisfied with money; and who so delighteth in riches shall have no profit thereof.</hi> And what pleasure more hath hee that possesseth them, saving that hee may looke upon them with his eyes? A labouring man slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth sweetly, whether it be little or much that hee ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: but the abundance of riches, will not suffer him to sleep. <hi>I have scene</hi> (saith he) <hi>riches kept to the hurt of him that hath them in possession.</hi> For oftentimes they perish with his great miserie and trouble. And it is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thing among men, when God giveth man riches, goods, and honour, so that hee wanteth nothing of all that his heart can desire, and yet God giveth him not leave to enjoy the same, but another spendeth <note place="margin">Answers worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</note> them. <hi>Vincentio Pestioni,</hi> an Italian Gentleman, being asked, how old hee was; answered, that hee was in health. And to another that asked how rich hee was, he answered that he was not in debt. As if hee should say, that he is young enough that is in health, and rich enough that is not in debt. The rich man is compared to a Peacocke, that climbeth up to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est places, as the rich man aspireth to honour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence. And as the Peacocke is decked with faire feathers, and so delighteth to bee seene, and to behold his taile, that hee discovereth his filthy parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde: So the rich man rejoyceth in his wealth and precious attire, and delighteth in flatterie, in pride, and vaine glorie. And whilest hee goeth about to shew his bodie well fed, and set out with costly ornaments, hee sheweth a brutish minde, voyd of vertue, and full of vice and vanitie. The more (saith <hi>Boccace</hi>) that riches is had in estimation, the more is vertue had in contempt. This rule (saith <hi>Plato</hi>) will seldome faile, that when the

fathers have too much riches, the sonnes have no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue at all: because betweene ease and superfluitie of riches, vices and not vertue are wont to bee nourished. A Philosopher said, that the gods are so just in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding their gifts, that to whom they give conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, from them they take riches; and to those they give riches, they take from them contentation. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <note place="margin">Imitable examples.</note> a Philosopher, having received of King <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> the value of tenne thousand duckets for a gift, entred into so many conceits and fantasies, that hee passed three dayes and three nights without sleepe; which sudden change and alteration put him in such a feare of some great evill to follow, that hee carried forthwith the money to the King; and told him, that hee restored his gift to him againe, because it did let him from sleepe. <hi>Epictetus</hi> the Philosopher was wont to say, that povertie doth not cause unquietnesse, but mens desires: and that riches doe not deliver men from feare, but reason. And therefore hee that will use reason, will not covet superfluous riches, nor blame tolerable povertie. <hi>Seneca</hi> was wont to say, that a bull filleth himselfe with a little medow, a wood is sufficient to feed many Elephants: but man through his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot be satisfied with the whole earth, neither yet with the sea.</p>
               <p>And this is to bee noted, that notwithstanding the goodly lessons and precepts that <hi>Seneca</hi> gave of the dangers and troubles, which commonly accompanie great wealth and riches, he had neverthelesse gathered together abundance of riches and possessions, procuring thereby to himselfe much envie; which was the chiefe cause of his destruction. And the same may bee a document to others, to bee very wary and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:896:72"/>
that they be not carried away, and overcome with the inordinate desire, and love of riches and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, when so wise and learned a man, that could give so wholesome counsell and remedies to others, was himselfe infected and overthrown by the same disease. <hi>Seneca</hi> was schoole-master to the Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> in his youth, and afterward in such authoritie and credit with him, that for a time he managed all the affaires of the State, and gathered great wealth: which through envie procured him many enemies; among which <note place="margin">Wise men not free from ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.</note> number was one <hi>Snillius,</hi> who was highly in <hi>Nero's</hi> favour; and spake thus unto <hi>Seneca</hi> in the Princes presence: By what wisedome, by what instructions, and doctrine of Philosophie, wherein thou takest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee to bee studious, hast thou within lesse than foure yeares, whilest the Emperour hath favoured thee, and shewed thee signes of love, gotten together three thousand times sesterties? (which value after the french mens account, is seven millions, and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand crownes.) But though <hi>Seneca,</hi> for that time escaped the accusations of his enemies, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving foure years after his authoritie taken from him, and his former favours diminished, and that the Prince lent his eares to his enemies, hee began to feare, and to save his life; and to prevent the Emperours cruelty, he came to him, and by way of oration spake thus: It is fourteene yeares or thereabout (O King) sithence I came to you, and eight yeares of this time have you beene Emperour, in which space you have heaped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee such goods and honours, as there wanteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to my felicitie, but a moderation thereof. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee had reckoned up many benefits, and great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which hee had received of <hi>Nero,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

wherein consisted riches; he beganne to accuse himselfe, that hee had not kept the Lawes of written knowledge, and lived onely by Philosophie, which would have taught him to bee content with a little, or that which is sufficient. He told him that the riches and possessions which hee had bestowed upon him, were so great, that hee was not able to beare them, but rather was ready to sinke under his own burthen. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee desired <hi>Nero,</hi> that hee would ease him of this charge, and send his officers to seaze upon all to his use, to whom it rightly appertained: alledging it to bee a thing glorious to the Emperour, that hee had advanced them to the highest dignities, that could also beare meane fortune, and be content with a little. <hi>Nero</hi> answered him with great commendations of his service, and worthinesse, and exalted <hi>Seneca</hi> his merits farre above his rewards, and that hee had bestowed greater benefits upon them that had much lesse deserved than <hi>Seneca</hi> had. Hee told him, that the delivering of his money, the leaving his Prince, would not bee imputed to his moderation, nor to his desire of quietneste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But <hi>Fabricius,</hi> Emperour or rather Generall of the Romanes Armie, carried a more upright minde, and gave a notable example of contempt of riches. For the Embadassours of the Samnites, after they had recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up many great benefits which they had received by his meanes, offered him a great summe of money, and very importunately desired him to accept it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the cause why they presented him with this money, to be, that they saw him want many things, to the honourable furniture of his house and provision, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with his estate. <hi>Fabricius</hi> drawing his hands <note place="margin">Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore he would not receive the money, whereof he had no neede, of them whom he knew could turne it to their benefit. Whereby he plainely shewed, that penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie proceedeth of greedy and covetous desires, and not of nature. As <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, frugalitie is painfull to luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious men, that delight in excesse and superfluities: but men given to temperance and sobrietie, contenting themselves with a little, feele no evill in penuric. And it is no new thing, to see wise men that have the meanes

               <p>The Barbarous people likewise of Peru, seeing the Spaniards, that first planted themselves in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, given to be covetous and luxurious, feared lest they would corrupt and alter their accustomed maners.

is to be preferred before glory &amp; honour. And honour <note place="margin">Vertue to be preferred before ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> is given as we see by dayly experience, by man; &amp; many times taken away againe by them that gave it. But that wherein felicitie consisteth, is a thing more stedfast, and not so easily removed, nor subject to the variable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of fortune. Honour is gotten with much labour, maintained with great exponces, and lost with intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble griefe and sorrow. It is likened to a mans shadow, which the more hee runneth after, the more it flieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and when he flieth from his shadow, it followeth him againe; as one saith, <hi>Qui fugit honorem, eum sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur honos:</hi> Honour followeth him that flieth from it. Who is more honoured now than Christs Apostles, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the like, that despised ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour when they lived? Of all the disordered passions where with mens minds are vexed, there is no one that troubleth and disquieteth them more, than ambition and desire of honour. They never content themselves with that which they have gotten, but their minds are alwayes imployed in devising how to get more. It is a hard thing (saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) for him that is placed in high estate, not to desire great matters. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, when hee heard a Philosopher disputing of many worlds besides this, fell into a weeping, as though some great cause of griefe had happened to him: and being asked, why he wept; Because (quoth he) I heare of many worlds, and I have not yet conquered one whole world. But he that hath felicity, is content with that he hath, and desireth no more. He is free from all pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations and unquietnesse of mind, and thinketh no man in better estate than himselfe, otherwise he cannot bee accounted happie. Which thing was by <hi>Cineas</hi> a verie wise man aptly given to understand to King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi>

When this newes was published in Rome, that the Empire should be sold, word therof was brought to <hi>Didius Iulianus,</hi> a very rich man, as he sate at supper in the middest of his pleasures. Who being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by his friends to hearken to this offer, went presently to the campe, where he found another chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whose offer the souldiers durst not accept, fearing lest hee would revenge the Emperours death, whose kinsman he was. But receiving the large promises of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus,</hi> they put downe a ladder over the wall of their camp, &amp; took him to them: where, after they had sworn him to performe his promise for the money agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they saluted him by the name of Emperour, and marched with him in order of battell, well armed, through the Citie to the Palace. The People in stead of salutations cursing him bitterly, and cast stones at him out of their windowes.

And after he had reigned seven moneths, in which time he suffered a great many indignities, being odious to all men, and to the souldiers also, because hee performed not his promise, the Senate sent a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to kill <hi>Iulianus;</hi> who declaring the sorrowful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage which hee brought him, with many teares, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi>

               <p>THe Emperour <hi>Trajane</hi> seemed to be of opinion, that the greatest felicitie is not found in the greatest estate: by a letter which hee wrote to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Rome, being new chosen Emperour, where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:896:90"/>
other things hee writeth thus: Ye know that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I was nephew to our predecessor, yet I never solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for the kingdome, and much lesse occupied my thoughts to hope for it: having learned of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that honour ought rather to bee deserved than purchased. And as I will not denie, but that a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a sweet prey, &amp; that the present of so high and excellent dignity, was welcome to mee, with inward gladnesse: so also I cannot but confesse, that I find great difference between the travels of a kingdome, and the security of a private life. Yea, after I had tasted of what bitter cares, this sweet prey is compounded, I was sory my weaknes was so soone enticed, though it be too late to repe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>. For of such quality is empire &amp; government, that if there be great honor to possesse it, there is no lesse paines &amp; travell to weild it. Oh, to how many perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <note place="margin">The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of pit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For if he be just, they will call him cruell: if he be pitifull they will despise him: if he be liberall, they will hold him prodigall: if he be a husband of that he hath, they will say hee is covetous: if he be peaceable, they will esteeme him a coward: if he bee couragious, they wil terme him quarrellous: if he be grave, they wil note him proud: if he be affable, they will impute it to lightnesse, and simplicitie: if hee be solitary, they will judge him an hypocrite: and if he be merry, they will tearme him dislolte. So that men will most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use more respect toward all others, than toward him that governeth the whole. For the Prince, they number the morsels that he eareth, they measure his paces, they observe his words, they marke what company hee k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:896:90"/>
his pastimes, and make conjecture even of his secret thoughts. Who then considereth the travels that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to principalitie, the jealousies that stand as espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als over such as rule, will confesse (I doubt not) that there is no estate more sure than that which is disseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Empire and dominion.

                  </gap> and remedie is to forbeare to be absolute, and live contented with a private estate. For if a man cannot but with great paine governe a wife whom hee hath chosen, traine up his children which he hath begotten, and instruct his servant that he hath hyred, having them all in his honse: farre greater paine shall he finde, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine in one peace &amp; vnitie, a whole common-wealth divided into strange dispositions. Sure the life of a Prince deserveth great compassion, for that in few they can repose or trust, seeing oftentimes they are most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by those whom they most favour. They cannot cate without watching, sleepe without guard, speake without jealousie, nor go without espiall. So that being Lords over all, they are prisoners to their owne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Yea, if we consider the servitude of Princes, and the liberty of subjects, we shall find, that by whom a kingdome is best mannaged, over him servitude hath most dominion. Insomuch that though Princes have authority, to give liberty to others, yet their place will not suffer them to minister it to themselves. A large sea, and a great kingdom are two things pleasant to behold, but most perillous to prove.</p>

above all the estates of the world: but weighing with his countenance and majestie, the cares and infelicities that are annexed to the seate, there is farre greater secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to follow a private life, than to manage the affaires and travels of a kingdome. And because (good <hi>Puti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) thou art so neere me in friendship and opinion, I will debate it frankely with thee, though not so much for that thou desirest to know it, yet because it brings case to my heart, to communicate my fortune, as in all adversities, it is one chiefe comfort, when men know the uttermost of their mishaps. But this was the case; The Emperour <hi>Antoninus</hi> adopting me to his sonne in law, gave me his daughter to wife, and for her dowrie, endowed me with the Empire: two things very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, &amp; even so not a little troublesome.

<q>
                     <l>Et tantum constans in levitate suaeft:</l>
                     <l>He was onely constant in his owne lightnesse.</l>
                  </q>
He gave over all his honours and dominions, to leade a private life, in a meane estate, that is free from all those troubles and peril;, which alwayes waite upon high dignities, and dominions. Many goodly perswasions, with much eloquence have been used, prudent precepts given by wise men, and pithy reasons, and probable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments have beene brought forth by many, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, that all these worldly riches and honours which wee so greatly esteeme, are but vanities, who never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of the things from which they would disswade men, and therefore not of that credit and efficacie to edifie. <hi>Aeschines</hi> the Philosopher sayth; Words well spoken, doe awake and revive the judgement: but great and manifest examples perswade the heart. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be of more validitie than precepts, and we are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taught by good life than by good words: as the Poet sayth:
<q>
                     <l>Mederis aliis, ipsus ulceribus scatens.</l>
                     <l>Hee would cure others, that was himselfe full of ulcers.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Dioclefian</hi> having passed through all the estates and dignities of this life, from the meanest to the highest, and thereby the better able, not onely by his owne wisedome, but also by his experience, to judge which
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:896:94"/>
was the best; and when hee was in the highest place of honour and glory, which men so earnestly labour for and admire, and take for felicitie, to leave all and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himselfe to a privat life and mean estate, may serve for a sufficient perswasion, that felicitie consisteth not in honour and glory, nor in worldly wealth and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after the common opinion of men. But a common errour continued, many times standeth for a law, and a judgement with authority, for a truth, and therefore not easie to be dissolved and rooted out. And <hi>Dioclesians</hi> opinion is both significantly and briefely confirmed by the Poet:
<q>
                     <l>Felix ille animi, divisque simillimus ipsis</l>

                     <l>Happi's that man in minde, and comes most neere</l>

               </p>
               <p>But the Emperours that succeeded <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> nor they which were before him, used the like consideration and foresight, of the troubles and dangers of high dignities. For th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which letter when Darius had read, he sent to the governours of his country, that he heard there was a young-man, the sonne of Philip, that overranne his countries of Asia, like one that were mad: he willed them to take him &amp; whip him with rods like a boy, &amp; send him to him clothed in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and for his noblemen &amp; captaines, that they should destroy them and his navie. But afterward when he was overthrowne in battell, and his wife and children were taken prisoners, himselfe hardly escaping, Nabarzanes and Beslus two of his principall captaines through an ambitious desire of rule, conspiring traiterously against Darius, looked for opportunitie to kill him. Where of when Darius was advertised, and counselled by some of his friends, rather to commit himself to the guard of the Grecians, than to trust his owne countrey-men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing predestinate to his chance, hee could not then beare any wholesome counsell; and hearing that such as were accustomed to the guard of his person, which

               <p>Abraham king of Marocco was driven to such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, by a preacher called Elmaheli, who had raised a power against him, and overthrew him in the field, that being voyde of all hope of succour, hee stale forth of the towne in the night on horsebacke, and tooke the Queene his wife behinde him, and being come to the top of a high rocke that stood upon the sea coast, hee put spurres to his horse and fell downe headlong, hee and his Queene, tumbling from one place to another untill they were torne in peeces.

But being more desirous of glory, than able to receive it, he commanded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be called the sonne of Iupiter, &amp; to be honored as a God. And whilest hee went about to increase the glory of his acts, he corrupted and defaced them with such vaine titles. For he received more mockes of the wiser sort, than adorations of his flatterers. When hee had sent to the Cities of Greece to have his new title of Godhead to bee confirmed by publike authoritie, and the matter being had in consultation, one steppeth up and sayd; Well seeing Alexander will needs have it so, let us make him a god. A frumpe worthy of such a vaine glorious petition. And as Cleo, an Italian of Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, given to flattery both by his owne nature, and by the custome of his countrey, had used perswasions, and set downe a forme to honour Alexander as a God: Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenes being of a contrary opinion; Are not they good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gods Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But flattery was never better rewarded, than by M. Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius the Triumvir. For when he entred into Athens,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:896:101"/>
all the Citizens having first prepared exceeding great honours for his entertainement, went to meet him, and they being desirous to win his favour, used this kind of flattery: They told Antonius that they had in their city the goddesse Minerva which wanted a husband, and <note place="margin">

                  </note> were desirous to give him her to wife, who was the god Bacchus. Antonius being offended with their shamelesse flattery, sayd that he was content to accept her for his wife: but I will have (quoth he) a thousand talents for her dowry, which is requisit for so great a marriage. But the Emperor Commodus used more severity, or rather cruelty in punishing flattery. Certaine yong gentlemen of Commodus chamber, understanding that Ebutianus was put to death for weeping and lamenting the death of the Consull Byrrius: and Apollaustus another Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour, for bemoning the death of Ebutianus, the day that Apollaustus was executed, thinking to please the prince, made shew of great mirth &amp; joy for the death of Apollaustus. Which being knowne to Commodus, hee commanded their throats to be cut, saying, that for any act done by the prince, they ought neither to laugh nor weepe, but heare &amp; see and hold their peace. Xerxes the great monarch of Persia, being unmeasurably overcome with pride and vaine-glory, after the bridge which was made to transport his army over the sea called Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont, was overthrown by the tempest &amp; raging of the sea, he with such arrogancy, disdaining that the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts would not be obedient to him, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the sea to be beaten with 300 stripes, &amp; a paire of fetters to bee cast <note place="margin">A kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet their ambition and desire of vaine-glory would not suffer them here to stay, but it was searched and disputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them and their parasites, whether the Pope might decree things contrary to the Gospell? whether hee

Pope Iohn the three and twentieth taught, that there was no life after this. For which cause hee was called by the Councell of Constance a Divell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate.

               <p>Pope Sylvester the second, called before Gilbert, a Frenchman borne, came by the Popedome, as Platina, Nauclerus, Benno, the Cardinall, and others report, by the help of the Divel. In his youth he became a Monke; <note place="margin">A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In this mans house he saw a booke of Necromancy, which he was desirous to steale away. But the booke being very warily and safely kept by the Saracens daughter, with whom hee had familiar acquaintance, at last hee wan her favour, that hee might secretly take it away, and reade it over. Which when hee had gotten into his possession, with promise to deliver it againe, hee determined to depart thence, fearing neverthelesse what danger hee might fall into, by his theft. After he had escaped this danger, being overcome with ambition, and a divellish defire to rule, he obtained first by corruption, the Archbishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke of Reymes, and afterward that of Ravenna, and at last the Popedome, as is sayd before, by the helpe of the Divell; upon condition that after his death, hee
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:896:107"/>
should be wholly his, by whose subtilty, he had attained to that high dignitie. And although in his Popedome he dissembled his Necromancy, yet hee kept in a secret place a Brasen head, of whom hee received answere of such things, as he was disposed to demand of the Diuel. At length when this Gilbert, desirous to reigne long, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Divel how long he should live Pope, the wicked spirit answered him cunningly after his maner, that if he came not to Ierusalem, he should live long. And as it happened him to say Masse, after he had reigned foure yeares and somewhat more, in a Church called the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Crosse at Ierusalem, he fel suddenly into an extreame fever, and knew by the rumbling and noyse of the Divel (who looked for performance of his promise) that his time was come to dye. But he falling into an earnest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, &amp; openly confessing his impietie, &amp; familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Divell to the people, bewailed his grievous offence committed against God, and exhorted all men, to beware of ambition, and the subtiltie of the Divell, and to lead an honest and godly life. When he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that death approached, he desired, that his hands &amp; tongue might be cut off, because with them he had blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed God, and sacrificed to the Divell, and then that his mangled carkase, as it had deserved, might be layd in a cart, &amp; the horses driven forth without any guide, and where they did of their owne accord stay, that there his body might be buried. All which things being done, the horses stayed when they came against a Church of Lateran, where they tooke him forth and buried him. Whereby men conjecture, that through his repentance God had shewed him mercy. Neverthelesse whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">Gods great mercy.</note> became of his soule, the Divell would not leave his old acquaintance with his body in many yeares after.

But if a common custome had not altered the case, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified the greatnesse of the fault, it would have seemed strange, that they which professe themselves to bee Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars of Christ, should bee so familiarly acquainted with the Divell. For there were eighteene Popes Necroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, one succeeding another, as some write.

               <p>How greatly pride and desire of glory is hated of God, Herod king of the Iewes giveth a notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This man going up into the pulpit, appointed for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and rejoycing to heare the people cry out to his praise, That it was the voyce of God and not of man, hee was suddenly stricken from heaven: and when hee perceived himself to consume away with lyce, he cryed out to the people: Behold how he dyeth now with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable pain, whom not long sithence you called God. But Menecrates received a more gentle punishment for his vainglory, of Philip king of Macedon, &amp; yet worth the noting. This man, because he knew himselfe to be anexcellent physitian, would needs be called Iupiter the saviour. The King meaning to reforme his arrogancie, invited him to a feast, &amp; caused a table to be set for him alone: whereof at the first he was very glad, but when <note place="margin">Pride <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:896:112"/>
nothing but frankincense, he was much ashamed, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the feast in great anger.</p>
               <p>And as they which desire honour and glory, seeke after it, often by ungodly and prohibited meanes, so they also, that are possessed of it, many times use the like meanes, to understand the continuance of their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous estate; but their counseller, whose advice they use, answereth them for the most part so cunningly, that they are nothing the neerer of their purpose. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Nero asked counsell of the Divell, how long <note place="margin">The craft of the Divell to those that speake to him.</note> his reigne should continue: hee willed him to beware of sixty foure. Nero being then yong, was glad to heare that answere, thinking the meaning had bin, hee should have reigned Emperour, until he had bin sixtie &amp; foure yeares old: But not long after Galba was chosen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour against him who was of the age of sixtie and foure, and deposed him with losse of his life. King Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip of Macedon, moved with the like desire, sent to Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos, to know his destinie: answere was made him, by the Oracle of Apollo, that hee must take heed of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot. The king commanded all the carres and chariots in his realme to bee plucked in peeces: and such places that did beare that name, he would alwayes avoyd and forbeare to come neere them. But all that would not serve his turne; for Pausanias slue him with a sword that had a chariot graven in the pummell. Pope Paulus the third delighted much in Nicromancers, being himselfe skilfull in the art; and desirous to know his fortune, a Necromancer told him, that he should be Pope, in the yeare, one thousand five hundred thirty foure, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it happened, in the time of Leo the tenth, when there was no likelihood of any such matter: and that he should be Pope foureteene yeares, at which time hee
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:896:112"/>
should end his Popedome with his life; which came to passe. Whereby it should seeme, that the Divell hath a voyce among the Cardinals in the election of the Popes: and that God suffereth the Divell sometimes to make Popes, and to take it from them againe at his pleasure, life and all.</p>
               <p>The humour of glory and desire to rule, resteth not onely in the affections of great estates, but also is many times found to be in men of base condition. And when <note place="margin">Ambition in men of base condition.</note> possibilitie faileth to attaine to honour, by rule and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they covet to win it by some singularitie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they would excell others. And some feare not to run into a voluntary &amp; present death, to win fame and glory after this life, by some notorious fact, without respect of the wickednesse thereof, whereof these examples fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing shall serve for proofe. Calanino understanding that the people of Capua a citie in Italy (himselfe being a Tribune there) were determined to kill the Senatours, whom they hated deadly, went with them, as though he allowed of their enterprise, but advertised the Senate before of the peoples resolution, and what he would do to save their lives. He shut them up fast in a close place as prisoners, that they might not bee subject to the fury of the people. And when they were assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to put their purpose in execution, this Calanino told them, that seeing they had determined to kill all the Senators, they must first devise with themselves, who were the worthiest men to supply their places. And making as though hee would bring them forth to be killed one after another; will yea have (quoth he) such a one killed first? naming him that hee knew they most hated: they all allowing it with great gladnesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him for his choyce. Then (sayd he) who will ye
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:896:113"/>
have to supply his place? Then stepped forth divers men of severall trades and occupations, every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with other, to have chosen one of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to supply his roome. And thus naming all the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, one after another to be killed, and asking them the like questions for supply of their roomes there was such an earnest contention among themselves, every one fearing lest one should bee preferred to a more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable place than the other, that they were all content rather to endure and submit themselves to the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the old Senatours, than any of them should have more honour than others. And thus by the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their Tribune, and the envy and emulation of the common people, the lives and honours of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, were preserved, whom they had determined through hatred and malice to have killed.

For which cause, his image was set up by Claudius Caesar, with this inscription, <hi>Simoni sancto Deo.</hi> Which at last wrought his own destruction. For as Saint Peter saw him lift himselfe up into the ayre, in a great assembly of people, making them beleeve hee would ascend up to heaven, to the great admiration of them all, hee desired God that hee would not suffer him any longer to seduce the world: whereupon he fell presently downe head-long, and brake his leg, whereof he dyed shortly after.

Constantinople: for when there was at a triumph, a great assembly of people beholding certaine justs, this Saracen went up to the top of a high turret, that stood in the Tilt-yard, and bragging that he would flye in the ayre, he had provided him a long white garment downe to the foot, full of playtes and gatherings, made for the purpose, to hover in the ayre; hee began to flitter with his hands, in steede of wings; and when hee thought he had soared enough, he committed himselfe to the winde and weather, and fell downe head-long to the ground, and bruised his bones to peeces, and, like a vaineglorious Coxcombe, there ended his life. Saint Iohn the Evangelist being banished into the Isle of Pathmos by the Emperor Domitian, because by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the name of Iesus Christ he drave away a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell out of the Temple of Diana, that seduced the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which had possessed an Idoll there two hundred fortie nine yeares, into Ephesus; in the which Island Saint Iohn found a notorious fellow called Cynops, that by the helpe of the Divell did wonderous things before the people; and bragged that hee would raise men, that were knowne to bee dead: who had gotten such a reputation among them, that he was a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the Gospell, which Saint Iohn preached. And as on a time hee had played many strange feats, in a great assembly of people standing upon the sea coast, Cynops seeing Saint Iohn comming towards them; Come on, good fellow (quoth hee, to Saint Iohn) thou shalt see more strange things, than hath beene yet shewed. Saint Iohn standing among them, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three evill spirits, which had taken upon them the forme and face of men, raised out of the sea by Cinops, which the people thought had beene men, commanded
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:896:114"/>
them in the name of Iesus Christ that was crucified, not to depart. Then Cynops, to shew more feats clapt his hands together, and leapt into the sea, as he had done di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times before, where he would tarry under the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long time. And as soone as he was under the water, the sea began to worke, in the place where he leapt in, of a great height, as though there had bin a tempest. After he had staied under the water longer than he used to do, the people cryed out; Thou Cynops art the onely man of the world, thinking he would shew himselfe to them againe as he did before. But Saint Iohn prayed to God that hee might be no more seene among men: which prayer tooke such effect, that Cynops could be no more seene. Which when the people perceived, they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">The Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.</note> their admiration to Saint Iohn; who then sayd to the three spirits; I command you in the name of Iesus Christ, that was crucified, that ye depart, and be seene no more in this Island. Which words were no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner spoken, but they forthwith vanished away. The fame of this art being blown abroad, was the cause that a great many bookes of Necromancie in divers places were burnt.</p>

And though he would cover some of his strange feates, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of nature, yet his familiaritie with the Divel, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things was apparent.

Maximilian being much troubled

in minde with this strange sight, winked upon the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, that hee should avoyd the spirit. Which being done, hee commanded him to shew him no more of those pastimes, protesting that hee was hardly able to forbeare speaking: which if hee had done, the spirit had killed them all. The Divell was so ready at the Abbots commandement, that as hee travelled on a time in the company of a man of account, who reported this story, they came into a house, where was neither good meate nor drinke, the Abbot knocked at the window, &amp; sayd, <hi>adfer,</hi> fetch.

This ambition and vaine-glory the Divell knoweth to be so offensive to God, and enemy to the felicity of men, that he leaveth nothing unpractised to stir up mens mindes to the desire thereof, himselfe being alwayes ready at hand, where he findeth a disposition meete for his purpose, to assist them to work strange feats, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit miracles, not to the destruction of them onely that are entred into his societie, but to use the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to seduce many others, and to divert them from the true service of God, from whom onely commeth mans felicity, to seeke helpe at his hands. And to this purpose there is a strange historie of a Spanish woman, of base parentage, called Magdalen, which happened in the yeare of grace, one thousand five hundred forty five, in the Citie of Cordube in Spaine. When this Magdalen was yet scarcely five yeares old, her friends made her a Nunne: and though it was too rathe for those young yeares, to know the wickednesse of the world, yet (such is the secret judgement of God) it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that the Divell in the likenesse of a man, blacke as an Ethiop, appeared to this mayd, who at the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing something affraid, yet at last by flattering words and faire promises of such things, as that old Serpent knew, were meete to allure her tender yeares, he found means, to enter into familiar communication with her, injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her straightly, not to speake of this new acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

The divell having a meaning by her to deceive all Spaine, seemed very provident by making choice of this towardly yong thing, whom he thought so much the more meete for his purpose, as she excelled the rest
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:896:117"/>
in sharpenesse of wit, and ripenesse of judgement, that by framing in her a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

When she was come to twelve yeares old, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell became a suter to her for marriage, promising her that for the space of thirty yeares, or I know not how many more, he would advance her to such estimation of holinesse throughout all Spaine, that shee should match or excell in glory &amp; reputation all that at any time have bin most famous in that kind of matter. The desire of glory, pierced so deepely into her tender affection, that she seemed to consent. And as they used to passe the time pleasantly together in secret, the Divel would send his servant in her very likenesse, to supply her roome in the Church, and to do all things that was for her to do. The Divell when shee was not imployed in attending upon divine service, was accustomed to bring her news of all things that were done in the whole world. Which when she declared to them that favoured her, it greatly increased the opinion of her holinesse: by meanes whereof, shee was accounted a Prophetesse. And rather than her yeares required, shee was by a generall consent of the whole company of Nunnes, chosen Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse. It was commonly known that at such times as the Nunnes did usually receive the Sacrament, the Priest should ever lacke one of the consecrated cakes, which was secretly brought by her angell to Magdalen, as she sate in the quire among the rest of the Nunnes, which shee would shew as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:896:117"/>
see and be seene. And likewise at such solemne festivall dayes, as the Nunnes used to leade the Abbesse, shee would by a strange miracle, in the sight of all men, somtime cause her selfe to be lifted up from the ground into the ayre, three cubits or more: sometime she would be seene, to beare a naked young child, representing Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus newly borne, with such other vaine devices, to make the festivall day the more holy. By these frvolous illusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and juggling casts of the Divell, shee grew in such reputation, that shee received letters from the Pope, the Emperour, and the nobility of Spaine, wherein they commended themselves and their important affaires to her most holy prayers. They would also use her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in matters of very great weight, as though she had beene a Prophetesse that could foresee things to come, as it manifestly appeared afterward, when her wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was discovered by the letters of the greatest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Christendome, that were found about her, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to that effect. Divers noble women also, would not <note place="margin">Strange su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</note> have their children newly born, wrapped in their swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bands, untill they had beene handled and consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this womans hands. In all this while among so many notable and learned men, there was not one, that could find these fraudulent toyes of the divell. Such was the darkenesse and blindnesse of that time. At last God of his unspeakable goodnes, would suffer this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous hypocrisie no longer to be hidden. For after she had thus abused the world, neere about thirty yeers, she began to fall into repentance, and discovered her detestable practices, to the visitours, and contrary to all expectation, confessed her wicked fact. This news see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wonderfull strange to all men: and that they might procced orderly with her, she was committed to prison
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:896:118"/>
and examined, where shee confessed all that had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But this Ethiopia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Divell would not so leave her so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie: for as she was kept close in prison, whilest her cause was examining, when the Nuns after midnight u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their ordinarie service in the quire, the Divel would transforme himselfe into her likenesse, and sit in her place, and kneele upon his knees as though he prayed, they all thinking it had beene Magdalen, and that shee had that liberty given for her repentance. But the next day when they understood that shee was kept in prison, and the night following seeing her againe in the quire, they told the visitors; who examining the matter, found that shee went not forth of the prison. And when the cause was known to the Pope, through her repentance, he pardoned her, and gave her absolution.</p>
               <p>But Sathan never found so fit an instrument to serve his purpose with such effect, as was that false Prophet Mahomet, who through ambition, and an unsatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of glory, wherein his life shewed him to put his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, not content to become of a base fellow, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of divers goodly kingdomes, but must also take upon him to be a holy Prophet, sent from God, to give laws to his people, whereby he hath not onely damned his owne soule, but also sendeth dayly infinite numbers of soules to the bottomlesse pit of hell: to whom the Poets saying may be aptly applyed.

seeke after, it will not be impertinent to the matter, to make a briefe narration of the course of Mahomets life, whereby we shall see, how by the helpe of the Divell, &amp; his owne subtil wit, by Gods sufferance for our sins hee was adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a poore wretch to a mighty Monarch, and reputed Prophet, and law-maker. This Mahomets <note place="margin">Cnustin His parents. His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> father was an Arabian called Abdalla, &amp; his mother an Ismaelite, called Enyma; he was borne in a little village, not far from Mecha, called Itrarip, about sixe hundred yeares after Christs incarnation. The Turks say that the same day he was borne, there fell downe to the ground of their own accord, a thousand Churches &amp; one; which was a signe, that in his time there should bee a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Christianity. Being in his youth brought up by <note place="margin">His bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up.</note> his parents in two religions, every of them desirous to draw him to his opinion, when he came to be a man, he was of no religion. He was sent no doubt by the Divel, to the shame of mankind, who cannot endure the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Christs Gospell; but finding so apt an instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to worke the dishonor of God, and the destruction of men, and knowing the disposition of the world, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace new things, he practised by his meanes to plant a new religion, having fit opportunity therto, by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering minds of the Arabians, and Affricans, who were at that time he was borne, in doubt, whether they might follow the religion of the Christians, or of the Iewes, or Arrians. There was great f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>iendship about this time betweene Mahomets father and a Iew, that was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomer, &amp; well learned in the old law, &amp; in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion. It chanced that Mahomet was borne when his father was gone to Ierusalem, and at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne this Iew having calculated his sonnes nativitie, told him, that he should be mighty in dominion &amp; law.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:896:119"/>
Not long after the birth of this apostle of Sathan, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla the father died. When Mahomet was 4 yeres old, this Iew devised a notorious and most shamefull lye. He said that he saw two Angels take Mahomets hart out of his bodie, &amp; divided it in the middest, and tooke out of it a drop of bloud, and afterward washed it cleane with faire water, &amp; put it in a paire of ballance, &amp; weighed it with ten other hearts, because his heart weighed them downe all. Then one of the Angels said to the other, if his heart were set against all the hearts in Arabia, it would over weigh them all. This (said the Iew) the Angell Gabriell shewed him. When Mahomet was viij<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeares old, his mother died, and committed him to his uncle by the fathers side, who delivered him to the Iew to be brought up in learning. The Iew instructed him in naturall Philosophy, but especially in the Iewish and Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion, wherin he proved so good a scholler, that it holpe to work the destruction of his own soule, &amp; many others. Some write, that when Mahomet was thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <note place="margin">Mahomet an horse driver.</note> yeare old, as he wandred abroad, he met with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that were going into Egypt, &amp; desirous to be of their company, they tooke him with them, to helpe to keepe their camels &amp; horses; and wheresoever he went there was many times seene a blacke fellow standing by him. And when they came to a village in Egypt, where at that time were divers Christians, the Parson of the towne invited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his house: they followed the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, &amp; left Mahomet to keep their camels. The Parson enquiring whether all their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany were come into his house, they are all here (said they) saving a boy that stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth without with our camels. As the Parson went forth he saw a black fellow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by the boy, which put him in mind of a prophecie that he had read, of one that should
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:896:119"/>
descend of pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, of two sundry natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, who shold esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish a religion, against the christian faith, by whom for a signe should many times stand a black fellow. The parso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> desired the mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to cal in the boy, &amp; understanding <note place="margin">A prophecy of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</note> his name to be Mahomet, he reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred him so to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the prophecie, &amp; that he should be a mighty man, &amp; a great trouble to Christendome, &amp; that his religion should not continue above 1000. yeers, &amp; then it should vanish away. When the Parson had considered of his name, &amp; of the black fellow sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding by him, he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that it was he the prophecie spake of, and set him at his table above the merchants, and did him great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. After they had eaten, the Priest asked the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, whether they knew the boy: who told him the manner how they came by him. The parson enformed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the prophecy he ha <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> read, who affirmed that they had seene such a blacke fellow stand by him. Then sayd the Parson to the boy: Thou shalt be a great learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and shalt establish a new religion among the Heathens, and with they power thou shalt bee great annoyance to the Christians, and thy successors shall be mighty men. Now I desire thee that thou wilt suffer my country men the Armenians to live in peace. Mahomet promised that he would so doe, and went forwards with the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to Babylon. When hee was foure and twenty yeares old, he went into Egypt about his trade of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise: where he stayed a long time, and had familiar acquaintance and friendship with Christians and Iews, with whom he was much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>oversant, but especially with a monke of Antioch called Iohn, that was an obstinate hereticke, enticed thereto by the Divel, through a desire of vaineglory. Of this Monke he learned to falsifie the Scriptures, both the old &amp; new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he might
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:896:120"/>
be the better armed against the Iewes &amp; Christians. It is reported that hee was also scholler to a Monke called Sergius, an Arrian heretick, &amp; expulsed from Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople by his brethren, &amp; fled into Arabia, where he fell acquainted with Mahomet, and holpe him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In his youth, he used the trade of Merchandise, &amp; went often with his camels into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt and Palestina. And as he came on a time into the land of Canaa, the Princesse of that Countrey, called Tagida, marvelling at his strange kinds of wares &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, fell into great liking of him, which when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet perceived, he omitted not that opportunity, but entring into familiar communication with her, he utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all his skill and eloquence to seduce her. When hee perceived her to wonder at his skill in both laws, and to bee as it were rapt with his stately stile, and glorious words; My deare Lady (quoth he) I will hide nothing from you, but tell you the truth: I am the Messias sent <note place="margin">Fearefull blasphemy.</note> from God, which the Iewes look for to this day; which he laboured to prove by miracles wrought by the help of the Divell, himselfe being a Necromancer, whereby he not only deceived this Lady, but also divers Iewes &amp; Saracens, who thought him to be the very Messias they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:896:120"/>
looked for. By meane whereof, in short time he had a great many followers. This Lady seeing the Iewes and Saracens, thus reverence &amp; depend upon Mahomet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that there lay hidde in him some divine majesty, <note place="margin">His marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> and being a widdow, married him. Thus was Mahomet suddenly advanced to great riches &amp; dominion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his desire, he went afterward into Spaine, where he preached at Corduba, such doctrine, that the Bishop sent to apprehend him; but he being warned by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When he understood that hee was esteemed for a high Prophet, of all the countries round about him, greater matters began to enter into his conceipt, devising how hee might become a great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.

And when the Saracens &amp; the rest of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, saw that he had overcome the Emperors power &amp; set them at liberty from the Romans, they resorted to him out of all parts to Damasco where by a generall consent they chose him to be their king, &amp; let the crown on his head.

And as one of his wives found him in a chamber se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly with one of his minions; Are these (quoth she) the manners of a prophet? where with Mahomet was so ashamed, that he sware solemnly never to doe the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And as on a time he fell downe with the falling sickenesse before the queene his wife (to which through Gods plague hee was much subject) and fomed at the mouth, after the manner of that disease, perceiving her to take it grievously, that shee had matched her selfe to such an unwholsome creature, he told her that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell Gabriel was sent to him from God, to enforme him of his mind, the bright shining of whose counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he could in no wise endure; which was the cause of his falling to the ground. And to confirme her the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this opinion, he wrought some miracle, by the Divels helpe, which gave the more credit to his words. His wicked sect began about the latter end of the reigne of Heraclius the Emperour, from whose obedience, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king opportunitie by a sedition amongst his souldiers, by whom Mahomet was made their chiefe captaine, had disswaded his subjects, making them beleeve that Gods will was that all men shold be at liberty, &amp; subject to no man. By meane whereof the Saracens &amp; Arabians depended wholly upon him, as hath bin sayd, and made him their king. When he had determined to publish his

And when he saw such a band of men, he demanded the cause of their comming, and of their departure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their king. They answered him, that they were poore souldiers, that had left the king of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier, because he had used them uncourteously, and if it would please him to entertaine them, they would bee faithfull to him even to death. The king entertaineth them, &amp; made them not long after his principall guard, and favoured them more than his owne people. Which procured them much envy, and especially of the great estates of his Councell, who advised him to beware of these Turkes, who they suspected came to him for no good purpose: alledging divers reasons, that moved them so to thinke, and that the Turke made none ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his life, if he might doe his master any accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table service. The Hermite being as subtile as they, said little, but determined to find some occasion to put them all to the sword. It chanced, that news was brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time to the king, of a rebellion in some of his countries, wherupon he tooke occasion to raise a power
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:896:125"/>
to represse them, but indeed to put the Turkes to the sword, of whom he grew very suspicious. The Turkes perceiving the preparation for this great journey, and observing that the king had often conference with his Councell, whom they knew to bee their capitall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, began to doubt, that this preparation was made for them. To retyre they had no meanes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse they should make themselves odious to all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and by that meanes, they should put the king out of doubt of that which he did now but suspect. Whilest they were debating these things, they had certain intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the kings intent, and that the time of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was at hand. The Turkes seeing no way to escape, resolved upon a most desperate enterprise, &amp; watching for opportunity, as the king sate in Councell, with the Princes and captaines of his army in his pavillion, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating how to put in execution his purpose against these Turkes, at what time it chanced the principall men of his guard to be gone for forage, and onely two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred renegates left to attend, the Turkes entred into the pavillion, where they slue the King and his Councell; with the captaines, and sacked his tents of such treasure as there was; the renegates in place of defending the king, joyned with them in the spoyle.

He told them, that hee was weary of the wars, and travels of a kingdome, &amp; was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to yield over all government, and give himselfe to ease and rest. And forasmuch as God had given him no heire of his body to inherite his crowne, and small hope thereof left, he desired them with a fatherly care, that they would think upon some man that were meet to succeed him, and take upon him the governement of the Realme; such an one as would pursue the King of Navarre and the heretickes to death. That at length the flourishing kingdom of France, may enjoy his religion and long looked for peace. These words he spake with such gravity, and shew of plaine meaning, that no man mistrusted any fraud or dissimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This speech of the kings was nothing unpleasant to some of his new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers; who answered him that the King was yong and lusty enough, &amp; wel able to govern the Realm himself, for the continuance wherofthey praicd to God nights and day: that he needed no other mans counsel or help.

The king after he had reckoned many Princes worthy <note place="margin">The project will prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuied.</note> to reign, he concluded, that he knew none among them more meet for this purpose, than the Duke of Guise, whose worthiness and praises, and service done by him and his father to the Commonwealth, when he had set forth, with a great many goodly words, his councell willingly allowed his choyce; and sent presently to the Duke of Guise, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The first cause hee sayd) was, that he beleeved it was done to the glory of God; because the Prince was a professed enemie to the Romish Catholike faith. The second was, that to take away the life from a most cruell enemy of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries, he knew would be beneficiall &amp; profitable to his countrey, to which he owed his life: which all good men, and lovers of peace, would commend and allow.

King of Spaine his master: of whom neverthelesse he denied to be hired, or allured with any promises or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to commit the murder. He protested that hee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing repented him of the fact, but greatly rejoyced that his enterprise had taken so good effect, &amp; had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse according to his desire.

The Gentlemen without, hearing the noyse within, ran into the chamber, and beholding what was done, after the kings Councell had examined the Frier, they fell upon him and slue him: and cast the other Frier that stood without, head-long into the river, and drowned him.

Christ utterly confounded this vanity, when he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himselfe of the greatest nobility that ever was in this world, &amp; besides that, being the sonne of God, yet called he commonly himselfe the son of man, that is to say, of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (for otherwise hee was no son of man.) He sought not for honourable titles of antiquitie (as we use to do) to furnish his stile, but called himselfe a shepheard, a base name, and of contempt in the world. And when he was to make a king first in Israel, he sought not out the ancientest bloud, but took <hi>Saul,</hi> of the basest tribe in all Israel; &amp; after him, <hi>David</hi> the poorest shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of all his brethren. And when hee came into the world, he sought not out the noblest men to make his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, but took the poorest &amp; simplest; therby (as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to some) to confound the foolish vanity of this world, that giveth such a preeminence to flesh &amp; bloud, that must be eaten with worms &amp; fall to dust. <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> to one that desired him to make him a noble man, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, I can make you rich, but vertue only giveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. But if nobility or gentility of bloud bee joined with vertue &amp; humility of mind, it is a thing worthy to be had in estimation, &amp; giveth a comely grace &amp; reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; may serve to put men in remembrance to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, after the example of their first parents, by whose vertue they are exalted to that title &amp; dignity. One saith;

Nobilitie is of another mans good, but vertue depends of his own good. And the man of vertue never wanteth nobility, neither can his honour be taken from him, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honour is joined to vertue, as the briar is to the rose.

And though all other things hang upon fortune (as wee use to speake) yet true nobilitie dependeth upon vertue. Nobilitie of parentage (saith <hi>Herod an</hi>) is nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept nobilitie of manners and courtesie bee joyned with it. When <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> heard that the Athenians had defaced and cast down his images, which they had set up; But (quoth hee) they have not overthrowne my vertue, for which they set them up before. So that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept nobilitie of bloud be joyned with nobilitie of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it is but vanitie, and of none account. For vertue is a noblenesse of the minde, and not borrowed of paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and therefore more excellent than nobilitie of bloud: as the Poet rightly saith;
<q>

               <p>And what vanitie is it to glorie in the forme or beauty of the flesh, that as a flowre in May sheweth it selfe to day, and to morrow withereth away, and returneth to the earth againe, from whence it came?

We rob almost all the creatures in the world to deck our bodies withall.

And then we must dig into the ground for gold and silver, as the Poet sayth;

And <hi>Aristotle</hi> to the <note place="margin">Arist.</note> same question, said; That there was as great difference between the learned and the unlearned, as was between the living and the dead. And as the sight receiveth light from the ayre that is round about it, so doth the minde from learning. And <hi>Ennius</hi> likeneth a wise man without <note place="margin">Arist.</note> learning to an uncleane glasse, that is fit for nothing: &amp; yet not he that knoweth many things, but he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth things fruitfull is wise. When <hi>Alphonsus</hi> king of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon heard, that a King of Castile should say, that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was not meete for noblemen and gentlemen, hee exclamed and said: These are the words of an oxe, and not of a man. That man (saith <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>) that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth upon him to be a man, and hath no learning, what difference is there betweene him and a beast? When the <note place="margin">Aeseh.</note> people of Mitylene were become masters of the sea, they inflicted this punishment upon their colleagues that were revolted from them: That they should not teach their children to reade, nor the liberall sciences: estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that to be of all kind of punishment, the most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, to passe their life in want of knowledge, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall <note place="margin">Fer.</note> sciences. There is nothing more unjust, than a man unlearned, because hee thinketh nothing to bee right, but what he doth himself. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> engraved in a stone with his owne hand, these words, &amp; set it before his Acad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon deprived a Magistrate from his office, which hee had given him, whom hee loved well, only because he heard hee was more occupied in combing his head and trimming his person, than in studying his bookes. <hi>Quintus Hortensius</hi> a Roman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is infamed by Historians, because he looked into a
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:896:149"/>
glasse when he made him ready, and was too curious in trimming up himselfe. But to leave Magistrates, and speak of inferiour callings; what would they have said, &amp; what will hereafter be said to the infamy of this age, if vertue ever come againe to be in estimation, that men should be so effeminate and nice, to bestow a good part of the day in trimming up themselves by a glasse like women, as though they would transforme themselves out of one sexe into another, and had rather resemble women than men? If <hi>Aristotle</hi> spake thus of women, then what would he have spoken now, not only of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but of men also? Neither the gorgeousnesse of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, nor the abundance of riches, maketh so much to the praise of women, as doth modesty with honest and sober behaviour. But this metamorphosis being now more common and usuall than in those daies, is not so much perceived, nor taken for so great a fault, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure may be justifiable by authoritie and prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> and <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> two of the greatest Monarks of the world.

It is strange to see what joy and pleasure men take in banquetting, and quaffing, and lasclvious talke, as though they would make <hi>podi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemexore,</hi> and what contention there is for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in such an unseemely, and unchristianlike pastime, which is so common, that there need no rehearsall of examples.

               <p>The felicity therefore we seeke for, must bee sought in some other thing than in pleasures, in riches, or in honour and glory. For in them (as appeareth by that hath been said) felicity is not to be found. But it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth many times to them that seeke felicity in any of those things, as it did to the boyes and the asse, in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A man had laden an asse with a sacke full of birch, and drave him homeward, staying behind about some other businesse. As the asse came by a schoole-house, which was in his way, he cryed apples, apples, who will buy any apples? The boyes that were within at schoole, hearing of merchandise so fit for their purpose, ranne forth to the asse, &amp; took down the sack, thinking to have found it full of apples. But when they perceived there was nothing but birch, they fell all upon the asse, that had deceived them, and beat him cruelly with his owne rods. The like happeneth to them whom the faire shewes and flattering promises of pleasures, riches, or honour and glory allureth to the inordinate desire of them. But when they make tryall, and looke into them with the eyes of the mind, clensed from the corruption of impure affections, they see how much they are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of that they looke for. And where they sought feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, they find matter of infelicity. And they that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse pleasures, riches, or honour, and glory, and make shew to be laden with felicitie or happinesse, are many times punished with the burden they bear, and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaten with their own roddes, that deceive not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly themselves, but others also by their example, with

A goodly happines no doubt, when for one reputed good thing, thou shalt have an infinite number of evils; for the shadow of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, a sea of troubles &amp; miseries. And what be the fruits of these torments of ambition?

But admit power &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to be good: one is adored, ten thousand make courtesie: one triumphs, thousands follow the chariot: one rules, millions obey &amp; serve: So that one man shalbe the end of infinite numbers, the felicity of a few, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of al.

It is not without cause said, that the displeasure of the Prince, is the death of the subject. And Princes themselves feele many times more corzies and unquietnesse of minde, by some of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence taken within their own wals, than any triumph or publike pastime can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Ambition therefore is so farre from the right way to that good we seek, that the very same thing hath cast us all downe head long from the greatest good, into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme evill and misery: Insomuch that if wee desire to find that good we must be driven to seek it in our selves; seeing we cannot find it with others, nor in these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters. In vaine therefore doe wee seeke felicitie in worldly vanities, which is to bee found in the service of God: which was well observed by the Poet:

                  </hi> should consist, that is in vertue, or in the action of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. <note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</note> The Philosophers entring into consideration of naturall things, found that the proper action of every thing, was the end for which it was created: as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per action and end of the Sun is to illuminate the earth. And in naturall things there are three kindes of life: vegetative or increasing, which is in plants; sensitive, which is in beasts; rationall or reasonable, which is in men. So that the life of plants, is to grow and increase; of beasts, to follow the motion of their senses; of men, to live according to reason, after the Philosophers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Which reason sheweth a man how to live wel: but what it is to live well, the Philosophers cannot agree. After <hi>Aristotle</hi> and others, it is to live vertuously. But <note place="margin">Aristotle.</note> because a man is a sociable creature, and not borne to himselfe, but to be helping to others, it is not sufficient for a man to have vertue in him, but hee must also exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and be a doer of vertue. And because all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and labours bee to some end, which end is taken of us to bee good: (for every man desireth that which hee thinketh to be good for himselfe) the last of all ends, to which the rest are applyed, &amp; for which all our labours are, and ought to bee bestowed, is the most perfect and best of all things that nature desireth: and therefore the thing wherein the felicitie of man consisteth. For that is desired for no other thing, but for it selfe. Which after <hi>Aristotle</hi> is the action of vertue: for that is his proper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and peculiar to himselfe alone. And if there bee any vertue more perfect and excellent than the rest, that is it by which all the course of our life ought to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:896:153"/>
as to the last end, and greatest good, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Felicitie. Which Felicitie <hi>Aristotle</hi> defineth to bee the action of man according to the most perfect vertue in a perfect life. By which last words he excludeth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that cannot judge of actions: and also those that doe well but once or twice; according to the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, One swallow maketh no summer. For perfect vertue or felicitie requireth time and long exercise. If therefore the action of vertue bringeth forth felicitie it shall be necessarie for him that would bee happy, first to know, and then to exercise vertue; that teacheth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of manners, which is the summe of Morall Philosophie; that hath for his subject a private man, a familie, and a common wealth. For hee that possesseth vertue, giveth lawes to himselfe, and endeavoureth to make himselfe a perfect man, by exercise of good and vertuous acts. And when hee hath gotten the habite of v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Philosophers bayteth him, saying; that seeing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is perfect, it is sufficient of it selfe to bring forth felicitie But if fortune be requisite, then nature cannot make felicitie; for fortune is not in our power.

But to proceede awhile in prosecuting their opinions; these three kinds of good <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">

                  </gap>ure, and comelinesse of the body: and lastly, riches, nobilitie, friends, and such like, which are the goods or gifts of fortune. These things being joyned together, bringeth to men such a sufficiency of al things requisite to happinesse, that whosoever possesseth them is in the perfect state of felicity, after <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion, felicitie being no other thing, but an end of mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that end which of all other is most perfect and excellent, and to, and for which, all other ends and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and labours of men are applyed and undertaken.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that felicitie is the action of vertue, which is the last and most perfect of all the workes and labours of men: it must follow, that it is a civill facultie or science, that teacheth a man to governe himselfe and others. And what science or facultie soever, is as it were the master and commander of all other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And that the government in a Common wealth is the worthiest and most principall of all other scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is apparent, because that procureth the universall and common benefite of many, and seeketh no other thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By this which hath been said, it is manifest, that after <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the felicitie of man consisteth in the action of vertue, &amp; that in the most perfect vertue (which is prudence) that teacheth a man how to live well, rightly to governe himselfe &amp; others. And though he joyneth three kinds of good things, that is, the goods of the minde, of the body, of fortune, necessarie to him that seeketh after felicity: yet he esteemeth those that be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But the principall good things without the which no man can have felicitie, are those of the minde, which after the sterne Stoickes are sufficient alone to bring forth felicity. For when <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that by great sinister fortune a man may fall from beatitude to infelicitie: they course him with
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:896:155"/>
bitter words, &amp; labour to prove that felicitie dependeth upon vertue; and that fortune hath no power upon a wise man; &amp; that if he suffer never so grievous torments, if hee were thrust into <hi>Phala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The same in outward appearance differeth litle from other common wagons; but there was in it a thing notable, which was a rope foulded and knit in many knots, one so wreathed within another, that no man could perceive where the knots began, or where they ended. Hereupon the countrey-men had a prophecie, that hee which could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For in all their arguments and discourses, there is no mention made of the will of God, nothing spoken of the feare of God, nor of the trust and confidence we ought to have in him.

For Christ sayth; This is everlasting life, to know God, and Iesus Christ, whom he hath sent, that is, to beleeve, that for Christs sake the father forgiveth us, and loveth us, that he preserveth and justifieth us.

which consisteth in morall vertues, and civill actions of this life onely; which small part of felicity men never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse by those meanes are not able to attaine to. For how can the Stoickes wise man account himself in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py estate, though he be indued with a consummation of morall vertues, if he live in torment and paine? <hi>Seneca</hi> sayth; <hi>Non sentire malasua, non est hominis: non ferre, non est viri.</hi> And in another place; silence can not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand pain &amp; sorrow. They are goodly perswasions to excite men to vertue, and to have the unfortunate acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the world in contempt. But men are not made of iron or steele, but of flesh and bloud; which must feele of necessity the paines of torments, except they be assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the spirit of God, as was <hi>Sydrach, Mysach,</hi> and <hi>Abed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And they that live in paine, cannot be sayd to be in felicitie; for the happy man desireth not to change his estate with any man: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise hee is not to bee accounted happy, which is a thing in the highest degree of perfection. But hee that suffereth pain and griefe, would willingly exchange for another mans health and ease. For if there be no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure nor delight in life, but continuall paine and griefe, death were to be preferred before it, and to be desired more than life; as the Poet sayth;

               <p>There happened at Rome in the middest of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, by meanes of an earthquake and other causes, the earth to open, and a very deepe hole to bee made which would not bee filled with all the earth that could bee throwne into it: the Romanes caused their Priests to use their accustomed ceremonies to their Gods, to understand their pleasure about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: when they had finished their sacrifices, answer was made them, that if they would have their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth perpetuall, they must sacrifice into this hole something, wherein the Romanes power did most consist.

               <p>THe respect the Heathens had to the observation, not of one or two, but of all morall vertues, may make Christians blush to thinke what observers they would have beene of Christian vertues, if they had knowne God as we doe. <hi>Zeleucus</hi> made a law among the Locri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <note place="margin">The rare justice of Zeleucus.</note> that whosoever committed adultery should lose both his eyes: it chanced that his sonne was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for that crime, and determining that the penalty of the law should with severity be inst upon him; yet being intreated by the earnest petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the whole city, who in as much as in them was, for the honor and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the father, forgave the necessity of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the yong man, first caused one of his own eyes, and after one of his sonues eyes to be plucked out, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sight to them both.

Among the rare examples of the Heathens, we will recite a strange kind of severitie used by Christians, out of the Histories of the Switzers. The Switzers have a free common-wealth, wherof they are very jealous: There was a yong man among them, that went about to usurpe the government and alter the state; whom when they had condemned to death, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given, that the execution should be done by his father, as the cause of his evill education, that hee might receive his death by the author of his life, and that the father in some sort might be punished for his <note place="margin">Vnnaturall justice.</note> negligence used in the education of his child.</p>
               <p>And these were notable examples of Iustice and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie used by the Emperours <hi>Trajan, Antoninus Pius,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Worthy Emperours.</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> and others, worthie of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; because the felicitie of Princes is said to bee in well governing their people. For that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth (saith one) cannot decay, where the poore have justice, and the wicked rich men punishment: and especially, if there bee good doctrine for the young, and little covetousnesse in the olde. In the daies of <hi>Trajan,</hi> none that had charge of justice might augment his goods: but in that estate of riches or poverty wherein hee beganne to governe, in the same hee was to containe himselfe, and to looke for reward at the Princes hand, according to his merit. <hi>Hoc deterius habet</hi>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:896:162"/>
long suites brought to his people, ordained that all suites of Italy should continue but one yeare, and the suites of other countryes but halfe a yeare. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Antoninus</hi> never sent any pretor to governe any Province, that was wise and valiant onely, but hee also must be without any infection of pride and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: For he thought that no man could well governe a common wealth, that is subject to pride or covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Vnto Pretors, Censors, and Questors, before <note place="margin">Imitable governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</note> he gave them any country to governe, hee caused them first to give up an Inventory of their owne proper goods, to the end that when their charge was finished, the increase of their wealth should be considered: And joyntly therewith he did both say and warne them, that he sent them to minister justice, and not by fraud to robbe his people. The Emperours <hi>Valentiman</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> tooke this order with Iudges &amp; governours of Provinces, that they should sweare at the entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their charge, that they had not given nor promised any thing, and that they would not give, nor cause to be given any thing; and also that they would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their fee. And if it were proved that they had taken any thing (being lawfull for every man to accuse them) they should pay foure times so much, besides the infamie and perjurie; and the like penaltie was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him that gave the present. The Emperour <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Coignet.</note> would say, that all Iudges ought to contemne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and to shew their hands cleane to God, to the Emperour, or King, and to the law: which is also to be understood of all Magistrates and governours.

Yet they may neverthelesse bestow honour and riches upon their friends and favorites, but so farre forth as the right of the common-wealth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine whole, and take no harme thereby. S. <hi>Lewes</hi> the French King by his testament ordained that his son should see good lawes observed, and to make choice of wise Counsellers and of ripe yeares, and that no money should be taken to make Officers; for men should not obtaine offices by money, by ambition, nor by favour; that he do justice indifferently to all, by which kings do reigne; and not beleeve too soone. That his sevrants be wise, peaceable, not covetous, backbiters nor quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> saith, a Prince ought to bestow more care &amp; cost in getting a wise Counsellor, than in conquests. <hi>Alexander Severus, Adria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> &amp; others, Emperors of Rome, would cal to their councell, not their favorites, but men learned, grave, &amp; experienced, &amp; of a good conscience. Princes should not esteeme men by their riches &amp; state, but by their vertue and conversation. One asked <hi>Trajan</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:896:164"/>
the Emperour how hee made so good a choice of counsellers &amp; friends: he answered, that his good hap came hereof, that he chose them neither covetous men nor lyers: for they in whom covetousnes or lying hath any place cannot love perfectly. And the French king <hi>Charles</hi> 8, would often say to his friends or favorits, that he made choice of them, for the opinion hee had that they were of the honester sort, and such as in whom he might put his trust, fearing but one fault in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they will suffer themselves to be overcome with cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, wherunto they may be easily allured &amp; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by means of the credit they have with him, but if he should understand, that for gaine they should command any unjust thing, or not honest, they should lose his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor for ever. They that be in favor (saith one) with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Greg. Thol. Favourites to Priaces.</note> abuse the Prince when they name or prefer to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and dignities, and government, such as be of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and at their command: not such as be worthy, but such as will be instruments to serve their turne, &amp; such as they may freely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand as their creatures &amp; depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, &amp; dare not gainesay them; wherof ensueth often many inconveniences. And therefore Princes ought to be very circumspect, and so to handle the matter, that they who be chosen to offices of government &amp; digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, depend immediatly upon them, &amp; not upon others, that they may have free men to their officers and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, that are bound &amp; beholding to none but to them. A Prince (sayth one) should bee sure to make choice of very good counsellers, of approved life &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners, such as God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to make choice of: and they <note place="margin">Greg. Thol.</note> shold be (saith he) faithful, wise, true speakers, not flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, godly, secret: such as know the minds of the subjects, &amp; state of the country: of good yeres, that have
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:896:165"/>
tasted of both fortunes, and are more apt to execute than to innovate matters: chosen not by sute, nor by private, but by publike commendation: and such as bee not headstrong and obstinate in defence of their opinion, free from passions and affections, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of gaine. Good Counsellors make a good and happie principalitie: and wisedome and counsell is better than force, as it was sayd in times past of the Romanes: <hi>Romanus sedendo vincit.</hi> By the law in the twelve Tables, a Senatour or Counsellour must be free from vice, and bee a spectacle to others: and that no man might come into that order that was given to any vice. And this is commendable in a wise Prince, to heare the opinion of many, and keepe secret to himselfe which of them he meaneth to follow, untill <note place="margin">Note.</note> hee command to put it in execution. <hi>Vegetius</hi> thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth a Prince: What yee have to doe, conferre <note place="margin">Excellent counsell from Vego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias.</note> with many; what ye will doe, with very few, or rather with your selfe onely: for there be no better counsels, than those which the enemie knoweth not before they be put in execution. <hi>Epaminondis</hi> the Philosopher gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this counsell to Princes: In the courts of Princes there ought no greedy or covetous men to bee familiar with him, nor of his councell: for the Princes give great occasion to be hated of the people, when their servants have alwayes their hands open to receive bribes. In the Courts of Princes there ought no fleshly men to bee their favourites: for the vice of the flesh hath in it so little profit, that he which is wholly overcome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ought alwayes to be of the Prince suspected. In the palace of a king, there ought not to bee drunkards nor gluttons: for they that be overcome with the excesse of eating and drinking, are unfit to give their Prince good
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:896:165"/>
counsell. In the palace of Princes there ought to be no blasphemers: for he that will not feare to blaspheme his Creator openly, will not feare to speake evill of his Prince secretly. <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> in the beginning of his reigng, discharged all them that were known to bee vicious persons from their offices, and forced them to make restitution of all that they had bribed or purloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; from thenceforth to live of their own proper la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. <hi>Pindarus</hi> greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth the citie of Corinth, <note place="margin">Honesties three daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> because honestie reigned there, which had three daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Good laws, Iustice and Peace, that brought them all good things. <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, after he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome <hi>Licinius,</hi> caused this proclamation to be made: If there be any, of what place, estate, or dignity soever, that assureth himself he can truly &amp; manifestly prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing against any of my Iudges, Earles, Frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latines, that he hath not seemed to deale uprightly and justly, let him come safely, and informe me: I wil heare, I wil know, &amp; if it be proved, I wil revenge my selfe. By which it appeareth, that as a good pastor of his people, appointed by God, he accounted the injuries done to his people, to be done to himselfe. For a Prince, sayth one, should never deny Iustice to the poore man because <note place="margin">Duties in a prince.</note> he is poore, nor pardon the rich man, because he is rich: he should never give reward for affection onely, nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish onely through passion. He should never leave evil unpunished, nor good unrewarded: he shold never deny justice to him that demandeth it, nor mercie to him that deserveth it: hee should never command punishment being angry, nor promise reward being merry: he should alwayes labour to be loved of the good, and feared of the wicked: and lastly, hee should favour the poore, that can do little, that he may be favoured of God, that
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:896:166"/>
can doe all. The chiefe strength of a kingdome is to <note place="margin">David.</note> love Iustice. <hi>Cicero</hi> would have the contempt of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall goods to be no lesse in Magistrates than in true phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers. <hi>Aristotle</hi> would say, that there was not <note place="margin">Precepts from Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers.</note> a rule to bee given of greater importance in every common-wealth, than to provide by lawes that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates should not be covetous, nor sharpe set upon their profit. <hi>Plutarch</hi> sayth, He that enricheth himselfe by managing the affaires of the estate, and taketh presents, committeth sacriledge, is an unfaithfull Counsellour, a forsworne Iudge, a corrupt Magistrate, and defiled with all manner of wickednesse that a man may commit. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siodras</hi> sayth, that justice is a virgin undefiled, alwayes lodged with honour, reverence, temperance, and the <note place="margin">Polybius. Against bribes.</note> common profit, hating all presents. There are many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient orders in divers common-wealths, that forbid all manner of presents to be taken by Magistrates and Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> sayth, that those common-wealths are sicke, where the magistrates bee occupyed in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving presents. <hi>Cato</hi> would say, that a man should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of a Iudge or magistrate neither a just nor an unjust thing: he would also say, that Iudges, Captaines, and Governor should not inrich themselves in their charge, but with honour and good reputation. Unsatiable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse in magistrates and officers (saith one) infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the common-wealth with all manner of vices. And therefore many Princes in time past would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from their magistrates and officers, the riches and lands which they had excessively gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together. <hi>Cicero</hi> would have that to take place in all Magistrates, that they might carry themselves the more circumspectly, which <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great would vaunt of himselfe, that he thought all things that he did, to bee done in the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:896:166"/>
Theatre of the world. The Emperour <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Veturius Turinus.</note> had a servant in his Court called <hi>Veturius Turi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> a man of bad conditions, whom he seemed to love and favour. This man had accesse to the Emperour at his pleasure: no doore was shut against him; he made all men beleeve (that were suters) that no man had so much conference with the Emperor as he. And when <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was advertized of his lewd behaviour &amp; bribery, &amp; how he deceived many; hee caused one to request <hi>Turi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to obtaine a sure of <hi>Alexander:</hi> who going &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming dayly into the Princes chamber, would alwayes informe the suter, though most untruly, what he had said to the Emperour in his behalfe, and what answere was made him againe. After <hi>Alexander</hi> had intelligence of these things, and of the bribes he had received he caused <hi>Turinus</hi> to be apprehended; and the matter being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and how much he had that way robbed, and how largely he used to promise, &amp; how little he performed; the Emperour caused him to bee fastened aloft upon a stake openly in Rome, and under him was set greene wood and wet straw; whereunto when fire was put, there came such a smoke up to his nose, that within short time he was miserably choked &amp; stifled to death; a cryer <note place="margin">Excellent Iustice.</note> with a loud voyce making proclamation, <hi>Funiopunitur, qui fumum vendidit:</hi> he that sold smoke, is stifled with smoke. This Emperour had another servant called <hi>Belon</hi> who promised a Gentleman to obtaine a great sute for him of <hi>Alexander,</hi> with whom hee pretended to bee in great favour, and received of him a great summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; which being knowne to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and that which he promised to be very hurtfull to the commonwealth, and a most unjust matter, he caused him to be crucisiedr saying, that none should dare to adventure to sell the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:896:167"/>
of the Prince to the prejudice of his people. And though this Emperour would use the advice of men that were wise, and of a sincere mind in weighty affaires: yet he would never commit his trust and secrets to any spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall person; for he used to say, that when the people do understand that the Prince is counselled or directed by any one person, such a one may bee with gifts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests easily corrupted. <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> saith, that if any private man hath such favour and grace with the Prince, that all others be compelled to feare and please him, that man reigneth and enjoyeth the kingdome, and provideth so carefully for his owne matters, that hee neglecteth the affaires of the common-wealth. And those Magistrates that beare chiefe rule in the common wealth under their Prince, are thought to commit a fault, when they give such especial credit to any of their servants or favorites, as to suffer them to be the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and solliciters of mens suits abusing thereby many times their credit with their master, to the hindrance of right and justice, to their owne gaine, and his scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall: wherein they might doe much better to heare sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters deliver their owne cause, and let their servants or favorites meddle with their private affaires. These two things may be observed in histories to be dangerous, &amp; apparent signes &amp; notes of the ruine or alteration of a common-wealth: the one, when the riches &amp; wealth of the realme is gathered together into a few mens hands, &amp; the rest live in want and extreame poverty: the other, when the Magistrates be covetous, and justice corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the people licentious and wicked, and given to <note place="margin">Three ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

OUr owne age hath given us examples and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the dangers that the generality of vices, and corruption of good manners and customes hath brought to a common-wealth; and how necessarie it is for a Prince to be inquisitive, and looke often into the manners of his ministers and subjects; and to foresee in season, that the corruption of a few members doe not infect the whole body of the common-wealth. In the latter troubles of France, in the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the <note place="margin">Examples of late times.</note> third, all the states, by the kings appointment, were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, to reforme the disorders, abuses, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that were crept into all parts of the realme. When they had reckoned up to the king, in the assembly, the generalitie of vices, the disorders, abuses and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which had over-run all parts of France, they set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, with eloquent speech, the evill bestowing of the ecclesiasticall functions upon persons unfit: the ambition, the covetousnesse, the plurality of benefices, the non-residencie, the contempt of the law of God; the luxuriousnesse and dissolutenesse of Bishops and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Prelates, (except some few) that jetted in great pompe up and downe his Court, and in all other places with troopes of servants the most wicked and lewd in al the realme; their houses sound not of Psalmes and songs to the honour of God, but of barking of dogs, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of birds, and of all manner of dissolute voyces. Then they shewed how their Noblemen &amp; Gentlemen were degenerate from their forefathers, and what vices were now usuall amongst them: and among the rest, their swearings, and blasphemies of the name of God, whereas the oath of their forefathers was, <hi>By the faith of a Gentleman,</hi> which was done with reverence, and in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses necessary, and not oherwise. And speaking more
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:896:168"/>
generally, blasphemie (say they) is their mother tongue, and ordinary with many Frenchmen: Adulterie is to <note place="margin">The French nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for many vices.</note> them a pastime: Symonie is common merchandise: The richer ignorant sort of the Realme finde place in the chiefe dignities: men are knowne rather by their proud attire than by their vertue, their knowledge, or by their goodnesse. Then come they to the overthrow of Iustice, and the great abuse that was therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the delayes, the subtilties, and disguising of the truth that was there usuall, the miserie of them that followed sutes by the subtiltie of the parties, the little zeale and negligence of Iudges, by so many delayes such prolongings, whereby justice was not exercised, but rather vexed and encombred, and often troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote: that the particular respect of many, was the cause of these evils, who laboured by this meanes to increase their estate to their posteritie. Of these and the like things (say they) the King had appointed to be informed of his Iudges, but his commandement was all one, as if hee had not commanded: for all was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and unfruitfull. And this is the wickednesse of this time, that the Iudges are bound to judge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes, as they have sworne, and promised when they received their charge: yet notwithstanding it is glorious to a great many Iudges in these dayes to say, that they are not bound to judge according to the lawes written by the Lawyers, but they will judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne braines, whereof it followeth, that as every one aboundeth in his owne sense, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heads, so many opinions; so many Courts, so many sentences. Hereof riseth the diversity of judgments in the like cases, and in the selfe same matter; by meane whereof the poore suters fall into infinite charges and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:896:169"/>
immortall sutes: Lawes seeme no other things than written papers. Then proceeding to other disorders and abuses, they came to the selling of offices, and the power of judgment, which was the cause that the more wicked sort was most honoured, the most ignorant most esteemed; that the stronger oppresseth without punishment the weaker; that without scruple they sell that justice by retaile, that was bought in grosse; that <note place="margin">Miseries at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the neglect of Iustice.</note> the Cities and Countries were overwhelmed with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and robberies unpunished; that there was no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in governement, neither respect to the law, nor love to vertue, and that a licentiousnesse addicted to all evill is spread throughout all the realme. Now (said they) if you will turne from you the ruines that are prepared, you must degrade and discharge a number, aswell of your Prelates, as of your civill Magistrates, that are now established in your high Courts, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them severely that have abused themselves in their callings and offices, otherwise you cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your estate. Then make inquirie in all parts where good and honest men doe dwell, and replenish your counsell with them, and God will bee there among them: God is alwaies at hand with the just man, and will rather bring to effect your enterprises by their hands whom he blesseth, than by the subtill devices of prophane wise men, whose labour he curseth: it is very true, that good men are not seene to walke in troopes by great companies, yet let the torrent of corrupt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners bee never so violent, the world was never nor will bee without some number of men of excellent vertue. How many heroicall courages replenished with a holy magnanimitie, and with an incredible valour, be in the state of the Nobilitie and Gentilitie (not these villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:896:169"/>
blasphemous Nobilitie and Gentilitie) but that which loves and feares God, that never saw your Court, but remaine in their houses without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imployed? which kinde of men, if they were imployed in your service, would in a few moneths reforme all the ruines and disorders of the state. But these men are not knowne but of God, and of some good men. King <hi>Boccas</hi> presented to the Senate of Rome these verses, among others, in reprehension of some disorders that were dangerous to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>Wo be to that Kingdome where all be such, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Three ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses worthy observation.</note> the good are knowne among the evill, nor the evill among the good.</p>

               <p>But to returne to the Heathens. And what an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of continencie or rather temperance (for <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, Continencie is no vertue, but the way to vertue, that is temperance) was shewed by <hi>Scipio,</hi> being Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">Raretompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Scipio.</note> of the Romanes Armie in Spaine, when in the slower of his youth, certaine beautifull young women of the Nobilitie were taken Prisoners, and brought to him: among the which there was a young virgin that was contract unto a Prince of the Countrey of Luccio, of such a singular beautie and favour, that whither soever shee went, she drew all mens eyes to behold her. <hi>Scipio</hi> committed her and the rest to safe custody, with straight charge, that no dishonour should bee offered them: and sent for the parents
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:896:170"/>
and husband of this young virgin: and after some comfortable words used to them, hee restored the virgin to her husband undefiled, in the same sort hee received her: for the which he told him he would looke for none other satisfaction, but that hee would bee a friend to the people of Rome: And when her parents offered him a great summe of money in gold, which they had brought for her ransome, desiring him earnestly to accept it; and affirming that they should take the receiving of that money for as great a pleasure as the restoring of their daughter: <hi>Scipio</hi> seeing their importunacie, told them hee would accept it, and commanded them to lay downe the gold at his feete; and calling the young Prince, hee gave him this gold with his wife for her dower, over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that which her parents had promised to give him. The young man returned into his Countrey with his wife and gold in great joy, and published every where as he went, that there was a yong man come into Spain, like unto the gods that overcame all with Armes, with Courtesie and Liberalitie: and within few dayes after, to shew himselfe gratefull, hee returned to <hi>Scipio</hi> with one thousand foure hundred horse. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great when hee had taken <hi>Darius</hi> mother and his wife <note place="margin">The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of Alexander.</note> prisoners, a woman of singular beautie, with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faire young virgins attending upon them, was of that continency, that he would not be allured by their beauties, though in the flourishing time of his youth, to offer them any dishonour: but caused them to be kept safe from all violence, and honourably used according to their estate. The same <hi>Alexander</hi> having appointed on a time some woman to be brought to him; after hee had looked long for her, when she came to his bed, side
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:896:170"/>
hee asked her, why shee had tarried so long: because (quoth she) I could no sooner steale from my husband: when <hi>Alexander</hi> heard that shee was a married woman, hee sent her presently away untouched, because hee would not commit adultery. Where shall we find such scrupulosity of conscience, or respect of honestie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians, that know the greatnesse of that sin, and perill thereof, as was in that heathen Monarch, that commanded almost all the world, and was subject to the controlment of no man, and did forbeare onely for vertues sake? It is true that the Poet saith;

When hee was gone, all men, and specially <hi>Dionysius</hi> expected attentively what would bee the end of this strange and doubtfull matter. When the day appointed for his returne was as hand, and hee not come, every man condemned the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of meere folly, that so rashly would adventure his life upon another mans word: but he assuring himselfe of his friends fidelitie, told them plainely, he repented nothing that hee had done, nor had any mistrust in his comming: the very same day and houre that was by <hi>Dionysius</hi> set downe for his returne, his friend came: the tyrant marvelling at their constancie and fidelitie, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them both: and further, desired them that they would accept him for a third person into the society of <note place="margin">Friendship hath power even in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.</note> their friendship. <hi>Ephenus</hi> having offended <hi>Dionysius</hi> likewise, and being apprehended and brought before him, and condemned to dye, made sute to the tyrant for licence to goe home into his countrey to dispose of his things, promising to returne to dye such a day: <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi> demanding a pledge, hee delivered him his friend <hi>Everitus,</hi> who boldly assented to bee his pledge,

The performance of this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship was joyned with honesty and discretion, but this that followeth was more faithful than wise.

Such faith as was between <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias</hi> must bee sought for in some new-found land, where swannes be blacke; for it will hardly be found in the knowne world. As the world declineth to old age, and bringeth not forth his fruits with that vigour and vertue it hath done in times past: so the vertue and goodnesse of men seemeth to decline from that of former ages, and to waxe old and decay, which was foretold in <hi>Esdras;</hi> for the weaker that the world is by

Our nation, although it hath received many great blessings from God, as no people in the world more, both in proportion and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of body, and in valour and noblenesse of minde, with divers other singular gifts: yet we are by a certaine naturall inclination, and a worse custome, too apt to counterfeit strangers maners: we imitate the Spaniards in their pride, the Italians in their dissembling, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices, the Frenchmen in their rashnesse and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie; the Fleming, we beginne to follow in their quaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing and drunkennesse: and all these we counterfeit, or rather exceede in their vanitie of attyres and gestures. Pride and excesse were two of the finnes for which Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was punished. For many of our travellers bring us the worst of their manners, leaving the best behinde: as the Spider draweth poyson from the same flower the Bee sucketh honey: as though they made a conscience to bring any good thing from them. Nothing is more odious and contemptuous to us, than the simplicity of manners, and habits of our forefathers: and yet Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are full of examples of famous men and Nations, <note place="margin">The danger of travell.</note> that so long as they continued in the simplicitie of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and manners, and singlenesse of life of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:896:174"/>
the manners of other countries, they brought also their vices with them, and thereby lost that reputation which before they had gotten by their vertue. So long as the Lacedaemonians observed <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ordinances and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenesse of life and manners, they were one of the most flourishing Common-wealths in the world, and when they changed them with strangers manners, their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was soone decayed: Princes should foresee that <note place="margin">Fran.</note> the corruption of an evill custome creepe not into their Realme, for it bringeth in vices, and driveth out all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great was conquered by the luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Asia, of which by his vertue before he had made conquest. The Romanes likewise so long as they used the simplicity and singlenesse of life of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, encreased their estate untill they became ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the world: but afterward, when they brought into their country the luxuriousnesse and delicatesse of Asia, they lost all, and themselves also; and were so drowned in voluptuousnesse, that they got not so much fame &amp; reputation by their vertue, as they lost by their vice and vanity. The care of antiquity was to adorne their minds with vertueland knowledge, not regarding the ornaments of the body. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was a famous Captaine among the Grecians, and wanne many victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <note place="margin">The thrifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times.</note> who had but one onely garment: and if it chanced him to send it to the Fuller, hee was driven to tarry at home for lacke of another; and yet being of so small substance, when the King of Persia had sent him gold of great value for a gift, he would not take it. <hi>Paulus Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> a Romanc, when hee was made the second time Consull, was sent to make warre upon the Macedons, where he wanne a notable victory, with wonderfull store of riches and treasure: which not withstanding, he
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:896:175"/>
lived in such poore estate, that after his death, his wife could hardly have any dower. But the Italians since that time have changed their manners from vertue to vice, turned matter into forme, with divers frivolous inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> saith, that by the prowesse of our forefathers are honoured those that now live; and by the little that is in them that live now, our posteritie shall be infamous: for they that are now, have turned the acts and labours of antiquitie into <note place="margin">Guevarra concerning Travell.</note> foolish toyes and vanitie. <hi>Guevarra</hi> seemed to be of the opinion, that Travellers into Italie brought no great good home with them into their own Countries: for writing a letter to an Embassadour of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, among other things wisheth that hee come from Italie so sound of body and so perfect of soule, as when hee departed from Spaine; for in new Countryes alwaies there are learned new fashions: for to speake the truth (saith hee) I have seene few come from Italie, that came not only absolute, but also disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. The property of Bels is to call men to service, and never enter into the Church themselves: &amp; in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment such is the condition of Italy, where bee a great many Sanctuaries that provoke to prayer, but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therof have no devotion: but seeing you come from Rome, I would not have you boast of that place: for the fashions of Italy are more pleasant to be declared, than sure to bee followed. Rome is not now in the power of Christians, as it was in the time of the Heathens: for then being the mother of all vertues, shee is now turned <note place="margin">What Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:896:175"/>
those conditions to bee a Romane, much good may it doe you (quoth hee) for upon the day of account you would rather have beene a labourer in Spaine, than an Embassadour at Rome, which agreeth with <hi>Mantnan:</hi>

               <p>And yet this is the Country and people that we have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in such admiration, and desire to see and imitate. Heare also what the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> saith of the vices of Rome &amp; Italy, in his time brought from other Countries, and how much they are degenerate from the ancient Romanes, which hee often repeateth in his writings, and bewayleth with teares; hee calleth Rome the head of vices: O Rome without Rome which now hast nought but the wals, and art a common stewes of vices: not without teares (quoth he) I say that there was <note place="margin">Victory with losse.</note> never any Romane Captaine that did kill tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Asians with the weapons he brought into Asia; but that he lost an hundred thousand Romanes with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they brought to Rome. At the same time when the warre was kindled in the East, tenne valiant Captaines brought these vices to Rome: whose names my penne shall forbeare to tell, because their vile offences should not obscure their valiant deeds. Before that Rome conquered Asia, wee were rich, wee were patient, wee were sober, wee were wise, we were honest, and above all, we lived contented: but now all vices may be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Rome, as all sciences may bee heard in Greece; O unhappy Rome that hast now nothing but the name of Rome! because there is in thee such scarcity of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and such plenty of vice: the wals of Rome are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

of a great height, but her vertues be very low: Rome braggeth of the great number of her inhabitants, but Rome may weep that her vices be many more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comparison. In one month a man may number all the stones of her stately buildings: but in many yeares a man cannot comprehend the lewd and wicked manners and customes that be in Rome: ô cursed Rome, cursed thou hast been, cursed thou art, and cursed thou wilt be: as thou hast with tyranny made thy selfe Lady of Lords, so the time will come when thou with justice shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to be the servant of servants. In the time of our forefathers all the youth did exercise themselves in armes &amp; now all their pastime is in courting yong wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: In times past when thou wert peopled with true Romanes, and not as thou art now with bastards, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that went out of Rome, were as well disciplined as the Academies of Philosophers that were in Greece: if the gods would raise up our forefathers againe, either they would not know us for their children, or else they would bind us for madmen. A yong man told the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours that hee came out of strange countries onely to see Rome, and now hee found Rome without Rome: if my <note place="margin">An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> judgment (saith he) deceive me not, either ye be not Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans of Rome, or else this is not Rome of the Romans: ô Rome if thou knewest truly the vertue of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and didst consider the lightnesse of us, the day that they ended their life, the same day not one stone in thee should have bin left upon another, and so the fields should have savoured of the bones of the vertuous, which now stinke of the bodies of the vicious: that which our forefathers did fly from, our vaine people in these daies run after.

which our Nation hath so great a desire to see and imitate: for the Italians have drawne their viocs, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill manners from the Romanes, being one natin, as the Romanes brought them from other countreyes: might not our forefathers have truely prophesied, that when our nation became travellers into Italy, our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and conditions would be made worser might they not have said, we shal then learn to speak much and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme little; to know how to dissemble injuries, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to forgive them; to bee very constant in hatred, and very changeable in love &amp; friendship? and out of other countries also, other conditions worse than our owne: is there a more unseemely thing for a man, than quaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing and carowsing, even to drunkennesse, and to death, which happeneth often?

And wil you see how odious this vice of quaffing &amp; drunkennes was to the old Romanes? <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> reporteth that in the Senate of Rome, there was an ancient man who made great exclamations, that a yong man had so dishonoured him, that hee deserved death: when the yong man was called to his answer; Fathers conscript (quoth he) though I seeme yong, yet I am not so yong, but that I knew the father of this old man, who was a vertuous and noble Romane, and kinne to mee.

The old Romances so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested this vice of quaffing and drunkennesse, that when the Consull <hi>Lucius Pius</hi> was sent to make war upon the Sarmatians, after a season a truce was made, in which time the Consull made them a banquet, and filled them so full with wine (a thing which the Sarmatians above all things most desired) that their Captaines yeelde themselves and their countrey into subjection of the Romanes. After the wars were ended, the Consull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Rome, required the accustomed triumph, which was not only denied him by the Senate, but also by decree in recompence of his service, his head was striken off, and all his acts defaced, and the Sarmatians set at libertie againe, and freed from the subjection of the Romanes: who would not winne kingdomes and countries by quaffing and drunkennesse, but by vertue and valor. The people of Brasill make a feast when they kill their prisoners, and sit drinking three dayes &amp; three nights: &amp; never leave quaffing untill they have emptied all their vessels: every draught they drinke is of exece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great quantity, and hee that holdeth not out to the end, is accounted infamous and effeminate.

               <p>For we change both ayre and minde, not as he would have it, in reformation, but rather in deformation of maners, from simplicity or singlenesse, to diffinulation or doublenesse.

The people of Creta being ill used of the Rhodians their enemies, desired their gods that they would suffer some evill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be brought in among them, thinking that to bee a worse curse than warre, or pestilence, or any other thing: But had it not been more honourable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for our nation to have continued in the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of habits, and manners of our forefathers, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their vertues, than to receive the vanity of attyres and gestures of other countries, with their corruption of maners, &amp; with them to exchange our vertues for their vices? are our maners and habits better now, than were in times past those of our forefathers, because they cannot lately out of Italy, out of Spaine, out of France, &amp; from the Dutchmen? Is there no better rule to be given how to discerne between that which is good, &amp; that which is

Vertue in former ages was wont to be in estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the antiquity, &amp; a rule to direct their lives by, through which many became famous, aswel privat men, as whole Nations. But what fruit hath bin brought to us with these new fashions and strangers manners? what effect hath it wrought? If it be lawfull to speake the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides to be proud and effeminate, and the exchange of our vertues for their vices, a confusion of all things: What difference is there in habits betweene estates? Doth not the baser sort glitter in gold and silver equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the greater, whereof ensueth many mischiefes? The maners that in time past for reverence were peculiar to Princes, &amp; the greater states of the Nobility, as due onely to them, are they not now common and usuall with the baser sort, and even among carters?

                  <note place="margin">Of a Dog.</note> marched with his Army, hee hapned to passe by a dog that guarded the body of his master who lay dead upon the high way: &amp; after the king had beheld awhile this pitifull spectacle, he was advertised by some of the countrimen, that the same was the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. day that the poor creature had not departed out of the place, nor forsaken the dead corps, without meat or drinke: which moved the king to command the body to bee buried, and the dog for his fidelity to be kept &amp; cherished: &amp; caused an inquisition to be made of the murder, but nothing could bee found. It chanced that not long after the king was disposed to take muster of his whole Army, that hee might see how they were furnished: the dogge alwayes followed the king sad &amp; mute, untill such time as they that killed his master past by: then he flyeth upon them with a wonderfull violence &amp; fury, as though he would teare them in peeces, turning this way and that way, howling most pittifully, sometime toward the king, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him earnestly, as though he demanded justice: which made the king and all the company suspect that these men committed the murder: whereupon they were examined and tormented; and upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the fact, put to death.

And being examined, and denying the matter, the king thought good to make triall what the dogge would do: he gave leave to the Gentleman to use his sword for his defence, and armed the dogge with leather, and turned them together: the dogge assayled the Gentleman with such fury and violence, that perceiving himselfe like to bee torne in peeces, and unable to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the dogge, he desired to bee delivered from him, and confessed the fact.

Where great care is had (saith <hi>Cato</hi>) to decke the body, there is great carelesnesse and litle regard of vertue. If <hi>Diogenes</hi> were now living, he must have a torch to seeke for a man at noone dayes; for he would hardly finde such a man as hee looked for with a candle. But to returne from whence I digressed. By the exercise of these and the like vertues, the Heathen thought they might attaine to felicitie: for to live according to nature they thought was sufficient to live happily, because by nature wee have an inclination to vertue, though not made perfect without exercise: but they knew not how our nature was corrupted by the fall of our first parent, by which wee can doe nothing that good is without Gods holy spirit: neither can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune give us any helpe to it, avaine name among the Heathens given to those effects, whereof they knew not the cause proceeding by the providence of God. There was found engraven in a precious stone called <hi>Topaze,</hi> these words in old Romane letters:

Which words against the Philosophers, that thought the way to felicity to bee, to live according to nature whereto they would have the helpe of fortune, may be thus applyed, by the defect of nature: by the mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:896:191"/>
of fortune: without the providence of God, no man can attaine to felicitie. For our nature being degenerate from his first perfection and estate to wickednesse and corruption, and fortune (as they call it) being variable and uncertaine, void of all constancy, we have no means to come to felicitie without Gods providence &amp; grace: and to thinke that a man may bee able to attaine to it by his wisedome, is extreme arrogancie and meere folly. <hi>Patrarke</hi> saith, To beleeve that thou art wise, is the first degree to foolishnesse: the next is to professe it. By this <note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which hath beene said, it appeareth that the felicitie of man consisteth not in the action of morall vertue, as the Philosophers would; for that is not his end: but the end of man, is the glory of God; to know and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, which is also his proper action: for unstable and uncertaine are all humane matters, not onely in the minds and actions of private men, but in Monarchies also and kingdomes: to day they flourish and seeme to be in great securitie, to morrow they decline and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thraldome and miserie: another time they returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to their former estate: thus continually prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their periods, even as the heavens that goe round, alwaies moving, and in circular sort returning where they beganne: so by vertue they are raised up on high, and by vice following (as it were by a necessary succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) they are throwne downe againe.

So wee say, that the operation or worke of the sight, is more perfect than the operations of all other senses, because it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from a power more perfect, and is more pure and subtill. And the art of a blacke Smith is lesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than that of a gold Smith, because the matter whereupon he worketh as his subject, which is iron, is lesse perfect than the matter which is gold, upon which the gold smith worketh: so the operations of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, proceeding from the most perfect power of al other, &amp; working upon an object most perfect, which is substances abstract and divine, must needes bee the most perfect operation, which is nothing else but the contemplation of divine substances. But the operations of the senses are not pure, but are mixt with paine or lacke: as to eate, endureth no longer than we suffer the paine of hunger, or have neede of meate; so that the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:896:192"/>
pleasure of eating is joyned with the paine of hunger; and likewise of all the other senses. The operations also of a civill life are not pure and simple, as are the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the understanding, which is a power voyde of all matter: but they are full of perturbations &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and affections, farre from the delight and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a contemplative life. For all our operations and actions, and likewise the exercise of morall vertues, are full of travell and wearinesse: the troubles and unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the warres wherein men exercise fortitude, is known to all men: likewise the endlesse labours both of body and minde, that is in governement in a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, by exercising justice, liberalitie, prudence, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and other vertues, is apparent: and all our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and labours, whether it be in warres or peace, is to enjoy quietnesse. As one said, every motion is to rest: and if we see a man withdraw himself from publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and from medling with worldly matters, to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and quiet life, all say with one voice, that man is happy that leadeth a secure and quiet life, free from worldly cares, and troublous affaires of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: by which we confesse, that we judge a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quiet life to be the end of all our travels: so that the felicity of man seemeth in our owne judgement to consist in a quiet life, free from worldly cares and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: and forasmuch then, as such quietnesse is in no kind of life to be found, but in a contemplative life, then in must rest the felicity of man, after the Philosophers. The contemplative or studious life also is not onely to be preferred before the active and civill life, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the subject whereupon it worketh, that is, divine things, &amp; the vacancie of worldly cares &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but also that it is of such condition that fortune

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:896:193"/>
Moone, to make one entire Common-wealth with the rest of his kind, like to that heavenly principality above; but as a certaine spectator also of divine things: who by comparing things past, with things present, might fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see things to come: and know and love by his word, and worke the glorie of his parent. And when he should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up to him, hee should joyne himselfe to God, and conforme all the harmonie of his gifts, to his goodnesse and glory; which by two manner of wayes is brought to passe; when he helpeth and maintaineth his fellows and brethren according to his calling by the rule of Gods laws: and magnifieth God in continuall contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation by prayers and thanks-giving. Therfore that the minde being fallen into the prison of the body, might raise it selfe up againe, as it were by certaine degrees to perpetuall light. In man, there is from the body a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ascending by the spirit to the inward soule: In the world, where with we are environed, from the elements and compound things, by the Aethereall substance to heaven: In mans common-wealth from kingdomes and cities to the due order of the whole course of nature; from hence to the incorporate world and God himself, as the first example and patterne of all justice and truth.

Philosophers which they bestowed in the knowledge of God by his workes, and by their reason and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, were imployed to the knowledge of God by the testimony of his holy Scripture and by faith, then may it more rightly bee said, that the contemplative life is more perfect than the active life: But Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation properly isto be exercised in afflictions, and to feele motions of the spirit; and not to be studious on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that resembleth rather an active life; which afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and spirituall motions may as wel be in him that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himselfe to study, as in him that is occupied in matters of the common-wealth, as it is to bee seene in <hi>David,</hi> and then may it truly be said, that such a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative life is to bee preferred before all other kindes of life, as that which leadeth to the true felicitie and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude or <hi>Summum bonum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The contemplative or studious life hath been in such estimation among men, that divers examples are regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in histories both of Heathens and Christians, that have voluntarily forsaken the world and all societie of men to leade this kinde of life: to whom many strange things have happened: among the rest (by the report <note place="margin">Examples.</note> of St. <hi>Ierome</hi>) <hi>Anthonie</hi> being in the wildernesse, met with a strange kinde of creature or monster that resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a little man, and a crooked nose, a horned forehead, whose lower parts ended into the feet of a goate, who brought him dates to eate: And when <hi>Anthonie</hi> asked him what he was, he answered, I am a mortall man, one of the inhabitants of the wildernesse, whom the foolish Gentiles worshipped, being deluted with many erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinions, &amp; called them <hi>Fauni, Satyri,</hi> and <hi>Incubi:</hi> I am the Embassador of my companions; we desire thee to pray to our common God for us, whom wee know

But if we cleanse our minds of our corrupt affections and passions, and looke into the matter with a sound and vpright iudgement, we shall see, that either
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:896:196"/>
there is no felicitie in this life, that answereth to that name, or else that affliction and such crosses as God will lay vpon us, detracteth not any thing from our felicitie. For seeing the difference of greatnesse, and distance of space, that is betweene things that are circumferiptible and have end, can make the lesse seeme nothing, and beare no proportion to the greater, then <hi>à fortiori,</hi> that which is temporall and comprehended within time, and hath end, seemeth nothing, nor beareth any proportion to that which is without time, perpetuall, and infinite.

And who will call him a sickly man, that in the whole course of his life hath neuer felt any sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but onely one little short fit of an ague: but rather will call him a healthfull man? much lesse can the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions or troubles of this life bee called infelicitie: or withdraw any thing from the name of felicitie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause betweene the other there is some proportion: betweene this life and the life to come, none at all. But yet because the life wee lead in this world, is something in respect of time, let us see whether wee can finde any thing in it worthie to be called felicitie.

And for as much as he made us to his owne glory, and that we might know and worship him: the end and true Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of man in this world is, to know God, to magnifie and worship him; to which end is ioyned the fruition and enioying of him in the world to come, which is the Beatitude or blessednesse, and <hi>Summum Bonum</hi> we seeke for. But because men are commonly called happy or vnhappy, according to the course of life they leade, let us examine the estate and condition of this life, and see whether wee can finde any thing in it, other then that last aboue spoken, worthy of the name of Felicitie.</p>
               <p>Many ancient Philosophers and Wise-men, having diligently observed the nature and manner of life of all sorts of creatures of the world, and compared them with the estate and condition of men, cryed out, that of all the creatures that breathed and went vpon the earth, There was not any more miserable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man. <hi>Heracltt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And it was not sufficient for him to abhorre and detest the company of men as furious wilde beasts, but hee sought also all the meanes he could, if it had bin possible, to destroy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: and for that purpose he set vp a great many gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets in his garden, that desperate folkes and such as were weary of their liues might hang themselues: and after certaine yeeres, meaning to inlarge his little Cottage where he dwelt, hee determined to cut downe those gibbets for his building: and being loth the lacke of them should bee any hindrance to his Citizens death, he went to Athens, and openly in the market place hee caused the people to be assembled, that hee might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer some newes to them, who knowing his humour that used to speake with no man, ranne to the place out of all parts, expecting attentively some strange matter: when they were come together, he cryed out with his hoarse voice; My Citizens of Athens, if any of you be

disposed to hang your selues, doe it quickly, for I meane shortly to cut downe the gibbets for my necessary buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And when he had ended his charitable motion, he departed home to his house, without speaking any word more; where he liued many yeeres, continuing in the same opinion, detesting the miserable estate and condition of men. And when <hi>Tymon</hi> perceiued that death approched, he tooke order for his buriall to bee at the low water marke, in the very brinke of the Sea, that the waues might not suffer any man to come neere him to see his bones or ashes, and caused this Epitaph to be written vpon his tombe, made Latine thus:

The Danes under their King <hi>Hading</hi> making Warre in Suecia, in the winter suffered a wonderfull famine: for being so straightly besieged by <hi>Vffo</hi> King of Suecia, that they had no meanes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And the Caliguritans, when <hi>Pompey</hi> besieged their Citie so straightly, that all
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:896:204"/>
things were consumed that might serve them for meat, they ate their wives and children. Among the rest of the infelicities and miseries that ensue of the Warres, this is not the least, that <hi>Olorus</hi> King of Thracia, when hee had subdued the Daces, compelled all the men to be servants or slaves to their wives, in token of extreme servitude, &amp; of the most spitefull disgrace and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that he could devise to inflict vpon them. And this was no lesse spitefull, that <hi>Attilus</hi> King of Suecia made a Dog King of the Danes, in revenge of a great many injuries received by them. And <hi>Gunno</hi> likewise King of the Danes made a Dog King of Norway, &amp; appointed Counsellers to doe all things vnder his title and name. But the Emperour <hi>Fredericke</hi> the second used a more moderation, when hee had overcome the people in Hungary: We have (said the Emperour) done a great worke, but now there remaineth a greater worke, that we overcome and master our selves; that wee make an end of our covetousnesse and desire of revenge: words worthy of an Emperour. <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> noting the infelicitie of these kinde of men among the Romanes, saith; After our men of Warre are gone out of Rome, they neither feare the Gods, nor honour the Temples: they reverence not the Priests: they have no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Fathers, nor shame to the people, dread of justice, neither compassion of their countrey: some rob the Temples, others breake vp doores: the nights they passe in playes, the dayes in blasphemies: to day they fight like Lyons, to morrow they fly like Cowards: some rebell against their Captaines, and others flie to the enemies: finally, they are vnmeet for all good, and meete for all evill: and therefore, to speake of their filthinesse, I am ashamed to describe them: they leave
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:896:205"/>
their owne wives, and take the wives of others: they <note place="margin">The insolency of Warre.</note> dishonour the daughters of the good, and they beguile the innocent virgins: there is no neighbour but they covet, nor Oastesse but they force: they breake their old wedlocke, and yeerely seeke a new marriage: so that they doe all things what they list, and nothing what they ought. What? wilt thou I tell thee more of the injuries which the Captaines doe to the Cities whereby they passe? of the slanders which they raise in the Provinces where they abide? the Moths doe not so much harme to the garments, nor the Locusts to the corne, as the Captaines doe to the people: for they leaue no beast but they kill, nor orchard but they rob, nor wine but they drinke, nor doue-house but they climbe, nor Temple but they spoile, nor villanie but they commit: they eate, without meaning to pay: they will not serve, vnlesse they be well paid: and the worst of all is, if they have their pay, immediately they spend and play it away; if they be not paid, they rob and mutine: so that with povertie they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and with riches they are luxurious and insolent. I heard one day (saith the Emperour) but hee saw not mee, a Captaine of mine say to an Oastesse of his, that would not let him doe in the house what hee would: Yee of the countrey did never know Captaines of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and therefore know it now (mother) that the earth doth never tremble, but when it is threatned with a Romane Captaine: and the Gods doe never <note place="margin">A Cowardly boaster.</note> suffer the Sunne to shine, but where we are obeyed. Within short space after, this Captaine went to a battell in Arabia, where hee was the first that fled and left the Standard alone, which had almost made mee lose the battell; but in recompence of his valiant service, I

In these Civill Warres of France, Sanserra was so <note place="margin">The siege of Sanserra.</note> straightly besieged, that for want of victuals almost halfe the people were consumed by famine: when they had eaten vp all their Dogs, Cats, Mice, and Wants, they fell to the hides of their Oxen, and Kine, and Sheepe: then to their leather girdles, saddles, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and halters: to their purses, points, and all manner of leather garments: then they ate the hooffs of Horses, Oxen, Stags and Goats, whereof many had long hanged at their keyes: when all their corne was consumed, they made bread of straw cut in small pieces and stamped in a morter, and of a kinde of tile-stones: and when all these things were spent, the rage of their hunger was so extreme, that they ate the dung of beasts: and also their owne excrements: they would also seeke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dung-mixens for the bones and hornes of beasts that had long lien there rotting, and eate them greedily. There were that would haue eaten the carcas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of dead men, but being taken with the manner, they were punished by the Magistrates: and when they were driven to this extremitie, that all manner of things that might bee eaten were almost consumed,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:896:206"/>
they cast out of the towne all those that were vnser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for the Warres; who were without any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or respect of humanitie most cruelly with stripes and wounds by the enemie driven into the towne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: but the sight of the towne was so hatefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that many chose rather to suffer any extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then to returne thither againe, and were slaine with their shot. It was a lamentable sight to behold men, women and children like a dried corse, nothing left upon them but skinne and bone: but nothing could moove the hard hearts of their enemies, so as at last they were enforced to yeeld up the towne upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conditions. When the French King that now is and of Navarre besieged Paris of late yeeres, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <note place="margin">Of Paris.</note> grew so extreme within the Citie, that they fed vpon their Horses, Asses, Dogs, Cats, Mice, Vine-leaves; and after some Writers, there died by famine above thirtie thousand persons: and this lamentable History is also reported; that a Citizen having nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to feede himselfe, his wife and his children, not able any longer to endure the sight of this miserie, nor to heare their lamentable complaints, he first han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp his wife and his children, and then himselfe. But before this was done, he tyed a writing to his brest, declaring the only cause why he committed this act to be, that hee was no longer able to endure this miserie, and therefore hee prayed God that hee would forgiue him this fault.</p>

So as the effects and conditions of a suite are no other, then of a rich man to become poore; of a pleasant disposition, to fall into melancholy; of a free mind to become bound; from liberalitie to fall into covetousnesse; from truth, to learne falshood &amp; shifts; and of a quiet man, to become a vexer of others: so that I see no other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the tenne plagues, that scourged Egypt, and the miseries that afflict suitors, then that the calamities of the one were inflicted by Gods providence, and the torments of the other are invented by the malice of men, who by their owne toyle make themselues very Martyrs.</p>

                  <hi>Peter de la Primandaye</hi> thus noteth and reprehendeth the abuses of this time, in suites of law in his country of France. <hi>Cicero</hi> complaineth of his time, that many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table decrees of law were corrupted and depraved by the curious heads of the lawyers: what would he doe, if he were now aliue, and saw the great heapes and piles of bookes, with our practice in the law? If he saw that holy temple of lawes so shamefully polluted, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably prophaned; where a thousand cavils and quiddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are continually coyned by such writings, according to the saying of the Comicall Poet: that through craft and subtilty one mischiefe is begotten vpon an other. But times have beene when there were but few lawes,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:896:210"/>
because men thought that good manners were the best lawes; and that naturall sense, holpen with an vpright conscience, and ioyned with due experience, was the right rule to iudge by. But after that men became so skilfull in suites, and that offices of iustice, that were wont freely to be given to them that deserved them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came to bee gainefull and free from yeelding any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their doings, and set forth to sale as marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disc for them that offered most: after that men began to spice their suites with great summes of money: after that lawyers began so greatly to gaine, and slightly to consider of their clyents causes, because they would make hast to another that waited for them, with gold in his hand: after that they began to write with seuen or eight lines on a side, and to disguise matters with frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous answers: after that Proctors and Atturneys, who in former time were to be had for nothing, and appointed for certaine causes, became hirelings and perpetuall: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that sollicitors were suffered in the middest of them all to be as it were the skum gatherers of suites, with all that rabblement of practitioners, who devoure the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of poore men, as drones eate vp the hony of Bees: Lastly, after that the Chauncery did let loose the bridle to all sorts of expeditions, and went about to teach the Iudges. After these things (saith he) began to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, we fell into this miserie of long suites, gainfull to the craftie and wicked, and very preiudiciall to plaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and good men; who many times had rather lose their right, then hazzard their vndoing by following a suite so long by way of iustice: for that commonly wee see the rightest cause frustrated by delaies, by affection, or by corruption. We see how suites are heaped vp one vpon another, and made immortall, that nothing is so
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:896:210"/>
certaine, which is not made uncertaine: that no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie is so cleare, which is not obscured: no contract so sure, that is not vndone: no sentence or judgement so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly given, which is not made voide: all mens actions open to the slanders, craft, malice, redemptions and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Lawyers: the Majestie and integritie of ancient justice lost: &amp; last of all, that in the dealings of men now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a-dayes, no shew of upright justice, but only a shadow thereof remaineth. This evill is become so great, and growne to such extremitie, that it is unpossible but that according to the course of worldly things, the ruine thereof must bee at hand, or at the least it is to receive some notable change within some short space. For as <hi>Plato</hi> saith, In a corrupt Common-wealth defiled with many vices, if a man should think to bring it back againe to his first brightnesse and dignitie, by correcting small faults, and by curing the contagion thereof by little and little, it were all one, as if he should cut off one of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draes</hi> heads, in whose place seven more did spring up. But that alteration &amp; disorder, whereby all evill &amp; vice was brought into the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, must be plucked up by the roots: For an extreme evill must have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme remedy. And true it is, that there haue bin times <note place="margin">Lawyers and Physicions ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> when both Lawyers and Physicions have bin banished out of divers countries, as men rather hurtfull then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Common-wealth, which argueth the same to bee no happy estate. And some reason they had to maintaine their opinion; because men being more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in their life &amp; diet, &amp; not so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentious &amp; malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in those dayes &amp; countries, as they have bin since, they needed not so greatly Physicions nor Lawyers. But since that time the luxuriousnesse and intemperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie commonly used, and the contentious and malicious
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:896:211"/>
minds of men growne to extremity, have brought forth a necessary vse of both their skils. Of the one, to cure the disease engendred by disordered life, or some way to ease the paine: Of the other, to helpe minister matter of contention, and at length to decide the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: for such is the necessitie of our humane condition, that in many things they are driven to seeke remedie there, from whence their harme commeth: As the oyle of a Scorpion is a present remedie for the stinging of the Scorpion. <hi>Chilo</hi> said, <hi>Comitem aeris alieni ac litis, esse miseriam.</hi> But why Lawyers and Physicions should be <note place="margin">Lawyers and Physicions have one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon end.</note> coupled together in such a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gruence, I see not, except, because they have one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon end, that is gaine; and the manner of both their proceedings in their faculties, is by evacuation. <hi>Sine Causidicis satis olim fuere futura<expan>

               <p>LET vs leaue these men pleading their Clients causes, and looke further into the estate of Iudges and other Magistrates, which is an honourable estate, and necessary for our humane nature.

A great number of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples may bee produced of good Magistrates and honourable Personages, that by the ingratitude of the Prince or people, in recompence of their good seruice, haue beene bereaued of their liues and goods. <hi>pellizarians,</hi> a noble Gentleman and Generall vnder <note place="margin">Bellizarius.</note> the Emperour <hi>Iustinian,</hi> ouercame the Vandals, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed ouer the Persians, deliuered Italy many times

of the Barbares: in recompence of so notable seruice, the Emperour through enuie and suspition caused his eyes to be plucked out of his head, insomuch that he was driuen to get his liuing by begging: And stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a little cottage that was placed in one of the most frequented streetes in Rome, asked almes in this sort: Yee that passe by, giue poore <hi>Bellizarians</hi> a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Gods sake, who for his vertue was famous, and through enuie is made blind: so that it is truly said, A great good turne is often rewarded with great ingratitude: and the vncertainty of the peoples fauour <hi>Petrarke</hi> taxeth thus: Faire weather of the Spring, the mornings sweet winde of Summer, calmes of the Sea, the estate of the Moone, the loue of the people, if they be compared together, the palme and price of muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie shall be giuen to the last.

So after them, they set their sonnes in their dignities, sometime of small knowledge and capacitie. There was written in the Councell house at Ratisbone in a Marble table with Golden letters, these words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are meete to be written in the brests of all Councellors and other Magistrates: What Senatour <note place="margin">Words worthy to be ingravon over every Seat of luslice.</note> soever thou art, that enterest into the Councell house to execute thy office, cast away before this doore all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affections, anger, violence, hatred, friendship, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; put on the person, and have care of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: for as thou art just or unjust to others, even so shalt thou also look for &amp; endure the judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God.</p>

What more monstrous thing can there be, then for the Iudges and Magistrates which Rome sends to take away the evill manners of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be themselues the inventers of new vices?

Because I am not to be intreated or moved with rewards. From whence derive you your kinde? From heaven. What parents did beget you? Measure did beget me, &amp; sincere faith brought me forth. Why is one of your eares open, &amp; the other shut? One is open to just persons, the other is deafe to the wicked. Why doth your right hand beare a sword, and the left a ballance? This doth weigh causes, the other strikes the guilty. Why goe ye alone?

There be foure things necessary in a Iudge: to heare patiently, to answer wisely, to iudge vprightly, and execute mercifully. Iudges and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates (saith one) should not imploy their study to get friends, to maintaine their estate proudly, but rather to read books, to iudge mens causes vprightly. The good Magistrate should take the authority of his office which the Prince giueth him for accessary, and his good life for principall; that the vprightnesse of his iustice, and the sharpenesse which the wicked feele in the execution thereof, should be so tempered by his discretion, that all may hold authority by the syncerity of his life. <hi>Aristotle</hi> requireth three things to be in all good Iudges and Magistrates, Vertue and Iustice, a loue to the present e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and a sufficiency to exercise those duties that are required in their office.</p>

to please: otherwise they must fall short of that they looke for. The happinesse of these men differeth as much from felicitie, as a darke dungeon differeth from the cleere light of the Sun: and this is incident to those great estates that are so followed, that many of them, who to salute them, take their hattes from their heads, wish that his head were taken from his shoulders; and that bow their knee to do him reuerence, wish his legge broken, that they might carrie him to his graue. <hi>Alfonsus</hi> king of Arragon, sayling vpon the sea fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sicilia, beheld certaine fowle soaring about his Galley, and looking for meat of the marriners: and when he had cast them meat, he obserued how greedily they contended for it: &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer as they had gotten their prey, away they would flie and returne no more.

They which haunt the Courts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if they will be curious and no fooles, shall finde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things whereat to wonder, and much more whereof to beware. And to another question, whether the Court be deare or good cheape; he answered: Some things <note place="margin">What is cheape in the Court.</note> in the Court are at a good price, or to say it better, very good cheape; that is, cruell lies, false newes, unhonest women, fained friendship, continuall enmities, double malice, vaine words, and false hopes; of which eight things, we have such abundance in this Court, that they may set out Boothes, and proclaime Faires. In the Court (saith he) there be few that liue contented, and many that be abhorred. In the Court none hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire there to die, and yet wee see not any that will depart from thence. In the Court we see many doe what they list, but very few what is meete. In the Court all dispraise the Court, and yet all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Court: and the fashion of the Court is, if a man be in fauour, he knoweth not himselfe; and if the same man be out of fauour, no man will know him: This life at Court is no other thing then a languishing <note place="margin">The Courtiers life.</note> death, a certaine vnquiet life without peace, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally without money; and a certaine purchase of dammage and offence to the body, and of hell to the

An Italian compareth the life of Courtiers with that of Sea-faring men; saving that there is in them this difference, that the Sea-man commeth to the end of his purpose by sayling well, and the Courtier to his by doing ill. <hi>Zenobia</hi> the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Queene of Palmerines, is reported to haue had a well ordered Court, as appeared also by her answer made to the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warre vpon her, offered her conditions of peace, and demaunded her sonne to bee sent to him for a pledge.

Were it not better (said <hi>Inlius Caesar</hi>) to die once, then to liue in such continuall feare and suspition They command all, and yet many of them seeme as though they were gouerned by one or two, which is much disallowed of diuers State men.

so others are dejected from high dignitie to base and poore estate; as was apparant in <hi>Cleander,</hi> who of a Slave, was made a Free-man; of a Freeman, a Steward; of a Steward, a Praetor; and then a Great Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, and as it were Monarch of the world, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in one day and in one houre, hee and all his were utterly destroyed. The particular loue (saith one) which <note place="margin">Favour begets envy.</note> Princes shew to one more then to another, breedeth many times much envie in their Realme: and when a Prince sheweth not to equals his fauour indifferently, he putteth fire into his Common-wealth. The like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may be taken of <hi>Plautianus,</hi> an especiall favorite of the Emperour <hi>Seuerus.</hi> This <hi>Plutianus</hi> was a poore <note place="margin">The story of <hi>Plautianus.</hi>
                  </note> Gentleman when he came first to Rome, from whence he was banished, by the good Emperour <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> for his evill conditions; but afterward he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned such grace of <hi>Seuerus,</hi> that he read no letter but he must see it, signed no commission that he liked not, nor gave any reward that he craved not: In the Senate hee was placed in the most honourable estate: When hee came forth of Rome, all the Gentlemen did accompany him: When hee came out of his house, all Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours did attend on him: In time of Warre, all Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines sued unto him; and so many honours were given him, that it was never seene in Rome that any man, without the title of an Emperour, enjoyed so great a portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Empire. <hi>scuerus</hi> gave <hi>Plautianus</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate goods of all condemned persons within the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, whereby he grew so rich &amp; covetous, that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an infinite number of men to suffer death, not for their demerits, but that he might possesse their goods: wherewith he grew so proud and stately, that when he passed thorow the streets, he had a naked sword borne
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:896:221"/>
before him, and no man might behold him in the face, but cast downe their eyes to the ground: and besides all this, he found such favour with <hi>Seuerus,</hi> that he married his daughter with <hi>Seuerus</hi> the Emperour his eldest sonne: so as beholding himselfe thus advanced and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, it seemed to him but a small matter to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the whole world. But at length this heaping of honour upon honour, dignitie upon dignitie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end or measure, wrought his owne destruction: for perceiving the Emperour to withdraw his favour from him, suspecting that he would also take away his life, he practised to kill the Emperour and his sonne <hi>Bassianus,</hi> that he might not onely prevent the suspected intent of <note place="margin">Too much grace begets ingratitude.</note> his owne death, but also succeed him in the Empire: but the same being discovered to the Emperour in the presence of his sonne, they trained him into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where <hi>Bassianus</hi> slew him with his dagger. This was the end of <hi>Plautianus,</hi> through his immoderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of riches and honour, and the good fortune of the Emperour that escaped narrowly his owne death and his sonnes, by the exceeding favour and authoritie, and countenance hee gave to his servant and subject: by which example the Emperour <hi>seuerus</hi> was warned, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after to give the like favour and grace to any person: alledging, that hee knew not whom to trust, seeing his servant <hi>Plautianus,</hi> whom he so greatly loved and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, had deceived him.

And what felicitie can a Prince have, that hath under his government so many thousands of people, who
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:896:221"/>
must wake for them all, heare the complaints of every one, haue care for all their safetie? His waking defendeth all mens sleeping, his labour all mens rest, his industry all mens delights: that he is occupied, bringeth to all men case: for as if the Planets of the world make never so little stay, or swarue aside, it is to the exceeding hurt of all things; so a Prince cannot rest, nor be idle, without the great detriment of his people, whose care is no lesse to maintaine his people in peace, then to defend them from the invasion of their enemies: besides many other calamities that accompany Scepters, whereof a meane estate never findeth any taste. For rightly (saith one) that it is not sufficient for a Prince to draw to him all vertues, but hee is bound also to roote all vices out of <note place="margin">Note.</note> the Common-wealth. These be the thornes they have for a counterpoyse of their brightnesse and royall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which ought to be like a lampe that giveth light to all the world: But if it be eclypsed with any vice, then it is more notorious, and subject to greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch then in any other private person: for they are not onely blame-worthy (saith <hi>Plato</hi>) for the fault they commit: but for the evill example they giue. And it is a great felicitie (saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Augustine</hi>) not to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of felicitie. Great compassion (saith <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>) should be had upon a Prince, because all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him for their owne profit, but none for his loue and seruice, as appeareth by that, when he leaueth to giue them, they begin to hate him. The Emperour <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian</hi> said, that there was nothing more hard, then for a Prince to rule well: for three or foure of those who haue credit with the Prince, ioyne sometime together in one speech, and of purpose tell fained things for true, whereby hee is often deceiued.</p>

               <p>LET us now enter into the consideration of Prelates, beginning with Popes: who as they chalenge the Supremacie over all other estates, so they seeme to be placed in the highest degree of Felicitie: they come by their dignitie without labour, and for the most part without effusion of blood, and preserue their estate <note place="margin">The estate of Prelates.</note> without perill, commanding all. The Monarkes and Princes of the world honour them: they are rich, and seeme to want nothing that men desire in this world, to make their life happy, although those whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, were the very patterns and examples of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But he that will with an upright judgement consider of their estate, shall finde them rather unhappie: for if they will take upon them the government of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peters</hi> ship, according to the commandements of God, they must be, not as they professe in words, but in deeds, the servants of the servants of God: which must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his owne life, in respect of the care he should have of them under his charge: which being wisely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

And if to enter into the dignity of the Apostleship, not called thereto by the Holy Ghost, and not to enter into the Church through the doore, which is Christ, but by the window, by the favours of men, by corruption, by the authority of Princes, is not to be the Vicar of Christ and successour of the Apostles, but is a theefe, and the Vicar of <hi>Iudas Iscariot,</hi> and of <hi>Symon Magus:</hi> what case are then the Popes in, that have come into the Church by all these wayes, and also by the Divels helpe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the example of <hi>Syluester</hi> the second? They take vpon them to keepe the keyes of heaven, but they shut vp the way thither, that neither themselues will enter in, nor suffer others: they procure wars: they vexe Princes, and trouble the people: they excite the subiects against their naturall Princes, the Prince against his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. When <hi>Otho</hi> the 4. and <hi>Fredericke</hi> the 2. were in <note place="margin">One thing preached, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther practised.</note> contention for the Empire, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it vnder hand: yet notwithstanding he made a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cloquent Oration of the vnity &amp; concord that ought

And if felicitie can not easily be found in temporall principality, how much more hard it is to be found in their estate that challenge Empire over all Monarkes and Kings, and supremacie over all spirituall functions: so as they take vpon them authority over body and soule? which estate and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, being by their vsurpations exalted above all other estates of life, and so far beyond the imbecillity of mans nature to beare with that moderation it ought (so as such men as were of good condition before, being once made Popes, many of them become the most wicked of all others) hardly will felicity be found in their estate: for besides that the Popes have beene Atheists, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,

The Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the third (saith he) used often to goe to pray in the Church of S. <hi>Mary,</hi> in Mount Aventin. <hi>Hildebrand</hi> having by spiall watched all his doings, caused the place where the Emperor used to pray, to be marked, and hired one with promise of money, to lay secretly great stones vpon a beame of the Church, so as he might let them fall directly upon the Emperours head as he was praying, and knocke out his brains: which thing when this wicked fellow made haste to accomplish, as he was about to place a stone of great weight upon a beame, the stone by his weight drew the fellow to him, &amp; breaking the thin boords that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the beame, both the stone &amp; he (by the judgement of God) fell downe to the pavement of the Church, &amp; with the same he was crushed to death: which thing being knowne to the Romanes, they tyed a rope to his feete, and drew him three daies together thorow the streetes.

The same <hi>Bernard</hi> detesting their pompe and couetousnesse, called them Antichrists; and saith thus: The offices of dignity of holy Church are translated into filthy gaine, and the workes of darknesse: it remaineth that the man of sinne be revealed, the sonne of perdition, a spirit not onely of the day, but also of noone-light, that is not onely transformed into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light; but is also advanced aboue all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God, or that is worshipped.

what they say. To contract matrimony with a woman (saith he) is a thing very easie, but to sustaine it to the end, is a thing very difficult. For those that marry without any other respect, but onely for loue, leade their life afterward with sorrow: But this sauoureth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Spanish humour. For God neuer fayleth to blesse them with sufficient, that ioyne themselues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and liue in his seruice and feare. If thou marry a rich wife, she will be proud, and shee will esteeme thee rather as her slaue, then her husband, and it may happen thee to be ashamed of her kindred: if shee be poore, she will be contemned, and thy selfe the lesse esteemed: if she be foule and euill-fauoured, thou canst not loue her: if she be faire, thou wilt be iealous of her, and in danger to fall into an vnnaturall metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.

The husband sighing againe, I would (quoth he) giue halfe my land that I were as certenly assured that this boy were mine, as he is known to you to be yours. There shall not need (said the wife, keeping her countenance with great sobrietie) so great a price, only giue mee an hundred acres of medow wherewith to feed my cattell, and I will put you out of doubt of this matter: and when he had told her it was vnpossible, yet they agreed to call in certaine Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen to heare the bargaine, which in their presence being agreed vpon, shee holding the boy in her armes, said vnto her husband, Is this boy in very deed mine?

Certaine souldiers that were vnder the Lieutenant of the Emperour <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Anthonius,</hi> being in Seleucia, went into the Church of <hi>Apollo,</hi> where they opened a coffer, thinking to find some great treasure, but the contagious aire that came forth of it, first destroyed a great part of the people of Babylon: then it entred into Greece, and from thence to Rome, whereof ensued such a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that it destroyed a third part of the people. In France there was such a disease at Aix, that the people

would die eating and drinking; many would fall into a frenzie and drowne themselues in welles; others would cast themselues out of their windowes, and breake their neckes: The mortalitie growing of this disease was so great, that there was no roome in the Church-yards to <note place="margin">Miserable mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</note> bury the dead: and many finding themselues infected with this disease, being out of all hope of recouery, would presently sow themselues in sheetes, looking when death would come to separate the soule from the body.

These mice in great heapes assaulted him, his wife and children, as they sate feasting, and neuer left gnawing vpon them day and night, though his guard

and souldiers did all they could to driue them away; great fires were made, and the King, his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren placed in the middest: yet notwithstanding the Mice ran thorow the fire, and fell to their gnawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: Then they went into a ship, and prooued what the water would doe: the Mice followed them, and gnawing continually vpon the Ship, the Mariners see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues in danger of drowning, the water com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in at the holes which the Mice made, brought the Ship to land, where another companie of Mice ioyned with these, and molested them more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: when his followers saw these things, perceiuing it to be the Iudgement of God, they all fled. The King seeing himselfe left alone, and those departed that should defend him, he went vp into an high tower; but the Mice climbed vp and deuoured him, his wife, and two sonnes. By which it appeareth, that there is no policie nor power to be vsed against God. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Arnolphus</hi> was likewise eaten vp with Lice, his <note place="margin">

But God left not so great a crueltie vnreuenged: for he made Mice assault him in great heapes, which neuer left gnawing vpon him night nor day: he fled into a Tower which was in the midst of the Riu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="459" facs="tcp:896:240"/>
execute the iust Iudgement of God, and deuoured him. The like happened to a Bishop of Strasbrough, who was also deuoured with mice. When <hi>Harold</hi> King of Denmarke made warre vpon <hi>Harquinus,</hi> and was ready to ioyne battell, there was a dart seene in the aire flying this way, and that way, as though it sought vpon whom to light. And when all men stood wondering what would become of this strange matter, euery man fearing himselfe; at last the dart fell vpon <hi>Harquinus</hi> head and <note place="margin">A prodigious accident.</note> slew him. An Italian Gentleman being vniustly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die (as it was thought) by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fift, at the request of <hi>Philip</hi> the faire King of France, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them both out of a window, speaketh to them aloud in this sort: Thou cruell <hi>Clement,</hi> for as much as there is no iudge in the world, before whom a man may appeale from that vniust sentence, which thou hast pronounced against me; I appeale from thee as from an vniust Iudge, to the iust Iudge Iesus Christ, before whom I summon thee; and likewise thee King <hi>Philip</hi> (at whose suite thou hast giuen iudgement of death vpon me) within one yeere to appeare before the Tribunall seat of God, where I shall plead my cause, which shall be determined without couetousnesse, or any other passion, as yee haue done. It chanced that about the end of the time by him prefixed, both the Pope and the King dyed. The like <note place="margin">Gods great Iustice.</note> happened to <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the fourth King of Castile; who puttìng to death two knights rather through anger then iustice, whose fauour could not be obtained nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Strange exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Gods Iustice.</note> by weeping and lamenting, nor by any petitions, they summoned the King to appeare before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall seat of Christ within thirtie daies; the last of which the King died. A Captaine likewise of the Gallies of the Genowayes tooke a vessell, the Captaine whereof neuer
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:896:241"/>
did harme to the Genowayes, yet for the hatred that the Captaine of the Genowayes did beare to his Nation, he commanded him to be hanged: And when no petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nor prayers would be heard, nor excuses allowed, nor any mercy would be found, hee said to this cruell Captaine, that he did appeale to God that punisheth the vniust: and summoned him to appeare at a certaine day appointed, to render account before God of the wrong he had done him: the very same day that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the Captain of the Genowayes dyed, &amp; of like went to yeeld his account.

This man being rich, intending to depriue his master, and to occupie his place, suborned two wicked Cardinals, with a great summe of money, to fauour his practice: when he came to answer for his master, hee confessed how much bound he was to him, yet he was more bound to God, and to the truth, then to men; and said, that the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions laid against the Bishop, were true: By meanes whereof the Pope sent the two corrupted Cardinals to heate &amp; determine the Bishops cause: when they came into Germanie, they sent for the Archbishop, and vpon hearing of his cause, depriued him of his dignities, and
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:896:241"/>
placed <hi>Arnand</hi> in his roome. The Bishop being present at the sentence; God knoweth (said he) that I am vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned, yet I will not appeale here from your sentence, because I know that ye shall sooner be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in your lying, then I in speaking the truth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I receiue this iudgement for my sinnes: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I appeale from your sentence to the eternall Iudge, which is Christ, before whom I summon you. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals fell into a laughing, and mocking him, said, That if he would go before, they would follow: it happened that the Bishop hauing withdrawne himselfe within a Monastery, dyed within a yeere and a halfe after: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when the Cardinals heard, they were in a great iolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and in a scoffing manner said one to another, that they must goe seeke the Archbishop.

that should offend God; which words were no sooner out of his mouth, but he fell downe speechlesse, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing a few houres, he dyed in the same place: which argueth the miserable condition of men, that a mightie King, when he least thought vpon death, and had many goodly houses and buildings, ended his life suddenly in the most vile and filthy place of all his Castle, where men vsed to make water.

               <p>It is no lesse strange to consider of the miserable end of men by two contrary passions; sudden sorrow and ioy. <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> hauing the gouernment of the kingdome of Castile, in the nonage of the young King their Nephew, made warres vpon the Moores <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

was faine to send to <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to returne to his aide. Hee hastening to assist <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> could by no meanes make his souldiers follow him: and drawing his sword to strike some of them, thinking therby to make the rest more obedient, he was so troubled to see he could not helpe <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> that he fell downe dead from his Horse: which when <hi>Don Iohn</hi> heard, that was valiantly fighting with the Moores, he conceiued such griefe, that he fell downe speechlesse, his strength fayling, and dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little while after. <hi>Herennius</hi> a Sicilian, as he was led to prison for being partaker of a conspiracy, was so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed through feare of the future Iudgement, that he fell downe dead at the entry into the prison. <hi>Plantius</hi> looking vpon his dead wife, cast himselfe vpon her dead body, and with very sorrow dyed.

This is no lesse strange, that ioy hath <note place="margin">The strange effects of ioy.</note> wrought the same effect: and such as sorrow could not kill, sudden ioy hath dispatched. A woman hearing of a great slaughter of the Romanes, by their ouerthrow at the battell of Thrasymeno, where her sonne serued as a souldier, meeting him at the gate vnlooked for, fell downe dead in his armes, as shee was embracing him. Another woman, hearing a false report, and beleeuing that her sonne was dead, as soone as she saw him, dyed presently. <hi>Philemon</hi> had certaine figs gathered for him, and being set within his sight, an Asse came to them and began to eate: he willed a Boy to drine away the Asse, who went so slowly, that he had eaten all the figs before the Boy came.

               <p>But that the miserable conditions of men may be seene, as well by the strangenesse of their death, as by the infinite troubles of their life, we will alleage a few examples more (for to prosecute it at the full, would containe a great volume) of the seueritie or crueltie that hath beene vsed in a strange sort. The Transiluanians <note place="margin">Barbarous cruelties.</note> hauing taken certaine Rebels with their Captaine, made them fast three dayes, and then made them eate their Captaine halfe roasted, and afterward his bowels sod, before they put them to death. There were sixe men for some notorious fact condemned &amp; iudged to this death; they were set aliue into the ground, all sauing their head aboue, in front three against three, and face to face; and there continued in that sort, vntill they miserably ended their liues. An Italian Gentleman hauing the vpper hand of his enemie, who vpon his knees asked for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, willed him to deny God; which when the other had done in hope of life, he thrust his sword thorow him, saying; I will now kill thee body and soule.

Then he concludeth; In the end of my reckoning, I haue found that he which was yesterday <note place="margin">Necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.</note> rich, is to day poore: hee that was yesterday whole, is to day sicke: he that yesterday laughed, to day I haue seene him weepe: he that was yesterday in prosperitie, to day I haue seene him in aduersitie: he that yesterday liued, I haue seene him by and by in his graue. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> entring deepely into the consideration of the miserable condition of men, and wondering at their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicitie, maketh thus his complaint to God: Lord, after men haue suffered so many euill things, mercilesse death followeth, and carrieth them away in diuers manners: some it oppresseth by feauers, others by extreme griefe; some by hunger, others by thirst; some by fire, others by water; some by the sword, others by poyson; some tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough feare, others are stifled; some are torne in pieces by the teeth of wild beasts; others are peckt with the fowles of the ayre; some are made meat for the fishes, others for wormes: and yet man knoweth not his end. And when hee goeth about to aspire higher, hee falleth downe and perisheth: And this is the most

apply their opinion to the words and meaning of the authoritie they alleage, they will wrest and apply the words to their opinion: So let vs vse some force to the word, and wrest it from his proper significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and apply it to the matter, and call that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of life, Felicitie, which a man hath possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to attaine; and set downe such a felicitie as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the condition of men, and as hath beene and is enioyed of some.

And though it happen but to few, to enioy this felicitie in the highest degree, yet in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing their labour with hope fully to possesse the same, they shall come neere it, and flye further from those things, which by mistaking haue brought many to infelicitie.

The <note place="margin">The best reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for sorrow.</note> best way to auoyd the occasion of sadnesse, is to liue well: but to be sorrowfull before there be cause, and to feare euill things to come, before they happen, is meere foolishnesse.

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:896:246"/>
were laide together in a heape, and euery man should take away a part, there is none but would thinke, that his owne euils were lesse then that portion which he did beare. And in truth a man shall sometimes receiue more comfort in sadnesse of them that be in calamitie, then of them that be merry: For if he consider and compare his owne euils with those of others, he shall finde that to be little which he suffereth, in respect of that which others endure. And nothing bringeth grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sorrow to the minde, then the losse of the thing dearely loued: and though many men winne opinion of wisedome; because they seeme not to be greeued with the lacke or losse of that for the which we see others tormented with great sorrow and anguish of minde; yet if the same men were touched with any thing that they did strongly affect, we should see that humane wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were not able to make sufficient resistance. For in such cases our affections and reasons contend toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and if reason be stronger in vs then the affection that moueth the minde, reason preuaileth and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the other: But if the affection be stronger then his reason, then it preuaileth, and reason yeeldeth. And the more neere they be in equality, the more vehemently they contend together, and the longer endureth the conflict, before the victory bee wonne: like as two wrestlers, the stronger ouerthroweth the <note place="margin">A Simile.</note> weaker, except he be assisted by skill: So naturally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth it betweene affections and reason, or wisedome; affections being the stronger, if the minde moued be stricken in the right vaine, and doth commonly make reason giue place, except it be assisted with Gods grace aboue our owne strength. It is a hard matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine <note place="margin">Arist.</note> from pleasures that delight and tickle the senses,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:896:247"/>
yet it is more hard to resist and endure things painefull and grieuous. But we must contend neuerthelesse, and endeauour with our reason and wisedome, against our vnruly affections, and call to God for the assistance of his holy Spirit. For to what purpose serueth our wisedome, our learning, our knowledge and experience, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the ordinary course of worldly matters, if we apply not the same to our owne benefit? As the Poet saith:
<q>
                     <l>Quid iuuat humanos, scire atque euoluere casus,</l>
                     <l>Si fugienda facis, &amp; facienda fugis?</l>
                     <l>What bootes it humane things to know,</l>
                     <l>Or after them Inquire.</l>
                     <l>If what's not to be done, we doe,</l>
                     <l>And: To be done, forbeare.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But seeing that by the fall of our first Parents wee are drowned in sinne and iniquitie, and our nature is so corrupted, that we can doe nothing of our selues, not deserue any thing that is good, nor haue any meanes to escape the torments of the life to come, and the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of this present life, which is extreme miserie, nor enioy the pleasures of the heauenly life, nor the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vacancie of trouble in this life, without Gods especiall grace and free gift, through the merits of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ our Redeemer; we must confesse and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that both the felicity we seeke for in this life, and the beatitude and <hi>Summum bonum</hi> in the life to <note place="margin">All felicity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon God.</note> come, dependeth wholly vpon God, and commeth from him: so that we may call the Felicity of this world, the contentation of a faithfull minde in a godly life and death, which commeth by the enioying of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and graces. And although all good things that can happen to vs come from God, yet we must bestow
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:896:247"/>
our endeuour, and vse those meanes which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs, to make our selues capable of them, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to the attaining of a happie life.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that our endeuour and labour is requisite to felicitie, let vs see how and to what end wee ought to bestow the same, that we may enioy it. There are two sorts of ends, some are precedent, some subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, some the last ends, to which when we haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, wee rest setled and contented, and proceede no further: others are degrees to the last ends. As for example. A Merchant buildeth a ship to the end to saile <note place="margin">A comparison.</note> ouer the Sea to such a Port, to transport his Wares; hee transporteth his wares to sell them, to make money to buy other commodities; that he doth to sell them to his gaine: this he doth to gather riches; hee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth riches to build houses, or to buy land, or to liue in pleasure, or to winne honour and reputation, or such like: and thus being come to the last end of his labour, for which all the rest were vndertaken, hee resteth set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and seeketh no further. Euen so all mens desires and labours are addressed from one end to another, hoping at last for a contented and happie life. But because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnderstand not wherein felicitie consisteth, nor the way to it; others take the instruments for the thing it selfe: few attaine to the end of their desires. First therefore, when we know what the felicitie is to which we may attaine, wee must submit our selues to the will and pleasure of God, from whom all good things doe proceed, and with all humilitie desire him to blesse our labours, and bestow vpon vs those his benefits and graces (with condition neuerthelesse, if it be his will, for he onely knoweth what is best for vs) that are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to happinesse of life. Then wee must set before our
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:896:248"/>
eyes Felicity as a marke, to which wee must direct the course of our life; wherein we must haue a continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the true felicity and beatitude, or <hi>Summum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of men; that is, to glorifie and magnifie God in this life, as hath beene said, which is his last end and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per action, whereunto is ioyned the ioyes of heauen in the life to come, without which our life here is meere infelicity, how pleasing so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>uer it be. To this end, which is our proper action and true felicity, we must alwaies haue a speciall regard: For in euery nature, the end must be common to all of that kinde. But that we commonly <note place="margin">Earthly felicity is only in name</note> call felicity or happinesse in this life, is rather so by name then indeed: for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s life is but a pilgrimage and way to that common end and true felicity of men, which through their owne faults, some ouercome with great troubles and labour (as they that) not knowing the right way, or not willing to follow it, passe ouer mountaines and rockes with much wearinesse; others, better aduised, that follow the right path, walke quietly, as in a plaine smooth ground, and come to the end of their iourney without any great paines: and therein resteth our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, to make choise (as much as in vs lyeth) of the smooth way, and auoide the rough and stonie passage, that we may come to the end of our iourney with lesse trouble and vnquietnesse. But let vs see what manner of felicity or happinesse that is, which dependeth vpon Gods benefits and graces, and may be enioyed in this life; and how farre those graces must extend to make vs happy.</p>
               <p>Seeing this felicity commeth from God, the author of all good things, and goodnesse it selfe, and is so much desired of all men, it must needs be some one good thing, or many, wherein it doth consist. And for as much as it
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:896:248"/>
concerneth both the body and soule or mind (things of a contrary condition) it must be more then one thing. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, Of euill things a little will doe a great deale of harme: but to doe a little good, requireth a great many, or a great quantity of good things. So we may say of this matter, That to bring forth such an effect as is fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity (the greatest good thing that happeneth to men in this world) many good things are requisite. The things (after <hi>Gueuarra</hi>) that cannot be bought with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <note place="margin">4. Things not to be bought with gold.</note> nor can admit comparison with any other things, are, the Liberty we haue, the Knowledge we learne, the Health we inioy, and the Vertue for the which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue commendation: for Libertie lighteth the heart; Knowledge enricheth the vnderstanding, Health preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth our life; and Vertue is the glory of the soule: All which are so much the more precious, as they are the true figures and fore-runners of Gods grace, to such as it pleaseth him to esteeme and choose. Let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine some of the good things which God hath diuersly <note place="margin">Sundry bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings bestowed by God vpon man.</note> distributed among men: to some he hath giuen a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall health &amp; liberty of body: to others he hath giuen a light heart, &amp; merry disposition of mind: to some, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to this or that vertue: to others, a contempt of worldly riches and honours: to some, a quiet mind and void of perturbations and passions: to others, iudgement to discerne betweene things good in shew, and those that be good in deed: to some, an inclination or apt disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make choise of the one, and refuse the other: to others, a quiet life void of troubles: to some, patience to beare afflictions and crosses if any happen, so as they seeme to verifie the Poets saying;
<q>
                     <l>—Gaudet patientia duris:</l>
                     <l>Patience endures aduersity.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="476" facs="tcp:896:249"/>
To others he hath giuen a competent portion and sufficiency of worldly wealth to maintaine their estate, and to serue their necessary vse, &amp; such other like things. Now if all these good things did concurre together in one man, with the remission of his sinnes, which is the greatest good that can be inioyed in this world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which beatitude cannot be obtained, who would deny him to be happy? For he in whom these things do meete together, liueth a pleasant and contented life, and maketh a godly and quiet end: and whoto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>uer leadeth continually a contented life, and dyeth in the sauour of God, he is in perfect felicity. But many that liue quietly, seeme to liue contentedly, when indeed if their minds <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient life. No man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his estate.</note> were knowne, they may be said rather to liue patiently; because they want the meanes to haue that they would, they seeme content with that they haue. This fault is common to all men, that euery one liketh another mans estate better then his owne, as the Poet wisely noteth when he asketh this question:

                     <l>But still in others praise the contrary?</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But he that liueth contentedly, desireth no more then that he hath, nor would exchange his estate with any

man: but whether any such man may be found in this vale of miserie, whose pleasing and contented life is not interrupted with some displeasures &amp; ouerthwart acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, may greatly be doubted. <hi>Homer</hi> duly considering the miseries of this life, and the instability of humane matters, fained that there were two vessels at the entry of the great Olympus, the one being full of honey; the other full of gall; of which two mingled together, <hi>Iupiter</hi> causeth all men to drinke. Whereby his meaning is to giue vs to vnderstand, that there is no life so sweete or pleasant, but hath in it some bitternesse: which agreeth with his opinion that saith, God doth mingle bitternesse with worldly felicity, that we might seeke another feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in whose sweetnesse there is no deceit. And <hi>Plutark</hi> saith, Men can neuer simply and sincerely enioy the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse of any great prosperity: but whether it be For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or the enuie of destiny, or else the naturall necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of worldly things, their quietnesse is alwaies during their life intermingled with euill among the good; yea and that which is worst, the euill surmounteth the good: for this life hath in it much aloes, but very little honey. The consideration whereof mooued <hi>Philip</hi> King of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon, <note place="margin">An excellent with of <hi>Philip</hi> King of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</note> when he had three messengers brought him good newes at one time, two of victories, the third of the birth of his sonne, to desire the gods that they would mitigate the enuie of Fortune, with the moderation of some meane chance, because he knew that some sorrow would alwayes follow good tydings.</p>
               <p>The instability and vncertainty of worldly prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, moued <hi>Amasis</hi> King of Egypt to giue this counsell to <hi>Policrates</hi> King of Samos. This <hi>Policrates</hi> in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was so fortunate, and liued continually in such pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, that <hi>Amasis,</hi> with whom he was ioyned in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:896:250"/>
league of friendship, fearing some great euill hap, according to the ordinary course of this world, to hang ouer his head, wrote thus vnto him: <hi>Amasis</hi> saith thus to <hi>Policrates;</hi> It pleaseth me well to heare that all things fall out so happily with my friend, yet your great pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity liketh me not, knowing how enuious a name it is; but for my part, I had rather that both mine owne matters, and also theirs that be deare to me, should some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times go prosperously, sometime otherwise, and to passe my time after the variety of fortune, then in all things to haue good successe. Follow therfore my counsell, and <note place="margin">Good counsell of a friend.</note> doe thus against prosperity: Consider with your selfe what thing ye haue that ye most esteeme, and which being lost, would most grieue you; which when ye haue found, cast it away, so as it may neuer come to the hands of men againe: and if then there shall be no alteration in your good fortune, temper it sometime in this sort as I haue told you. When <hi>Policrates</hi> had read this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he determined to follow his friends counsell; and examining with himselfe what thing he had, that of all other was most deare to him, &amp; which being lost would most grieue him, he found that the same was a Ring of great value, which he had in very great estimation: he putteth this ring vpon his finger, and goeth into a ship, and after he was in the middest of the sea, he let his ring fal as though it were vnawares, thinking in that sort craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to beguile fortune, and returned home againe sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull (as it seemed) for his great losse. After fiue or sixe dayes, it chanced a fisher to take a great fish, which for the rarenesse of him he presented to <hi>Policrates:</hi> and <note place="margin">A strange chance.</note> as the fish was opened to be dressed, the ring was found in his belly, and brought to the King: Which when <hi>Amasis</hi> vnderstood, perceiuing that it was not possible
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:896:250"/>
for one man to diuert from another the euill destiny that hangeth ouer him, nor that <hi>Policrates</hi> could haue any good end, whom Fortune had so exceedingly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured all his life, he sent a Herald to <hi>Samos</hi> to signifie to him, that he would breake the league of friendship with him, lest <hi>Policrates</hi> falling into some great misfortune, which he feared, might be to him the cause of sorrow and griefe, being his friend. It chanced not long after, that <hi>Policrates</hi> made warre vpon the Persians, by whom he was taken and depriued of his kingdome, and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hanged vpon the top of an high hill: this misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Fortunes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie.</note> end followed his great and long prosperitie. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example of the instabilitie of mans estate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he seemed to be strongly drawne by an ineuitable destinie for no intreatie of his friends, nor cuill signes and tokens going before, neither the dreame of his daughter that presaged his vnfortunate successe, could disswade him from that iourney. Shee dreamed that shee saw her father aloft in the aire, and that hee was <note place="margin">An ominous dreame.</note> washed of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and anointed of the Sunne: all which came to passe; for as he hanged in the aire, he was wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with raine that fell from aboue, and was anointed with his owne grease by the heat of the Sun that drew out his sweat. The prosperous life and miserable end of <hi>Policrates,</hi> confirmeth the opinion of <hi>Solon:</hi> that no <note place="margin">No man happy before death.</note> man can be accounted happy before his death: For to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Which agreeth with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that said, We ought to choose the best life, and saue our selues from the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:896:251"/>
blasts of Fortune, as the Galley is safe from the winds in the Sea. That riches in this mortall life are weake An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, glorie weake, and the strong body also feeble. So offices, honours and all such things (saith he) are weake and vnconstant: and the sure and strong Ankers are Wisedome, Magnanimitie, Fortitude and Vertue, which <note place="margin">Foure sure An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</note> cannot bee ouerthrowne with any tempest: all other things hee accounteth foolishnesse, dreames and winde.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore there is no life in this world to be found that is voyd of calamities, but pleasures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are intermingled with sorrow and griefe, ease and quietnesse with paines and troubles, so as no man leadeth continually a contented and pleasing life, but either in the beginning or end of his race, or in the midst thereof hee findeth some alteration, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth something that discontenteth him, and desireth amendment of his estate, wee must bee driuen to seeke felicitie in the midst among troubles and calamities, and call him happie, that feeleth least of those things that doe cause discontentment. And hee that looketh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to liue happily, seemeth to bee ignorant of the one part of nature; for the crying and lamenting of a childe when hee first entereth into this world, doth seeme to presage his painefull life, as a vauntcurrer of his miseries to come: for where is hee that can vaun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, that either in his body hee hath not felt some paine, in his minde some griefe, or hath not suffered losse of his goods, or reproch to his person? These be diseases in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, accidents remedilesse, and alwayes incident vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: euen as there is no Sea without waues, no Warre <note place="margin">A proper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</note> without perill, nor iourney without trauell; so is there no worldly life free from troubles, nor any estate voyd

of incumbrances. So as no man liueth so happily, that hath not something whereof to complaine and be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. <hi>Boetius</hi> saith:

                     <l>—Nihilest ex omni parte beatum:</l>

               </p>
               <p>There is nothing in this world vniuersally blessed or perfect: and therefore that which cannot be auoyded by prudence, nor resisted by fortitude, must bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by patience, after Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> counsell: <hi>Vt exercitatione tolerantiae, sustineantur temporalia, &amp; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur aterna:</hi> that by exercise of bearing, we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure temporall things, and hope for eternall things.</p>
               <p>For as much then as there is such a mixture in this life of good and euill, as the Poet saith,
<q>

               </p>
               <p>That no man can alwayes liue contentedly or happily, but the felicitie we seeke, must be found in him that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth least discontented or vnhappily, let vs see how a man must behaue himselfe (so much as in him lyeth) to enioy this felicitie or happinesse. Though wee cannot flie from cares and troubles so long as we walke in this world, yet we may endeuour our selues to auoyd as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as we may: for much more in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber be the displeasures &amp; griefes we seeke to our selues, then those that are brought to vs by any other meanes. We said before that he vpon whom God bestoweth his graces, by which he liueth contentedly, is happy, and in felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: <note place="margin">Necessary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations.</note> and no man is vnhappie, but he that thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so: neither is any man happie, but hee that so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemeth himselfe. And yet not euery contentment bringeth forth happinesse, but such as is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a certaine manner and measure. For as contentation
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:896:252"/>
consisteth not in the much or little that wee haue, no more doth happinesse consist in that to which general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are inclined. Many by nature, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>uill education, or custome, are so inclined to vice, and strongly addicted to lewd life; that neither reason, nor perswasions, nor terrour of lawes can reforme them: wherewith though they be contented, yet are they farre from happinesse, and may rather be accounted most vnhappie. For in all our actions, and in euery course and trade of life wee must haue alwaies respect to our common and true end, that is, to praise and glorifie God, that we may haue the fruition of the ioyes of the other life; which is our true felicitie and beatitude. And seeing the happinesse wee seeke for in this life seemeth to require contentation, I see not how that happinesse can well be had, except in some measure we enioy the things whereunto we are enclined, that thereof contentment may follow: for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may rather perswade patience, then bring foorth contentment. And therefore wee may affirme, that as they which seeke for contentation by following their vicious appetites and inclinations, in stead of felicitie, finde infelicitie: so they that enioy the things whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are inclined, not being repugnant to vertue and honesty, nor to our common end before recited, haue a great aduantage to the happinesse of this life; which commeth by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentation: For he (saith one) liueth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, that liueth as he will, and will nothing that is euill. Mens minds are diuersly affected according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of their inclinations, which draweth their labours &amp; industry to satisfie their appetite, and to bring them to contentation and happinesse.

So God distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not all his gifts equally to all men; but to some he giueth riches and possessions, others he suffereth to line in lacke and pouertie; some hee afflicteth and punisheth diuers wayes, to others he giueth a quiet and peaceable life, according to his pleasure and the difference of mens dispositions: because he seeth that those benefits and graces, which doe leade men to the happinesse of this life, will be to some an hinderance to the true feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of the heauenly life: and therefore he taketh from them the occasions wherewith they may offend him, and leadeth them in the exercise of such things as stand them most in stead to serue him. For, the Lord (saith <hi>Justin Martyr)</hi> wil not honour his children with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happinesse for a reward of godlinesse: for those things which bee subiect vnto corruption, cannot bee a recompence to good men for their vertue.

chastise vs with sickenesse, or any other way, wee ought to thinke, his meaning is to amend and make vs better: for God for the most part suffereth aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to vse their force against such as are most strong, not to tempt them aboue their power, but through exercise, the better to confirme them.

               <p>Well then, let vs admit that all those good things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoken of, which engender felicitie, meet together in very few or none at all: yet neuerthelesse let vs pray to God to bestow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs so many of them, as it shal please him to thinke meet for vs, and vse our endeuour to passe our time in such felicity as is agreeable with our humane condition; which (as we said before) is improperly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led felicity, or at least with as little infelicitie as may be. But if his pleasure be otherwise, then to beare his crosses patiently, alwayes looking vp to the true felicity. For he that falleth into a ditch, and cryeth, God helpe, without employing those meanes which he hath giuen him for his help, may lie there long before he come forth: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must vse those means which God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. He hath endued vs with reason, to iudge of those things that be subiect to our sences, and as a necessary meanes, by which we should sustaine and gouerne this corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life.

Therefore Gods grace must assist vs, otherwise our

endeuour is nothing: for in this so great imbecillitie of nature, and by the subtill practices of the diuell, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in waite to hinder and peruert our good intents and purposes, our power and forces are very little: so as wee be no otherwise able of our selues to doe those things which are requisite to the attaining of felicitie, then as a body that is made weake with long sicknesse, is able to go; who is by and by weary: and if any chance to thrust him euer so little, he falleth to the ground: so our strength and force is often ouercome with the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of our affections, and often ouerthrowne by the subtiltie of the diuell. Yet neuerthelesse we must not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, nor be discouraged, but vse our indeuour and force, such as it is, and call to God to supply our defects with his grace.</p>

corrupt and vncleane affections, that we may be the better able to see and desire those things which be good indeed, and auoid those things that be good in shew onely: wherein morall vertues are very necessary: for by them our vnruly affections and vnprofitable desires are bridled or suppressed, or at least moderated, which are the chiefe cause of an vnhappy life. They mooue mens desires to pleasures, to riches, to honour and glory, which hath beene shewed before by many examples and sayings of wise men, to be the cause of infelicity; they stirre vp pride, enuy, hatred, malice, desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, feare, and such like perturbations and vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the mind, and will neuer suffer the soule or mind to be in quiet and rest, which is contrary to felicity and a happy life; which consisteth not in fleshly pleasures, nor in the abundance of riches or possessions, nor in principality or power, but in a contented and quiet mind, void of sorrow and feare, which cannot be obtained without Gods speciall grace and gift, and his assistance to our endeauours.</p>
               <p>The counsell which King <hi>Dauid</hi> gaue to his sonne in his death-bed, is meete to be followed of all men: Thou <hi>Salomon</hi> my sonne, know the God of thy father, and serue him with a perfect heart and willing mind: for the Lord searcheth euery mans heart, and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all the thoughts of mens minds. If thou seeke him, thou shalt find him: but if thou forsake him, hee will cast thee off for euer. And <hi>Tobit</hi> gaue this counsell among other things to his sonne: My sonne, set our Lord God alwaies before thine eyes, and let not thy will be set to sinne, or to transgresse the commandements of God: doe vprightly all thy life long, and follow not the wayes of vnrighteousnesse: for if thou deale truly,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:896:255"/>
thy doings shall prosperously succeed to thee, and to all them which liue iustly. Blesse thy Lord God alway, and desire of him that thy wayes may be made straight, and that all thy counsels and purposes may prosper.</p>
               <p>And if thou desire to know whether thou be happy <note place="margin">To examine our selues.</note> or not, examine thy selfe whether thou be glad, merrily disposed, of a quiet conscience, without feare of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and content with thine estate: whether thou be neuer pensiue or melancholike, for the lacke or losse of any worldly thing: whether no hope in gaping for any thing to come troubleth thy mind; whether day and night thy mind be pleased, and in one estate. If these things be so, thou art come very neere to the felicity that a man can enioy in this life. But if thou desire or thinke to find happinesse in pleasures, riches, or honour, thou art as farre from felicitie, as from the true ioy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation thou seekest: for these things after which thou huntest, as though they would bring thee gladnesse and contentation, are rather the causes of sorrow and griefe. Euery man seeketh after the things that should make him ioyfull and content: but where to finde that ioy <note place="margin">The wrong way</note> which is certaine and constant, they know not. Some seeke it in feasting and carowsing, others in ambition and great traines of followers; some in braue attire; others in courting young Damsels: but all these and such like be false and deceiueable pleasures and ioyes, and bring men rather to infelicitie, then vnto happinesse. He that will be happy, must thinke vpon the varietie of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that chance vnto men before he feele them: hee must account of his riches and possessions, of his wife and children, and all other things that be most deare to <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> him, as if he should not alwaies haue them, and as if he should be nothing the more vnhappy, if he should
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:896:255"/>
leaue to haue them For he is in a miserable state, whole mind is vexed with feare of that which may happen, and he is vnhappy before vnhappinesse come, that with feare is carefull, lest the things wherein he delighteth, should not alwayes remaine with him: for that man shall neuer be quiet; and by looking for that is to come, he shall lose the pleasure he might take in the things present. Prouidence must foresee, and wisedome preuent the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils that may happen: and not to follow the common manner of men: then to iudge when they begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: for nothing is more miserable nor foolish then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <note place="margin">The vanity of feare.</note> to feare: and what a madnesse is it for a man to run before, or accelerate his owne euill? He is more sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull then is necessary, that is sorrowfull, before there be necessity. But all these things will not bring thee to happinesse, except thou direct them to the true felicity and beatitude, and end of man; that is, Gods seruice and thy soules health. And therefore thou must yet exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the matter further: how thou dost vse honour and riches, and beare pouerty and contempt; how thou carriest thy selfe in health and sicknesse, in prosperity and aduersity; how thou vsest thy selfe hauing much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or little: for all these things be Gods creatures and gifts, made to our vse: which if thou vse as thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and carriest an indifferent hand vpon them, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest no more nor no lesse of these and the like things then is necessary to the attaining of our end and felicity, then art thou in the right path that leadeth to the same: but if thou desire or seeke, loue or vse these creatures to any other end then for this, thou runnest astray, and art out of the way that should bring thee to that end and happinesse.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that the fountaine of our happinesse of
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:896:256"/>
life, in a great part is within vs, and proceedeth of a contented and quiet mind, that is, by a moderation of our affections, which is brought to passe by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of vertue: let vs labour to make our selues vertuous, and cleanse our mindes of all manner of perturbations, that we may the sooner come to that happinesse of life we desire. Euen as a field (though the ground be fertill) <note place="margin">Simile.</note> without manuring and tillage, will not be fruitfull; so the mind (though well inclined) without exercise of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and learning, will grow dull and sluggish, and as it were, gather rust. <hi>Diogenes</hi> walking on a time thorow the streete in Athens, wherein were placed diuers ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of such ancient men as had best deserued of the Common-wealth, asked almes of them one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the cause being demanded; I learne (quoth he) to take deniall patiently: so should we practise to master and command our affections, and inordinate desires of fleshly pleasures, and patiently to take deniall of riches, reputation, worldly pompe and vanities, which allute and deceiue men by the like meanes, as they that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a bitter drinke for a child, anoint the cuppe with hony, that the poore infant may by the sweetnesse of the one, the lesse perceiue the bitternesse of the other: and as the drugges that are tempered with vnwholsome and venimous hearbs, haue written aboue, A medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for such a disease, that the poyson may be nothing suspected of him that readeth the superscription. So the worldly vanities we haue in such estimation, allure and deceiue vs, with a faire, but a false shew of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. All men desire one thing, that is, a happy life; but because they take the instruments for the thing it selfe, and follow not the right way; the more they labour to come to it, the further they goe from it.
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:896:256"/>
For whereas Felicitie requireth a quiet and contented <note place="margin">The benefit of a quiet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented mind.</note> mind with that which is sufficient, men heape to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues causes of worldly cares and troubles, leauing the plaine straight way, to goe ouer hilles and mountaines: to whom it happeneth as it doth to trauellers, that being once set out of the right way, the further they wander, the more they goe astray. Euery man complaineth of the troubles of this life, and yet no man is contented with quietnesse: wherein they resemble foolish sea-men, that when they should flie from the sea to the land, they runne from the land to the sea. And nothing seemeth to mee more to resemble the variable accidents of this worldly life, then that of sea-faring men, that are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tossed vp and downe with tempestuous weather, sometimes swallowed vp with the Sea; otherwhile sayle in a faire calme; sometime lie at anker in a safe harborough; sometimes aduanced to great riches; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time vndone, or cast into great pouerty. <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> saith; He that will liue happily, must propound to himselfe things possible, and be content with things present.</p>
               <p>That which bringeth forth contentation, is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of things: this sufficiency is measured either by the necessitie of nature, or by the opinion of men. The <note place="margin">Things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to nature.</note> things that are necessary to nature, are health of bodie, and libertie, and to be defended from hunger, thirst, and cold. These be the things that nature requireth; the rest are superfluous, and not necessary to contentment or happinesse. Why doest thou embrace (saith <hi>Boetius</hi>) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne good things for thine owne? Doest thou thinke that fortune will make these thingsthine, which Nature hath made nothing appertaining to thee? The sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of things by the opinion of men are, diuersitie of
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:896:257"/>
pleasures; abundance of riches and possessions; honour and glory; pompe and principality. The election or choise of these things helpeth to make the life happy or vnhappy. But although the things which nature requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, are sufficient to bring forth contentation: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, to liue according to the law of nature onely, is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and not meete for them that know ciuility, which is to be preferred before the other; let vs see what is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in a ciuill life to make contentment. To liue in pleasures, is rather beastly then agreeable with huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and as hath beene said before, hath beene the destruction of them that haue beene addicted to them: for the more a man giueth himselfe to pleasures, the more he subiecteth himselfe to vices: and as the Poet saith:
<q>
                     <l>Delicias mundi fragiles, qui mente sequetur,</l>
                     <l>Perdidit aterni certissima gaudi coeli.</l>
                     <l>Who the fraile pleasures</l>
                     <l>Of the world will choose:</l>
                     <l>The certaine Ioyes of Heauen</l>
                     <l>Are sure to lose.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And yet honest pleasures or rather delights, (for by this name I would distinguish betweene the pleasures of the flesh, and those of the minde) for recreation and <note place="margin">A limitation for pleasures.</note> healths sake, ioyned with sobriety and modestie, are not denied a Christian, nor any hinderance, but rather a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance to felicity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristippus</hi> saith, That man moderateth pleasure, not which abstaineth vtterly from it, but which vseth it in such sort as he is not carried away with it; as we gouerne a ship or a horse, when we leade them whither we list.</p>
               <p>The immoderate desire of riches (as appeareth by that which hath bin said) hath beene the ouerthrow and
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:896:257"/>
confusion of many, and cryed out vpon, not only by the Philosophers, as a most pestiferous passion, but also by the Prophets and holy Fathers, and by Christ himselfe, with sharpe and bitter threatnings of extreme miserie to those that possesse them. For he is not in the right path that leadeth to happinesse, who runneth after the goods of the world, but he that flyeth from the vices of the world: and nothing bringeth more care and vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of minde, then the loue of riches; which is neuer <note place="margin">Auarice neuer satisfied.</note> satisfied with that he hath, but alwayes desireth more, and therefore neuer contented. For liberty of the mind, and care of worldly goods, will neuer agree together: and yet riches well gotten, and well spent, is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the blessing of God; and may be a furtherance to felicity, as one saith:
<q>
                     <l>Eaelix opes qui cum sapientia tenet.</l>
                     <l>Happy is he that inioyes</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But as it is now commonly gotten and vsed, it may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taken for the blessing of the diuell. Rich men, for the most part, are said to haue riches, as men are said to haue an ague; when indeed an ague hath them: And so riches possesseth them, and not they their riches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slaues many times to that should serue their vse.

If thou content thy selfe with that which is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to serue thy necessity, thou canst neuer be poore: but if thou goe about to satisfie thy couetous desires, thou canst neuer be rich.

to God, to whom he hath giuen wisedome and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted mind, then for that he made him rich. Vnto whom soeuer God giueth riches (saith the <hi>Preacher</hi>) goods, and power, he giueth it him to enioy it, to take it for his portion, and to be refreshed of his labour: this is now the gift of God. <hi>Seneca</hi> aduiseth, lest fortune should find vs vnprouided, to make pouerty familiar to vs. He shall be rich with more security, who knoweth that it is not painefull to be poore. For he that agreeth well with <note place="margin">A riches in pouerty.</note> pouerty, is rich; because nature desireth but a little; but opinion would haue without measure, and a man may be poore in the middest of great riches. And so much the more excellent is honest pouerty, then hatefull co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, by how much the poore man is contented with little, where, to the rich man, a great deale seemes nothing: for he is not rich that possesseth much goods, <note place="margin">A pouerty in riches.</note> but he whose desires are satisfied, and his mind content with a little. And what a madnesse is it to seeke to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change contentment for care, mirth for sorrow, liberty for bondage, pleasure for paine, and watching for slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? It is giuen for a penance to ambitious and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men, neuer to content themselues with enough, nor yet with too much. <hi>Seneca</hi> speaking of the measure of riches, saith; <hi>Primus modus habere quod necesse est, prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus quod sat est.</hi> The first is to haue so much as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, the next, that which is sufficient.

And if couetous men knew, what a sweete thing liberality is, they would turne their desires to gain much, into a disposition to giue more: as the Poet saith:

For where vices haue had long continuance, there death onely must plucke vp the rootes. He taketh no pleasure but in casting his rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenings, in telling his money, in selling his wares, and in multiplying his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities: esteeming it as a Paradise to be alwayes gaining, and neuer spending; to be alwayes winning, and neuer losing; to be alwayes receiuing, and neuer lending; and to be alwayes getting, as though he should neuer die. And if he haue two keyes to his chest to keepe money from stealing, he suffereth ten cares in his heart, to keepe him from spending. <hi>Crescentem se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur cura pecuniam.</hi> So that the care being great to keepe, and the griefe no lesse to lose; men should bee aduised how they beginne to get, since to saue a little of their wealth, they hazzard much of their honour: for gaine and getting are but weake pillers to vphold a good name: because couetousnesse and honour are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues contrary, and cannot agree together in one man. And although he haue great riches and possessions, yet in his own conceit he lacketh so much, as he seeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe aduanced by another that hath more. It is paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to many, to see a few aboue them; because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider not how many be beneath them. Riches is neither good nor euill of it selfe, but by relation, according to the vse or abuse of it. Neither do riches hurt the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour, <note place="margin">Riches in themselues neither good nor euill.</note> if he vse them well; nor neede maketh a poore man commendable. And therefore saith Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:896:260"/>
Let rich men learne, that there is no fault in riches and possessions, but in them that know not how to vse them. For as to the wicked riches is a hinderance, so to the good it is a furtherance to vertue. For what profiteth it thee (saith <hi>Augustine</hi>) to haue a chest full of goods, if thy conscience be empty? Thou wilt haue goods, and thou wilt not be good thy selfe: Thou oughtest to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of thy goods, if thy house be full of goods, and haue of thee an euill master. And <hi>Ecclesiisiicus,</hi> What profiteth it a foole to haue riches, seeing he cannot buy wisedome? For a guilt saddle and bridle maketh a horse nothing the better. And this is commonly seene in these <note place="margin">Similies.</note> dayes, that whom fortune raiseth a foote in riches and reputation, hee lifteth vp himselfe a yard in pride and couetousnesse. By which sayings, it appeareth, that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches neither couetously gotten, nor niggardly hoorded, nor vainely spent; to him that estimateth them with a sound and vpright iudgement, and vseth them as they ought, and to that purpose for which they were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, may be a furtherance to felicity. To this purpose serueth the olde Greeke Poets counsell, <hi>Hesiodus,</hi> made Latin (if I forget not) by Sir <hi>Thomas Moore:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Tanquam iam moriturus, partis vtere rebus,</l>
                     <l>Tanquam victurus, denuò parcetuis.</l>
                     <l>Ille sapit qui perpensis his ritè duobus,</l>
                     <l>Parcus erit certo, munificúsque modo.</l>
                     <l>As at thy death, so liberally giue,</l>
                     <l>Yet therein be, as thou wert long to liue.</l>
                     <l>He shall be held wise that both these can doe,</l>
                     <l>Be equally both free and sparing too.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But the paines men commonly take in getting <note place="margin">No true felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in riches.</note> riches, and the care in keeping them, and the sorrow for losing them, maketh men rather vnhappie then happy

that possesse them. The next way to riches (saith <hi>Sene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>) is by contemning riches: for some man may contemne all things, but no man can haue all things. And yet to possesse riches without feare and care, may be profitable to him that hath them. The on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ly way to doe that, is for a man to perswade himselfe, that hee may liue well without them. Compare the riches thou hast lost, with the cares that be gone with them, and thou mayest call it gaine. It is more easie to depart from the rules of vertue in the state of riches then of pouertie. Hee, whom in abundance (saith <hi>Gregorie</hi>) pride puffeth not vp, nor in necessity defires prouoke, knoweth how to vse plentie, and to suffer penurie. For no man is ouerthrowne with the griefe of aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <note place="margin">Aust.</note> that is not ouertaken with the pleasures of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie. Our fore-fathers (saith one) were so wise, and we so simple, because they laboured not, but to know, and we trauell not, but to haue. <hi>Antist.</hi> said, that riches without vertue yeeld as much pleasure, as a banquet without any body at it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Horace</hi> noting the euill estimation and vse of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, said, it brought all things to passe.

So they that liue in a meane estate, are free from the troubles, cares and dangers, to which high dignities are subiect by their excesse and supeisluities, which allure to vice: and likewise from the feare of penury and want, which tormenteth the poore estate.

And therefore if thou desire to be great, and to make all things subiect to thee, make thy selfe subiect to reason: thou shalt rule much, if reason rule thee. But if such a man as we speak of, be not, or hardly to be found, that is able among so many assaults and afflictions, to which men are subiect, to make sufficient resistance (as without Gods especiall grace, ioyned to his endeuour, it is not possible) yet let vs set such a man before our eyes, in our conceit to giue vs aime, the better to direct our leuell: and though we strike not the marke, yet let vs labour to shoot as neere it as we can.

               <p>The estate of Kings and Princes (in the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <note place="margin">Of Kings and Princes.</note> of the world) is taken to be a most happy estate, but to those that looke into the matter, with a sound and vpright iudgement, many of them seeme to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from felicity, then meaner men; except they vpon whom God bestoweth his graces in greater measure; as vpon some he doth. For as their dignity is high, and their charge great, so are they more subiect to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of fortune, then all other earthly things; and haue many occasions to mooue their affections to sorrow, sometime to anger, sometime to feare, sometime to the inordinate desire of pleasures, and such like passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, more then the inferiour sort hath: and therefore they need a mind strongly fortified with all manner of vertues, and prepared to resist the violent assaults of those vnruly affections and temptations, which hauing once gotten the vpper hand, their felicity is cleane ouerthrowne, as hath beene shewed before by many examples, with the dangerous estate of principality, by the confession of wise and mighty Emperours and Princes themselues.

delights, whereof they see themselues possessed, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and allureth many of them to vice. As the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Emperours which commanded the most flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing common-wealth in the world, after they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to that dignity, many of them grew to be more <note place="margin">Empire maketh men monsters.</note> like monsters then men. The like may be said of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrians, and other Monarchies. But to leaue the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens that knew not God, what was <hi>Saul</hi> before he was <note place="margin">Profitable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations.</note> chosen King? how is his goodnesse exalted in the holy Scripture? whom the Lord himselfe did elect; and yet how soone was his vertue eclypsed? How maruellous was the beginning of <hi>Salomons</hi> raigne? who being drowned in Princes pleasures, gaue himselfe within a little while, a prey to women. Of two and twenty Kings of Iuda, there were not aboue fiue or sixe that continued in their vertue and goodnesse. The like may be found in the Kings of Israel: and there wanteth not examples in Christian kingdomes. And what profiteth it a Prince to be Lord of many Kingdomes, if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come subiect to many vices? Many Princes (saith a Philosopher) beginne well, because their nature is good; and end euill, because no man doth gainesay them; and they commit such follies, because there is great store of flatterers that deceiue them, and great want of true men, that should serue them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Demetrins Phal.</hi> aduised King <hi>Ptolomie</hi> to reade those bookes, in which precepts are giuen to Princes and great States, because those learned men did write those things, which no man dare at any time say to Princes. <hi>Agapet</hi> wrote to <hi>Iustinian,</hi> aduising him that they who had need, might haue easie accesse to him, by reason of his exceeding high estate: that he would open his eares to them that were afflicted with
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:896:274"/>
poverty, that he might find the accesse to God open to him. For a Prince should consider in what degree of dignity he is, and how much he is of God preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, and for what cause, and to what end. The conversation and maners of a good Prince &amp; his court, standeth with his people for so many lawes: for every one frameth himselfe to follow the examples of his Prince and his Court.

A King is Lord of all, but then especially when he over-ruleth himselfe, and becommeth master over the lusts that bring all the world in subjection. That Prince (sayth one) that hath <note place="margin">Who is an happy Prince.</note> his mouth full of truth, his hands open to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, his eares stopped to lyes, and his heart open to mercy, is happy, &amp; the people that hath him fortunate. <hi>Alphonsus</hi> king of Spaine sayd, that the fimple word of a Prince ought to be of as great weight as the oath of private persons. And Princes oftentimes commit faults, not because they have no desire to do well, but because no man dare or will admonish them. Vices (sayth one) are nourished in Princes palaces, because pleasures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and counsell wanteth. Neither do they become evill so much by their owne disposition, as by the evill example and shamelesse flattery of their parasites. One sayth, <hi>Principum aula mendacii, &amp; adulationis gymnasium</hi>

It is an unseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing for a man that is in an honourable place to live delicately, loosely, or incontinently. The Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> would often say; that good Princes ought to esteeme them for greater enemies, that deceive them with flattering and lyes, than such as doe intrude upon their countries; for the one taketh not but of his goods, but the other robbeth him of his fame. Flattery <note place="margin">Cur.</note> hath more often overthrowne the riches of Kings, than his enemies. <hi>Miser est imperator apud quem vera reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centur.</hi> Miserable is that Emperour from whom truth is <note place="margin">Cap.</note> concealed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dionysius</hi> would bewaile the state of Princes, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">Truth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be whispered in Princes cares.</note> in this, that men will not speake freely before them, and that the truth is hidden from them. The Emperour <hi>Gordian</hi> would say, that all things were disguised to them, and their flatterers would cast dust in their eyes. <hi>Trajan</hi> was a great enemy to lyers and detracters, and would say, that it were more safe for Princes to have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to heare their owne errors, than to give eare to such as report other mens defects. And this is no small <note place="margin">Simeon.</note> infelicity to those Princes that have none that wil speak the truth to them, and that are not willing to heare it, that they must beleeve well or evill of every one by the mouth of another. The French king <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh would say, that he had plenty of all things but of one: &amp; <note place="margin">Truth scarce in Princes Courts.</note> being asked what that was; Truth, quoth he. If truth be so scant in Princes Courts, it is no marvell though in time past they used such severe meanes to reforme that vice. In some countries lying was grievously punished with imprisonment, with deprivation of all dignities,
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:896:277"/>
and with more severity; in some only, he that had told a lye to another mans harme, should carry a stone in his mouth a month after. The wise king said, that to give no place to flatterers, and to give honour to good and vertuous men, were very great ornaments to a princely power. King <hi>Antiochus</hi> being iu hunting, lost his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, and was driven to lodge in a poore mans house, who not knowing the king, told him all the faults which he and his favorites had committed. To whom at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne he said, that he never understood the truth untill the last night: and carried himselfe more vertuously e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after.</p>

                     </gap> Princes</note> would make choice of foure excellent men, and singular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to vertue.

To these should be given the charge of the education of the kings children of the Persians: who should be called up every morning by some of his chamber in due season, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to rise and provide for the affaires which the great God hath committed to his government: for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be the ministers of God for the charge &amp; welfare of men. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> saith, that none ought to reigne, that is not better than them over whom he doth command. It is a much more beautiful thing &amp; more princely, to shew forth a mind garnished with knowledge, and framed to vertue, than a body attired with gorgeous apparell. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Severus</hi> would weare no gold nor precious stones: saying, that a Prince ought not to measure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by the things that cover the body, but by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:896:277"/>
&amp; vertue of his minde. But all the difficultie is to become good, among so many allurements and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to evill; which must come of Gods speciall grace, whereto hee must joyne his owne endevour, to make himselfe capable of it.

It is expedient for a Prince to admit some, both to his Councell and company, that are given to a very quiet life, that have not intermedled with any affaires of the common-wealth: for their same will make greatly with his fame. O that Princes would withhold their grace and favour from them, whose mindes are stained with covetousnesse &amp; immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate love of riches, or any other notorious vice, and give it to them that follow vertue: which would worke greater effect than <hi>Lycurgus</hi> lawes, that banished gold and silver as enemies to his countrey; or any other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall statutes that were made to reforme misdemeanours offensive to the weale publike. Such a Prince that would give countenance and grace to men of vertue, and reject the others that are of a contrary disposition, should bee better served at home, and all manner functions bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter executed abroad, to the great benefit and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his people, &amp; to his own immortall fame and glorie; who should by that meanes in short time see a most flourishing common-wealth, as if it were reduced, if not into that golden age, so greatly celebrated by the old Poets and antient Writers, yet at least into that of silver, which is next to it. For such men and manners as the Prince graceth, of the same condition every man will frame himselfe to be.

A Prince can shew no greater signe of a good minde, than to admit to his presence and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, men knowne to bee vertuous and of good fame. <hi>Aristotle</hi> remembreth a saying of <hi>Theognis</hi> the Poet, that it is a certaine exercise of vertue to converse with good men. A Prince (sayth one) should make choice of such, as for their vertue he thinketh worthy of his favor and presence: and should not use them with whose compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he is delighted, for their pleasant talke and courtly behaviour; but them by whose labour and counsell he may best atchieve great matters. And therfore he should be very circumspect what choice he maketh, and search out their manners with whom he meaneth to converse and communicate his mind, that he may discover what spots and staines they have, to the end hee may commit so much to every one, as he shall find in him cause of trust and honesty. The good Emperour <hi>Antoninus</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed every yere to have his house visited, what disorders were there committed; and among other things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were any in his house notably vicious: and if any such were found, what order the Visitor would set downe for reformation, was presently performed. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius</hi> sayth, hee observed one thing during the time he governed Rome: that he never tooke into his house a man that was hated of the common-wealth. He was also greatly commended for that hee would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have in his house any vicious man. He would often say, that those Princes lived in more security, that had gotten into their Court treasures of good men, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:896:278"/>
their chests treasures of evill money. For, unhappy (said he) is that Prince, that liketh to have his chests full of treasure, and his Court full of evill men. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Adrian</hi> with great diligence &amp; secrecy used to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what life the Senators or Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sellors did lead, and what exercise they used: And such as he found poore &amp; vertuous, he augmented their patrimony; and such as he found rich &amp; vicious, he would deprive them from the the Senate. He had a gentleman in his Court, which he greatly favored: but when he perceived that all the suits which he preferred to the Emperour, and obtained, he sold for money, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the man to bee apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; that all the things which by bribery he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyned, should be taken from him, and restored to the <note place="margin">Rare lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Emperour <hi>Antoninus</hi> would say, that a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reward ought <hi>Gratis</hi> to be dispatched. But <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> king of Macedon, gave a good example to Princes, how to bestow their liberality: for when one begged of the king as he was at supper, a cup of gold, that thought no time well spent, but when he was craving, the king commanded his servant to give it to another more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy than he: &amp; beholding him that begged the cup; thou (said the king) art worthy to crave, &amp; not to receive; but <note place="margin">Gifts ought to bee given ouely to the worrhy.</note> this man is worthy to receive, though he doth not crave. For men given to vertue, take it as a great offence &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, when there is no respect had of their merits; and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vicious men, or they that have little or no thing in them are made equal, or preferred before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in favor or
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:896:279"/>
honour, which is the reward of vertue. For Princes should not looke to be sued unto for reward or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by them that are worthy and have deserved well; <hi>(Meritum petere grave:)</hi> for honour forbiddeth to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or begge the rewards of vertue, which should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to those that are worthy, or have deserved them. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great would play many times at tennise, and his manner was to give them that playd with him as they were playing, some gifts and rewards that did aske any thing of him: <hi>Serapion</hi> a modest yong man, &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly disposed, that played often with the king, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, because he never asked any thing, he never had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing given him, he cast the ball to every one but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander:</hi> And being asked of the king, why he cast the <note place="margin">A wittie courtier or cunning begger.</note> ball to every one but him? Because (quoth <hi>Serapion</hi>) you did not aske him of me: then the king smiling to himselfe, gave him a very great gift; which when hee had with very great joy received, he played more lively than before. Then said the king, I see plainly, that gifts are more gracious to him that asketh not, than to him that asketh. A Poet saith:
<q>
                     <l>Principis est virtus maxima nosse suos.</l>
                     <l>It is the greatest vertue in a Prince to know his own.</l>

               </p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Sigismund</hi> was wont to say, that those Kings and Princes of the earth were happy, that bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed proud men from their Court, and brought in their places men given to courtesie and humility. I doubt not, but his meaning was also to have flatterers &amp; disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers and detracters banished; saving that hee doubted many of their Courts would then bee left desolate and unfurnished. By this which hath beene sayd it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that felicity doth not alwayes attend necessarily upon the highest estates, and the higher the estate, the
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:896:279"/>
more hard there to be found; except where God doth plentifully bestow his graces and blessings: Because Princes seeme rather to bee ordained to the happinesse of others that be committed to their charge, than of themselves, as touching worldly felicity; for the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and cares that are joyned with government, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them many times from contentation to discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which detracteth from felicitie. What the eye is in the body, the same a Prince is in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: what the Sunne is in the element, the same a Prince is in his people: the Sunne is the eye of the world, a Prince the eye of the multitude: what the Minde is in a man, the same a Prince is in his realme: what God is in the administration of the whole world, the same a Prince is in the people committed by God to his charge. As God when he seeth all things, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse as not seeing any thing; so a Prince should know all things, and make as though he knew not many things. And as the Sunne is no other to the poore man, than to the rich man: but indifferent to all; so a Prince should not respect the person, but should wisely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the matter, according as it is requisite in everie thing. <hi>Ecphantes</hi> sayth: <hi>Rex unicum &amp; excellens quoddam opus cst, imago supernii<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Neither do we reverence and honour so much the private person in Princes, as we do consider the majestie of God, and the image and power of him, whose delegates and deputies
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:896:280"/>
they are here upon the earth. They are the lights of the world. And as to governe well in principalitie, is the most excellent dignity of all other; so is it of all other the most difficult. And though their charge and care bee very great, yet that Prince that will with humility, joyn his owne endevour with Gods graces, to consider with himselfe, that as he is exalted above all things in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and dominion, so he should labour to surmount all others in worthinesse of vertue and goodnesse, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse or moderate his unbridled affections, which <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> sayth, be very evill counsellers; to purge his minde from all manner of perturbations; to use magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in contemning all perills; patience in bearing such crosses as God shall lay upon him; to have a mind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all things that may happen; to be like the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereall substance, that is above the Moone, which is alwayes cleare and in one estate; that considereth with himselfe, that religion and the service of God is the foundation of a kingdome, and that the chiefe meanes to rule well, consisteth in the worthinesse and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of the minde, and in a certaine contemning, and despising of humane thing, after which other vertues will then easily follow. For as stones and rockes, beate back the waters, so the mind of a Prince should break all adverse things, and alwayes persist in his vertue; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be lifted up with prosperity, nor dejected with adversity, but to take both fortunes with a constant mind, nor to feare death it selfe. Such a Prince, I say, may not onely attaine to the highest degree of felicity, but by his example may be a meanes to the happinesse of many others.

Adversity never dismayed any but such as prosperity deceived. He is more happy to whom honours, riches, and worldly pompe is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:896:281"/>
than they that have the fruition of them at the full. All these which we call good things, wherein wee seeme to take a singular and sound, but indeed a deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and false pleasure, as riches, reputation, authority, rule and such like, which mens vaine and greedy desires have in so great admiration, are possessed with paine, <note place="margin">Note.</note> and beheld with envy. And to them that are so ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or rather burdened, they threaten more evill than they promised good. And those estates that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these extremities, have also their meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to felicity; but with so much the more difficulty, as they exceede or defect from the meane. For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of estates, specially the highest, are more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to those things that are hinderance to felicitie, than the meane estates. And therefore they require Gods graces in greater measure, &amp; a mind fortified with many vertues, to make resistance to the things that are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive to happy life. And yet there is no estate but is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to troubles and unquietnesse. <hi>Pontanus</hi> reckoneth up <note place="margin">Troubles of this life.</note> some of the troubles of this life, in an Epitaph made for his friend, thus: Doe you aske me what be the saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this life? labour, sorrow, sickenesse, mourning; to serve proud masters, to beare the yoke of superstition, to bury those that bee deare to us, to see the ruine of our country; for the troubles of a wife I never felt.</p>
               <p>Seeing then there is no estate excluded from felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that there are more incumbrances and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to happinesse in some estates than in others, it shall bee requisite for him that would live happily, to content himselfe with that estate that hath in it least dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the attaining of felicity, and not to aspire to high dignities, and great possessions: neither to hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter credit, and reputation, the immoderat desire wherof,
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:896:281"/>
I observe generally to be a great hindrance to felicity: but rather to thinke a reputation of vertue and honesty <note place="margin">Good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune the greatest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Better is a good name, saith the wise man than much riches; and better to have renown among the good sort, than to bee Lord over the whole world: there being no such riches under heaven, as to be well thought of among men. And therefore nothing ought to be so deare to us as good fame, being the true &amp; only reward of vertue, all other things being the gifts of Fortune. And nothing in this miserable life can right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called losse, but when wee lose good fame. And <note place="margin">Good same the greatest losie.</note> because in seeking for felicity, there must be a respect had to civility, which consisteth in decency of habits and manners, it shall be good for him that meaneth to preferre vertue before vanity, to follow <hi>Seneca</hi> his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: <hi>Temperetur vita inter bonos mores &amp; publicos:</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thy life (sayth he) betweene good manners, &amp; those that be commonly used. For it is one thing to live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the common custome of men, and another to live as thou oughtest. Covet not to win estimation by trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up thy selfe in disguised habits &amp; new fangled fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions, nor by wrying thy body with tragical gestures &amp; Frierly ducks, and such like Italian and Spanish tricks and tuckes, which are but fantasticall toyes, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of idle heads: for honesty is of small estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him that is over-curious, and carefull in dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his body. Nor yet bee over-rusticall, as though thou didst condemne all things, saving that thy selfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowest; but be modest in attire, and temperate in dyet, <note place="margin">The best bravery.</note> and use a mean, observing decency.

manners. Curious neatnesse is meete for women, but <note place="margin">Marius.</note> labour for men: for he that passeth his youth vainely, maketh his old age odious: but that time being well spent, hee gathereth to himselfe the fruits of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and authority in his latter age: as a Germane Poet sayth:

               <p>We are no lesse beholding to them, from whom wee had good education and instruction, than to them from whom wee had our being: for good inclinations are many times corrupted by vicious conversation.</p>
               <p>Neither wonder at these kind of things now in use af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the common custome, nor yet despise them, but give every one leave to use his owne manners, and laugh in thy fleeve. Thou art nothing the worse though the gallants thinke thee rude, because in all things thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not imitate them. Let it suffice thee that thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy selfe, and the office of a man, and many of their formall manners to be vaine, ridiculous, and fantastical: If the manners used in times past were good then, they are not evill now. A common custome maketh things more familiar, but not Good. The wise Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> foreseeing the inconvenience that ordinarily ensueth the alteration of outward habits and manners, sayd in a great assembly of the Romanes; <hi>En palliati cives:</hi> behold our cloaked Cittizens; a thing <note place="margin">Moral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> not then used: but if he lived in this corrupt age, hee would say: <hi>En Tragaedi:</hi> Thrust not thy selfe into offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and charge for credit sake, nor yet for gaine; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber thy selfe over much with worldly affaires: they
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:896:282"/>
bring with them troubles and unquietnesse, rather than happinesse. He is not least happy that is most free from worldly cares:
<q>
                     <l>Obtundunt siquidem curarum pondera sensus; <hi>for</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>The weight of cares duls and besots the senses.</l>
                  </q>

               <p>Let matters rather follow thee, than thou follow them; <note place="margin">oncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning law suits.</note> and avoid contention and suits in law: for hardly there can be found a more miserable life. A bad end at home, is better many times than a good sentence in court. It is not in his power that beginneth contention, to end it at his pleasure. And though no man is borne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but all to bee helping to others, yet because an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlude hath no grace, if all be players, and none have leave to looke on; this life may bee compared to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlude, that hath many players, and few spectators. If I were to begin the world again, I would willingly chuse (if it were lawfull) to be one of the lookers on. All men are not equally affected, some desire labour, others qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse: some hunt after honour, others after riches and reputation: some like a sole life, others thinke it no life without a companion: which diversities of affections, when one had considered and reckoned up, he breaketh out into this speech:
<q>

And if thou wilt reap fruit also of the flatterers, endeavour to be such as they commend thee: and if thou wilt wade safely through the troubles of this world, make no great account of externe things; and set honesty alwaies before thine eyes, and therewith content thy selfe. Thinke not to winne happinesse by depending upon the favour of great estates, gotten with flattery; give them their due, and live of thy selfe. Liberty is a great furtherance to felicitie. Plaine dealing and honest conversation will bring thee favour and reputation enough to leade thee to a happy life:
<q>

               <p>The higher the tree, the more subject to the winde, whose fall many times overthroweth them that stand neare him. And the more favour thou hast with great estates, the greater is thy disgrace and griefe when they reject thee. And when thou hast used all thine endeavour to please them, what greater griefe can there bee, than to see thy selfe defrauded of the fruits of thy labour? And where thou didst expect a reward, or thankfulnesse for thy good will and diligence, thou shalt sustaine losse and disgrace: and therehence receive harme and unkindnesse, where thou thoughtest to finde helpe and favour. Three things avoyde as much as thou <note place="margin">Three things to be avoyded.</note> mayst, envie, hatred, and contempt. Wherein thou must be very circumspect, lest by avoyding the smoke, thou fall into the fire; beleeve not all thou hearest: doe not all thou mayst: nor speake all that thou knowest. And

By pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thou shalt avoyd many things that bring men to infelicitie. By modesty in speech thou shalt avoyd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny quarrels, and occasions of trouble and unquietnesse. As the wiseman saith; he that keepeth his tongue, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his soule: much speech hath often been hurtfull to many, but silence seldome or never to any. As over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much silence bringeth a mans simplicity into suspicion, so many words discovereth his vanity. And therefore one saith, we have two eares given us by nature, and one tongue; to the end we should heare much more than we should speake. It is a Princely vertue, quickely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and slowly to break out into speech. The Psalmist <note place="margin">Wholesome counsell.</note> saith; hee that is wise, hath his tongue in his heart; but the foole and furious hath his heart in his tongue; hide thy vertues as other men doe their vices, and use few words thy selfe, but heare them patiently that will speak. Think upon the end before thou begin any thing: heare every one, beleeve but few; and fall not twice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one error. Speake little, and think much: covet not to winne an opinion of wisedome, by setting forth a fine tale with eloquent words, when there is no just occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as though ye would draw your hearers into admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of you, after the maner of vain-glorious men; for he is not alwaies the wisest that loves to hear himself speak, &amp; that can tel a smooth tale, though it be a common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome so to esteem him: for wisdome consisteth chiefly in judgment, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith; <hi>Iudicium est anima sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae:</hi> Iudgment is the soule of wisdome. Nor reason over earnestly with a contentious man, that is full of words:
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:896:284"/>
for that may bee called a battell of fooles. Looke not too much into other mens estate and manners; for thereof envie hath his name: as well to eschew the torment that commeth of envie, as also that no man is envious, but he that mistrusteth his owne vertue: as the Poet saith;
<q>
                     <l>Invidus alterius rebus marcescit opimis:</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The envious man growes leane to see others fat. <note place="margin">Of envie.</note> Envie beareth such rule in these dayes, though men be lesse vertuous than they have bin, that he is in miserable estate that hath no enemies: for if his owne merits will not procure them, envie will: yet forbear not to follow vertue, to avoyd envie: but live so as thine enemies may rather wonder at thy vertnes, than thy friends shall have cause to excuse thy vices. And remember the words of <hi>Hermocrates</hi> the tyrant of <hi>Syracusa</hi> spoken to his son ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his death-bed. Sonne, the last words I speak unto thee, are: Bee not envious in condition; but doe such deeds, as therefore thou mayest bee envied.

But there is not so modest or meane a felicitie that can escape evill tongues, howsoever hee can avoyde all other things. But hee that hath his conscience cleare, will say with the Poet:

                     <l>He that is conscious of truth, laughs at lying report.</l>

In all things follow reason, and fly opinion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thy selfe with thine estate; and thinke there is no difference betweene having and not desiring: A little will serve thee to happinesse of life: to which thou shalt the more easily perswade thy selfe, if thou consider, (as hath beene said) that the true end and felicitie of man, and his proper action, is to glorifie God; and that the common opinion of happinesse that commeth by pleasures, riches, honour and glory, is contracted by the fall of our first parent, and by the corruption and alteration of our nature: As to him that is sicke of <note place="margin">Imitable precepts.</note> an ague, sower things seeme sweete and pleasant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the disease hath corrupted and altered his taste. If thou wilt avoyde the things that be odious to God and men, in poverty bee not proud, nor in riches cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous; in age be not lecherous, nor in youth shamelesse. If thou see thy selfe in poore estate, without credit and reputation, and of a cleare conscience, and beholdest another live in abundance of wealth and honours, bee not dismayed, nor thinke thy selfe lesse in Gods favour, or lesse happy than he, because he surmounteth thee in riches and reputation, and worldly vanitie; for God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributeth these temporall goods in differently both to the good &amp; to the bad. For if God should give them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to good men, the wicked would thinke for that cause he should be worshipped and prayed unto: and if hee should bestow worldly goods upon the wicked onely, the weake in faith would feare to bee converted wholly to God, lest he should want.

<pb n="628" facs="tcp:896:285"/>
raced them out of the Register of heaven. Arme thy selfe therefore with patience, and expect the islue of Gods ordinance with a quiet and thankefull minde, and thereto wholly submit thy selfe. That which seemeth sometimes to a man full of griefe and pain, becommeth many times the cause of his joy and comfort. And the same, that in the beginning seemeth to worke his infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, bringeth to him unlooked for happinesse. The best way is to take those things patiently that thou canst not amend. And if thine estate be not sufficient to maintain thee and thine, endeavour by honest meanes to amende it. But if God blesse thee plentifully with riches and possessions, hoord it not niggardly, nor spend it prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, but be beneficiall to others, and use liberalitie to those that lacke and deserve well of thee: for (after <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>) wee ought to doe most for them that most loveth us: yet with this consideration, that thou spare at the brimme, lest whilest thou shouldest powre out a pint, there run forth a pottle, &amp; let the old proverb never fall out of thy minde; <hi>Serò parsimonia in fundo:</hi> It is too <note place="margin">Necessary parsimony.</note> late to spare when all is out. <hi>Cicero</hi> counselleth us not to shut our purse so fast, that a will to do good cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it, nor yet so to unloose it, that it bee open to every body. And <hi>Alcmenes</hi> saith, hee that possesseth much should live according to reason, and not to his lust, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that riches are hurtfull, except thy mind be above riches, that can moderate riches by their use, not by their plentie.</p>
               <p>Remember alwayesthat thou live by thy mind, which (after <hi>Plato</hi>) is the true life, and thereof hast chitsly the name of a man. The substance of thy body is common with that of brute beasts, but by thy minde thou resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest the Angels and God himselfe. The minde is not
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:896:285"/>
disgraced with the deformity of the body, but by the beauty of the minde the body is graced. Give not thy selfe to fleshly pleasures, to ambition, nor to covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as the most part of men doe: thy understanding <note place="margin">Who is happy.</note> was not given thee to that purpose. <hi>Thales</hi> being asked who was happy, answered, he that hath an healthfull body, and a learned and a vertuous minde. And <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiasticus</hi> saith, better is the poore, being whole and strong, than a rich man that is afflicted in his body. Health and strength is above all gold, and a whole body above infinite treasure. There is no riches above a sound body, and no joy above the joy of the heart. And <hi>Anxagoras</hi> to the like question said; none of these that thou accountest happy, but he rather is happy, that thou beleevest is unhappy: meaning that the rich and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable persons, who are wondered at as the happiest men for their wealth and reputation, are unhappy; and he happy that contenteth himselfe with a little: which agreeth with <hi>Democritus</hi> opinion, that he is happy that is merry with a little money; and hee unhappy that is sad in the middest of great riches. Give not over thy minde unto heavinesse, and vexe not thy selfe in thine owne counsell. The joy of thy heart is the life of man, and a mans gladnesse is the prolonging of his dayes. Love thine owne soule, and comfort thine heart: drive sorrow farre from thee, for sorrow hath slaine many, and there is no profit therein: envie and wrath shorten the life, and carefulnesse bringeth age before the time. <hi>Socrates</hi> walking in the Burse or market place, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding <note place="margin">Vnnecessary sorrow.</note> the great variety of things there to bee sold; How many things (quoth he) have I no neede of?

And so of all other estates of life, some things are desired that seeme to be wanting to the fulnesse of their happinesse, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are as unpossible to be joyned together, as for heate and cold to be at one time both together in one subject, being diametrally contrary in quality. So
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:896:287"/>
hat the greatest hinderance to our attaining of felicity or happinesse of life, proceedeth from our evill affected minds, that desire unpossible things, which also diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us from our proper action and true end or beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. We passe our time in vaine hope of things never like to come to passe; as <hi>Petrarke</hi> saith: <hi>Bene sperando &amp; male habendo transit vita mortalium.</hi> In hoping well, and having evill, the life of man passeth away. Every good <note place="margin">Ou.</note> thing wee possesse is lesse, the things hoped for seeme great. And such is also the infirmitie of our common nature, seldome or never so sully to enjoy prosperitie, as in no respect to finde cause of complaint of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of our estate. For many are raysed to great wealth, <note place="margin">Gu. No one man can enjoy all things.</note> that beare shame of their base linage: some ennobled by birth and parentage, and yet live in povertie: many blessed with riches and nobilitie, that want the delight of children: and some made glad with procreation, that feele great sorrow and discomfort by their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens untowardlinesse. No man is wont to be long and <note place="margin">Octav.</note> every way happy, a worse fortune ever followeth the former. But what estate or course of life soever thou follow, have alwaies a speciall regard to these two things; to live in the feare of God, and to observe the rules of honesty among men: from which, what soever happen, let nothing divert thee: To God thou owest <note place="margin">The end which all men should ayme at.</note> a good conscience, and to thy neighbour a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. All things will happen well to thee, if thou place God the beginning and the end: For in this life thou shalt not finde greater comfort than by that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of a good conscience, of honest counsels, of upright actions, of contempt of casuall things, and of a quiet and peaceable life. But in these dayes many feare <note place="margin">Plin.</note> their fame, but few their conscience: and yet there is
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:896:288"/>
not (saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) a more happy thing, than the quietnesse of conscience. And if any afflictions or crosses happen that thou canst not avoyde, yet thou mayst overcome them with patience. Fly unto God for succour, he will give it thee; that is the only way to make thee safe, secure and happy.</p>
               <p>Friendship was wont to bee accounted a helpe to happinesse of life: but wee may now rightly say with the Poet:
<q>
                     <l>Illud amicitia quondam venerabile nomen,</l>
                     <l>Prostat &amp; in questu pro meretrice sedet:</l>
                     <l>That name of friendship venerable of yore,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The time is so changed, and mens manners with <note place="margin">Friendship.</note> them so corrupted, that the precepts heretofore given by wise men for the commoditie of life grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vertue and honesty, will not now serve the turne. Friendshippe is growne cold; faith is foolishnesse; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty is in exile; and dissimulation hath gotten the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand. That is effectually done which is commonly spoken, he that cannot dissemble cannot live. <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels</hi> rules are better followed in these dayes, than those <note place="margin">

Professe (saith hee) love and friendshippe to thine enemie: and if hee fall into the water up to the knees, give him thine hand to helpe him out. And if he fall in up to the waste helpe him likewise; but if hee fall into the water up to the chinne, then lay thy hand upon his head and ducke him under the water, and never suffer him to rise againe. Men have changed the inward habites of their mindes, as they have done the outward habites of their bodies. Every age, nay
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:896:288"/>
rather every yeare bringeth forth new fashions; so likewise that friendship and honesty, which in our forefathers times was wont to bee performed with faith and plaine meaning, is now out of the fashion, and therefore not esteemed: cunning dissimulation with faire words, and large offers with little perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, is now all the fashion. Ioyne thy selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in friendship with very few, and bee circumspect and curious in thy choyce: and if it be possible, bee beholding to no man, more than hee is beholding to thee; for a faithfull friend is hard to be found: the bare name onely remaineth, the thing is obsolet and growne out of use. So long as thou hast no need, thou shalt find friends ready to offertheeal mnner of courtesies: but if fortune begin to frowne upon thee, &amp; a tempest chance to arise, they will find quarrels to leave thee, and cover their infidelity with thy fault, and give thee cause to say with <hi>Ovid:</hi>

               <p>It is a hard matter for him that is in poverty to find out a kinsman or friend: for no man will confesse that he appertaineth in any sort to him, that needeth any helpe, fearing lest hee will by and by aske something of him: <hi>David</hi> calleth such men table friends.

But to him thou meanest to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the part of a faithfull frieud, thou must observe these two things: to helpe his necessities; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him in adversity. But the manner of friends in these dayes, is to deliver words by the pottle, and deeds by the pinte. They that call themselves thy friends, will looke for performance of friendship at thy hands,
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:896:289"/>
though they wil performe none to thee. For every man looketh for honest dealing in another, though he meane to use none himselfe. To this declination, the greatest comfort to the life of man is come by the generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of manners: for where can a man find grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comfort in adversitie, than in faithfull friends? who also double the joyes and pleasures of prosperitie. That was never more commonly in use which <hi>Latimer</hi> spake <note place="margin">True friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship doubles prosperitie.</note> in his Sermon to reprehend the want of love, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: Yee have a common saying (said hee) every man for himselfe, and God for us all; but ye might more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">proverbs.</note> say, every man for himselfe, and the Divell for us all; one for another, and God for us all. <hi>Martiall</hi> finding the infidelitie and inconstancie of love and friendship, giveth this counsell:

               <p>Prosperitie winneth friends, but adversitie proveth them, as the touch-stone tryeth Gold. And over-great friendship, not considerately united, is many times the cause of great hatred. Men cannot bee better warned to trust to themselves, than by <hi>Aesops</hi> fable of a Lark, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> discovereth the common coldnesse of friendship in their friends causes.

<pb n="637" facs="tcp:896:289"/>
her at her returne. The master of the corne perceiving it ripe, willed his son to desire his friends the next day earely in the morning to come reape downe his corne. The sonne did as hee was commanded: and when the Larke returned, her little ones trembling for feare, told her what newes they had heard, desiring to be removed to another place: but shee bid them be quiet and feare nothing, and went forth the next day againe to seeke for meat: the master looketh for his friends, and when hee saw that none came, hee willed his sonne to goe to his kinsfolkes, and desire their helpe to cut down his corne the next day: when the Larke returned, shee found her young ones in the like feare againe, but understanding what they had heard, she willed them to have no feare, for kindred (said she) will not bee so hasty to helpe with their labour at the first call, and departed from them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The day following when the master had in vaine expected the performance of his kinsfolks promise also; Away (quoth hee) with friends an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which when the Larke understood of her young; Now it is time to bee gone (said shee) and removed her nest. By which fable men are warned not to stay for their friends help in that they can do themselves. And hereof springeth a common error, that men consider not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the nature of friendship, which can be perfect but between two, and those vertuous persons. And where is no conformitie of manners, there can bee no perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of friendship; for contraries can hold no consent nor unity together: because their affections must be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, and his friend must bee preferred before all others, &amp; as it were two bodies made one: which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                  <note place="margin">Alexander and Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</note> for the king, that he was also <hi>Alexander.</hi> For if a man have many friends, it may chance, that one may have cause of joy by some great good fortune happened to him, and another at the same time may have cause of sorrow by some evill accident or fortune. Both which contrary passions cannot bee in him together; and therefore hee cannot bee like friend to them both. But one may be a friend to many by degrees, according to the merit or estimation hee hath of them: which he may also with honesty dissolve, if by their deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites he shall find just cause, and bee not bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it by some good turne received and not requited. Many by acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce only, or by some courtesie shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for civilities sake, are more ready to challenge a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friendship never promised or professed, as due to them by his voluntarie kindnesse, than forwardly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite that already received. Yet neverthelesse true love and friendship hath respect onely to his friends necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, without merchandize or feneration: as one sayth, <hi>Charitas non quaerit suum.</hi> But seeing the affected name of a friend is so common, and the act or matter so rare, I wish thee to make choyce of a few companions, with whom thou wilt passe thy time, to avoyd the tediousnes of a solitary life, such as bee inclined to honest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, as neere as thou mayst; and let them goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of welwillers rather than of friends, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <note place="margin">Chuse wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the than friends.</note> thou bee assured of their fidelity. So shall not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie bind thee to performe more to them to whom a common custome, and the malignity of this time hath given a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to discharge the duty of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, then thou shalt see cause, or they will performe
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:896:290"/>
to thee: for in so great pennury of friends, &amp; corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of manners, thy fortune must bee very good if thou chance upon a faithfull friend: for in these daies men hold friendship by indenture. And that thou maist bee better instructed in thy choice, hearken to <hi>Guevarra</hi> his counsell, to one that asked how one man may know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to the end he may be either accepted or eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. First, obserue what affaires he taketh in hand, what works he doth, what words he speaketh, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <note place="margin">How to chuse or retuse.</note> he keepeth; for the man that by nature is proud, in his businesse negligent, in his word a lyer, and maketh choice of evill men for his companions, deserves not to be embraced, much lesse to be trusted: for that in men in whom is laid no foundaton of vertue, is no expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith or honesty. And one of the things (saith he) that men thinke they haue, when they have them not, is many friends; yea (say I) one faithfull friend. For by my experience, if thou wilt beleeve me, I know not any thing wherein thou maist sooner bee deceived. Fortie yeares and more I may with some judgement remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the world; in which little time I have found such a metamorphosis and alteration in mens minds and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that if they should decline so fast from evill to worse after forty yeares more, it will bee a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any where to finde out a faithfull friend, or an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man. For (as the same Authour further saith) that which one friend doth for another in these dayes, is eyther to excuse, or hide himselfe when there is neede of him, being more ready to lend him his conscience than his money. And hee that will compare the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that professe friendship unto him, with them that have performed the true office and part of friends, for one faithfull, hee shall discover an hundred dissemblers.
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:896:291"/>
Of such friends, as they are most common, so we may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem it no smal felicity to be divided from them, being more prodigall of their conscience, than liberall of their goods, or ready to performe any other duety of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. <hi>Isocrates</hi> counselleth us to chuse that friend which hath beene faithfull to his former friends; for he is like to prove constant in friendship: and if thou wilt follow <note place="margin">No friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to bee made with the covetous man.</note> mine advice, enter not into friendship with a covetous man, for his mind is so possessed and overcome with the love of money, and greedy desire to encrease his riches and possessions, that there is no hope of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance eyther of friendship or honesty at his hands. <hi>Plautus</hi> saith: <hi>Vt cuique homini res parata est, firmi anuci sunt: Si res lassae labant, itidem amici collabascunt:</hi> As our substance is, so are our friends; if that faile, they fall from us.</p>
               <p>The minds and manners of men in these latter daies, are much like to the manners used by the old Romanes, when they triumphed: the Romanes, as they were very politike in all their government, so did they well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that there was no better meanes to excite their young men to vertue, than by rewarding their noble acts with honour. Therfore they had a custome, when <note place="margin">Custome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Romans.</note> any Generall of their Armies had wonne any notable victorie, to suffer him at his return to Rome to triumph, which was done with very great pompe and solemnity and when the triumph was ended, the triumpher had prepared a sumptuous feast, and invited the chiefe men of the citie to supper, and among the rest the Consuls also, which were the principal Magistrates of Rome, yet meaning nothing lesse than to have their company: for they were no sooner returned to their houses, but the Triumpher would send a messenger presently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:896:291"/>
the Consuls not to come to supper, that there might be no man to whom he might give place. So, many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite <note place="margin">The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> men to their friendship, with faire words and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offers, when they meane nothing lesse, that they may seeme to give place to none in humanity and courtesie; but his back is no sooner turned, but they revoke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themselves their friendly offers, and are ready, if they thinke he look for performance, to forbid him to make triall of their friendship, being done for forme, and not with plaine meaning, as the triumphers maner was.</p>
               <p>This time seemeth to resemble that whereof <hi>Galen</hi> complaineth, that he happened into a most wicked age, in which hee thought them onely wise, and of a sincere mind, that having espyed the generall infidelity, subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, dissimulation, and dishonestie of men, withdrew themselves speedily from the assemblies and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of people, as from a vehement storme and tempest into the safe port of a solitarie life: which agreeth with the Poet:
<q>
                     <l>—Benê qui latuit, benè vixit.</l>
                     <l>Hee lives well that lives warily.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There have bin times when he that knew most, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed best, but now reputation growes not by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor is measured by the worthinesse of vertue, but by the abundance of riches and possessions.

               <p>One of the things that <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> said grieved his heart, was; That men of understanding are not set by.

Wee condemne Papists for their superstition &amp; confidence in their good works and we blame Puritanes for their affected singularitie and formall precisenesse; and in the meane time that we may be unlike the one in grossenesse, and not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the other in precisenesse, we neither have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient regard to the true devout service of God, and to Christian charity, nor sufficiently shew the zeale of true Christians to the sincerity of religion, and least of all expresse it in our lives and conversations: as though godlinesse consisted in a theoricall kinde of beleeving, without any respect to the exercise of Christian chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vertue. And when we go about to shake off the clogges wherewith our consciences are burdened by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, to enjoy the true and Christian libertie, wee fall into such a licentiousnesse of life, and dissolutenesse of manners, that the Poets saying may be aptly applyed to many:

<pb n="645" facs="tcp:896:293"/>
of manners, being almost (as we may conjecture) at the highest, this comfort remaineth to the well-minded, that the day of deliverance cannot be farre off. When <hi>Dionysius,</hi> at the time that Christ was crucified, beheld with admiration the Sunne eclipsed contrary to nature, the Moone being at the full, and opposite to the Sunne, he pronouneed these words; Either the God of nature suffereth now, or else the whole frame of the world shal be dissolved. And as <hi>Dionysius</hi> divined rightly in the one, so may he do in the other, that wil behold the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of all maner of vice and wickednesse of this time, <note place="margin">A fearefull eclipse.</note> contrary to the nature of Christianity, and opposite to the word of God which was never more plentifully taught; and boldly pronounce, that this generall and unnaturall eclipse of Christian manners, doth presage the destruction of the world to be at hand.</p>
               <p>Hee that will looke into the manners of this time; shall he not find cause, with trembling and feare, to thinke that the time is at hand, that the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> spake of to the Ninivites? There be yet forty dayes and the world shall be destroyed: but our hearts be so har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with worldly desires, that wee will beleeve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that feedeth not our humours, and is not plausible to our inclinations. And nothing is more dangerous to a Christian than to accustome himselfe to harden his <note place="margin">Guev.</note> conscience. For in such unhappy people there is no will to be amended, nor meanes to be remedied. The Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans had a Prophecie, that when the Romans sent an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie into Affrica, <hi>Mundus cum tota sua prole periret:</hi> the signification of which words is, The world with all his issue shall perish: which made them thinke that the world with all the people should be destroyed.

And as wee are worse than our fathers, so our posterity is like to be worse than wee be, if vice bee not now at the highest, and the world almost at an end. The Poets observed diligently, and with great <note place="margin">The foure Ages.</note> consideration, the mutations of the world, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it into foure parts. The first age they likened to gold, and called it the golden age: the next so decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they compared it unto silver: the third, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to brasse: the fourth worst of all, was become like iron, of lesse value and price than any of the rest: and if there were a more base metall, wee might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our age to it. In consideration whereof, they with other writers in these latter ages, both divine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, doe bewaile the decay of vertue, of true faith, of charity, of mutuall love and fidelitie, of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, of honesty, yea of devotion and prayer, and of
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:896:294"/>
the love and feare of God, and of heavenly contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereof, as from his proper root should spring all the rest. For how many doe wee see live as though they had no need of God; &amp; hoped for no better, nor mistrust no worse than they finde here? As though God were not the rewarder of vertue, and punisher of vice; nay rather as though there were no God at all, no resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, no heaven, nor hell. Who feareth to offend God, or spareth to blaspheme his holy name? Who <note place="margin">The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of these times.</note> taketh any paine to please him? Who forbeareth to hate, envie, and to slander? Who laboureth to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his flesh to the spirit; sensualitie to reason; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to faith; and faith to the service of God? Who letteth not loose the reines to his affections, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not his will and wicked inventions to take the bitte in the teeth, and runneth away against the rule of reason? Subjects rebell against their Prince and Gods anointed, and are sometime excited unto it by them that should set forth obedience by word and example of life. Children disobey their parents, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne them, and laugh them to scorne. Servants make small estimation of the trust committed unto them by their masters. Labourers hunt after idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Artificers are deceiptfull in their wordes and workes. Merchants and others in uttering the wares that they sell. No man lendeth without hire. Vsurie was never so generall, nor so extreame. And if wee should after this sort run over the other estates of life, wee should finde all sorts of men degenerate from the simplicity and goodnesse of their forefathers. No man seeketh after vertue, nor laboureth to reforme or amend, much lesse to mortifie himselfe. So as we might never more truly pronounce these old verses:
<q>
                     <pb n="648" facs="tcp:896:295"/>

Wee are notable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers of other mens faults, and cunning dissemblers of our owne.

patience, quietly to receive such afflictions and crosses, as it shall please God to send and lay upon him; and perswade himselfe he doth all for his good, to draw his love from these worldly vanities, to the contemplation and desire of God and his heavenly kingdome, which is our end, and sovereigne good and beatitude. He must purge and cleanse his mind from those impure motions and affections, that intice and allure men to the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable lusts and brutish pleasures of the flesh: than which pleasure (after <hi>Demosthenes</hi>) there is not a more capitall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie given of nature to man: and (after <hi>Demosthenes</hi>) no evill can happen to that man, which hath layd tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and continency for a foundation of wisedom. He must also beware, and be very circumspect that he bee not overcom with inordinate desire of riches, nor with ambition and desire of honor and glory; whereunto, for want of due consideration, the most part of men are commonly carried headlong, by a false and flattering shew of happinesse. And if it shall please God to blesse him with worldly wealth &amp; honourable estate (for they are his blessings to them that come rightly and justly to them) he must use them to that purpose for which they were ordained and given him: for the estimation of things, and their use and abuse maketh them helpefull or hurtful to happinesse of life. He that knoweth how to esteem and use riches &amp; honourable estate as he ought, neither will desire them, if he have them not, nor feare their losse, if he possesse them: knowing that he may live well and happily without them; as things not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to felicity. For the greedy desire of riches &amp; pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, &amp; the ambitious passions, common almost to all men in aspiring to honorable estate, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual fear of their losse, doth so torment and unquiet our mindes, that whereas by the due estimation of riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

and such like delights of men, with an upright judgement, we might leade a pleasant and happy life; wee contrariwise by a sinister opinion, heape upon our selves grievous torments, manifold cares and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so as wee seeme to seeke of purpose for the causes, and meanes how to bring our selves into an unhappie and miserable estate: for all the troubles and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that travell our fraile bodies, our selves are the cause of them, and for the most part we goe out to seeke them. For thus fares it with men of all estates, first to desire one thing, and then another, without end or measure, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver satisfied or contented, and therefore never happy.

the word, because he revealed this secret decree out of the breast of the eternal Father. And this was the first miracle that God wrought after his creation of the world, and the creatures therin contained, staying them that were to dye without the second causes, and without that ordinarie course of life, which before hee had esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth that <hi>Adam</hi> set up two tables of stone, in which he wrote the beginning of the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the fall of man, and the promise.</p>
               <p>Now if wee consider what a worthy and beautifull <note place="margin">Man before his fall.</note> creature man was before his fall, the very habitation &amp; temple of God, without sinne, and without death, wee may easily judge what an ungrateful and unhappy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was to revolt from God, to the Divell, whereby he and his posterity became subject to sinne and death. For first God made him after his own image &amp; likenes, that is, he made him most good, uncorrupt, holy, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, &amp; immortall, &amp; furnished him with most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts, that nothing might bee wanting unto him to all blessednesse in God. His understanding was wholly divine, his will most free &amp; most holy: he had power of doing good &amp; evil: a law was given him of God, which shewed him what he should doe, or what he should not doe. For the Lord said, Thou shalt not eate of the tree of knowledg both of good &amp; evil. God simply required of him obedience &amp; faith, &amp; that whole <hi>Adam</hi> should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him, &amp; that not constrained by necessity, but should do it freely: he told him also the perill, &amp; willed him not to touch the tree, lest he dye. So that he left him in his own counsell, whose will was then free, &amp; might have chosen whether he would have broken Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment or not. Neither did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

more excellent wisedome, who drew on her husband willingly to bee partaker of the same, by the false and lying perswasion and promise of the divel, &amp; by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable shew &amp; sightliness of the tree, the fruit whereof after the woman had first tasted, she gave to her husband also to eate: By meanes whereof hee lost those goodly <note place="margin">Mans fall.</note> gifts &amp; ornaments, which God had bestow'd upon him: which gifts hee gave to <hi>Adam</hi> upon condition, that hee would also give them to his posterity, if himselfe did keep them: but would not give them, if hee by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes would cast them away: so that by his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression &amp; disobedience, hee was cast out of Paradise, that is, out of that happy estate, &amp; found al the elements lesse favorable. His nature &amp; condition was alter'd from goodnes &amp; holines, to sin and wickednes: from sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to corruption: the influences that descend from the stars and planets, which are of themselves simply good, through our sinnes and corruption turne to evill: so as all things made for our use, rebell and conspire together against us, and our sinnes are the cause of all our evill.</p>
               <p>Which fall and alteration of mans nature, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude <note place="margin">Mans alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration after his fall.</note> towards God, will manifestly appeare to him that will looke into his owne estate, &amp; the things which God hath created. To man alone (at least in this lower part) hee hath given understanding, by which hee may know what al other things have, &amp; what they be, which the things themselves know not. An infallible argument that whatsoever they have or be, the same they have or bee, not for themselves, but for man. For to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose serveth the vertues and properties that be in them, if they know them not? To man only in all the world it is given to know these things, &amp; to have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> and therfore the world and all things there in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, were given to man, and created for him onely: for the Angels had no need of it: nor brute beasts could use a thing of such excellencie; but to man that hath a bodily substance, it was necessary; who only, because he was endued with a reasonable soule, could use it. And <note place="margin">Man of more digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie than the world.</note> seeing the possessor farre surmounteth the thing that is possessed, man is of much greater dignitie than the world, which is his possession and habitation. But the more excellent his nature was, the more filthy is his corruption: the greater benefits he received of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, the more ungratefull he was to offend him. And if we call our selves to account, and examine the whole course of our life, we shall see how small a part thereof we bestow in the cogitations &amp; service of him that hath given us all that we have, and be: And how farre we are from giving him his owne, that is, our selves, and all that wee have, which wee possesse, and ought to apply to the glorie of God. But contrariwise, wee convert <note place="margin">The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans nature.</note> all things to our owne commodity as his proper end, and us onely to our selves. How few houres, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how few parts of one houre doe wee bestow in a whole day and night, in thinking upon God, as though it were the least care we have? And when we pray, what doe we but commit sinne upon sinne? In the very heat of our prayers, how cold are wee? yea when we seeme most vehement and devout, what vaine &amp; idle thoughts and fansies falleth into our heads? So that our minds in our praiers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> in his Booke <hi>de sera numinis vindicta,</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a strange historie of a man that killed his father. This man, of all other was least suspected, being so rare <note place="margin">A Parricide.</note> and unnaturall a thing for the sonne to kill his father: and therefore the murther could never bee discovered, untill this man, long after the murther committed, went on a time forth to supper, and espying (as hee walked) a swallows nest, hee with his staffe threw downe the nest, and killed the young swallowes; and being reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of some that beheld him, for killing so cruelly the harmelesse little birds: They have (quoth he) followed me long enough; they cry every day, that I have killed my father. The men that were present, marvelling to heare so strange a thing, informed the King, who caused him to be apprehended, and being examined, he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the matter.</p>
               <p>Which example confirmeth that which hath beene said, that though our nature bee corrupt, yet the soule
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:896:301"/>
detesteth his own wickednesse, and our conscience, that <note place="margin">The soule opposite to the sinner of the flesh.</note> repineth against our misdeeds, tormenteth and secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonisheth us; which could not be, if there were not some little image of God, and of our former divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture left in us. And whereof commeth it, that seeing we know and confesse, that God is our Creatour, and hath so liberally given us all that we have, &amp; made the world for us, and that he is good, and goodnesse it selfe, that wee put so little confidence in him, or rather mistrust his help, saving that we seeme to have some sense &amp; fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling imprinted in our conscience, that wee have grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously offended him, &amp; are justly disinherited &amp; unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his favor? Our prayers be as full of distrust, as our hearts be void of faith. God hath advanced us far above stones, plants, brute beasts, and all other unreasonable creatures, and above the world it self. He hath set us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and given us eyes to look up towards heaven, and with our eyes to behold his magnificence. But wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise looke downe to the earth, and tumble in the ground, like swine in the dirt. How many give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholly, and have almost no other th ought, but in getting and heaping together gold and silver, the scurffe of the earth, which they seeke after as their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test good and felicity? Whereof riseth all our contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and suits, but for earth and earthly things? Which is a plaine demonstration, that wee are throwne downe headlong from that honourable estate &amp; throne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were by the bountiful goodnesse of God first pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. If a man should see one with a crowne or diademe upon his head, all soyled with dirt, or delving the ground, or holding the plough, would not hee thinke him eyther mad, or else cast out of his chaire of estate, <note place="margin">Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> and deposed from his royall dignity? What doe men
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:896:302"/>
but digge and turmoyle in the earth, occupy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholly in base things, as though God had given immortalitie to the soule, to bestow our labour and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations in dung and dirt? A scepter is not given to a King to play the dizzard. But if a man had held himself in his first estate that God made him, our divine nature would have bin occupied in divine things, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemplation. Wee should not have set our felicitie in these transitorie things, as though our inheritance were in this world.</p>
               <p>The consideration of these things will enforce us to confesse, that the soule liveth not properly, but the body onely: and that his actions and motions are not free and at his owne libertie. <hi>Proclus</hi> could say, that the naturall life properly of the soule, is not in this earthly body, but above. And <hi>Plato</hi> likeneth the soule, when hee is in generation, to men that dwell in a pestilent ayre: and the soule that is without ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, to them that dwell in a faire greene meadow. And as they that dwell in an unwholesome countrey, are for the most part, sickely, and few continue in their naturall health: so the soule as long as it liveth in this elementary body, as in a prison, and both together in this world, will be subject as it were to sicknesse, that is, to sinne, to passions, to corruption and uncleannesse. For among so many men that are endued with a mind, who useth it? that is, (as <hi>Morney</hi> further saith) in men how many beasts? and among men what is more rare than a man? And of these that use their minde, how few use it well? That is, (saith he) in men how many Divels? And if from among men, beasts and divels should bee taken away, what marvell is it that the Philosopher sought for a man at noone

For the sins we commit is a punishment of his offence. And though they are come to us by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, yet it is not to bee imputed to him as an author of it, because hee could by his absolute power hinder and let evill. For hee proponeth lawes, to man with rewards and punishments. Hee willeth him to embrace good and flye evill. To the doing whereof hee denyeth not his grace, without which wee can doe nothing, nor refuseth our diligence and labour. Here if we cease and give over, the sin and negligence is attributed to man, and not to God, though hee could have hindered it, and did not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he ought not to hinder it, lest hee should disturbe his apointed and settled order, and destroy his owne worke. God therefore is not the Authour of evill and sin, for al things which he made are good. It is no effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but a deficient cause. Evil is no substance nor nature but an accident that commeth to the substance, when it is voyde of those good qualities that ought naturally to be in them, and supplieth the others absence with his presence. And that hee suffereth evill to be done, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his great justice and mercy. For if God should suffer no evill to be done, men could not finne: which agreeth not with his nature; the Creator of all things having given him in the beginning free-will. And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <note place="margin">Why God suffereth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</note> there should bee sinners, how should God shew
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:896:304"/>
mercy? But because all men commit sinne many waies, God findeth every where matter to forgive, every whereupon whom to shew mercy. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, If the disease were light, the Physitian would bee contemned and not sought; and if the Physitian should not be sought, the disease would have no end. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where sinne abounded, there also grace abounded, which onely divideth the redeemed from the damned. All which things are sufficient testimonie against us, that God made all things good, and the evill that is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us, is come upon us by our owne fault, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sobeied God to obey the Divell.</p>
               <p>Wee must confesse therefore, that God made man good, and a divine creature, after his owne image; that he endued him with many goodly gifts and ornaments; that hee made the world and all things therein to serve man, as he made man to serve him: and as man is the end of the world, so God is the end of man; that he esteemed him in place of his sonne, and opened his mind to him: But because man preferred his owne appetite before <note place="margin">Pride the fall of man.</note> the will of his Creator, and became as a bastard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, not onely by breaking Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by affecting an equality with him, he fell out of his favour, and lost those gifts hee first gave him, and is justly punished by him, that is most just, with the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his estate and condition, as a rebell against his Sovereigne and Creator; because he would not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and rest in his felicitie, wherein God had first pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him; that is, in the contemplation of his Creator: but would needs seeke his felicity some other where. For the end of man is to glorifie God, having made him for his own glory; and the end, felicity, beatitude and <hi>Sum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="668" facs="tcp:896:305"/>
confession, as hath been shewed before. Therfore God, that hath made all things good, and is most good, and goodnesse it selfe, is the felicitie or beatitude and <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Summum bonum.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>bonum</hi> of man. And though man by his ungratefull revolting from God, that had bestowed such innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable benefits upon him, deserved justly to bee utterly destroyed; yet hee dealt mercisully with him, that hee took not away all, as his demerits required, and left him a meanes to returne into his grace againe. For by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the things he first gave us, he would make us humble by the fall of our first parent, lest by the like presumptuousnesse we should fall againe. A King buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a new city and endoweth it, as the manner is, with many priviledges and liberties: it happeneth the citizens to rebel; the king taketh away from them many of their liberties and priviledges. Which punishment of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on descendeth to all their posterity, though the city was begun with a few families, it groweth at length to bee very populous. His giving those priviledges to the first inhabitants, was to bee imputed to his bounteousnesse and liberality: that he took them away, was his justice: that he denied restitution of them to their posterity, was his clemency, lest they being of the same disposition, should procure againe their owne destruction. So God gave unto man liberty, a great priviledge; and adorned him with many goodly gifts both of body &amp; mind, for the which he ought to praise his goodness. And because by abusing his gifts, he hath taken them away, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished them, is to be attributed to his justice; which hee hath done, lest by example of the first man, his posterity being of the same condition, should commit againe the like offence, and fall into the like punishment. Thus it pleased God of his goodnesse to chastise his people, and
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:896:305"/>
to suffer them to bee governed by his lawes, but not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroy them. And that mankinde might feele and know how great miseries follow their sin, and fall, and thereby learn humility and godlines, and to call for his great mercy, apparent in the middest of his high justice, that notwithstanding mans grievous offence &amp; ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he would not utterly destroy his posterity, whom he had made to his glory, but raised up one out of that rebellious stocke, that should satisfie his justice wherby they might live, and bee received into grace againe: hereby it is evident that mans nature is corrupted, not so created at the first by God: but by abusing his gifts and graces, is fallen from goodnesse into wickednesse, from his speciall favour, into his just indignation. And as we are of the nature of that man our first parent, in whom humane nature was universally polluted; so doe wee receive from him his nature, and draw to us the corruption thereof, from whence is derived by propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the cause of our miserable estate and condition. Now that we have shewed how &amp; by what me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>God, all men confesse to be Creator of all things, and <note place="margin">The meanes to escape these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into which wee are fallen.</note> as he is good &amp; goodnesse it selfe, all that he hath made, must needs bee also good as proceeding from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of goodnesse. And because God is wisedome, all his creations we must needs acknowledge, were made to some end; For nature (say the Philosophers) doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vaine, but all things well; much more God the Creator of nature doth all things to an end. And as God is the beginning, middle, and end of all things, so hath he none other end of his workes, but himselfe. For he made all things to his own glorie; and therefore
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:896:306"/>
we that be the creatures of God, of whom we have our beginning and life, can have no other end but God. So <note place="margin">God the end of his own Works.</note> that God is our <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> or Soveraigne good; our beatitude and felicity. To that end therefore, to the attaining of that good, which is the proper action and true felicity of man, all our studies and desires, all our labours and diligence, ought to be directed and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. If mans first nature had remained whole and uncorrupted, there would not have needed any great search to bee made to find out his felicity. For our end or felicity did then shine in our understanding; and the same end or good, which is God, by whom and for whom we were created, did allure and draw our will. But now by our pride and presumptuousnesse, and fall of our first parent, our matters be brought to this passe, that in earthly things we have <hi>Lynces</hi> eyes, but in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things we are as blind as beetles. In seeking for the true light, the true God, and the right way to felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> our eyes do not only twinkle as an Owle against the Sunne, but are shut close together. Yet notwithstanding there remaineth to vs some signes or tokens by which we may know these things: speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if wee call continually to minde our fall. For then we should not wallow in the dirt like swine, and desire these earthly things, that appertaine nothing to us, nor to our end and felicity: nor stand like men amazed with the greatnesse of our fall: but wee should seek our end, or soveraigne good or beatitude, in the grace of God, and in the face of our Creator: from which by our owne fault wee are fallen &amp; cast away. To make the matter more plaine, we will use <hi>Morneyes</hi> similitude. He that desireth to know the use of any instrument, as of <note place="margin">A Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

into it, or that it is defaced, or broken by some chance but by the whole teeth, scowred cleane, and fit to cut, even as it came out of the artificers shop. So likewise must we judge of a man; not estimating his end, &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test good, of his blindnesse, of his ignorance, of his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and such like, that are come upon him; but of the excellency, of the goodnesse, of the brightnesse, wherewith he was at the first endued of the Creator. Neither may wee apply the use of a sawe to that it is of Iron, and hath a handle, and will cut; for these things be in every sword, and yet a sword is not a sawe: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath teeth, and is of a peculiar forme: by which a sawe di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ereth not onely from a sword, or knife that hath no teeth, but also from a file that hath teeth also. In like sort we must examine a man (if we shall judge of a mans use or end) by his life or senses. To what purpose <note place="margin">The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> was a man made, seeing these things be also in plants &amp; beasts? But God made man not in vaine: wherefore his end and good must be estimated by that peculiar &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part, by which he doth excell and is a man, by which he surmounteth all things, that be, that live, that have sense, that is, by the principall part of his soule, which is his understanding; for what is more excellent than that? And as this particular forme, which giveth the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar use to a sawe, is common to all sawes, so likewise that speciall form of man, by which the end of man differeth from that of all other creatures, is so proper to him, as neverthelesse it is common to all mankind. For as this property is engendred by nature in all men, so all men ought to levell &amp; direct their course to that end, as their greatest or fove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>aigne good and beatitude. For the same which was the end and good of the first man, is also the end &amp; good of all men; although our understanding is
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:896:307"/>
become dull, our will foolish, and our nature corrupted. And as our first parent, whilest he was in his perfect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, did aspire and lift himselfe up to God, as to his end and beatitude, so must we climbe up to God, as much as by our minds we are able. And as to cleave unto God, was his soveraigne good and beatitude; so cannot we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to our greatest good and felicity, except we return to God againe from whom we are fallen away.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that understanding was given to man, by a singular priviledge, cleare at the first, without spot or blemish, that he might behold the end and good, for which he was created, we must use the helpe thereof to discerne between the true end to which we ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <note place="margin">A necessary distinction.</note> the course of our life, and the false reputed ends and felicity, which diverteth and leadeth us astray from our greatest good and happinesse or beatitude, which is God. By nature every man wisheth well to himselfe, and directeth his course to some end, which he thinketh to be good for him. But though this desire or appetite of good be common to all, yet there is great diversity in their taste, which (as in them that have the greene sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or a woman with child, that longeth to eat coales, <note place="margin">An apt simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> and ashes or other evill things greedily as good meat) sheweth plainely a great distemperance of their nature: which maketh men propone to themselves divers ends, to which they direct the course of their life. Some give themselves to pleasures, others to covetousnes and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of riches, and possessions; some to ambition, and desire of honour and glory; all which hath been shewed before, to divert men from their true end, and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good. Which blindnesse and corruption of our nature and understanding is happened to us by our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and fall. For when mans understanding was

But because our nature is now corrupted &amp; our understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding deformed, having nothing left in us of that good wee had before our fall, but a variable and vaine desire of that wee have lost and have not, if we consider our owne estate and ability, and an uncertaine kind of knowledge, or rather an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God: and that also being confused &amp; grown out of use: either we take not God for our true end and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne good, though he offer himself every where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, or if we desire to go to him, we go astray, &amp; fall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wickednes, or to superstition, or else (as the most part of men do) take that which commeth next to hand, addict our selves to the world &amp; sensible matters, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in these excrements of the earth, like swine in the dirt. But these be not the things for which man was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, nor wherein his end or soveraigne good or felicity must be sought: for man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth of a body &amp; soule; the body mortall, the soule immortall: if we seek the felicity of man in the body only, men shal do great injury to the soule &amp; to our selves. For if it be in the body, it dyeth &amp; putrifieth with the body, which were a miserable estate. But wee seeke after the felicity of the whole man, and of his whole life, which cannot be in the body, except we take form &amp; beauty for it; that rather delighteth him that beholdeth it, than himselfe that hath it; which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so many wayes defaced and lost, with sicknesse, with a wound, or with the heat onely of the Sunne.

In the mind therfore our chiefe good must be, seeing we be willing to redeem the perfect estate of our mindsw<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the miseries of our bodies.</p>
               <p>Next unto this is the sensitive part, whose felicity <note place="margin">The sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> seemeth to bee in pleasure; but then were beasts more happy than men, that feele pleasures more sweetly and fully. And how soone are these pleasures ended with repentance also? It pleased the gods, (said <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>) that sorrow should follow pleasure as a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But wee seeke for the greatest or soveraigne good, and if it be good, it will amend men aud make them better. But what doth more weaken and corrupt men, than pleasures? and what doth lesse satisfie men, and more weary them? But wee looke not for that which doth finish, but that continueth our delight: whereas these pleasures contrariwise soone decay and quickly spoyle us: As <hi>Petrarke</hi> saith; <hi>Extrema gaudii luctus occupat:</hi> The extremity of joy and pleasure, sorrow doth possesse. The delight of the mind is greater and more meet for a man, and more agreeable to his end than
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:896:308"/>
the pleasures of the senses. And if choyce be given to him that hath passed all his life in pleasures, and hath but a few houres to come, either to enjoy the fairest curtisan in Rome, or else to deliver his countrey, who is so beastly or barbarous, that will not presently chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to delight his mind with so noble an act, than to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his senses with pleasure? And to conclude, the place of pleasures is in the senses; which are decayed &amp; taken away, by sicknesse, by wounds, by old age. And if these pleasures that be exercised by the sensitive part, will not sooner be abated, yet death will utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them. But seeing man hath two kindes of life, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and immortall, the one of which he preferreth as farre the better, before the other, we must not seeke for such an end or good as perish both together, but such as maketh men happy indeed, everlasting and immortall, which cannot be found in these transitory things.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the third part of the soule which is understanding, which is occupied sometimes in it selfe, <note place="margin">The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</note> sometimes in the matters of the world, and other while in the contemplation &amp; study of divine things. Of these three operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s springeth three habits; vertue, prudence, &amp; sapience. And seeing that understanding is the most excellent thing in man; let us see in which of these we may place our soveraigne good. For in this part of the soul the end &amp; beatitude of man must needs consist: for what thing can be imagined beyond man, beyond the world, &amp; beyond the Creator of both? That vertue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be his end or soveraigne good hath bin shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For vertue is nothing but the tranquility &amp; quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the affections: &amp; what be affections, but a sodaine tempest in the soule, that are raised by a very smal wind, which overthrow the mightiest ship that is in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:896:309"/>
and maketh the most skilfull mariners to strike saile, and reason it selfe to give over the stern. And if our end of felicity should be in vertue, what were more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable than man, that must fight continually against his affections, which neverthelesse will not be overcome, as the mariners labour to save themselves in a tempest from the raging of the sea, that gapeth every moment to devoure them. So that in this life vertue cannot bring us to felicity; and in the other life it can stand us in no stead, where wee shall have no affections. Therefore ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue cannot bee our end, or Soveraigne good.</p>
               <p>Neither is prudence the thing we seeke for, which is nothing but the right use of reason in exercising the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of this world. And what bee the affaires of this world, but contention, strifes, sutes, warres, bloudshed, spoile, murders, burnings, and sackings of townes and countries, with an infinite number of such like stuffe? Neither can they that have the charge of government in common-wealths (which are all subject to these things) be accounted happy, but they rather are happy, that are defended from them by their cares and unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>LEt vs now examine sapience (after <hi>Morney</hi>) as we have done the rest, or that part of wisedome, which is conversant in the contemplation of God, and divine matters; for that in all mens judgements, seemeth to bee a mostexcellent thing. By instinct of nature every man knoweth that there is a God; for the workes of God doe present him continually to us. But how should we enter throughly into the knowledge of the Creator of all things, when we know not the things before our eyes? <hi>Socrates</hi> confessed freely, that he knew this one thing, <hi>That he knew nothing.</hi> Which confession, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe thought, was the cause he was by the Oracle called the wisest man of his time. And <hi>Porphyrius</hi> said, that all <note place="margin">Nothing certaine in philosophy.</note> Philosophy was but a conjecture or light perswasion, delivered from one to another, and nothing in it that was not doubtfull, and disputable. But he that knoweth God in this, wherein is hee the more happy? Reason sheweth us that God is good, that he is just: that hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the good, and hateth the evill.

<pb n="678" facs="tcp:896:310"/>
himselfe to contemplation, climbeth higher: God is immortall, immutable, impassible; that God dyeth not like a man; nor is altered or moved. And when he is come thither, he is at the wall, his minde can goe no further. And what kind of knowledge is this? What madnesse is it to take upon us to know a thing by that it is not? Shall we perswade our selves that wee know what thing a Camell is, because wee know it is not a Frogge? So that our highest knowledge, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to be meere ignorance. And who will place mans <note place="margin">Our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge meere ignorance.</note> end or soveraigne good and felicity in ignorance? But those that climbe highest to search for knowledge, fall into such errors, and entangle themselves in such labyrinthes, that they know not how to winde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out: But as men that looke stedfastly upon the Sunne, the more they behold the brightnesse thereof, the more their eyes dazell, untill they become starke blind: so happeneth it to them that aspire to the knowledge of God and divine things, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

good in this life, but in the other life; without doubt (saith he) they that follow vertue, shalbe rewarded with beatitude. And <hi>Pythagoras</hi> saith, that man as it were banished from the face of God, walketh as a stranger in this world. And <hi>Hermes</hi> saith, that the end of man is to live by his minde, and the life of the mind is God. Thus farre the Philosophers knowledge did reach, that the end of man is to live by his minde, that his soveraigne good or beatitude is not to be enjoyed in this life, but is to be found in the other life with God. But they wanted faith to carry them whither their wisedome could not reach. For that knowledge of God we attaine unto in this life by naturall wisedome, is ignorance; by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, faith. In vaine therefore we seeke here either by action or contemplation, the thing that is not here to be found. For <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>de, and the end of all blessednesse. In seeking then for this end and soveraigne good of man, <note place="margin">Christian considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> we finde that the world was made for man, man for the soule, the soule for the mind, the mind for some higher cause, which is God. For the world was not of it selfe; nor for it selfe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t was made of some and for some. So man not having his being of himselfe, cannot be the end of himselfe. He that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eth any thing, maketh it not for it, but for himselfe, so that he is the end thereof: neither is the thing good in it selfe, but to him that made it, as touching that he made it to his own use. He therefore is the good of that thing, by whom and for whom it is called good. And seeing man is made by God, and for God, he must needes be his end, and the greatest good. So (saith <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>By this it appeareth, that after the ancient wise men, and better sort of Philosophers that were guided by reason onely, the felicity or beatitude and soveraigne good of man, must not be sought for in this life, but in the other life.

betweene them and it, is a great deepe gulfe, over which no man is able to passe, nor all the world is able to fill it up: yet there must needs be a passage over som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: for the end of man is certaine, to bee joyned with God. And that he may be joyned with him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it is requisite that he be reconciled to him in earth. And the onely way to be reconciled is, that God pay our debts: and untill they be payd he doth not absolve us. That therefore is the onely true religion, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us directly to that passage, by whose conduction we find out the right way over it: which onely leadeth us to the end of religion, that is, mans salvation: for true religion is the right way to reconcile us to God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">True religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to what it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And that the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may be discerned from those that bee the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, it hath three markes by which it is made apparent. But first this foundation must be taken for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and immoveable, as laid upon a rocke, that true religion is a rule of the worshipping of God, by which man is reconciled and tyed to God for his owne salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This salvation of man is his beatitude, his beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is to be joyned with God. For neither the world, nor any thing in it, maketh a man happy or blessed, but God onely that made man, maketh him happy. And seeing it is manifest that he and no other must bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped in the earth, that will make us happy or blessed in heaven, what religion soever, though it shew to be very singular and very holy, diverteth and draweth our minds and prayers from the Creator, to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is idolatry and wickednesse. And what religion shall perswade us, to seeke our soveraigne good and beatitude any other where, than with him that is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, and the only author of good, is not only vanity
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:896:313"/>
and erroneous, but it leadeth out of the way to kill, and throweth down head long to destroy. And though they have offerings and thankesgiving, sacrifices, prayers, and other observances, they are vaine and blasphemous, if we attribute that to a creature, how excellent soever he be, which we received of God: and desire pardon of creatures, for the sinnes and offences wee commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">A gainst prayer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note> the Creator. Let this therefore be the first marke of true religion, that it doth direct us, and our prayers and advocations to one God, the Creator of heaven and earth, who only searcheth mens hearts, with which hee will bee chiefly worshipped. But this is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to worship the true God, but he must bee rightly worshipped. But who is so arrogant to take upon him to enter into the knowledge and secrets of God, as to prescribe a rule, by which God is to be worshipped? We must flye unto God for his helpe, poore wretches as we are, to whom wee are not able to goe, except hee vouchsafe to come downe unto vs. The Sunne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be seene without the Sunne; no more can God be knowne without his helpe and light. No man can wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God except he know him, and no man can know him, except hee discover himselfe to him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what worship is meete for him can be knowne of none, except hee vouchsafe to reveale himselfe in his word and oracles. For, that God cannot be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped but by the prescript of his owne will, both the consciences of all men, and God himselfe in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word doth testifie. <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> In vaine doe they worship mee, who teach the doctrines and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men. And this therefore is the second marke, <note place="margin">A second marke of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> that the religion teacheth the worshipping of God, leaning upon the word of God, and revealed of God
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:896:314"/>
himselfe. But this neither is sufficient, that the religion we seeke for, teacheth us to worship the true God, and that by Gods word and appointment: for God gave us a law out of his owne mouth, according to his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and justice, that wee might be holy like him. But if we cannot of our selves know God, nor how to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, how can we, after he revealed himselfe to us, and gave us a law to worship him, performe our duty to God, and fulfill the law? We ought to loue God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, and for his sake whatsoever beareth his image, though wee never knew or saw him before: But who dare arrogate to himselfe such a perfect charity, to love his neighbour as hee ought, and for his sake that hee ought? that is, no otherwise than for himselfe, and for God. But if wee examine our coldnesse in the love of God, wee shall perceive the reflexion thereof to our neighbour to bee frozen. And therefore, the third marke is, that the religion we seeke, must helpe us to a <note place="margin">A third marke.</note> means whereby Gods justice must be satisfied; without which not only all other religions are vain and of none effect, but that also which seemeth to have the keeping of the worshipping of God. So that the Heathens saw by instinct of nature, and by reason, that there is a God, and that mans soveraigne good is to bee joyned with God, and that some way to the same was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which they thought to bee any religion which they had invented to worship and adore him. And hereof came their magicke, and idolatry, and superstitious ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of their owne invention. But the right way is beyond their reach, and a great deale higher than it can be found out by men: for there is a great difference betweene, to know that God must bee worshipped, and to know how hee should rightly bee worshipped.
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:896:314"/>
                  <hi>Hierocles</hi> saith, that religion is the study of wisedome, consisting in the purgation and perfection of life: by which we are joyned againe and made like to God. And the way (saith he) to that purgation, is to enter into our conscience, to search out our sinnes, and confesse them to God. But here they are all gravelled and at a stand: for of the confession of our sinnes followeth death and damnation, except God that is Iustice it selfe, and most good, and to evill most contrary, be pacified, and made mercifull to us sinners. But we seeke for the true and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting life in religion, and not immortall death.</p>
               <p>Seing then that the end of man in this life is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to God, that hee may bee joyned with him in the other life which is his soveraigne good and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or beatitude; and that the way to returne to God is religion, and that as there is one true God, so there can be but one true religion: whose markes be to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the true God, and that by the appointment of his owne word; and such as reconcileth man to God: let us see what religion hath the same markes, and meanes. That the Israelites worshipped the true God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of heaven, is apparant by the confession also of some of the learned Heathens. <hi>Seneca</hi> said, the basest peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (meaning the Iewes) gave lawes unto all the world: that is, they onely worshipped the true God, the <note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

But the Painims worshipped goddes of their owne making, sometimes men, and sometimes divels, that are enemies to God. Such was the blindnesse of
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:896:315"/>
man in the matters of God, and his vanitie and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the matters pertaining to his salvation, after the corruption received by his fall. But it is certaine and manifest by that which hath beene said, that man was placed in this world to worshippe God his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, which worshippe wee call religion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as soone as man was in the world, there was without doubt, also religion: for mans band and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant towards God, was made even with man, the very same day that hee was created; that is, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of man towards God, which is religion or godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

In the religion also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that book, is the third marke, that is, the means by which men may be reconciled to God. And because this is the principall part of religion; to make it more plaine, wee must make a repetition of some thing that hath been said. Man is immortall &amp; his soveraigne good or beatitude is not to bee had in this life; but it is to bee joyned with God in heaven: to which hee shall attaine, if whilst he is here upon the earth, he love and worship God with all his heart, and bee obedient continually to his will. But our first parent, that was by nature free and capable of goodnesse, revolted from God; that is, from his soveraigne good; and by his rebellion was made a flave to sinne; by means whereof he fell from God, and from his beatitude. And therefore, except he find par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don by grace, he is fallen into extreame misery, which we call hell. From this man wee derive our pedegree, whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath begotten our flesh, and made us the servants of sinne, as hee was made himselfe: so that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we are to expect the reward of sin, that is, death: for wee are heires to our father, whose inheritance is death onely and damnation. And we heape daily more coales upon our heads: For no man performeth that to God, which the law most justly requireth: and therefore every one daily offendeth God many waies in thought, word, and deede: so as they sinke continually deeper. And against whom do wee commit these offences? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Father, our Creator, that hath bestowed so many things upon us, from whom we revolt to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:896:316"/>
his enemy. And as the offence doth multiply and encrease, according to the respect of him against whom it is committed; so doth the offence against his divine Majestie, that is infinite, deserve punishment. In what case then are wee miserable creatures, that dayly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sinne upon sin, except God himselfe discover some way how his justice may by satisfied, and how wee may come into his favour againe? In this distresse religion presenteth it selfe to us, which sheweth us the true God. But what is that but to present the guilty before the Iudge? What doth religion then availe us? It leadeth <note place="margin">Religion leadeth us to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> us to the Scripture, which sheweth the expresse will of God to bee, that we should love him with all our heart, and our neighbour as our selfe: and to them that obey his will he pronounceth eternall life; to the disobedient eternall death: Seeing the same Scripture sheweth, that mankind is corrupted from the beginning, and that all our imaginations and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are wicked, and seeing we all feele in our selves, and in our members, motions contrary to the will of God; and therefore wee detest with horrour, the botomelesse pit of hell. But as this Scripture pronounceth against us our condemnation, and a severe sentence of death; so doth it also shew us a Mediator, by whose helpe and meanes we may obtaine pardon and grace, and be reconciled to God againe. In which conjunction that beatitude and felicity may bee restored to us, for which wee were created at the first. And this is the third marke of the true religion: for it is certaine, that the religion which God hath so deepely engraven in our hearts, is not in vaine.</p>

And for as much as the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is infinite, and the punishment likewise, being committed against the Creator, which is infinite, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the punishment must also be infinite. If man should offer the world to God, hee received it of God, and by his owne fault hath lost it againe. And seeing God made the world of nothing, which must also have an end, the world can bee no sufficient satisfaction for the offence that is infinite. If man offer himselfe, what doth hee offer but an unthankfull and rebellious mind, blasphemous wordes, and perverse deeds, by which hee shall provoke the wrath of God, and incense him the more against us? If an Angell should intreat for us, a creature will bee no sufficient Intercessor to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiethe the Creator: and though hee bee good, yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinite, hee cannot cover an infinite evill: So that we must needs say, that God must set himselfe between his justice and his mercy: and that as hee created us at the first, so he must new make us againe: and as he created us in his favour, so hee must absolve us from his wrath: and as hee declared hi wisedome in creating us, so hee must shew the same in restoring us. But who then is
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:896:317"/>
that Mediator? God against God? Infinite against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, <note place="margin">Who and what the Mediator is.</note> that can both cancel that infinit obligation, &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie that infinite punishment? It is even Iesus Christ the only Sonne and wisedome of the eternall Father, both God and man. A man, that he may be borne under the law; God, that he may fulfill the law: a man, that he may serve, God, that he may redeem: a man, that he may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himselfe with all humility; God, that he may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself above all things: a man, that he may suffer; God, that he may overcome a man, that he may die God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

It is also necessary to our salvation, that our Mediatour be a man, that he may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer punishment for our sins, and reconcile mankinde to God againe. For except he were descended of the same kinde we are, wee could not bee partakers in any sort of him, nor he of us; &amp; so should his satisfaction &amp; merits appertain nothing unto us: therfore it is requisit that he should be borne of our progeny, that he may be flesh of our flesh, bones of our bones: that as we be all in <hi>Adam</hi> the servants of sinne, so we may be in the Mediatour free and discharged of the reward of sin, that is, from death: &amp; againe, he must overcom sin, he must be without sin; and because he must make us cleane, he must be without spo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And though the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bee put into the ground, diversly affected, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to putrifaction, yet hee shall revive and rise againe with a lively countenance, cleansed from all the defects and corruptions of nature.

It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by many reasons and examples that the felicity of man wee seeke for, consisteth not in pleasures which is common to brute beasts, neither in riches, which are sought for some other thing, rather than for it selfe; as reputation, honour, &amp; such like: nor in honour &amp; glory, which is but a vaine admiration of the people, by whom it is many times given &amp; taken away: and is also desired for an opinion of vertue: but that wherin felicity consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, is the last end to which all other ends are referred: to which end whosoever hath attained, hee proceedeth no further, but resteth settled. And it is peculiar and proper to men alone: neyther is it in vertue, nor in the action of vertue, after the Academickes, and Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="709" facs="tcp:896:325"/>
be a helpe to the attaining of felicity, especially that of this life: for no man is able to endure the things that happen to men, though hee bee armed with all manner of vertues, with that minde that hee may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse bee accounted happy. For felicity in one part and contentation may not be dissevered: and the end or true felicity of man, which is all one, consisteth not in morall vertues, as hath beene said: but his end and proper action is the glory of God, to know and worship him. We shewed before, that in seeking for fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity respect must be had to the body and soule, to this life, and to the life to come. For Christ saith, What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayleth it a man to have all the world, and to lose his soule? And because there seemeth to be a kind of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse in the world, and men are said to live happily; we called the happinesse of this life, felicity; and that of the heavenly life, beatitude or blessednesse, and soveraigne good. But when we had examined all the estates of life, and could find none worthy to be called felicity, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subject to troubles and unquietnesse, and full of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, wee were driven to use violence to the word, and to call that happinesse of life, felicity, wherein is least infelicity: in the managing of which discourse, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth how little power is in men, to the attaining of felicity, and that all commeth from God: and therefore we call Felicity, the contentation of a faithfull mind in a godly life and death, which commeth by the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods benefits and graces: yet neverthelesse our owne endeavour must bee thereto imployed with the meanes which hee hath given us, and continuall praiers, that he will blesse our labors according to his good will and pleasure: which if it succeed not to the happinesse wee looke for in this life, yet to take all things patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

by which we may not only be taught advisedly to beware that wee be not intrapped by them: but also that wee leave to wonder at honours, riches, pleasures and the vanities of a delicate life; which the common sort doth most marvell at. For seeing for the most part they are bestowed upon those that are unworthy, and have never any certaine place, nor sure ground, they ought to bee called very cares, and painefull labours, and the frumps of fortune, rather than the instruments of felicitie. And if it be true, as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith; That Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie healeth mens mindes, driveth away careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, delivereth from cupidities or desires, expelleth fearfulnesse: then of much more force is divine Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siphie, joyned with it, to bring these things to passe. But (saith he) this power of Philosophy is not of like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie with all men; yet it prevaileth greatly, where it hath gotten an ant nature. Our mindes have their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And thought the inordinate desires of pleasures, riches honour and pompe of the world, hath taken so deepe roote in the multitude or greater part of men, that it will be as hard a matter and great a labour to purge them of those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill humors, as it was for <hi>Hercules</hi> to draw <hi>Cerber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

so some minds are so tractable, and apt by a naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, to receive and embrace reasonable and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perswasions, that they digest them into a good nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment and habit, and reape thereby many times great comfort and profit. And if the counsels or sayings of the ancient Philosophers and other learned men seeme to any (in some part) too severe or hard to be observed, let them consider, that a staffe that is warpt and grown crooked, must be bent as much to the contrary side, that at last he may come to the meane, be made streight, and brought to his right place. This fruit men may reape by this discourse, that are not wholly drowned in worldly desires: When they have compared the counsels &amp; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of wise and learned men, with those of the vulgar sort, they shall perceive themselves, as it were awaked out of a long slumber, and plainely see, that by corrupt judgment, following the trace and course of the world, yeelding to their owne motions and desires, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselves to bee overcome with their affections and cupidities, they fall from happinesse they seek after into felicity and misrie. But in so great diversities of mens inelmations, it is not possible that any one thing can please or profit all men.
