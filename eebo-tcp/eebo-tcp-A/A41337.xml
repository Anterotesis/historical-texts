         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Propoſals for the Employment of the Poor,
and for the Prevention of Idleneſs, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is now above four years ſince I erected my Work-Houſe
in <hi>Little Britain</hi> for the Imployment of the Poor
in the Linnen Manufacture, which hath proved ſo great
a Help, and afforded ſuch Relief to many Hundreds of
poor Families, that I never did, nor I fear ever ſhall do an
Action more to my own ſatisfaction, nor to the good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Poor.</p>
            <p>In a former <hi>Letter</hi> that I wrote upon this occaſion, I gave
you ſome account of the management of the ſaid Work-houſe,
eſpecially with relation to the Pariſh of <hi>Alderſgate;</hi> which
<hi>Letter</hi> being wholly out of Print, and much deſired by ſome
perſons, I ſhall here inſert the chief things conteined therein,
with what elſe hath come into my thoughts concerning that
matter; hoping that when the great benefit of ſuch an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
ſhall be made publick, every good man will ſome
way or other give incouragement to it; there being nothing
ſo neceſſary for the prevention of Poverty and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
thereof, Begging, as to provide ſome Imployment for
our Poor People, whereby to prevent Idleneſs, the Mother
and Nurſe of all Miſchief, and one of thoſe ſins for which
God deſtroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> with Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven,
as the Holy Scripture informs us.</p>
            <p>To the end therefore that Poverty, together with that
wicked Trade of Begging (which ſo many thouſands of late
years have taken up, to the diſhonour of Almighty God, and
the great ſcandal of the Government of this Nation) may be
prevented, I ſhall humbly propoſe a few things, which being
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94424:3"/>
put in practice, may with Gods Bleſſing, prove effectual to the
ends deſigned.</p>
            <p>And the firſt is this, That every Pariſh that abounds with
Poor People, would ſet up a School in the nature of a Work-houſe,
to teach their poor Children to work in, who for
want thereof, now wander up and down the Pariſh and parts
adjacent, and between Begging and Stealing, get a ſorry live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but never bring any thing to their poor Parents, nor
earn one Farthing towards their own maintenance, or good
of the Nation.</p>
            <p>This, in a ſhort time, would be found very advantagious,
not only to the poor Children themſelves, who by this means,
whilſt young ſhould be inured to labour, and taught to get
their own Livings, but alſo to their Parents, who ſhould
hereby both be freed from the Charge of keeping them, and
in time, be helpt by their Labours, as it is in other places;
and moreover the Pariſh ſhould be freed from much Charge
which many times they are at, to keep ſuch poor Children, or
at leaſt which they are neceſſitated to allow their Parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it.</p>
            <p>Nothing being accounted a better Argument for a large
Penſion, than that a Man or Woman hath ſix or ſeven ſmall
Children, whereas unleſs they were all born at a time, or came
faſter into the World than ordinarily ſo many Children do,
it is very hard if ſome of them are not able to work for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
I my ſelf have at this time many poor Children, not
above five or ſix years old, that can earn two pence a day,
and others but a little older, three pence or four pence, by
ſpinning Flax which will go very far towards the maintenance
of any poor Child. Not that I would have theſe Schools con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
only to Spinning, but left at liberty to take in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
work that the Children ſhall be capable of, as knitting of
Stockings, winding of Silk, making of Lace or plain Work, or
the like: For it matters not ſo much what you employ theſe
poor Children in, as that you do employ them in ſome thing,
to prevent an idle, lazy kind of Life, which if once they get
the habit of, they will hardly leave; but on the contrary, if
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94424:3"/>
you train up a Child in the way that he ſhould go, when he
is old, he will not depart from it.</p>
            <p>And this is the way (as I am informed) that is practiced in
<hi>Holland</hi> and other places, with ſo great advantage, that there
is very few Children who have attained to ſeven or eight years
of age, that are any charge to their Parents, or burthenſome
to the Pariſh. And Mr. <hi>Chamberlain</hi> in his Book, Intituled,
<hi>The Preſent State of</hi> England, hath obſerved, that in the City
of <hi>Norwich,</hi> it hath been computed of late years, and found,
that yearly, Children from ſix to ten years old, have gained
twelve thouſand pounds a year more than they have ſpent,
chiefly by knitting fine Jerſey Stockings.</p>
            <p>This School would be of no great Charge, but many ways
advantagious to the Pariſh. At this time I have a perſon who
for five ſhillings a week, doth conſtantly teach between twenty
and thirty poor Children to ſpin; Some that are little, upon
the ſingle Wheel, and others that are bigger, upon the double, or
two handed Wheel (like that which you have at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of theſe Papers, which I eſteem the beſt way for ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and full as proper for Wooll as Flax) which when they
are expert in, I give the Children leave to carry away with
them to their ſeveral places of abode, that ſo there may be
room for others; and of theſe, there are divers that can earn
ſix pence a day, and ſome more, allowing them two hours in
a day to learn to read in, inſtead of that time which is allotted
to the pooreſt of our Children to play in; a cuſtom that I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believe hath been the ruin of many thouſand poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and hath nothing in the World to juſtifie it but an old
Proverb, which yet we have not fully obſerved: For inſtead
of giving them all work and no play, the generality of our
poor Children have all play and no work, which is a thouſand
times more miſchievous than the other. Not that I would
have all manner of Recreation and Divertiſement prohibited
to Children, nor will it be hard to find ſome others beſides
playing at puſh-pin, or hide-Farthing, neither of which, nor
twenty others now in uſe, are any ways conducing to the
health of their Bodies, or to the improvement of their minds;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94424:4"/>
but are only fit to teach them lying and wrangling, with
twenty cheating Tricks, which many times they retain as long
as they live.</p>
            <p>I believe there are very few perſons who have had occaſion
to take one of theſe poor Children for a Foot-boy, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
but can tell you the ſad Effects of ſuch an idle Life as
they have been brought up in; the Lad having from his Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
if he had any, been permitted to play, has made it ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to him, that ſend him in what haſte you will, upon any
Errand, if he meets with a Play-fellow, will have a touch of
his old Sport, and many times for want of ſuch a one, will be
exerciſing his hand alone, rather than forbear his old Trade.</p>
            <p>Let any man that hath occaſion either to walk or ride
through the Out-parts of this City, (where moſtly our poor
people inhabit) tell but what he hath ſeen of the Rudeneſs of
young Children, who for want of better Education and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
ſhall ſometimes be found by whole Companies at
play, where they ſhall wrangle and cheat one another, and
upon the leaſt Provocation, ſwear and fight for a Farthing,
or elſe they ſhall be found whipping of Horſes, by reaſon of
which, they ſometimes caſt their Riders, to the hazard or loſs
of their Lives or Limbs; or elſe they ſhall be throwing of Dirt
or Stones into Coaches, or at the Glaſſes, inſomuch that I have
been a hundred times greatly troubled, to ſee the Rudeneſs
and Miſbehaviour of the poorer ſort of Children, (eſpecially
of late years) they having been generally ſo much neglected,
that they have neither been taught their Duties either towards
God or Man.</p>
            <p>To me it ſeems very ſtrange, that ſuch Children whoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
receive any Penſion from the Pariſh, or that are brought
up at the Charge of the ſeveral Pariſhes or in Hoſpitals, as
ſoon as they come to ſix or ſeven years old, are not taught to
do ſomething towards their own Maintenance, which is the
way in <hi>Holland,</hi> as hath been ſaid. There the Children in
Hoſpitals, as ſoon as they come to any Bigneſs, are two hours
in a day, to wit, from Five to Seven in the Morning, taught
to read and write; but when ſeven a Clock comes, they are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94424:4"/>
by a Bell called to Breakfaſt, which when they have eaten,
every one hath their ſeveral Employment allotted to them for
all the day after, excepting only ſuch time as they have to eat
in. The Boys are ſent to the Ship-yard to pick Okum, to
turn the Wheel for the Rope-maker, to wind Quils for the
Weaver, or to braid Nets, or the like: the Girls to Spin, to
Knit, to weave Lace, or to work with the Needle, or ſome
ſuch like Employment as they are fit for; ſo that as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
a thouſand Children ſhall be brought up with leſs Charge
in <hi>Holland,</hi> than five hundred here; and I cannot apprehend
what Harm ſuch a <hi>Dutch</hi> Trick would do us, if we had Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
enough to practice it.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid that their Children are not maintained ſo well,
nor learnt ſo much as generally our Children in Hoſpitals are;</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 'Tis ſo much the better, for why ſhould poor
Children that muſt be put out to poor Trades, where they
muſt work hard, and fare hardly, be fed with white Bread,
or taught farther than is neceſſary for ſuch Trades? Is not this
to make them too big for their Buſineſs, which is always for
the worſe? Why, I pray muſt a poor Boy that is deſigned
for a Maſon, Bricklayer, Shoomaker, or the like honeſt and
neceſſary Trade, be taught to write as if he were deſigned
for a Maſter in that Art; or ſo far in Arithmetick, as if he
were deſigned for a Merchant? Is it not enough that ſuch Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are taught to read the Bible, and ſo much of Arithmetick
and Writing, as may fit them for ſuch Trades and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as they are intended to be put unto? And muſt Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
be kept from ſeven to fifteen Years old, to learn ſo much,
when two hours in a day would be more than enough to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it? And all the reſt of their Time might be ſpent in doing
ſomething or other that might help to keep them, and be by
degrees, inured to the Work and Buſineſs for which they are
deſigned and intended. This in a very ſhort time, however
it may ſeem hard at firſt, would be much more pleaſant to the
Children themſelves, than ſitting eight or ten hours in a day
under a ſevere School-Maſter, who many times ſhall whip a
poor Child for not remembring or elſe for miſtaking a few
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94424:5"/>
words, as ſeverely as a Rogue in <hi>Bridewel,</hi> for picking a Pocket,
or cutting a Purſe.</p>
            <p>I am well aware from ſome Diſcourſes that I have met with
of late, that what I have ſaid in this particular, will give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to ſome whom I am very unwilling to diſpleaſe; And
that they will object the great prejudice which will be done
to ſome Children of good parts, if they ſhould be hindered
in their Learning, by the Advantage of which, if their Trades
failed, they might be able to teach Arithmetick, or Writing,
or to keep Merchants Accounts.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, that there is no danger, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Handy-craft Trades ſhould fail: As long as People are born
naked, there will be need of Shomakers, Taylors, Weavers,
and ſuch like; and as for thoſe that may be able to teach A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick,
Writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there neither is, nor I believe, ever
will be any want of ſuch Perſons, even among them, which
received their Education from their Parents, and not upon
Charity: Nay, I dare ſay, there is ſo many of theſe at preſent,
that not one half of them can be provided for in thoſe ways.
Not but that if a poor Lad were found of extraordinary Parts,
he might be permitted a more liberal Education; but the
number of theſe is very few, and to give it unto others, is to
do them and the Commonwealth a great prejudice. I my
ſelf have known ſome perſons kept ſeven or eight years at
School, to learn the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, which have ſtood them
in very little ſtead afterwards, being gone from School they
have ſoon loſt it, and thereby all the time they ſpent to gain
it; whereas, if they had inſtead thereof, been taught ſome
uſeful Art or other, they might have been the better for it
as long as they lived. It is very well known, that at this
time, there is hardly Employment for one half of the Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that are in <hi>England.</hi> Yea, ſome will tell you, that there
are not above ten thouſand Livings in <hi>England,</hi> and that there
are above thirty thouſand men in Orders to ſupply them. I
am not bound to make good the truth of this Computation,
but ſure I am, that great Multitudes want Employment, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94424:5"/>
that if the ſmalleſt Living or Lecture ſhall be void, there will
be many Competitors for it. Alſo, ſome will tell you, that
the number of thoſe that pretend to the Law of late years, are
ſo much increas'd, that many of them (Thanks be to God)
want Employment, although there are a ſort of men in the
Country (as I am informed) that make it their Buſineſs to ſet
men together by the Ears, and ride from Market to Market
upon but a very little better account, not but that I think
and know there are many worthy men of that Profeſſion, I
heartily wiſh they were all ſuch; 'tis only thoſe that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of incouraging Suits and Quarrels, that I am offended with,
and if they are offended with me for ſaying thus much, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now help it.</p>
            <p>But not to forget the Objection, pray let it be conſidered
before you ingage perſons in a liberal Education, how they
ſhall be maintained in it? and before you ſend Lads to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
and <hi>Oxford,</hi> how they ſhall be kept there; if any man
will be ſo kind to do it for a poor Boy, 'tis very well, and I
for my part have nothing to ſay againſt it: otherwiſe, I am
very ſure, and know it by ſad Experience, that for want of ſuch
Supplies, ſome have been ſent to thoſe places, that had better
have ſtayed away, and been put to ſome honeſt Trade, by
which they might have lived more comfortably themſelves,
and more profitably for the Nation: but at the Rate that ſome
would order the matter, the Plough, the Sea, and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
which are the great Concerns of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be
wholly neglected, as being too mean Employments for the
pooreſt of our Children. He that hath a mind to ſee more of
this, let him read <hi>Britania Languens,</hi> pag. 100. 102. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
pag. 133.</p>
            <p>But that I may after ſo long a Digreſſion return to the Bufi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
I was upon, to encourage the ſetting up of Schools for
the Inſtruction of young Children, and bringing them to ſome
Employment, whereby to get their own Living, the Charge
hereof, as hath been ſaid, would not be great, but the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
very many; and among others, this is not the leaſt,
That the Parents of ſuch poor Children would have more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94424:6"/>
time to follow their Buſineſs and Employments, and that with
more Content and Satisfaction, when their Children were not
only kept out of Harms way, but were learning ſomething
that would do them ſome good at preſent, and more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
all the Trouble they ſhould have, being only in the
Morning, to dreſs them with ſuch poor Rags as they had to
put upon them, and to give them ſome ſmall matter for their
Dinner, and to fetch them home at Night, if they were too
ſmall to go home alone: for at this School, I would have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
taken in from three to ten years old, thoſe of the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſort might be taught their Letters, and to read till they
were able to Spin, or do ſome other work, and even then I
would have two hours in a day at leaſt, allotted to theſe poor
Children, to learn ſome plain and uncontroverted Catechiſm,
that might teach them the Principles of Religion, and alſo to
perfect their Reading, which through the Bleſſing of God,
might be a means to prevent much of that Ignorance and
Wickedneſs that is found amongſt our poor People, and bring
them to Sobriety and Virtue, which being once done, they
will of their own Accord, naturally fall to ſome honeſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
without which, 'tis impoſſible they ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
good, or happily enjoy themſelves.</p>
            <p>That this is a way that would very much conduce to the
Happineſs of poor people, and their poor Children, I have
found by very much Experience, having at this time ſeveral
poor Children at my Work-houſe, that over and beſides their
learning to read, have learnt to ſpin both upon the ſingle and
double Wheel, and can earn from two pence to ſix pence a
day, as hath been ſaid; which, every <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, I cauſe
to be paid to the Children, to carry home to their poor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
or elſe, cauſe to be laid out for themſelves in ſuch things
as they need.</p>
            <p>But before you enter the Child upon the double Wheel, or
ſuffer it to ſpin with both hands, you muſt teach it to ſpin
well with either hand upon the ſingle Wheel, which is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Foot as the other is, by means whereof, you may
teach the Child to draw out the Flax with either hand indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94424:6"/>
and to be as nimble and quick with one hand as with
the other; otherwiſe, when it comes to ſpin upon the double
Wheel, which hath a Quill for each hand, the Threads will
not be alike, but one will be more twiſted, and the other
leſs; it may be, the one will be too much, and the other too
little, and ſo will not do well together. In this School, are
taught Boys as well as Girls, which they take very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
and for want of other Employment, they may be kept at,
till they are fit to go to Prentice, or to do other Buſineſs;
and the Girls, till they are fit to go to Service, and no longer:
For it is a thing greatly complained of in the Country alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that by reaſon of ſo great numbers of Single Perſons that
of late are fallen to the Spinning Trade, and to live at their
own Hands, there is ſo great a want of Servants, that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hard for the meaner ſort to get a Supply, unleſs upon
much higher terms than formerly; and the like would ſoon be
here, if Single Perſons that were come to any Age, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to live at their own Hands: For which reaſon, and
ſome others, I have taken ſpecial care, that no perſon that is
fit to go to Service, or to Prentice, ſhall have any of my Work.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid in this particular, touching the
great Benefit that would ariſe to every Pariſh, by ſetting up
ſuch a School for the Ends above ſpecified, I would adviſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perſon that had a mind to ſettle any thing upon a poor
Pariſh, to appropriate it to ſome ſuch uſe as this, rather than
to give it at large to the Pariſh, to be diſpoſed of at their
pleaſure: For this would be in effect, rather to eaſe the Rich,
than to help the Poor, it being too well known, that ſeveral
Pariſhes that have great Incomes for their Poor, have yet their
Poor as ill provided for, as thoſe that have leſs.</p>
            <p>If therefore I had a 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Year to ſettle upon a poor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
I would do it after ſome ſuch way as this:</p>
            <p>Twenty pounds a Year I would appoint for an able and
honeſt Woman, to teach forty of the pooreſt Children to read,
and to ſpin Flax or Hemp, firſt upon the Single, and then
upon the Double Wheel, which when they had well learned,
they would be in a capacity to get their own Living.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94424:7"/>
Five pounds a year I would allot for the Rent of a Large
Room to teach the Children in; Twenty five pounds a year
I would aſſign for the buying of Hemp and Flax to teach the
Children to ſpin upon.</p>
            <p>Twenty five pounds a year I would allot for the payment
of the poor Children that ſhould ſpin the ſame, allowing one
penny for every 600 yards of Yarn, which the Children ſhould
every week be paid for and carry home to their poor Parents,
or elſe be laid out for them in ſuch things as they needed.</p>
            <p>Fifteen pounds a year I would allot for the Weaving of ſuch
Yarn, and whitening ſuch Cloth as ſhould be made of the
Yarn.</p>
            <p>Eight pounds a year I would allot for the buying ſuch
Wheels and Reels, as the poor Children ſhould uſe; which, at
their going out of the Houſe I would have given unto them.</p>
            <p>The remaining two pounds, I would appoint to be laid out
for a Dinner for the Truſtees, which ſhould be upon a day
prefixt, upon which day they ſhould audite the Accounts for
the Year paſt, and diſtribute the Cloth which was made,
ſome of it to the poor Children that ſpun the Yarn, and the
reſt to other poor people in the Pariſh, eſpecially the aged
and impotent, it being more eaſy for them to get a Meals
meat, to feed their hungry Bodies, than a Shirt to cover them;
neither is the Charity much leſs to cloath the Naked, than to
feed the Hungry; nor the Promiſe greater to the one than to
the other. However, by ſuch a deed of Charity, I ſhould do
both; and alſo by teaching the Children to read, and learn
their Catechiſms, you ſhould inſtruct their minds, which is a
piece of Charity no whit inferiour to the feeding their Bodies,
or clothing their Backs: For without Knowledge, <hi>Solomon</hi>
ſaith, <hi>The Heart cannot be good;</hi> and God by the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
That his People periſh for lack of Knowledge.</p>
            <p>This Settlement I would ſo make, that it ſhould not be in
the Power of the Pariſh, nor yet of the Truſtees to alienate
to any other uſe or purpoſe whatſoever; but upon ſo doing,
it ſhould come to the Hoſpital of <hi>Chriſt Church,</hi> or ſome ſuch
like Foundation; the Governours whereof, would always
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94424:7"/>
take care that the Trnſt were performed, or in caſe it was not
would ſoon take it out of their hands.</p>
            <p>Having this propoſed (as I conceive) a very likely way to
prevent Idleneſs in the younger ſort, my next Care muſt be
to prevent it in thoſe that are of Age, which I judge may be
done by each Pariſh, if they would provide ſuch Work for
them, as they might carry to their own Homes, which though
never ſo mean and homely, are more deſirable than any other
place, which alſo is the way that I have taken in the Pariſh
aforeſaid, and which is the way that all the Countries take for
the Spinning of thoſe vaſt Quantities of Yarn, which is every
Year made uſe of, for the making of Bays, Sayes, Serges, and
Stuffs of all ſorts. And that which ſome of late have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of bringing them to a publick Work-houſe, will never effect
the end deſired; for ſuppoſe a Woman hath a ſick Child, or
Husband, or ſome Infirmity upon her ſelf, in all which Caſes,
ſhe may do ſomething at home, but cannot leave her own
Houſe: and ſuppoſing that none of theſe ſhould happen, which
is yet very frequent, not one perſon of many, will endure the
Thoughts of going to a publick Work-houſe. Sometimes it
happens, nay, very frequently I have known, that Perſons of
good Education and well related, have fal'n into great Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which for theſe Reaſons, and leſt they ſhould fall into
Contempt by the Diſcovery, they are willing to hide as much
as they can, and therefore cannot expoſe themſelves to work
in a publick place. True indeed, for Vagrants and ſturdy
Beggars that have no Habitation, and that will not work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they are held to it as Galley-ſlaves are tied to their Oars;
ſuch Work-houſes are very neceſſary, and I wiſh we had more
of them, and that thoſe we have were employed to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
but for ſuch poor People as have Habitations of their
own, and are known in the places where they live, and that
would take Pains at home, it is altogether unreaſonable and
unprofitable in my poor Judgment to bring them to a publick
Work-houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But againſt this, of every Bodies carrying their Work
to their own Houſes, it will be objected, what Aſſurance can
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94424:8"/>
you have, that theſe poor People to whom you deliver your
Flax and Hemp to ſpin, will bring it home again? They may
die, and what will become of it then, or they may pawn it,
or run away with it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To all which I anſwer, that it is poſſible that one or
all of theſe may happen as they have done ſometimes among
thoſe that I have employed; but to prevent all Loſs that may
come by theſe ways, if the Perſons be wholly unknown,
which can hardly be if they live in the Pariſh, let them leave
ſix pence in hand, which is about the Price of a pound of
Hemp or Flax, which no poor Body who is of any good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
but will find Credit for, if they have it not of their
own; and let this lie as a Pawn till they bring home their
Work, and as long as you ſhall employ them, or be ſatisfied
of their Honeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome will object, that by this ſetting poor People
to ſpin, you will take them off from other Employments, as
winded of Silk, ſtitching of Bodice, kniting of Stockings, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Lace or the like, which are more neceſſary Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than ſpinning of Flax and Hemp to make Linnen Cloth,
we having that already very cheap from other Countries, for
which alſo his Majeſty receives much Cuſtom, which by this
new Trade will wholly be loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, That there is no fear that any
Perſon who can wind Silk, knit Stockings, make Lace or the
like, will leave theſe Employments, if they can have them, to
ſpin Flax and Hemp, the Price thereof being ſo very low; but
if any of theſe ſhould fail, as many times they do (as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
kniting of ſilk Stockings was of late years a very great
Employment, whereas now they have found out a way to
weave both Silk and Worſted: the kniting Trade is greatly
abated, and 'tis like, in time will come to very little; had
not then the poor People better ſpin than do nothing? And
were it not much better that his Majeſty ſhould loſe the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of ſome Linnen Cloth, than that the poor People ſhould
loſe both their Bodies and Souls too in Sloath and Idleneſs,
the latter whereof, is many times the Conſequence of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94424:8"/>
But as to the Cuſtom of Cloth, it is humbly conceived, that
if a higher Impoſt were laid upon Foreign Linnen, it would
be a ready way to encourage this Manufacture at Home; and
alſo bring in as much Money to His Majeſty, though there
ſhould come in leſs Cloth than now there doth.</p>
            <p>But further, let it be conſidered, that this Employment of
Spinning Flax and Hemp, is ſet up, and intended only for
thoſe Perſons that have nothing elſe to do, or that can do
little elſe; of which number there are very many antient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who cannot ſee to wind Silk, to ſtitch Bodice, or to work
with a Needle, which yet can Spin indifferent well: Nay,
there are ſome at this time which ſpin to me, that can ſee no
more than the Wheels they ſpin upon, that yet follow this
Employment, and can draw a Thread that for ſome purpoſes
doth well enough; And for young Children, there is nothing
they can more eaſily learn, than to ſpin Linnen, their Fingers
being never ſo ſmall, being big enough to pull out the Flax,
and to make a fine Thread, in ſo much, that ſome Children
that I have taken up, that came begging to my Door, which in
ſix months time, have drawn a pound of Flax to ſo fine a
Thread, that the Spinning hath come to twelve pence, which
very rarely Antient People will draw to ſeven pence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But again it will be objected, where will you find a
Stock to employ ſo many poor People as ſhall want Work?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, That there are few Pariſhes, but
either have a Stock of Money, or ſo many good Men, that
would willingly lend <hi>gratis,</hi> if not give conſiderably towards
the carrying on of ſo good a work as is the Employment of
the Poor: But in caſe either of theſe ſhould fail, the Pariſh
may as eaſily raiſe a Stock to ſet the Poor at Work, as raiſe
Money by a Rate to keep them in Idleneſs. 'Tis very well
known, that ſome Pariſhes about <hi>London,</hi> do raiſe ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of pounds every year for the Relief of their Poor; and
yet as the matter is handled, very few who are not through Age
or Sickneſs confined to their Houſes, but do beg up and down
the Streets: To prevent which, I know no better way, than
to provide Work for all that are able; and inſtead of giving
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94424:9"/>
them twelve pence or two ſhillings in a Week, in dry Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to give them the like value in Flax or Hemp, which,
when they had ſpun, they ſhould be paid for at the ſame rate,
together with what the Spinning of it came unto. This in
all probability would leſſen the number of our Beggars and
Street-walkers, who having not ſufficient for the Supply of
their Wants, allowed them by the Pariſh, make up the reſt
by begging: if any one of theſe ſhould pretend that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſpin, the Anſwer is very near at hand, they may ſoon
learn; ſince I ſet up this Employment, I have taught ſeveral
perſons of about ſixty years of age, to Spin, who do conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow this Work, if they have no other; but if this anſwer
will not do, the next ſhould, which is this, if the Perſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live of her Penſion, and will not, being able, accept of
ſuch Employment as the Pariſh hath to give; let her get ſome
other, by means of which, ſhe may help to maintain her ſelf,
ſo that ſhe be not found begging in the Streets, upon pain of
loſing that Relief which ſhe received from the Pariſh; to
prevent which, 'tis like ſhe would fall to work, from which,
and her Penſion, ſhe might make a good Shift to live: Or,
otherwiſe let her perſon be ſecured as an Idle Beggar, in the
Houſe of Correction, where ſhe ſhould be made to work, or
forbid to eat, as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth, ſaying, <hi>If any
will not work, neither let them eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further, to encourage the ſetting up of the Linnen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
for the Employment of the poor, I deſire it may be
conſidered, That there is no Commodity that I know of, that
is of the like Value, that can be ſet up with leſs Stock or leſs
Loſs at firſt, three parts of four even of that Cloth which comes
not to above two Shillings an Ell, will be paid for Labour to
the Dreſſer of the Flax, and to the Spinner, and Weaver, and
as they ſpin finer, the price will advance ſo much, that five
parts of ſix ſhall go out upon that account. I my ſelf have ſeen
a Pound of Flax not worth above eighteen pence at moſt,
ſpun to that Fineneſs, that the Pound of Thred hath been
worth eight or ten Shillings; and from other Countries we
daily receive Thredſpun of Flax, not above three or four Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94424:9"/>
a Pound, at the price of three or four Pound Sterling.
Then as to the Loſs by Children and Learners, it will not be
near ſo much as in many other things. A Child may firſt be ſet
upon ſpinning of Tow, which coſt about two pence a pound,
which though it be ſpun never ſo badly will ſerve for ſome
kind of uſe or other, which in Wool would be good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which yet is many times the Price.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I deſire it may be conſidered, that in this Trade
all ſorts of Perſons whether Young or Old, Male or Female,
may find Employment; if of Years and able, they may beat
Hemp, dreſs Flax, and make them ready for the Spinſter, and
when ſpun, may be employed in weaving it, and thoſe of both
Sexes that are not able, may be put to ſpinning, as it is uſual
in many Places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The next Objection I have met with is this, what will
you do with all the Yarn theſe poor People ſhall ſpin, if you
turn it into Cloth, the Commodity is brought over ſo cheap,
that you will never be able to ſell it without much Loſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt confeſs, this Objection hath too much of
Truth in it, wholly to be removed: The beſt Anſwer I can
make to it at preſent, is this, That we had better loſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by the Labour of the Poor, than loſe all, by letting
them live in Sloth and Idleneſs: For, ſuppoſe you ſhould give
ſix pence for that which really is not worth five pence, here
will five pence be gained to the Nation, tho' one penny ſhould
be loſt to the Pariſh. But beſides, let it be conſidered, that
if this Perſon had not been employed, there would not leſs
have been ſpent, but rather more; foraſmuch as ſix pence
that is got by Labour, doth many times go further than twelve
pence given for doing nothing, all that time People are idle,
they will be ſpending, if they have where withal; and if they
have not, 'tis like they will be worſe employed, and either
beg or ſteal to ſupply their Wants.</p>
            <p>All that I can further ſay to this Objection, is only this,
That it is to be hoped in time, as our People grow more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and induſtrious, we may be able to ſell as cheap as our
Neighbours; but if we cannot, 'tis much better to loſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94424:10"/>
in a way that will make the poor People better, and
the Nation richer, than to ſuffer them to live in Sloth and
Idleneſs, to their utter ruine, and to the great Loſs and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be ſome will object and ſay, Where will
you find Perſons that have Skill to manage this Employment,
or whom ſhall the Pariſh truſt with it? If it be left to every
body's Care, it will come to nothing; foraſmuch as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that is no body's, which is every body's Buſineſs: And if
you leave it to the Care of one or two, the Pariſh may be
cheated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this I anſwer, That it is not to be doubted, but
that in every Pariſh ſome ſuch honeſt and faithful Perſons may
be found, as would not wrong the Pariſh, nor imbezzle one
farthing of their Stock, but account it their Honour to be
employed in ſo noble and generous a Work, which would
not only make a better Proviſion for the Poor, but make
them better alſo.</p>
            <p>But farther, I anſwer, that there needs not much Skill to
manage this Affair, and that which is neceſſary will ſoon be
learnt; this was one of the greateſt Encouragements I had to
fall upon the Linnen Manufacture, becauſe there was ſo little
of Difficulty in it, to what there is in ſome others. Every
Merchant will tell you where you may buy Flax and Hemp at
the beſt hand, and it will be as eaſie to find both Men and
Women that ſhall dreſs them, who will give an Account how
many Pound of every ſort each hundred Weight makes, which
you muſt enter into a Book for that purpoſe; when this is
done, what you deliver of any ſort to the Spinſter, muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be entred with the name of the Perſon and Place where
ſhe dwells, which I have done by drawing two Lines after
this manner, with the name of the perſon ſet above, upon
<figure>
                  <head>A.B. in C.D.</head>
               </figure>
the firſt of which
lines I make ſo many
ſtroaks as I deliver
out pounds to the
Spinſter; for Tow,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94424:10"/>
which is a cheaper ſort, I make a little Daſh on the Top of
the Stroke; when it is brought home, I make the Stroaks
through both the Lines, as above, with a D. for deliver'd
out, and an R. for received in again; but in caſe you ſtill
deliver the ſame for Quantity and Quality that you receive
in, you need not trouble your ſelf in this Manner, but let
the Account ſtand juſt as it did at firſt.</p>
            <p>When the Yarn comes in, I lay every ſort by it ſelf, that
is ſpun to a Fineneſs, and when I deliver any of it to the
Weaver, I enter to his account the Quantity and Quality;
as for Inſtance, to A. B. in C. D. ſo many pound of Yarn,
which coſt ſuch a price; and when the Weaver brings
home his Cloth, I weigh it again, by means of which, I
can certainly tell you, at the making up of the Account,
whether all my Flax and Hemp be brought home by the
Spinner, and all my Yarn by the Weaver; as alſo what my
Cloth ſtands me in: By which I do prevent being deceived
by others, and deceiving my ſelf.</p>
            <p>When I firſt began to employ the Poor in Spinning, the
beſt direction that I could receive, was to pay for ſpinning
the ſame price that the Flax and Hemp ſtood me in, or
what thoſe ſorts were generally ſold for; but this I ſoon
found to be a very unequal way: Foraſmuch as ſome People
would ſpin a much finer Thread than others, and better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
8 <hi>d.</hi> for ſpinning a pound of Flax that coſt but ſix
pence, than another four pence; ſo that after a little time,
I brought all the poor people to ſpin ſix hundred Yards for
a penny, were the Thread finer or courſer, which was
three Knots or Lays about a half yard Reel, with one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Threads in a Lay, which makes juſt ſix hundred yards;
and ſince then, with much ado, finding the Loſs to be great,
I have brought them to fifty Yards more, which yet is
much leſs than is ſpun in other places. In the Contract
which the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> made with one Mr. <hi>King,</hi> and
others, for the Employment of five hundred of their poor
People in the way of Spinning: For the firſt Year, he was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94424:11"/>
obliged to pay them two pence half penny for ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Yards of Yarn, which is much about the price that I
pay the poor People here, becauſe they being either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to learn, or much to ſeek, might not be diſcouraged; but
after the firſt Year, by this Contract, he might alter the
Price, provided he never brought them to ſpin above eight
hundred Yards for a penny; and I doubt not, if our poor
People could be brought to ſpin ſo much here, there would
be no Loſs by the Liunen we make, but rather Profit;
but the Miſchief of it is, our Poor People have not been
brought up, either to work hard, or to fare hardly; and
the Trade of Begging, being known to be ſo eaſie and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
they will much rather range about forty or fifty Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
in a day, and get a penny in each Pariſh, than work
hard in one to get ſix pence or eight pence; which they
muſt do in this Employment: So that till the Magiſtrate
will do his Duty, and ſee the Laws put in Execution agaiuſt
Beggars, or the People grow ſo wiſe, as not to encourage
this wicked Courſe of Life, I have little hope to ſee this
matter much amended.</p>
            <p>Having given you an account of the price I pay for ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
I ſhall now tell you what I pay for Flax and Hemp,
(though this is ſometimes more or leſs, as the Markets riſe
or fall) as alſo what I pay for dreſſing them, and for wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Cloth I make, becauſe I would give the greateſt
Encouragment I could to the ſetting up this Manufacture,
for the Employment of our poor People, till ſome other,
or better way ſhould be found out.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Riga</hi> Hemp at this time, I pay twenty ſhillings a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
which is very low; for <hi>Quinborough</hi> about twenty
two, which is cheap; for <hi>Muſcovia</hi> Flax, about forty four
a hundred; for <hi>Quinborough</hi> about forty ſhillings a hundred;
for <hi>Holladay</hi> about thirty ſix; for <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> Flax, about
thirty: All which Prizes are very high to what they are
at ſome times; for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Flax, about five pence half pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a pound undreſt; which Prizes I rather inſert, to give
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94424:11"/>
Buyers a little Aim, than for a ſtanding Rule. For beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Hemp, I pay four Shillings and eight pence, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Weight.</p>
            <p>For dreſſing Hemp long or ſhort, eleven pence a dozen
pound, for dreſſing Flax I give three pence a Stone, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
eight pound to the Stone.</p>
            <p>For Weaving Cloth, I pay the ſeveral Prices following,
for Yarn ſpun to ſix pence and ſeven pence a pound, for
every Ell of Cloth half-ell wide, two pence half penny; for
that which is three quarters wide, three pence; for that
which is three quarters and half wide, three pence half
penny; for that which is Yard wide, four pence; for that
which is Ell wide five pence.</p>
            <p>For Yarn ſpun to nine pence and ten pence a pound, I
pay one half penny more for every half quarter of an Ell,
riſing as before; in that of ſeven pence and eight pence,
and the like in that which is ſtill finer; for courſe Cloth,
Yard half quarter wide, I pay three pence an Ell, and for
Sacking, about three pence a Yard.</p>
            <p>Which prices I have here inſerted, as I ſaid before, rather
to give ſome Aim, than to be a ſtanding Rule; yet this I
am ſure, no one need to exceed them, but in ſome places
they may be abated, according to the Cheapneſs of Living,
over what it is in this City.</p>
            <p>It is a thing greatly to be wiſhed, that we could make
Linnen Cloth here, as cheap as they ſend it us from abroad,
but if that cannot be done, nor any other way found out
to employ our poor People, we had much better loſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by the Labour of our poor, than looſe all their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and keep them into the Bargain, which muſt be done
one way or other; for the Back and Belly have no Ears,
Hunger will break through ſtone Walls, and if ſome People
cannot honeſtly, they will any way ſupply their Wants,
though they are hanged for their Pains.</p>
            <p>But Thanks be to God, there are ſtill amongſt us, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſort of poor people, that are content to take any pains
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94424:12"/>
for a Living, rather than beg or ſteal, and for their Sakes
chiefly, I have ſet up this Employment, and do heartily
wiſh it were better for their ſakes, they being indeed the
trueſt Objects of Charity that will do what they can to get
a Living, and 'tis great Pity, that ſuch poor Souls ſhould
not be helped: If by what they are able to do, they
cannot procure to themſelves Neceſſaries of this ſort.
You very ſeldom ſee any begging about the Streets,
except upon ſome extraordinary Occaſion or Accident, and
then 'tis done with great Modeſty, and as much againſt their
Natures as any thing in the World, but ſtarving.</p>
            <p>But as for thoſe common Beggers, and eſpecially thoſe
profligate Wretches called the running Camp, which every
day peſter our Streets; they are a People that one would
think came from the Suburbs of Hell it ſelf, a Diſhonour
to humane Nature, a Shame to the Government, and an
intolerable Trouble to all perſons they come near, by their
Swearing, Scolding, Fighting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You may eaſily know
them, as alſo by their numbers, for they commonly go in
Companies, and will be preſent at all Solemnity, but more
eſpecially at Feaſts and Funerals. Of late they are grown
ſo impudent, that they will thruſt themſelves into Churches,
and by their Brawling and Scolding, many times diſturb the
Miniſter; when Sermon is done, the Congregation muſt
not paſs out, but one by one, becauſe they will make the
moſt they can of it, by asking every perſon ſomething, and
what they get, they ſpend as wickedly as they get it: So
that to relieve theſe Miſcreants, is a greater Act of Folly
(that I ſay no worſe of it) than to throw a man's Money
down the Thames, for hereby you give Encouragement to
this wicked kind of Life: and would once People be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to forbear this fooliſh Pity, they would be neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to work. I lately heard a Gentleman tell this Story,
who was perſued by a luſty Rogue in <hi>Lincols-inn-fields,</hi> that
refuſing to give him any thing, cryed, Ah, Maſter if all
were of your Mind, I know what I would do; upon the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94424:12"/>
hearing of which, he turned back again, and ſaid, why
Sirrah, what would you do? Truly Maſter ſaid he, I would
fall to work: and I doubt not but the reſt of his Brethren
would do the like, but that they find Begging ſo beneficial
a Trade.</p>
            <p>It is not above ſix Months ſince, that a Gentleman of good
Quality, that lives in the Country, told me, that having
occaſion to paſs ſome of the Fields about the Town, he met
with a young Fellow that askt him for an Alms, whom he
no ſooner lookt upon, but he well remembred him to have
lived in the ſame Pariſh where he did, and asking him if
he were not ſuch a man, he told him he was, and preſently
called the Gentleman by his name; who asking him how
long he had folowed that Trade? told him, ever ſince his
Wife died, which was about three years: in ſhort, the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
askt him where he lay, and deſired he might have
leave to wait upon him at his Chamber, which he readily
granted him; withal, wondring in himſelf, what he ſhould
have to ſay to him, but when he came, he ſoon acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with his Buſineſs, which was to get him to put out
200. <hi>l.</hi> that he had gotten by his new Trade, to keep him
as he ſaid, when he was old; by which you ſee, that beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
is a very gainful Trade. So that 'tis no wonder that
ſo many fall upon it, and that all places, but eſpecially this
City and Suburbs are ſo filled with them, nor is there any
Hopes to ſee them fewer, till the Laws are put in Execution
both againſt them, and thoſe that do relieve them. If any
ſhall think that I am very uncharitable, becauſe I would
have all luſty Beggars made to work, or ſoundly whipt,
and ſuch as relieve them, puniſhed as the Laws require, I
am very confident that they do not conſider upon what
good Grounds ſuch Laws were made, nor the great Evil
ſuch Relief doth both to the perſons themſelves, as well as to
the Nation, nor yet the plain Injunction of the Apoſtle,
who ſaith, <hi>If any will not work, neither let them eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94424:13"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome will ſtill object againſt the ſetting up the
Linnen Manufacture, That the Commodity is more proper
for other Countreys, becauſe they have more plenty of
Hemp and Flax; and alſo, that if we do not take off their
Linnen, they will not take off our. Woollen Cloth, which
is the Staple Commodity of our Nation, and ought rather
to be encouraged than any other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, Firſt, that for Flax, our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
at leaſt ſome parts of it, is as proper as any other, and
may with good Management, be made ſo for Hemp alſo.</p>
            <p>A Worthy Perſon in <hi>Surry,</hi> having a mind to employ
his poor Neighbours, and to prevent the great Miſchiefs
that Idleneſs had produced among them, as Begging, Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and breaking of Hedges, reſolved to ſet up the Trade
of Spinning Flax, and making of Cloth, which for ſome
time he did, by ſupplying himſelf with Flax from <hi>London;</hi>
but afterwards, he cauſed ten Acres of his own Land to
be ſown with Flax; and after a juſt Computation of his
Charge, reckoning his neat Flax at one penny in a pound
leſs than he paid for the ſame ſort from <hi>London</hi> the Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
made twenty ſhillings an Acre of his Ground, which
would not have been let at four ſhillings.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, Let it be conſidered, that ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
have fallen upon the making of Wollen Cloth; and
others in a manner prohibited it, by laying ſo great a Charge
upon it; ſo that it is in a manner abſolutely neceſſary for
us to fall upon the making of Linnen Cloth, to make up
the Damage they have done us.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Exchange of Commodities one Nation
with another, is a very profitable way of Commerce, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the Ballance of Trade be any thing equal; which it
is well known hath not been with <hi>France</hi> for ſome Years
of late: So that there is very great reaſon we ſhould fall
upon making ſuch Cloth as we receive from thence, and that
as great an Impoſition ſhould be laid upon their Linnen
Cloth, as they have laid upon our Woollen: The Linnens
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94424:13"/>
imported from <hi>France</hi> of late years, as ſaith <hi>Britania Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guens,</hi>
hath been eſtimated at five hundred thouſand pounds:
and ſo much as our Importations from <hi>France,</hi> exceed our
Exportations thither: So much the Nation loſeth, and is
impoveriſhed; and in the ſame Proportion <hi>France</hi> gains,
which may be accounted a double Loſs to <hi>England,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in making us ſo much poorer, but alſo in making our
moſt formidable Neighbour ſo much the richer, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
ſo much the more able to do us harm: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſo much Cloth as we make here, and would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be brought us from <hi>France,</hi> to the ſame proportion
our Nation ſaves, and <hi>France</hi> loſeth; which is a double
advantage to us.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, it is very neceſſary; that the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture
ſhould be kept up to the height, and a thouſand
pities that any of our Wooll ſhould be carried out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
unwrought, eſpecially at ſuch a time as this, when
the Commodity is ſo much advanced, and grown ſo ſcarce,
that 'tis much to be feared, we ſhall not long have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for thoſe Hands that are already employed in it;
ſo that inſtead of prohibiting the wearing of Silk,
and Hair Stuffs for five months in a Year, when ſo many
thouſand Perſons are employed in thoſe Commodities: It
is thought may prove very prejudicial; and that we had
more need to encourage theſe Manufactures, or any other,
to employ our Poor, than forbid them; neither indeed, will
this be a way to leſſen our Woollen Manufacture, but much
more to encreaſe it: Foraſmuch as any Perſon that wears
Silk, or Hair that is brought from beyond Sea, in Exchange
for our Woollen Cloth, may be truly ſaid to wear twice as
much, as he that has nothing but Woollen upon his Back.</p>
            <p>I deſire alſo, that it may be conſidered, that although it
matters not how great a price is paid for what is worn of
the Wollen Manufacture among our ſelves; yet if we ſhall
not be able to ſend it abroad at a reaſonable price, we
ſhall put other Countreys upon ſeeking out other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94424:14"/>
that will be cheaper, which may prove very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous.</p>
            <p>There is no great danger, that ever our making of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
Cloth ſhould do the Woollen much harm, unleſs we
could make it cheaper than we have it from other places; and
then if we furniſhed them with Linnen to as good advantage
as Woollen, the matter would be much the ſame.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, I am not fond of one Employment for our
Poor, more than for another, let but our idle People be
employed, and the Trade of Begging ſuppreſt, and I ſhall
have attained my End: for this I am ſure, is a far greater
Evil to the Nation, and every way more miſchievous than
the ſetting them to make Linnen-Cloth, or any other thing
would be. Nay, I am very confident, I conceive upon
good grounds, that it were much better for the Nation to
employ the poor to pick Straws, if there were no better
Employment for them, than to let them live in Sloth and
Idleneſs, becauſe what they got by their Labours, would
go much farther than ſo much given them for doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
all the idle perſon hath to do, is to ſpend what you
give him, which he will quickly do, when that is all his
Buſineſs, but he that is employed hath ſomething elſe to
mind; neither will his Wants be ſo many, as the others,
nor himſelf in half ſo much danger as the idle Perſon, whoſe
Head is the Devils Anvil, where he forges all his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Death, and by being altogether at Leiſure, may even
be ſaid to tempt the Devil himſelf to fall upon him, being
ready for want of other or better Buſineſs, to do any thing,
which either the Devil or his own wicked heart can ſuggeſt
to him, or ſet him upon.</p>
            <p>But there is one Objection more, which I have lately met
with, which I cannot well paſs over, and that is this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Though it cannot be denied but that in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
the Employment of the Poor is a very good Work, yet
it may not be convenient to ſet up any Manufacture in this
City for the doing of it, leaſt by this means you drain the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94424:14"/>
Countreys of all their poor People, and in time ſo fill the
City and Suburbs with them, that all the Manufactures in
<hi>England</hi> ſhall not be enough to employ them; and alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by Experience it is found, that all thoſe Places where
there is any Manufacture ſet up, are much fuller of poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
than any other. And laſtly, becauſe it is not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that the making and Conſumption of any Commodity
ſhould be in one and the ſame place.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, firſt, that if the Employment of the
Poor be good in any place, it is ſo here, both becauſe they
are more in number in this City and Suburbs, than in any
other Places, and becauſe if they are here ſuffered to be
idle, they will have more Temptations and Opportunities
to do miſchief, than they will have any where elſe.</p>
            <p>As to what is objected, that by the ſetting up of any
Manufacture here for the Employment of the Poor, you
will drein the Countreys of all their poor People, and at
laſt ſo fill the City and Suburbs with them, that all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
of <hi>England</hi> ſhall not be enough to ſupply them.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, that there will need no more work to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them in the City, than in the Country; ſo that if all
the Manufactures in <hi>England</hi> will not employ them here,
neither will they do it in the Country. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I deſire it may be conſidered, that where there
is one perſon comes to this City to find Work, there is two
comes to beg or to do worſe: ſo that if due care were taken
to employ all perſons that were idle, and the Laws put
in Execution againſt Beggars, a great many perſons would
ſoon leave the City, and return to their own Countries,
where they might have near as much Money for their work,
or at leaſt more meat for their Money; and till this eaſie and
gainful, though wicked Trade of Begging ſhall be ſuppreſt,
I do not expect to ſee fewer, but more Beggars every day.
It is well known, that of late years, many perſons have
come from the fartheſt parts of this Nation to ſet up this
Trade here, and if ſpeedy Care be not taken to prevent it,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94424:15"/>
this City and Suburbs will drain all the poor people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
unto them, Begging being here a better Trade than
any where elſe, and greater Encouragement given to it.</p>
            <p>As to that part of the Objection, which ſaith, that thoſe
Towns, where there is any Manufacture ſet up, are fuller
of poor People than any other places, the Anſwer is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe thoſe places have abundantly more People
in them than any other, all Manufactures being carried on
chiefly by the Poor, and not only by the Rich; ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
are the Poor to the carrying on of any Manufacture,
that the one would ceaſe without the other.</p>
            <p>But let it alſo be conſidered, that as in theſe Places, there
are the pooreſt, ſo alſo here are the richeſt; and as there
are in theſe places more poor People than in others, ſo alſo
there are more rich People than in thoſe places where there
is no Manufacture, the Trade of ſuch places being very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
Let any one compare the Trade of <hi>Colcheſter</hi> with the
Trade of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and he ſhall find, that where the
Town of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> gets one penny, the Town of <hi>Colcheſter</hi>
gets twelve pence; and for every twelve pence returned
in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> there is near twenty ſhillings returned in <hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
Let the Poor of any place be never ſo many, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they work and do not eat the Bread of Idleneſs, the
place will be the richer for them, and the Trade far the
better: For theſe People muſt eat, and drink, and wear
Clothes, as well, tho' not ſo good, as thoſe that are richer;
and by theſe the Trade will be much increaſed, and the
Inhabitants made much richer than otherwiſe they would
be: A multitude of poor People well employed, would
be like a multitude of Bees in a Hive, which would much
ſooner fill it with Honey than if they were fewer.</p>
            <p>I would gladly know how our poor People ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for, if Begging muſt not be allowed, nor Working
encouraged, for fear of bringing more poor People among
us. Put the caſe this were an Evil which yet I cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94424:15"/>
muſt we not do good to our own Poor, for fear it
ſhould bring the Poor of other places among us. For my
part, I am ſo far from thinking abundance of poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
an Evil, that if they were well employed, they would
prove a Bleſſing to us: For in all Labour there is Profit,
ſaith the Wiſeman: 'tis only Idleneſs that makes the poor
a Burthen both to themſelves, and the Places where they
inhabit.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, That all Pretences may be taken away from
ſuch as object againſt our Employment of the Poor among
us, leſt we ſhould bring in the Poor of other Places: If the
ſeveral Pariſhes do not like of this, they have Laws to keep
them out; and they may thank themſelves, that ſo many
neceſſitous Perſons do daily come in among them, becauſe
they do not prevent Inmates, but ſuffer any to ſettle among
them, that may be chargeable, without giving Security to
prevent it.</p>
            <p>But it is further ſaid in the Objection, that the Making
and Conſumption of any Commodity, ſhould not be in one
and the ſame place.</p>
            <p>To which it is anſwered, that this part of the Objection,
even by the Confeſſion of all, hath no force in it as to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things; and why it ſhould as to any, I ſee no reaſon:
It was never doubted, but that good Beer and Ale, which
ſome call our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture, may without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
be made and conſumed in one and the ſame place;
and why not any Commodity for the Back, if there be
need of them, as well as thoſe for the Belly? I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand:
We uſe to ſay, Every man will Chriſten his own
Child firſt: So much of any Commodity as is neceſſary,
will be made uſe of in the place where it is made, and only
the reſt ſent abroad.</p>
            <p>Put the Caſe, for want of other Employment, the City
of <hi>London</hi> ſhould ſet their poor People upon making Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
Cloth, and that in time they ſhould be able to fit the
Country with it, upon as good terms as they do twenty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94424:16"/>
others that are made in this City. Where would be the
Prejudice, if in the firſt place they ſupplied themſelves with
what they have occaſion for.</p>
            <p>But as to the ſort of Work, you will employ the poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in, I am not concerned ſo much for that, as that you
do employ them ſome way or other, and prevent that idle
kind of Life, which many of them lead, which will bring
them, not only to Beggary, but to all manner of Vice,
as hath been already obſerved from what hath been
ſaid, I think it doth plainly appear, that the only way to
prevent Poverty and Want among thoſe that are well and
able to work, is to bring them to Labour, and prevent Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which being done, it will be much eaſier to provide
for thoſe that through Age, Sickneſs, or the like, are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
uncapable of doing any thing towards their own
maintenance: And that this might effectually be done, care
muſt be taken to put the Laws in Execution, which are
made on that behalf, which I am told, hath ſtrictly enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
every Pariſh, to take care, that ſuch Perſons, may have
ſuch an Allowance, as may be ſuitable and ſufficient for
their Wants, that ſo they need not be neceſſitated to beg,
nor forced to go out of their own Pariſh to ſeek Relief: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
that if the Places where they live, be not able to
give them a ſufficient Supply to their Wants and Neceſſities,
they ought to apply themſelves to their next Neighbours
for Help and Aſſiſtance; and in caſe they fail herein, 'tis
their own Fault. And indeed, what can be more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
than ſuch Laws as theſe? Foraſmuch as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can tend more to the Diſhonour of any Nation, than
to ſee ſuch poor, aged, ſick and impotent People, neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to beg up and down the Streets, when God knows,
many times they are fitter to be in Bed. That we do not
force ſuch as are able to work and get their own Livings, is
a ſhame only to our Prudence, and want of good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but that we neceſſitate ſuch Perſons as thoſe to beg,
is a ſhame to our very Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and ſhews
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94424:16"/>
that we are hard-hearted, and have no Bowels of Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to our poor Brethren. Surely this is not to give Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the Aged, nor to be Eyes to the Blind, and Feet
to the lame, and Wiſdom to them which have no Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
nor yet to do to others as we would that they
ſhould do unto us, if we were in ſuch Circumſtances. It
many times falls out, that Perſons who have lived well in
their younger Years, and it may be wrought hard when
they were able, that by reaſon of Sickneſs, or ſome ſad Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
have come to Poverty in their Old Age.</p>
            <p>How often hath it fallen out, that Widows, by truſting
their Eſtates in the Hands of Knaves, have loſt all they
had, and been brought to Want? having out-lived all their
Friends and near Relations, and nothing to help them, but
the Kindneſs of the Pariſh, and if that fail, how miſerable
muſt they be?</p>
            <p>Now for the Prevention of which, I would propoſe one
or two things more.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That in every great Pariſh, there might be ſome
other perſons appointed beſides the Church-wardens, who
ſhould be men of the beſt Reputation, both for Honeſty
and Eſtates, to whom I would have given that honourable Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of being called Fathers for the Poor, as it is now in the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches, whoſe chief work and Buſineſs
it ſhould be, to viſit ſuch poor People, and to inſpect their
Wants, and to have ſome part at leaſt of the Pariſh
ſtock, committed to them for the Supply of them whereas
now alas, the poor people muſt themſelves apply to the
Church-wardens if they are able to crawl abroad, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
if their own Neighbours, which many times are poor
enough themſelves, are not the kinder, they may periſh in
their own Houſes for want of Food, Phyſick, Fire or Cloaths,
as I have great reaſon to believe many hundreds have done
of late years, I pray God lay it not to our Charge, that in
a Nation ſo abounding with Riches and Plenty as <hi>England</hi>
doth, any perſon ſhould periſh through want. It is well
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94424:17"/>
well known, that the Church-Wardens of moſt Pariſhes,
come not to thoſe places, becauſe they are better or richer
men than others, but becauſe of their long Standing in the
Pariſh; and many times, God knows, they are no more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the Wants and Neceſſities of a poor Creature,
than a Grave-maker at the ſight of a dead Corps.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I propoſe that ſome ſuch Houſes may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
here as are in <hi>Holland,</hi> for the Reception of aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
to which they may reſort, and be admitted as ſoon as
they find themſelves in a declining Condition, before all is
ſpent or loſt, paying for their Admittance according to their
Age, and the Quality of ſuch Houſes as they ſhould deſire
to go into; for of theſe, I would have ſeveral ſorts. This
in a few years would prevent much of that Poverty and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
that oftentimes fall upon old Age; as to give an
Inſtance or two, ſuppoſe that a Woman buries her Huſband,
who leaves her in Goods and Money to the value of one or
two hundred pounds, but altogether unable to manage the
Trade her Husband followed or any other, what can this
poor Woman do, to live upon the Intereſt of this Money,
though ſhe knew never ſo well, how to ſecure it, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;
and if ſhe lives upon the Principal, it will ſoon be
gone. In ſuch a caſe, what more adviſable, than that this
Perſon forthwith go and purchaſe for her ſelf a Being in one
of theſe Houſes, where ſhe ſhall be well provided for, as
long as ſhe live, and be delivered from the fear of Want in
her old Age, which many times is more grievous than the
fear of Death it ſelf?</p>
            <p>How often have it faln out, that Widows who were left
well by their Husbands, for Want of Underſtanding to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
their Eſtates, or by truſting it in inſolvent hands, have
loſt all, and brought themſelves to Poverty; or ſuppoſe as
many times it hapneth, that while a Man and his Wife live,
their Trade ſhould either grow out of Faſhion, or ſo bad,
that it was not poſſible for them either to get a Living by
it, or to fall into any other. In this caſe, would it not be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94424:17"/>
much for the Advantage of both theſe Perſons, while ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was left, to go and make Proviſion for themſelves in
one of theſe Houſes where they ſhould be comfortably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for as long as they lived, and the longer Liver of
them.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but there are many perſons that have known
the Caſes now put often to happen, and many others of the
like nature; this would be a ſort of Charity, if I may call it
Charity, very advantagious to the Perſons that ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of it, and as it may fall out, very profitable to the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it up, but however, without Loſs, and would really
be a far greater piece of Service done to the Nation, than
are for the moſt part our Alms Houſes, which though never
ſo well intended, are in ſome Reſpects prejudicial, drawing
poor People to ſettle in ſuch places where they are erected,
and a means to make ſome People careleſs in laying up any
thing againſt old Age, in hopes of being there provided
for; not that I would wholly diſcourage this way of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
In ſome Reſpects it may be good, but yet I will ſay,
that this is no way inferiour to it, in as much, as many
times it would effectually prevent that Poverty which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
falls upon Old Age, which is doubtleſs as great an Act
of Charity, as to relieve Perſons in Neceſſity. I am verily
perſwaded, if one ſuch Building as this I am now ſpeaking
of, was erected, for the Reception of Aged Men, or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or both, and well endowed for the performance of
ſuch Conditions as ſhould be made, there would be no want
of Perſons to go into it; and that in a ſhort time, ſo many
would be erected, that the next Generation ſhould not ſee
one quarter ſo many of poor aged People, expoſed to Beggary
as in this. There are ſome perſons that I know, who have
poor Relations, that would willingly be at one or 200 <hi>l.</hi>
Charge, to ſee them thus provided for. I wiſh that all that
were able, were ſo well minded; but on the contrary, to
their ſhame be it ſpoken, I know ſome that have ſo little
Charity for their poor Relation, that though they are able,
yet ſuffer them to want; nay, to beg. I hope the number
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94424:18"/>
of ſuch uunatural Wretches are not many, yet ſome ſuch
there are, who provide not for their own Kindred, of whom
the Apoſtle ſaith, That they have denied the Faith, and are
worſe than Infidels.</p>
            <p>But now Sir, that I may give you an account of the Work-houſe
in <hi>Alderſgate</hi> Pariſh, and the management of Affairs
there (which was the thing you deſired, and what firſt I chiefly
intended) by which I hope there will appear a very likely
way to prevent much Poverty for the Future, and Beggary
for the Preſent.</p>
            <p>The Houſe being finiſhed, I acquainted the Pariſh, that
if they had any poor People that wanted Employment, if
they went thither, I would ſupply them, upon theſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould not take away their Penſions
from any that I employed, nor give Penſions to any but
ſuch as would, being able, follow that Work I had to give
them, or ſome other, by means of which, and the Penſion
received from the Pariſh, they might provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
without Begging: For I have long obſerved, that a
great many of thoſe Perſons we find begging up and down
the Streets, are ſuch as do receive ſome Penſion from the
Pariſhes where they live? but that being too ſmall to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them, they make up the reſt by Begging, which might
eaſily be prevented in every Pariſh, as it was in this we are
now ſpeaking of, there being here no Perſon that had
a Penſion, and was able to work, but was ſupplied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and with theſe together, were inabled to make good
Proviſion for themſelves, and to live much more happily
than before: And if at any time any of theſe Perſons ſhould
be found begging in the Streets, the Pariſh promiſed to take
away their Penſions, and I promiſed to take away their
Work, and leave them to provide for themſelves as well as
they could, which muſt be by begging or ſtealing; but
wherever they begged, it ſhould not be in this Pariſh, at
leaſt, not with any good Succeſs: For the Pariſh having cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
over all their poor People, and appointed work for thoſe
that were able, thought it convenient to give a Badge, with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94424:18"/>
the three firſt Letters of the Pariſhes name upon it, to ſuch,
and only ſuch as they found uncapable of any Labour; by
means of which, they were permitted to go into the
Pariſh, if they were able, or elſe to ſend ſome in their names
at ſuch an hour of the day, to receive ſuch broken Bread and
Meat as their Neighbours had to give, who alſo promiſed to
give it unto theſe, and no others: for by this Badge, which
was made of blew and yellow Bays, pinned upon their ſleeve
or breaſt, they were known to the Inhabitants to be thoſe
very perſons, whom the Deputy, Common-counſel-men, and
Church-wardens had judged fit to receive ſuch Charity.
And I know not why any body ſhould be offended that the
Pariſhoners ſhould invite their poor Neighbours once a day
to come to their houſes to receive ſuch Bread and Meat as
they were willing to give them, neither would I have theſe
poor people go under ſo diſhonourable a name as Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,
but to be lookt upon as invited Gueſts.</p>
            <p>And would their rich Neighbours now and then invite
them to their Tables, it would take away this Reproach, and
be an Obligation upon their Servants, to take care that what
they gave them at other times, were decently ſet by for them,
and not ſcambled up and down as in ſome places I have ſeen
it done as if it were to be given to Dogs, rather than Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
this were indeed to follow the Advice of our bleſſed
Lord and Saviour, who ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 13. <hi>When thou makeſt
a Feaſt, call the Poor, the Maimed, the Lame, and the Blind,
for they cannot recompence thee, but thou ſhalt be recompenced at
the Reſurrection of the Juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this courſe of giving a Badg to your own Poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
by which they might be known, and reſolving to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no others, unleſs there were not enough of theſe; in
which caſe, ſome from other Pariſhes might be allowed to
come in like manner, tho at firſt ſight it may ſeem to have little
in it, yet if duely practiced would be found of very great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and productive of many goods effects; inſomuch, that
it is impoſſible it ſhould fail, unleſs the Pariſh fail in their
promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:94424:19"/>
For firſt of all, by this means, you will in a ſhort time
clear your Pariſh of all thoſe idle Beggars that daily infeſt
it, to the great trouble of all Houſe-keepers, whoſe doors
are ſeldom quiet from one or other of them, to the great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
of the whole Family, it being in ſome places almoſt
one bodies work to give them anſwers.</p>
            <p>Then this will tend to the quiet of all Paſſengers that ſhall
have occaſion to go through your Pariſh, who are wont to
be haunted with thoſe evil Spirits, from one end of the ſtreet
to the other; and if by accident they meet with any one by
the way, with whom they have occaſion to ſpeak, and ſhall
make the leaſt halt, they muſt in their own defence, give them
ſomething to be gone, or elſe they will hear all they ſay, or
by their begging, hinder them from ſaying any thing; this
is a thing ſo well known to all that live in or frequent the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that I need not ſay more concerning it. Now by means of
a Badge, the Pariſh will know whom they relieve, and when
it ſhall come to be known that they have reſolved to relieve
at their doers, no other but their own poor Neighbours as
it will in a ſhort time; the common Beggars will know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
how to employ their time, than in viſiting ſuch places,
where nothing is to be got.</p>
            <p>And while this Pariſh of <hi>Alderſgate</hi> took the courſe preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
them, I my ſelf have taken a Friend, and gone through
the chief places of this Pariſh, and have not found one Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
in it; I muſt confeſs, of late they have been ſomething
remiſs in the Proſecution of the Methods agreed upon, but
I doubt not they will fall upon it again. (For I hear, inſtead
of Badges made of Bays, they have made ſome of Braſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to give the poor aged and impotent People, new-coats,
all made of gray Cloth, to put them upon, that ſo the Pariſh
may the better know their own poor People, that are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to take ſuch Relief as they have to give at their doors;)
and then I am ſure, what I now tell you was done, will be
done again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But here it will be objected, That ſome Pariſhes are
ſo full of poor People, who are not able to work, that they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94424:19"/>
are not able to relieve one quarter of them in this kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, That there are ſeveral Pariſhes
and ſome Wards within the City of <hi>London,</hi> which have very
few or no poor People in them, wherefore I humbly propoſe,
that by the Allowance of the Lord Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to thoſe poor Pariſhes, to ſend daily ſome of their
pooreſt People for Relief.</p>
            <p>As for Example, Suppoſe the Pariſh of <hi>Algate</hi> which is very
full of poor people, ſhould be permitted to ſend ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them into the Ward of <hi>Langbourn,</hi> with a Badge of the
Pariſh, by which they might be known, at ſuch an hour of
the day, to receive what Bread and Meat they had to give,
and this Ward deſired by the Alderman, Deputy, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-counſel-man
of every Precinct to give their broken Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
only to theſe perſons: this in a ſhort time would have
the like Effect in this Ward as it had in the pariſh aforeſaid;
yet leaſt it ſhould be found troubleſome to the Ward, that
theſe poor people ſhould be ranging about it from one end
to another, it might with eaſe be ordered, that every Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct
ſhould have ſuch a number allotted, according to it's
Bigneſs or Smallneſs, to receive their Fragments; by which
means, the Ward ſhould be more quiet, and the Streets rid
of thoſe multitude of Beggars which are every day found in
them, to the great trouble of the People, and the Diſhonour
of the Government, as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>And till ſome ſuch Courſe as this was taken, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
every Family that have broken Bread and Meat to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow,
that they would not throw it away upon thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Beggars that come to their doors every day, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times are too fine mouthed to eat any of it themſelves, unleſs
a choice Bit now and then, and either throw away the reſt,
or ſell it unto others; but rather to invite two or three poor
Families to come for ir at ſuch times as you ſhould apppint,
which would be a great Comfort to them. This is the way
which I have taken for many years laſt paſt, ſo that now my
door is ſeldom troubled by common Beggars on this account.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, I ſuppoſe it will appear very
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94424:20"/>
practicable to bring all the Pariſhes in <hi>England</hi> into ſuch a
Method, that no poor Body ſhould want Work, or be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to beg otherwiſe than by the allowance of the Pariſh,
which yet I would not have called by this Term: For what
hath been done in one Pariſh, may be done in every one, if
the Circumſtances are the ſame.</p>
            <p>But 'tis like ſome will ſtill object and ſay, that this of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſgate</hi>
Pariſh, is a rich Pariſh, and the Poor very few in it to
what there are in others; ſo that what is related, may with
greater eaſe be effected here, than where the Poor are more
numerous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this, I ſay, it is very true, there are ſeveral Rich
Men in this Pariſh, and the Poor of this Pariſh, tho' many,
are not yet ſo many as in ſome others; yet even here there
are many poor People and their Children that do ſpin Flax
and Hemp, tho' they are not all Penſioners to the Pariſh, nor
I hope ever will be, it being my deſign to prevent that as
much as I can. But over and beſides thoſe of this Pariſh,
there are above 1500 more out of other Pariſhes in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the City of <hi>London,</hi> ſome of which do conſtantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this Employment, and others only when they have no
better. As ſuppoſe a poor Woman that goeth three days
in a week to waſh or Scour abroad, or one that is imploy'd
in Nurſe-keeping three or four months in a year, or a poor
Market-woman, that attends three or four Mornings in a
Week, with her Basket, and all the reſt of the time theſe
folks have little or nothing elſe to do; but by means of this
Spinning, are not only kept within doors (ſome of which
would otherwiſe be begging in the Streets) but made much
more happy and chearful, being by their own Labours able
to make Proviſion for themſelves.</p>
            <p>And were the Rich of this Pariſh fewer than they be,
and the Poor many more than they are, the ſame courſe
might be taken, and would prove effectual to the Ends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expreſt: And by how much greater the number of the
poor People are, by ſo much the more need to find them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94424:20"/>
Employment, it being much more eaſie to provide them
Work, than to keep them in Idleneſs; and much more for
their advantage, to be put into a way to get their own Bread,
than to give it them for nothing: If with their Penſion, you
find them Employment, 'tis like that 6 <hi>d.</hi> will go further,
and do them more good than 3 <hi>s.</hi> nothing being more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
to the Poor, than to live in Sloth and Idleneſs, as
hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>But further, to encourage the ſetting up of Schools in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
greeat Pariſh, for the Inſtruction of young Children,
and bringing them to labour; and alſo for providing Work
for ſuch as are of Age, which they may carry to their own
Habitations: I have a few things more to ſay.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By means hereof, you will prevent much of that
miſchief that happens to young Children, by ſuffering them
to wander up and down without any Care or Government,
by reaſon of which, they do not only get a lazy, idle Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
which yet is no ſmall Evil, but learn all manner of
Wickedneſs that they are capable of, as Lying, Swearing,
Thieving, and ſuch like, which by ſad experience, we find
many times they retain as long as they live, being bred in
the Bone, will hardly be got out of the Fleſh, it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as poſſible to waſh the <hi>Blackamore</hi> white, as it is to
teach them to do well, that have been long accuſtomed to
do evil: Whereas, if due Care were taken to inſtruct young
Children, and to put them into a good Courſe of Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Evil had taken hold of them, both Labour and Vertue
would be much more pleaſing to them, than Idleneſs, Sloth
and Vice.</p>
            <p>Then by providing Work for ſuch of your poor People
as are able, and may want it. By this means, you ſhall in the
firſt place, moſt certainly, make Proviſion for all the honeſt
and induſtrious Poor in your Pariſh, who will, with great
Joy and Thankfulneſs, be employed in any honeſt way to
get a penny, Idleneſs being to them the greateſt Burthen in
the World, inſomuch, that ſeveral perſons have told me,
they have taken as much pleaſure in earning a penny, as they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94424:21"/>
have in uſeing it, their minds being all that time quiet in
which they have been employed, and the day ſeem'd ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and paſſed away much more pleaſantly than otherwiſe
it would have done, no part of it being a Burthen to them;
and had you ſeen as I have done many a time, with what Joy
and Satisfaction many poor people have brought home their
Work, and received their Money for it, you would think
no Charity in the World, like to this of finding them Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
Do not think that all the poor people in <hi>England</hi>
are like thoſe idle Vagrants you find up and down the ſtreets,
no, there are many thouſands whoſe Neceſſities are very
great, and yet they do what they can by their honeſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to help themſelves, and many times they would do
more than they do; but for want of Employment, ſeveral
that I have now working to me, do ſpin ſome fourteen, and
ſome ſixteen hours in four and twenty, and had much rather
do it, than be idle.</p>
            <p>Here, if it were to the purpoſe, I could tell you many ſad
ſtories of the great wants and neceſſities of ſeveral poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that I have been an Eye-witneſs of, that would melt the
moſt rocky heart into Compaſſion; the pooreſt people are
many times thoſe that come leaſt in ſight, who fare hard,
and work hard to get bread.</p>
            <p>Some Trades are grown ſo bad, and ſeveral Commodities
fal'n ſo low in their price, that ſome who could with eaſe
have earned 2 <hi>s.</hi> or 2. <hi>s. 6. d.</hi> in a day, can now hardly earn
12 <hi>d.</hi> by reaſon of which you have men run away from their
Wives and Children, leaving them to the Pariſh; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
run diſtracted, or make away with themſelves, Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of all which caſes, I have known too many.</p>
            <p>To whom ſhould Charity be extended rather than to ſuch
poor people, who are willing to take any pains for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and yet are wholly idle many times, for want of work;
but by this means of providing work for all perſons that
want Employment, it will be much more eaſie for the honeſt
and laborious poor to find Relief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:94424:21"/>
Secondly, By this means you will leave all idle perſons ſo
much without Excuſe, that they will not deſerve your pity,
whatſoever their Wants and Neceſſities are, they muſt thank
themſelves, who will not make uſe of ſuch a means, as is put
into their own Power; for if this Courſe was taken in all
Pariſhes to imploy all that were able, and did want work,
then when you ſaw a luſty perſon begging in the ſtreets, you
might ſay, go to your Pariſh, and work for your Living: but
unleſs this be done, and you are ſure that this perſon may have
Employment, to bid him go work for his Living, is no better
than to ſay to a Brother or Siſter that is naked, and deſtitute
of daily Food, go be warmed and filled, but give them not
thoſe things that are needful for the Body.</p>
            <p>I pray God lay it not to the Charge of this City and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs,
that ſo little Care hath been taken in this reſpect, for
this is one of thoſe things to which it is chiefly owing, that
our priſons are ſo full of Fellons and Debtors, of which it is
thought, no Age hath produced the like; for tho I know
one man that within a few years laſt paſt, with the Charity
of ſome worthy perſons hath delivered many hundred poor
people out of Priſon, that lay there either for their Fees
or very ſmall Debts; and I have reaſon to believe that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more hath been delivered by others, yet let any one but
go to the Marſhalſey, or the priſon of <hi>White Chappel,</hi> or to
the two Compters of <hi>London,</hi> and he ſhall find them very
full of Priſoners at this time.</p>
            <p>It was hoped that the City of <hi>London</hi> would have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Stock, and appointed a place to which poor perſons
might have brought their Pawns, and have been ſupplyed
with Money upon any Extremity, which would have been
no loſs to the City, and much to the Advantage of the poor,
who now are fain to go to ſuch Brokers as will not lend
twenty Shillings a Week under ſix pence, which comes to
26 <hi>s.</hi> a year, by which Trade they make above two of one
in a years time, to the Ruine of many poor people; neither
is this the worſt of it, but for every 20 Shillings they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
they muſt leave many times, above 40. <hi>s.</hi> worth of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94424:22"/>
Goods, which they muſt fetch away in ſuch a time, which
being never ſo little elapſed, the Goods are no more to be
heard of.</p>
            <p>Neither are many of our Tally-men much better, who
truſt poor Perſons with twenty ſhillings worth of Goods, or
rather with twelve or fourteen ſhillings worth, inſtead of
twenty, to pay them by 6 <hi>d.</hi> or 12 <hi>d.</hi> a week, wherein, if
they fail to pay, they hurry them into a Priſon, with great
Charge for Arreſts and Proceedings at Law, which many
times exceed the firſt Debt (which we hope will be in a
great meaſure prevented, by ſetting up a Court of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and Borough of <hi>Southwark,</hi>
as it is at preſent in the City of <hi>London</hi>) at which Priſon,
they are ſure to lie, till Charity comes thither for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
of poor Priſoners, which they very well know will
come at ceatain times of the Year; and then, if you meet
with a kind Jaylor, or a Creditor of any Compaſſion, 'tis like
you may get out your Priſoner with ſome ſmall Abatement,
otherwiſe not; ſo that in effect, moſt of thoſe Moneys that
are carried to Priſons, run either into the Bailiffs, or the
Jaylors, or into the Pawn-brokers, or Tally-mens Pockets.</p>
            <p>This I inſtance, not to hinder people from delivering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
out of Priſon (I wiſh there were many more ſo well
minded) but to provoke them to do all they can to keep
them from coming thither: It being twice as great an Act of
Charity, and much more for the benefit of any perſon, to
keep him from falling and breaking his Head, than to take
him up and give him a Plaiſter: So to keep a poor man
from going to Priſon, is much greater Charity than to help
him out; and I heartily wiſh, that this ſort of Charity were
more in practice, both here and in other Countreys, where
they tell you of prodigious Numbers that are every Year
brought to their Hoſpitals and Charitable Houſes, when it is
much to be feared, little Care is taken to prevent that Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Miſery and Neceſſity that falls upon them; but is rather
occaſioned from the badneſs of ſome Laws, or from the want
of good ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:94424:22"/>
Methinks it were greatly to be wiſhed, that care were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to provide work for all our poor Debtors and Felons,
that being caſt into Priſon, could not there keep themſelves
without the Charity of ſuch places. Nay, for our Felons,
I ſee no reaſon but they ſhould be made to labour, though
they could otherwiſe provide for themſelves: This would
be a good means to prevent much of that Wickedneſs which
is practiced in thoſe places.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me very unreaſonable, that Priſons ſhould be
places of pleaſure, delight and choice; yet ſome ſuch there
are, into which, ſeveral perſons of good Eſtates, but very
bad Conſciences, remove themſelves on purpoſe to cheat
their Creditors, and to ſpend their own, and other mens Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
in Sloth and Luxury, whilſt their poor Creditors are
fain to fare hardly, and many times to live in Sorrow and
Want. As theſe therefore ſhould be wholly ſuppreſt on the
one hand, ſo alſo thoſe little Priſons about the Town, which
in ſome reſpects I may call little, becauſe the Houſes are not
big, by reaſon of which, 20 or 30 ſhall be caſt into one
room, and that none of the bigeſt, and alſo becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are not great for which perſons are ſent thither, tho'
it may be, ſome of them have more Commitments and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
in a Year, than <hi>Newgate</hi> it ſelf. Into ſome of theſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
I have known ſeveral perſons caſt for a debt often Groats,
and ſometimes for leſs, where, if the perſon continue but a
Night, his Fees ſhall be 13 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> to the Keeper and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
beſides 1 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> Garniſh-money, 3 <hi>s.</hi> for the Writ, and
5 <hi>s.</hi> for the Arreſt, with ſome other Charges. It it is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long ſince I had one of theſe Jaylors before the Judges,
for taking unlawful Fees, and other Exorbitant Practices;
but before any thing was determined in the Matter, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
made a Rope, and hanged himſelf. It is a moſt lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing, that theſe little Priſons are not ſuppreſt, or at leaſt
regulated, and a Table of Fees ſet up, both in them, and all
the Priſons of <hi>England,</hi> that ſo all the poor people may know
what they have to pay, and not be left to the mercy of a
cruel Jaylor, who rather than he will abate any thing of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94424:23"/>
his Demands, will keep a poor Wretch in Priſon till he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſtarved there, and his Wife and Children quite ſtarved
at home. I do not lay this Charge againſt them all, ſome I
have known to be more compaſſionate, yet ſuch I have
known alſo, that upon the leaſt Diſpleaſure taken againſt a
poor Priſoner, have threatned to make Dice of his Bones,
before he would abate him a penny, and no doubt he would
have been as good as his word. 'Tis in theſe places that they
eat up the poor of the Land, as a man would eat Bread; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are the Jaylers themſelves ſometimes more cruel, than
the poor people are one unto another, inſomuch, that I have
greatly wondred to ſee how violently they will proſecute one
another, it being moſt certainly true, which <hi>Solomon</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<hi>That when the Poor oppreſſeth the Poor, it is like a ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rain, that leaveth nothing behind it;</hi> much of which Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
alſo would be prevented by ſetting up a Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
in the out-parts of this City, as it is already in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
to which all perſons ſhould apply themſelves for any
Debt under 40 <hi>s.</hi> with very little Charge to themſelves; by
reaſon of which, the Creditor would be much more like to
get his Debt, and the Debtor better able to pay him, than
when five times the value of the Debt ſhall be run out in
Charges of a Suit, as many times I have known it, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine of the Debtor, and loſs of the Creditor's Money.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe Night-walkers, and other idle and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſons, that are ſent to <hi>Bridewel,</hi> and other Houſes of
Correction, it would be of great uſe, that there were ſome
Law to confine them to ſuch places for a certain time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of their Offences, where they might
be taught to work, and made able to get their own
Livings, both while they were there, and when they came
out, as it is in <hi>Holland</hi> and other places; whereas, for want of
ſuch a Law, theſe kind of people are no ſooner put into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but they are bailed out again, and if they do receive the
Correction of the houſe before they are diſcharged, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
very little, neither can it reaſonably be thought, but that
they will follow their old Trade again, for want of a better;
whereas 'tis very probable, if they were taught a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94424:23"/>
way to get a Living, they might leave off that wicked
courſe of Life, which they had followed, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to that Employment they had learnt in Priſon, or if
they did not, if ever they came in again, it might be for a
much longer time, which would make them at Leiſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
their Folly, and careful to avoid the like again, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
if they were ſuffered to eat no more than they earned,
and to do as much work for 2 <hi>d.</hi> in the Priſon, as they might
have three pence for if they were out, which would alſo
help to bear the Charge of ſuch places, which as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is the way taken beyond Sea, with great Advantage to
the perſons themſelves, who are hereby brought to Sobriety,
and alſo to ſuch Houſes. I have heard the worthy Preſident
and ſome of the Governours of <hi>Bridewel,</hi> complain of the
want of ſuch a Law, having obſerved, that of the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that have been ſent thither, of which many have been
corrected, yet few in compariſon, have been amended, but
as they have been ſoon diſcharged the Houſe, ſo they have
ſoon been brought thither again, without any Alteration,
except for the worſe. And how indeed can it otherwiſe be
expected, theſe people having been brought up to nothing
of Labour when they were at Liberty, nor taught nothing
when they were under Confinement, by which they might
provide for themſelves, will do it either by the old way they
formerly took, or ſome other as bad, rather than ſtarve.</p>
            <p>I humbly propoſe therefore, that the Women and young
people might be taught to ſpin well upon the double Wheel,
or to weave Lace, or the like, and that the men might be
taught to beat Hemp, dreſs Flax, or comb Wool, or elſe to
weave Linnen-cloth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to be taught theſe ſo well, that
they might find Employment in ſome of theſe ways, when they
came out of Priſon, which 'tis like, many would rather take
unto, than run the hazzard of ſuch another Confinement,
or by taking ſuch a Courſe as would bring them to the
Gallows. I my ſelf have found ſome people very hardly,
brought to any Employment at firſt, that by fair means have
fal'n to it, and the lazy Habit being got off, have been more
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94424:24"/>
pleaſed with it than to live in Idleneſs, and have ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for ſome years. When this is effected, the perſon is in
a manner out of danger: For I dare ſay, there hath been
more loſt through Idleneſs, than any other Vice whatſoever;
when people have no Work to do, or Employment to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
their firſt Attempt is to run into Debt of ſuch as will
be ſo mad to truſt them, which not being able to pay, they
are run into Priſon, from whence, if they get out by the
Charity of others, their next Trade is Begging, or it may be
Stealing, for which they come to be hanged.</p>
            <p>I therefore would adviſe all perſons who are ſo charitable
as to releaſe poor perſons out of Priſon, to take eſpecial care
of thoſe who have a Trade to follow, and a Houſe to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
when they went out; otherwiſe 'tis very like the Perſon
is better where he is, and in leſs danger of doing Miſchief,
either to himſelf or others: For, for want of theſe, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
being out, of Priſon, muſt either fall to begging, or that
which is ſtill worſe, ſtealing, or cutting of Purſes; inſomuch,
that I have ſometimes known, and heard often of perſons that
have been taken out of one Priſon for Debt, and in a ſhort
time thrown into another for Felony. But that I may return to
the Buſineſs I was upon, to encourage the providing of work
for the Poor, by means of which they may be better able to
provide Neceſſaries for themſelves.</p>
            <p>By ſo doing, all that have any Bowels of Compaſſion, will
find themſelves greatly eaſed in their minds, and their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
of the good things of this World, more ſweet and
pleaſant to them, when they are not imbittered with the ſad
thoughts of the Wants and Neceſſities of their poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who otherwiſe will have no way to relieve themſelves,
but wretched Begging, or wicked Stealing.</p>
            <p>Beſides that, they will be more ſecure in the Enjoyment
of their Goods, by how much there will be fewer perſons
that will have the temptation of extreme want to make them
ſteal, and be injurious unto others in their Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, to leave many things unſaid, all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
who are ſerious in the Profeſſion of Religion, and hope
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94424:24"/>
of Eternal Life, muſt needs rejoyce to have a hand in ſuch a
work as this; becauſe nothing can more confirm our hope
of having our portion among thoſe to whom our Lord Jeſus
will at the great day of Accounts ſay, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed of my
Father,</hi> &amp;c. then this, that we have relieved the hungry,
thirſty, naked and impriſoned, or have been a means to
preſerve thoſe that otherwiſe would have fallen into thoſe
Miſeries and Calamities.</p>

            <p>THus Sir, in compliance with your deſire, and the deſires
of ſeveral other Friends, I have expoſed my private
thoughts to publick View and Cenſure, not doubting, but all well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
and ingenuous perſons will accept of my good will, tho they
may not be ſatisfied with my reaſons, nor yet in the management
of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, which now for full five years hath been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with ſome difficulty, and very great pains, as any one muſt
imagine.</p>
            <p>This I am ſure is the worſt that can be ſaid of it, That it hath
not yet been brought to bear its own Charges. The reaſon of which,
I have already given in part: however this doth greatly ſatisfie
me, that every penny that hath been loſt by it, either by my ſelf, or
thoſe friends that have helpt to bear it, hath been many times gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Poor, and to the Publick; neither hath the loſs been ſo
great, as to afright any man that is able and hath a good mind,
from undertaking the like: For in above 4000 <hi>l.</hi> laid out the laſt
year, in the management of the whole Affair, reckoning Houſe-rent,
Servants Wages, loſs by Learners, with the Intereſt of the Money
employed in the Concern, there was not above 200 <hi>l.</hi> loſt, one
chief reaſon of which I muſt attribute to the kindneſs of ſeveral
perſons that took off ſome of the Commodities I made at the price
they coſt me; and in particular, to the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> and <hi>Guinnea</hi>
Company, who gave me encouragement to make their <hi>Allabas</hi>
Cloths and courſe <hi>Canvas</hi> for their Pepper-Baggs, which in former
times they uſe to have from other Countreys.</p>
            <p>'Tis moſt certain, that unleſs a higher Impoſt be laid upon fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Linnen, it will not be poſſible for us at preſent, to make it ſo
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94424:25"/>
cheap as it is brought over, for our poor people will neither work ſo
hard, nor can live ſo cheap as generally the poor people of other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
do; therefore we muſt be content to loſe ſomething in this way,
or find ſome other to employ our poor people in, for employed they
muſt be, as we tender the good of their Souls or Bodies; and I am
of Opinion, notwithſtanding all that I have yet heard or read to
the contrary, that the ſetting up the Linnen Manufacture would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways be of great Advantage to this Nation, although to provide
againſt the worſt, I have made a good Progreſs in the Woollen
Manufacture alſo, inſomuch, that had not the price of Wool ſo
greatly advanced of late, I doubt not but by this time to have made
one of one; but of this I ſhall give no further account at preſent.</p>
            <p>All that I have more to ſay, is to requeſt ſuch perſons as have
any Kindneſs for my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, to aſſiſt me therein, by taking
off my hands ſome of the Cloth the poor people ſhall make, at the
Price it ſtands me in, tho it be a little dearer than they might
have Cloth elſewere; I have met with ſome perſons ſo charitable,
that not having occaſion for any for their own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, have bought
good quantities to give away to the poor, who have been as thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for it as for Money, there being many thouſands that have not
above one Shirt to their Backs, and many that have none, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that within leſs than two years, I have given away to Men,
Women, and Children, above 3000, whoſe Bodies have been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refreſhed by them; and I doubt not but many of them have
bleſt God for them, and pray'd for their Benefactors.</p>
            <p>I have heard many people ſay, they would be ready to help ſuch
as are induſtrious: here are Objects to their own Hearts deſire, that
do all they can, but cannot do enough to keep themſelves from want,
inſomuch, that had I not been inabled to give many of them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
as well as work, when either they or their Children have fal'n
ſick, they might have periſhed through Want.</p>
            <p>If any one ſhall deſire thus to ſhew their Charity to the poor, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by buying the Cloth they make, or otherwiſe, what they ſhall
freely contribute to their Help and Relief, ſhall be faithfully given
to them by theirs, and the Poor's Servant,</p>
