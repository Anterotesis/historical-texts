            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Nation being awakened out of that Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which for ſo many Years had bound up its Senſes, and deprived it of all feeling and Perception; begins at laſt to diſcern it's dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and to provide againſt the ruine and miſchiefs which threaten it. Accordingly the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> have not only declared, <hi>nemine contradicente, That the Duke of York</hi>'s <hi>being a</hi> Papiſt, <hi>hath given the greateſt countenance to the preſent Deſigns and Conſpiracies of the</hi> Papiſts, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King and</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Religion;</hi> but have brought in a Bill, <hi>Diſabling him to Inherit the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, this being the Affair I deſign to Write freely to you about, I preſume in the very entrance to tell you, that they could do no leſs, without abandoning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the whole Kingdom, to Bondage and Popery. And all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men as well as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> are ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied of the neceſſity and Juſtice of the courſe which they ſteer; that they not only applaud and commend them in what they have undertaken, but are ready to ſtake their Lives and Fortunes towards the ſeeing it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95852:3"/>
Sect. I. Nor, in the firſt place, can the <hi>Papiſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Condemn us for taking theſe due ways and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to ſecure our Religion, and preſerve our Lives and Properties; ſeeing they are not only agreeable to the Meaſures, (but much more modeſt) which they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Forreign Countries to preſerve their own. Shall it be lawful for the <hi>French,</hi> to endeavour to preclude <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> from enjoying the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and muſt it be unjuſt for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to debar <hi>James Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> from attaining the Soveraignty over this Realm, that is a <hi>Papiſt?</hi> Shall the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> cheriſh and juſtify a Bloody War, upon the alone foot of his being of a different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from what was received in that Nation? And ſhall not we be allowed to uſe ſuch legal means, as are conſiſtent with and warranted by our Conſtitution, to hinder a <hi>Papiſt</hi> from aſcending the Regal Throne of this Kingdom? Shall it be lawful for thoſe in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Papal Church,</hi> to adviſe <hi>Phillip</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> to Murder his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> for ſpeaking only favourably of his Fathers Subjects in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> who were called <hi>Lutherans?</hi> And ſhall not we have the liberty humbly to pray and deſire our King, to deſert a Brother who hath Plotted the Ruin of his <hi>Majeſties Subjects,</hi> and for no other reaſon but becauſe they are not <hi>Papiſts.</hi> And ſuppoſe it ſhould be ſaid; that theſe methods were not only unjuſt, but Condemned by ſome of the very <hi>Roman Communion;</hi> yet the deſparity is ſo great between a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> arriving at the Government over a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and a <hi>Proteſtants</hi> being advanced to Reign over a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Countrey, that it will no ways follow from thence, that what the Parliament have undertaken, is in the leaſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95852:3"/>
reprehenſible. For no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince will either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave his Kingdom or Subjects to a Forreign Juriſdiction, nor call his People into queſtion for their Religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be not influenced by the Principles of it, to diſturb the Government, and diſquiet the Civil Peace. So that <hi>Papiſts</hi> inſtead of receiving prejudice by having a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince to rule over them, they become poſſeſt of many advantages as to ſafety, eaſe and immunities, which their being under a <hi>Popiſh</hi> King excludes them from. And therefore it is, that we find the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do no where ſo fully enjoy the Right and Liberties of mankind, as in ſome <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Nations, where they have had the Wit and Sobriety, not to moleſt their fellow Subjects, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt the Government under which they live. So far as their Religion is found to have an Influence only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a future Life, and meerly to endanger their own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they are pitied inſtead of being Capitally Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the worſt they are made to ſuffer, is now and then to be rationally accoſted by their Neighbours, and addreſſed unto by arguments, which may conduce to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify and inſtruct their <hi>Judgments.</hi> Whereas through the having a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prince Succeed over a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they become immediately ſubjected to the ſevereſt Puniſhments, and that upon the alone ſcore of their Chriſtian Profeſſion. It is not only lawful for ſuch a <hi>Prince</hi> to deſtroy thoſe of his Subjects, who diſagree from him in Faith and worſhip, but it is an indiſpenſable Duty upon him to do it. Nor is he only ſure of a <hi>Pardon</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the accompliſhing ſo Bleſſed a work, but the merit of the Atchievement entitles him to unſpeakable Happineſs and a Glorious Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95852:4"/>
Sect. 2. And this conducts me to the <hi>2d.</hi> thing, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that no <hi>Papiſt</hi> ever ſince the Reformation ſucceeded to Supream Authority over a <hi>Proteſtant Country,</hi> but he both endeavoured to overthrow the Religion which he found Eſtabliſhed, and purſued his Subjects with the moſt outragious <hi>Cruelties.</hi> Nor hath the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of their <hi>People</hi> been able to appeaſe or obſtruct their indignation, but they have been treated as the worſt of <hi>Criminals,</hi> becauſe they would not renounce the Faith which they had embrac'd. This is ſo certain and beyond all control as to matter of Fact, that there is not one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance upon the whole file of Hiſtory to the contrary. Whereſoever any of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Belief, have attained the Soveraignty over a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Nation; whether they were <hi>Crowned Heads</hi> or <hi>Princes</hi> of a more Inferior Rank, they have Univerſally applyed themſelves to Subvert the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> which they found legally ſetled, and to deſtroy thoſe innocent and generous Souls which had the courage to own it. And if <hi>Sweedland, Hungary, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Principalities</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> do not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to confirm the truth of this Aſſertion; <hi>England</hi> can produce Queen <hi>Mary</hi> in the proof, and for the atteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. And as I challenge any man to aſſign ſo much as one oppoſite Example, ſo it is not to be expreſſed what <hi>Cruelties</hi> they have uſed towards the accompliſhing their Deſign of rooting out <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> and re-eſtabliſhing <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Not only Laws have been trampled upon, but <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> made ſwim with Blood, in order to the extirpating the Faith of the Goſpel and deſtroying thoſe who profeſt it. And therefore let me ſay, that the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Lot which hath befallen other Nations, through their folly in admitting perſons of a <hi>Papal Stamp</hi> to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95852:4"/>
over them, ſhould inſtruct <hi>England</hi> to prevent and obviate his aſcent to the Throne, from whom we may juſtly expect to undergo the ſame miſchiefs.</p>
            <p>Sect. 3. For thirdly, no Antecedent Promiſes made by <hi>Popiſh Princes</hi> on their Aſſumption to Rule over <hi>Proteſtant Countries,</hi> have been any ſecurity to thoſe who relyed on them, or any confinement to ſuch as made them. The Examples of the violation of all Faith are as numerous, as the Perſons who have been admitted to Sovereignty upon ſuch Stipulations. Every own knoweth that it was the Emperor's Tranſgreſſing againſt the promiſes which he had made to the <hi>Bohemian's</hi> concerning the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their Religion, which occaſioned that long bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and fatal War. And as thereby all <hi>Europe</hi> came leſs or more to be concerned and entangled; So by the ill conduct of ſome, and Treachery of others, the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> after the ſhedding of an Ocean of Blood, is at laſt extirpated that Kingdom. Yea the preſent differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Hungary</hi> between the Emperour and that People, are wholly to be reſolved into a departure from the <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> which <hi>Ferdinando</hi> made to them for their preſervation in the enjoyment of their Religion, when in <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. he was choſen to be their King. And notwithſtanding the <hi>Hungarians</hi> have been at all times ready to ſubmit to his Imperial Majeſty, providing their Religion and Legal Rights might according to the firſt Contracts and Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations be ſecured unto them; yet in the midſt of all his neceſſities he hath choſen rather to venture the ruine both of the Empire and his own Hereditary Countries by the <hi>French,</hi> than fulfil the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of his <hi>Anceſtors</hi> or comply with ſo juſt Requeſts. Which plainly ſhews us that it muſt be a ſtrange implacableneſs which <hi>Papiſts</hi> bear to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95852:5"/>
our Religion, that neither regard to <hi>Covenants</hi> nor inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of State can induce them to moderation towards ſuch as profeſs and maintain it: But what need we to conſult Forreign Examples, ſeeing our own <hi>Queen Mary</hi> affords us a remarkable inſtance as to breach of Faith in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Who as ſhe was the only <hi>Papiſt</hi> who hath weilded the <hi>Engliſh Scepter</hi> ſince the Reformation, ſo ſhe hath left us abundant warning how we admit others of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Stamp to aſcend the Throne, be their <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> before hand what they will. For neither the finding the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> legally eſtabliſhed, nor the having pledged her own Faith for the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Eſtabliſhment, were of any ſignificancy to keep out <hi>Popery,</hi> or to ſecure <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from Fire and Faggot, when once ſhe was poſſeſſed of the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sect 4. And therefore fourthly, Some Neighbouring Nations <hi>Profeſſing</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> having found that by ſubmitting to ſuffer a <hi>Papiſt</hi> to Reign over them, they had betrayed themſelves to loſe all that was dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; took not only care to relieve themſelves from the Violence and Treacherous Attempts of their Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Papiſh</hi> King; but made <hi>Proviſion</hi> to debar all of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Principles,</hi> from being capable for the future of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the Throne. The caſe in brief ſtood thus, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmond</hi> the <hi>Sweed</hi> who had been before choſen King of <hi>Poland,</hi> was as next Heir to the Deceaſed King of <hi>Sweedland</hi> admitted to the Throne of that Kingdom, but upon previous conditions that he ſhould not infringe their Liberty as to Religion, nor introduce <hi>Popery</hi> which they had Baniſhed out of their Dominion. Now this <hi>Prince</hi> having contrary to all Stipulations endeavoured both to overthrow their Religion, and to break in upon their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95852:5"/>
Rights; The <hi>Sweeds</hi> like a generous People that would expoſe themſelves to all hazards rather than give up their legal Rights, and Sacrifice their Conſciences to the Will and Luſt of their <hi>Prince,</hi> commenced a War againſt him under the Conduct of his Uncle <hi>Charles,</hi> whom they choſe to be their Protector. In which War being at laſt Conquerours, they not only Depoſed him, but made a Law that no <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſhould at any time after be truſted with the Scepter. And how conduceable that Law hath been to their Preſervation, all the World hath obſerved upon <hi>Queen Chriſtina</hi>'s reſigning the Kingdom, having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a purpoſe of Renouncing her Religion. For as ſhe knew that ſhe could not declare her ſelf a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and at the ſame time remain their Queen; ſo they had too ſadly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced what it was to have Popery and Soveraignty meet in one Perſon, to ſuffer her to continue their Soveraign if ſhe once abjured their Religion. Now I would gladly be informed, why the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> may not as well exclude a <hi>Papiſt</hi> from all capacity of mounting the Throne, to deſtroy this Nation and the Reſormed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion here, as the States and People of <hi>Sweedland</hi> have done there. Surely it is much better to be inſtructed by the Prudence of others after the foretaſt of manifold miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which they had undergone, than when we have made our ſelves through folly and Credulity Subjects and Examples of miſery, to think to provide for our own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety and Intereſt, and theſe of our Poſterity by the hopes of an aftergaim.</p>
            <p>Sect. 5. Fifthly ſuppoſing it were poſſible at an other juncture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to preſerve our Religion under a <hi>Popi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h Prince,</hi> and that therefore it were not altogether unreaſonable to admit one; yet at this Seaſon when the whole <hi>Papal</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

in <hi>Europe</hi> have Conſpired to extirpate Proteſtancy in all the Schem's and Branches of it, it were no leſs than mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to think we could ſecure our Religion, were the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Authority over theſe Nations once lodged in a Papal hand. He muſt be very ignorant in the preſent State of things, who doth not know that there is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign laid and carried on for the enſlaving all <hi>Europe</hi> again to the Tripple Crown. And he muſt be alſo a very great ſtranger in the Affair's of the World, that doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how far this Projection hath already ſucceeded, and that there is very little wanting to the full accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of it. I am ſure ſeparate but once <hi>England</hi> from a hearty eſpouſal of the Proteſtant Intereſt, and it muſt neceſſarily ſink and, without a Miracle, be ſupplanted in all other places. And as we cannot imagine that ſhould we have a Popiſh Prince in <hi>England,</hi> he would prevent the ruine of a Religion elſewhere which himſelf hath renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; ſo we can as little think that he would ſupport a Religion at home, that is both oppoſite to his own, and which had loſt it's footing every where elſe. So that as matters ſtand, we ſhould by admitting a Popiſh Prince to Succeed his Majeſty, not only loſe the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from our ſelves and our poſterity, but through aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of that profeſſion abroad, we ſhould be a means of making all the World Vaſſals again to the Romiſh Yoke. And hence it is that the Eyes and Hopes of all <hi>proteſtants</hi> are upon the preſent <hi>parliament,</hi> and from the Councels of this great Aſſembly, they are ready to date their Happineſs or Miſery. How much they judge their whole intereſt and concernments to be wrapt up in our Conſultations and Reſolves, is evident from this, that ſince the meeting of this Aſſembly, they have in ſeveral <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Countries</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> abroad, obſerved Selemn
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95852:6"/>
days of Faſting and Prayer, to beg a bleſſing from the Lord upon it, and that there may be a happy correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between the King and his Parliament.</p>
            <p>Sect. 6. Sixthly, ſhould it be allowed as a thing (at leaſt) credible, that there are ſome perſons in the Papal Communion, who ſhould they aſcend the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, we might nevertheleſs depoſite with them and conſign into their hands the preſerving of our Laws and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion; yet we have little Reafon to believe <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> to be a perſon of that temper and moderation, that we ought in a matter of this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and importance to rely upon him. For though I could venture far upon the Moral Principles and good Nature of ſuch a one as <hi>Maximilian</hi> was; yet I would be loth to abandon my life, fortune, and the liberty of my Worſhipping God to ſuch as <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain</hi> were. And if I miſtake not, the experience we have had of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> while only in a remote proſpect of the Crown, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inſtruct us what we are to expect from him were he once poſſeſt of it, and veſted with the Purple Robe. He that while ſubject to the Law hath ſo induſtrioufly purſued the ſubverſion of Proteſtancy, which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and fenced by it; what would he not do? were he once ſo ſtated, as that according to a fundamental Maxim of our Law, he could do no wrong. If you take a view of his private Friends, during his being in the rank of a Subject, you may eafily gueſs what his publick Miniſters would be, were he once arrived to the Quality of a King. There are few men of any Obſervation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Town, but they have taken notice that both his Court at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and his Train in the Park uſed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95852:7"/>
moſtly to couſiſt of thoſe who had formerly waſhen their hands in the blood of Proteſtants, or who are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Off-ſpring of thoſe that did. And how far we have reaſon to ſuppoſe he would be from overthrowing our Religion, and trampling upon our Laws, were his Temples once encircled with our Imperial Crown, we may in ſome degree learn from the arbitrary Counſels which he hath been obſerved to give, and the Plots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Religion which he hath influenced, and (to ſpeak modeſtly) hath given countenance unto.</p>
            <p>Sect. 7. Seventhly, The Nation hath already ſo much provok'd him, that it will not be hereafter ſafe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him to a condition, and truſt him with a power, whereby he may be enabled to revenge himſelf. The very endeavours of this Parliament, and the laſt, to diſable him from inheriting the Imperial Crown, will be judged expiable by no leſs than the blood of thoſe worthy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots who acquitted themſelves ſo well in thoſe two Houſes. And therefore as they have engaged themſelves beyond any poſſibility of a ſafe retreat, it were a baſe thing in thoſe whom they repreſent, and whoſe welfare in all this they have been conſulting, to abandon them to the revenge of an enraged and implacable Prince. It had argued great ſimplicity to have truſted him with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at any time ſince we had the firſt opportunity to know him, ſeeing a ſecret averſation for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath betrayed it ſelf in his whole carriage ever ſince his Majeſties Return: but we ſhould proclaim our ſelves perfectly frantick, after we have expreſſed our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments for his ill behaviour towards our Laws and Religion, and thereby have more exaſperated him, if we ſhould truſt our lives, fortunes, and conſciences under
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95852:7"/>
his power, and leave them to his mercy and diſcretion If a gracious King, who could both command him and and call him to an account, hath hardly been able from time to time to reſtrain his fury, what can be able to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle him wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n he hath all under his power, and hath no man to controll him. Beſides, how many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants muſt be offered up, to attone for the deaths of the late <hi>Tyburn</hi> Martyrs? The blood of thouſands will be accounted too little, to appeaſe the angry Ghoſts of thoſe who have ſuffered by reaſon of this meritorious Plot.</p>
            <p>Sect. 8. Eighthly, It were ridiculous to entertain any thoughts of diſcouraging the Papiſts from proſecuting their Conſpiracies, while we leave them any hopes or expectations of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s ſucceeding to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For as ſo many of all qualities and conditions would never have embarkt in deſigns ſo hazardous to themſelves and their poſterity, unleſs they had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and ſupported by the hopes of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s being the preſumptive Heir; ſo they will never deſiſt from purſuing the Plot wherein they are engaged for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving of <hi>England,</hi> and the final ſubjugating the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhern Hereſie,</hi> while there is any probability left them of his coming to the Throne. So long as they enjoy the leaſt hope that it is poſſible for the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unto his Majeſty, inſtead of being diſheartned from following their trayterous undertakings, they will be animated to accelerate their Villanies, eſpecially that of deſtroying the King. You may find that through the interruption of this affair, during the late interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and the laſt Parliament, how that inſtead of being diſmaid by the detection of their Crimes, they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95852:8"/>
have been enflam'd to carry on their Plots with more Zeal and Vigour than ever. Moreover as the diſabling the <hi>Duke</hi> to Inherit the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> of this <hi>Realm,</hi> is the only rational <hi>medium</hi> to hinder the continuation and purſuit of the Plot, ſo it will be the moſt effectual induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prevail with Perſons to come in and make a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther detection of it. For can we reaſonably conceive that they who have cooperate in it, ſhould venture by diſcovering to ſave us; when they muſt needs know that their reward may in a ſhort time, amount to their being hanged themſelves for their Service, 'Tis indeed a wonder, that in the proſpect of Death, and Torment which ſuch perſons muſt neceſſarily foreſee themſelves adjudged unto, ſhould a <hi>Papiſt</hi> once mount the Throne, how ſo many have already expoſed themſelves to lay open this Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Religion and Government. Whereas were the <hi>Duke</hi> made once uncapable of arriving at the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over this Nation, there are many more who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves put into a condition of ſafety for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as well as for the preſent, would undoubtedly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the proſpect of any reward, offer themſelves to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of further detecting, and thereby diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this whole Helliſh Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>Sect. 9. Ninthly, There is nothing in this Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, but what is conſonant unto, and juſtified by that which is the Supream and Ultimate end of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, For no Government was either deſigned by God, or ever erected by Men, but in order to ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. All Humane Laws whether they relate to the kinds of Government, or the ways in which perſons ſhall Succeed unto it, they ſuppoſe an Antecedent Right in Men of protecting their Lives and Liberties, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95852:8"/>
to themſelves a freedom of judging how they ought to ſerve and worſhip their Creator and Maker; and the deſign of all Humane Laws is to ſecure thoſe Antecedent and Natural Rights. No perſons ever Congregated or Coaleſc'd into Societies, but with an intent to live more ſafely and better, than if they ſhould continue ſeparated and alone. Nor did ever any condeſcend on this or that mode and form of Government, but with a proſpect and upon a ſuppoſal, that the Priviledges, Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men ſhould be preſerved unto them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as all Government is founded in Truſt and ſetled in ſuch a <hi>perſon</hi> or limitted to ſuch a <hi>Family,</hi> for the ſafety and advantage of the people as well as of the Ruler; ſo there can be ſuppoſed no primitive Agreements in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſuch and ſuch links of Succeſſion, where the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the people is unavoidable without a break in the Chain. If an Ideot may be juſtly put by from Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Royal line, becauſe he is uncapable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the intereſt of his people, or protecting them in their Rights; much more may one who hath deſigned and reſolved to deſtroy them, and overthrow every thing for which Kingſhip was both erected and ſubmitted unto; be debarred all Plea and Title to inherit. For to what purpoſe ſerve Laws betwixt King and People, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us not only concerning the Fealty and Obedience which we are to pay to our Prince, but what we may claim and expect from him that is to be advanced to that Grandure and Dignity, Yea were there any Laws for the Eſtabliſhment of a Mortal Enemy over us, on this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſuppoſal that he were of next affinity to the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lawful Prince, ſuch Laws were revocable and ought to be repealed as inconſiſtent with the ſafety and happineſs of Subjects. For though our Anceſtors might
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95852:9"/>
reſtrain and limit us in the uſage of thoſe things which we derive from them; yet they could not reſtrain and limit us in ſuch things which we have a right unto by the Law of Nature. That is (and bleſſed be God they never attempted it) they could not deprive us of, nor abdicate from us, a right to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelves from our declared Adverſary. So that if the people of <hi>England</hi> be but acknowledged to have a right to preſerve their Lives, maintain their Proprieties, or ſecure their <hi>Religion;</hi> it is lawful for them to diſable the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to Inherit the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> of this <hi>Realm,</hi> as having already not only rendred himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to the Nation in all theſe, but Proclamed by his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he is an open Enemy to every one of them.</p>
            <p>Sect. 10. Tenthly; It is remarkable that there was never a conveyance of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to any perſon, but upon the tacite concurrance and with the virtual or implicite conſent of the people. And indeed though a people may be made Slaves without their Conſent, yet it is impoſſible that they ſhould be free Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects but with it. And therefore anciently before any King of <hi>England</hi> was actually Crowned, the people, being firſt acquainted with the day appointed for that Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were three ſeveral times publickly ask'd, whether they would have ſuch a perſon to Rule over them. And till the conſent of the people was thus obtained and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, they who held in Fee of the King together with the Nobility, were not obliged, neither were they called to do Homage to him. And though theſe kind of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures be ſince aboliſhed by Act of Parliament, yet it plainly ſhews that heretofore the Nation had a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in recognizing the Right of their King. Now the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95852:9"/>
of <hi>England</hi> are no where ſo Univerſally preſent, as when Repreſented in Parliament by thoſe whom they have choſen and delegated to act in their Places and Names, as well as for their intereſts. And therefore what is the Language of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> 1s the unanimous Voice of all the People of <hi>England.</hi> Yea were the ſeveral Individuals of the Nation to be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Opinion, they would harmoniouſly reſound the Vote of that Houſe, namely that they will not have <hi>James Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Reign over them,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sect. 11. Eleventhly, The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> have from time to time ſo diſpoſed of the <hi>Crown of this R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alm,</hi> as both to ſettle and limite the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> in referrence to the <hi>Engliſh Throne.</hi> It was a Parliament that Depoſed <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, and choſe <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> to <hi>Reign in his ſtead.</hi> It was a Parliament which limitted the <hi>Crown</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> only for his Life with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of his Poſterity from all Title to it, and ſetled the Succeſſion upon <hi>Richard Duke of York.</hi> And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable that they who afterwards took part with the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> and fought by his Authority, as well as under his Banner at the Battel of <hi>Wakefield,</hi> where <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> was killed; were in the <hi>1ſt.</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> attainted of Treaſon becauſe they fought againſt and ſlew a perſon who was by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Heir</hi> after <hi>Henry</hi> to the <hi>Crown.</hi> It was a Parliament who choſe and advanced <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>3d;</hi> though <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> had not only left behind him a Brothers Son whoſe Title was <hi>Prior</hi> to <hi>Richards,</hi> but two Sons of his own. It was the Parliament that entailed the <hi>Crown</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4ths</hi> time; and ſetled the Inheritance of the <hi>Realms</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. Upon his Sons by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95852:10"/>
Name, and upon all of them ſucceſſively, in caſe <hi>He</hi> or <hi>They</hi> upon whom the ſettlement was firſt made, ſhould die without Heirs? Yea our Parliaments during the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> made a threeſold Settlement and Entail of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and that with ſuch various <hi>Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Proviſions,</hi> as they thought the intereſt of the Kingdom conducted them unto. Theſe three Entails were made and enacted the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> and the <hi>35th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> But to omit more Inſtances, it was the Parliament that having by Statute Recogniſed <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> Title to the Crown in the firſt Year of her Reign, afterwards Entailed it upon her and the Heirs of her Body in caſe ſhe ſhould come to have any, in the 13 of her Raign. Now it is very remarkable that in diverſe of theſe Entailes and Settlements, our Parliaments proceeded without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Legitimacy, their ſole will and pleaſure, under the Influence which the intereſt of the Kingdom had upon them, being both the beſt motive into which we can reſolve diverſe of thoſe Settlements, and the only Standard according to which we muſt account for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations contained in ſome of thoſe Entails. And can we be ſo ſilly as to believe that the moſt Magnanimous and Victorious Princes that ever Reigned over this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would have ſuffered Parliaments to interpoſe about the Succeſſion and meddle in the diſpoſal of it, if it had not appertained unto them by the conſtitution of the Kingdom and the ancient Uſages thereof. Surely bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Inheritance of the Crown by the Regnant Prince, would have better become the Prerogative of our Kings, if they had not believed that it belonged to the Parliament in conjunction and Cooperation with their Kings to diſpoſe and to ſettle that matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95852:10"/>
Sect. 12. Twelfthly, Nor hath the ſupreme Court of Parliament in their interpoſure about the diſpoſal of the Crown of this Realm, confined themſelves to nearneſs and proximity of Blood, as if it had been to deſcend without interruption, or be conveyed to the next in the Royal Line. And therefore whoſoever conſults our Laws and Hiſtories, they will find that our Parliaments in their choice and deſignation of Princes to aſcend the Throne, have often diverted from the next of Kin, and regulated themſelves in their Election and Appointments by the alone Meaſures of Publick Good, and the ſafety and happineſs of the Kingdom. And to begin with <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Conquerour, that <hi>Norman</hi> Prince had no right but from the Peoples Election of him. For whereas he pretended to derive a Title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> from the Will and Teſtament of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> that very <hi>Edward</hi> had no hereditary right himſelf. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by the peoples advancing <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman</hi> to the Throne of this Realm, <hi>Edgar Etheling</hi> the neareſt Prince to the Crown, if reſpect had been ſhewn to Blood, was excluded and ſhut out. And no ſooner was <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour dead, but <hi>William Rufus</hi> was preferred before <hi>Robert,</hi> who being his eldeſt Brother would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have had the better right. Yea upon the deceaſe of <hi>Rufus, Robert</hi> was again put by (though upon an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between them two he had been promiſed the Crown in Reverſion after him) and <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt was advanced in his room. And if we proceed a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſhall find that King <hi>John</hi> was advanced before his eldeſt Brothers Son, who muſt needs have had the beſt right, if nearneſs of Blood had obtained and taken place. And to paſs by other Examples, it is eaſie to determine
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95852:11"/>
whether any regard was had to the next of Kin, when <hi>Richard</hi> the Third was preferred before the two Sons of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth.</p>
            <p>Sect. 13. Laſtly, The Bill depending before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament about diſabling the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> to inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> is not introductive of a new Law, but corroborative and explanatory of thoſe which we have already. And indeed all the Laws which we are provided of againſt Popery, are not only weak fenſes to withſtand the irruption of it; but in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>null</hi> and void, unleſs we admit that there is this intended in them, that no Popiſh Prince ſhall ever be allowed to Reign in <hi>England.</hi> And this being of ſome conſequence to be known, I ſhall therefore inſiſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the more largely upon it. Every one knows that there is a vaſt difference between a perſons right to an Eſtate, and perſons remote Title only to Govern. For an Eſtate is a mans Property, whereas the advancing one to Rule over a Nation, is but the recognizing of a Right originally incluſive of a Truſt. And therefore if our Laws have made Papiſts to forfeit their Eſtates, or any part of them, for meer Recuſancy: We may very rationally ſuppoſe that they intended that every Popiſh Recuſant ſhould forfeit and be incapable of all Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſeeing that is but a Truſt limited to ſuch a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in order to the preſerving us in our due Rights. Now that our Laws have made Papiſts liable to <hi>forfeit all their Goods and two Thirds of their real Eſtates,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>all Title either by Birthright or Purchaſe which they may have in them,</hi> is evident and beyond all contradiction to whoſoever reads the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 29. of <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 6. and the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 3. of <hi>James, cap.</hi> 4.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95852:11"/>
Beſides our <hi>Laws</hi> provide <hi>that no Recuſant Convict ſhall be a publick Officer, or ſhall exerciſe any publick Office or Charge in the Commonwealth,</hi> but that <hi>every Recuſant ſhall be utterly diſabled to exerciſe the ſame by himſelf or by his Deputy. Sat.</hi> 3. of <hi>Jam. cap.</hi> 4. Yea <hi>that they ſhall be diſabled in Law to receive, take, or have any Office, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, or Service in this Realm. Stat.</hi> 1. <hi>of</hi> Eliz. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. And can it after all this be thought, that they who Enacted thoſe Laws, intended that it ſhould be lawful for a Popiſh Prince to aſcend the Throne, and be truſted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Soveraign Rule over us?</p>
            <p>Moreover our Laws have ordained and declared, That <hi>every Papiſt who is convicted, ſhall be diſabled to be an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, Adminiſtrator, or to have the Cuſtody of any Child, as Guardian, and that if any Wards be granted to ſuch, they ſhall be utterly void, and of none effect. Stat.</hi> 3. of <hi>James cap.</hi> 4. And can we then ſuppoſe, that they who enacted that Law, ever thought, or intended that a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> ſhould be capable of having the <hi>Guardianſhip</hi> of the whole Nation. Our Parliaments have provided both by a <hi>Statute</hi> of the 13. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. and by one of the 23. of <hi>Eliz, cap.</hi> 1. and by another of the 3. of <hi>James cap.</hi> 4. That <hi>it ſhall be Treaſon to be reconciled to the Church of Rome.</hi> Now as thoſe Laws are wholly inſignificant, as to ends for which they were made, if a Papiſt be left ſtill capable of inheriting the Crown; ſo I cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but think, that they do in effect exclude all ſuch who ſuffer themſelves to be ſeduced to Popery, and who thereupon are brought to acknowledge a forraign Juriſdiction, from all Right, Claim and Title to the Throne of this Realm. I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is alſo provided by a Statute of the 5. of <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>That it ſhall be Treaſon, by Deed, or Act,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to hold, or ſtand with, extoll, maintain, or</hi>

If he that both doth all this, and alſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in it, be held ſtill capable of mounting the Throne.</p>
            <p>Again the Statute of the 3d of <hi>James</hi> which appointeth and injoyneth the <hi>Oath of Allegience,</hi> doth in reality and in the drift and Scope of it, debar a <hi>Papiſt</hi> from being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Reign in <hi>England.</hi> For as the Deſign of that <hi>Oath</hi> was to extirpate <hi>Popery,</hi> ſo that is impoſſible to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, ſhould we be liable to admit a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor.</hi> Nor can there be any thing more ſilly and ridiculous to be required of us, than that we ſhould ſwear <hi>Allegiance</hi> to a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Popery.</hi> And not to purſue this point any further, the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 1 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> can no ways be adiuſted to Principles of Reaſon and Wiſdom, if notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing contained in that <hi>Law,</hi> a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Recuſant remains in a condition to inherit the Imperial Crown of this Realm, In a word that and all other <hi>Statutes</hi> made againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> ſerve only to reduce us into a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than ever we were, if this do not run thorough and enliven them with ſenſe as well as vertue, namely that no <hi>Papiſt</hi> can have right, or is ever to be ſuffered to Reign over this Nation.</p>
            <p>SIR, You ſee with what Freedom, I have repreſened my thoughts unto you in relation to the <hi>Bill for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling</hi> James <hi>Duke of</hi> YORK, <hi>to Inherit the imperial Crown of this Realm.</hi> And indeed it is a Bill of vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, not only to our ſelves and poſterity, but to all of other Nations who have forſaken the Fellowſhip of the Papal Church. I could have not only enlarged upon the

ſeveral heads, but have reaſoned from more <hi>Topicks:</hi> But I think there is enough already ſaid for one <hi>Letter,</hi> and ſhall therefore reſerve the reſt, till I receive your Advice whether it be neceſſary to ſay any more, or whether you dare truſt the farther manage of it in ſo weak and mean a Hand.</p>
            <p>And ſhall only add that our Church-Men are like to be ſtrangly entangled, ſhould the <hi>Bill</hi> once paſs into an <hi>Act.</hi> For if they omit to <hi>Pray</hi> for the <hi>Illuſtrious Prince James Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> they will be thought to <hi>offend</hi> againſt the <hi>Obligations</hi> they are under of <hi>reading</hi> the whole <hi>Liturgy;</hi> and ſhould they continue to pray for him in the wonted <hi>form,</hi> they may perhaps not only meet with ſome affront from the angry and incenced Multitude, but be judged by wiſer Heads, to beſpeak a publick Calamity at the hands of God, and entreat him to inflict the worſt of Judgments upon the Nation. I am.</p>
