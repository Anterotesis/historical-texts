            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former
part of this
chapter, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
hath faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
related
the drying of
the waters after the stood; and
Noahs sacrificing vnto God,
with Gods acceptance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Now in this verse and the


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:555:8"/>
next, he recordeth such lawes
and decrees as God made
with Noah touching the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration
of nature perished
by the flood; as well for the
sparing of the creatures from
such like destruction, as for
the continuance of his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in needefull times and
seasons, meete for their future
preseruation. These wordes
containe the first of these
lawes: wherein we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
three points; Moses his
preface to this law; the law
it selfe; and the reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>I. The preface; <hi>And the
Lord said in his heart:</hi> These
words must not be taken
properly, for God hath not
an heart as man hath, neither
speaketh he as man doth; but
hereby is meant, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:555:8"/>
and set downe with
himselfe this law and decree.</p>
               <p>In this phrase of speech,
note this one thing: If it had
pleased him, God could haue
spoken to man by a voice, the
hearing whereof would haue
confounded him: but as here
we see, he doth abase him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and as it were lay aside
his honour and might, and
speaketh vnto vs after the
manner of men, euen to the
capacitie of the most simple.
Which teacheth vs, that it is
the good will and pleasure of
God, that not onely the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but euen the vnlettered
and most ignorant should
knowe and vnderstand the
holy Scripture: for els he
would neuer haue penned
them in a phrase &amp; style that
doth so well accord to the


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:555:9"/>
capacitie of the simple.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Point.</hi> The decree it
selfe: <hi>I will henceforth curse the
ground no more for mans cause.</hi>
This is the peremptorie lawe
of God touching the restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of nature: wherein are
contained two things: first
what God hath done: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what God will not doe
hereafter. The thing that God
hath done is, <hi>the cursing of the
earth:</hi> for he saith, <hi>I will curse
no more:</hi> implying that he once
cursed it.</p>
               <p>In this obserue, that God
may truly be said to be a
cause of curses, and to curse
his creatures: not onely for
that he doth ordaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
all curses, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he inflicteth them vpon
the creatures: yet so as the
same is alwaies most iustly


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:555:9"/>
deserued by sinne, before it
be inflicted of the Lord. And
so must Gods <hi>cursing of the
earth</hi> be vnderstood in this
place, as a fruit of his wrath
for the sinne of man: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
God is said directly to
<note n="a" place="margin">Isa. 45. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>create euill,</hi> because what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
afflictions, curses, and
punishments are in the world,
they are ordained and infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by God vpon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
for the sinne of man.</p>
               <p>This plainly confuteth the
common opinion of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
people, who hold that all
good things, as peace, wealth,
ioy, and felicitie, come from
God: but all euill, as afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
calamitie, curses, &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
come from the deuill,
and God onely suffereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.
This is a most erroneous and
blind conceipt, which filleth


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:555:10"/>
many a soule with much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
and impatience: for
what comfort can he haue in
the time of trouble, that is
perswaded it commeth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the deuill, and the
hand of God is not therein?
We therefore must learne to
reforme this opinion, and
know that crosses, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
come from God. This
Dauid knew well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when Shemi cursed him,
and railed on him, he forbad
Ab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>shai to touch him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(saith he)<note n="b" place="margin">2. Sam. 16. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>what if</hi> (or, <hi>it
may be) God hath bid him curse
Dauid:</hi> so Ioseph telleth his
brethren, who most traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
sold him into Egypt,
that<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 45. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord sent him before
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, here consider
the impulsiue cause that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:555:10"/>
God to curse the earth
by a flood: it was not in the
earth, but in men: I wil hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
curse the earth no more
<hi>for man,</hi> that is, for mans
sinnes. In the newe Testament
there are two especiall sinnes
recorded for which God sent
this curse: first, <hi>carnall securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
They were choaked with
worldly cares, and drowned
in earthly pleasures: <hi>in the daies
of Noah, they did eat, and drinke,
marrie, and giue in marriage,</hi>
Matth. 24. 38. Secondly, the
<hi>contempt of the Gospell</hi> in the
ministerie of Noah, who
preached an hundred and
twentie yeares vnto them,
while the Arke was in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but they were disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
as<note n="d" place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Peter</hi> saith, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their owne pleasures and
delights. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:555:11"/>
that these two sinnes,
<hi>Securitie,</hi> and <hi>contempt of the
Gospel,</hi> are most grieuous
sinnes: for these brought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
not onely vpon all
mankind (Noah and his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
excepted) but euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all creatures that liued by
breath.</p>
               <p>Now looke as these sinnes
were in the old world, euen
so are they rife in this last
age; according to the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of our sauiour Christ,<note n="e" place="margin">Luk 17. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>as
it was in the daies of Noah, so
shall it bee in the daies of the son
of man:</hi> and as this is the state
of the whole world, so it is
the state of this our Church;
most men are drowned in
the pleasures of this world, &amp;
choked with the cares there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
for howsoeuer they will
heare the Gospell preached


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:555:11"/>
yet few apply their hearts to
beleeue the same, shewing
forth the power therof by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> dead works, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of life in new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
But we must know,
that if these two sins brought
a curse, euen destruction vpon
the old world, then no doubt
they will bring a fearfull
curse vpon this age, though
not by water, yet some other
way that shall countervaile
the flood, and therefore we
must lay these things to our
hearts, that vnles we abandon
securitie, and worldly lustes
and withall doe repent and
beleeue at the preaching of
the gospell, we shall see that
gods heauie curse will fall
vpon vs; for if we match the
old world in sinne, wee must
not looke to come behinde


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:555:12"/>
them in iudgements.</p>
               <p>The second thing in this
decree is, what God will not
doe hereafter, Namely: <hi>curse
the earth any more:</hi> this must
be vnderstood of that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
curse, which the Lord
laide on the earth by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
when he drowned the
world: for the generall curses
that were laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the ground,
and on mankind for Adams
sinne, remaine still, and shall
not be taken quite away till
the end of the world: so that
the meaning of this lawe is,
that the Lord will no more
drowne the whole earth for
the sinne of man by a flood.</p>
               <p>Here then wee see the cause
why the sea being as raging
and stirring as euer it was,
doth notwithstanding keepe
it selfe within it boundes, and


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:555:12"/>
not ouerflow the world: and
why the clowdes beeing as
full of water, as euer
they were doe not powre
downe more floods vpon the
earth to destroy it. Surely it
is by vertue of this particular
lawe, and decree of God,
whereunto the sea and clowds
become obedient, <hi>I will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
curse the earth no more.</hi>
And here we haue iust occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to take knowledge and
veiw of our owne wretched
and damnable estate how we
are sold vnder sinne: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
we were created bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and happie, yet by our
fall in Adam we are become
far worse then any earthly
creature; for each creature in
his kind, as the sunne, the
moone, and starres, the sea, &amp;
cloudes, &amp; all other obey the


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:555:13"/>
commandement of God: but
man of all creatures hauing
lawes giuen him of God to
keepe, rebelleth in breaking
the same, and to him it is
meate and drinke by nature
to liue in the transgression of
gods commandements: Thus
by comparing our selues with
the brute creatures, we may
learne to humble our selues,
and to be abashed when we
see them which were made
to serue vs, to goe before vs
in obedience to the lawes of
our creator.</p>
               <p>III. Point. The reason of
gods decree, in these words;
<hi>for the Imagination of mans
heart is euil, euen from his youth.</hi>
At the first this reason may
seeme very strange, that God
should no more curse the
earth for man, because the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:555:13"/>
of his heart is
euill; In all likelihood God
should haue saide the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<hi>I will still curse the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Imaginations of mans
heart are euill;</hi> for so he saith,
<hi>Chap. 6. vers 5. 6.</hi> that seeing all
<hi>the Imaginations of the thoughts
of mans heart were onely euill
continually, therefore hee would
destroy the man from the earth,
and from man to beast, &amp; euery
creeping thing:</hi> Howe can both
these stand together? <hi>Ans.</hi>
Thus; In the sixt chapter the
Lord saith, he wil <hi>once</hi> destroy
the world by water, because
of the wickednes of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
of man<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> heart: and
here he saith, <hi>he will not proceed
to curse the earth againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine</hi>
by the same punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of mans heart are euill,


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:555:14"/>
euen from his youth; as if hee
should say, I haue once drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the worlde for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes
of mans inventions,
but if I should thus proceede
to deale with man according
to the wicked imagination
of his heart, I must bring eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
yeare a new flood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the
earth, because I see the frame
of mans heart is euill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p>Here then obserue, that
God in the preseruation of
mankind doth temper and
moderate his iustice by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
for if he should deale ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to mans deserts hee
should euery day bring cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
vpon him; yea, so soone
as a man is borne hee should
be destroyed; but God dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not so rigorously, hee
mingleth mercy with iustice,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:555:14"/>
whereby the whole frame of
heauen and earth, the state of
man and all societies doe
stand: That which Habacuke
prayed for,<note n="a" place="margin">Hab. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>In iustice, or
wrath remember mercie,</hi> the
Lord hath performed euer
since the flood, yea since the
fall of Adam.</p>
               <p>There bee three great and
weightie causes, which moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
God to temper iustice
with mercie for the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mankinde and other
creatures: first that hereby hee
might <hi>shew his patience &amp; long
suffering towards the vessells of
wrath,</hi> (as the Apostle<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>2.</note> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth)
that is, towards such as
will not repent, that at the
last day they may bee most
iustly condemned: Secondly,
that there may bee a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of men vpon earth which
may worshipe God; for God


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:555:15"/>
hath speciall care of his owne
glorie among men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tempers iustice with
mercie in their preseruation,
that they might glorifie him:
<hi>Psal. 130. vers. 4. there is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
or pardon with thee, that
thou maist bee feared;</hi> that is,
wheras (oh Lord) thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
in iustice throwe all men
to hell suddenly, yet in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
thou pardonest the sinnes
of some, for this end that they
might worship thee: feare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put for worship and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
Thirdly, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
that the elect, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
of God might bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
for God in his eternall
counsell, and decree hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and set downe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
number of men vnto
whom hee will giue eternall
life, and for their cause doth


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:555:15"/>
hee spare the whole worlde
from daylie destruction: but
when that number shall bee
accomplished, then shall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and earth goe together,
and the worlde shall bee no
more.</p>
               <p>And here by the way, this
third cause of the continuance
of nature, must teach vs our
dutie; to wit, that seeing it
pleaseth God in mercie to
giue vs liberty to liue a space
of time in this worlde, some
twentie, some thirtie, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ome
fourtie or fiftie yeares, and
that for this ende that heerein
wee might bee fitted for his
kingdome, when as in the
rigour of his iustice hee might
haue cast vs to hell in our
mothers wombe, or so soone
as we were borne, wee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must bee carefull not to


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:555:16"/>
despise this long-suffering &amp;
patience of God, but rather
labour in the feare of God,
that it may become<note n="*" place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 15.</note>

endeauour in all such
meanes vnto the ende, as hee
hath sanctified for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

And thus much for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

speaking of an <hi>heart which
God hateth,</hi> saith, <hi>it is framing
or thinking thoughtes of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
Prov. 6. 18.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>mans heart,</hi> we must not
vnderstand the heart of some
particular persons, as of those
that liued in the old world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,

as he beginneth to thinke, to
reason or conceiue of any

wicked, and against the lawe of
God.</hi> The words thus expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                  <p>The imagination and conceite


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:555:18"/>
of euery man is naturally euill.</p>
                  <p>This appeareth not onely
in this place, but else where.
<hi>Rom. 8. 5. The wisdome of the

And againe,<note n="h" place="margin">2. Cor 3. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>of our selues

corrupt: Mans imagination

                  <p>Seeing that naturall Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination

consider of the naturall

of man may bee knowne; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
what the naturall
thoughts of man be.</p>
                  <p>For the first; there are
two waies to knowe mans
thoughts: either directly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meanes, or indirectly by
meanes. The first way is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:555:19"/>
to God alone: for no
creature in heauen or earth
can immediately and directly
know the thoughts of man:
this Salomon confesseth in

                  <p>The second way to knowe
mens thoughts is indirectly,
and by meanes: which be
three, by instinct from God;
by reuelation from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and by signes. First, by an

with the money that
they tooke for their possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And yet here we must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
these secret thoughts
to men, it was onely in some
things at some times, and for
some speciall causes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<hi>Nathan</hi> was faine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
his counsell, which hee
gaue to <hi>Dauid</hi> for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the house of God,
<note n="n" place="margin">1. Chron. 17. 2. 4.</note> when he knew the will of
God more perfectly. And so
was Elias deceiued, when he
said <hi>he was left alone, of all Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:555:20"/>
the knee to Baal,</hi> which Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
knew not. Secondly, mens
thoughts may be known by
<hi>Revelation from Scripture:</hi> for
therin that spirit speaketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently
which knoweth the
frame of the heart: and hence
it is, that in the ministerie of
this word <hi>the thoughts of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
men, are made manifest.</hi> 1.

                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>4. 25. Thirdly, mans
thoughts are knowne by
<hi>signes;</hi> as speeches, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
thus Peter knew the<note n="o" place="margin">Act. 8. 21,</note>
heart of Simon Magus; and
Paul the heart<note n="p" place="margin">Act. 13. 10.</note> of Elimas.
And thus may any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> know
the thoughts of another, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
as he may know the tree by
his fruit, and the fountain by
his streame.</p>
                  <p>Besides these three are two
other meanes added where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to know mens thoughts:


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:555:20"/>
one by the Papists, and an
other by the Astrologians.
The Papists say, the Saints in
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> know mens thoughts,
not directly of them-selues,
but by reflectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in the glasse
of the Trintie. But this is a
meere forgery of their own,
which <hi>Isaia</hi> neuer knew, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus of the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<note n="o" place="margin">Isa 6. 3. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham is ignorant of

of euerie sinfull

and vile damnable
thought that can be in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man. And that this is
one of the thoughts of man
naturally, appeareth by the
expresse testimonie of God
himselfe, who knoweth the
thoughts of man better then
man doth.<note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 10. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>The wicked thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

And againe,<note n="s" place="margin">Psa. 14. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>The foole hath

               <p>Touching this thought,

how a man by thinking
should denie God: Thirdly,
what is the fruit of this


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:555:22"/>
thought, and fourthly the
examination of our hearts
touching this thought.</p>
               <p>For the first:<note place="margin">1. In whome this thought is.</note> we must not

of whome <hi>David</hi>

without repentance, how ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
so euer his life be other
waies; though some shame
restraine his tongue from vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
it, yet by nature his
corrupt heart is prone to
thinke <hi>there is no God</hi> This is
made euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> who


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:555:22"/>
going about to prooue that
al men are sinners by nature,
aleadgeth for his proofe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
testimonies of Scripture
and particularly out of these
two Psalmes before cited:
whereby he giues vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that the <hi>foole</hi> there
mentioned, must be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of euery naturall man.
But it will be said, that it is
ingrafted in mans nature to
hold and thinke there is a
God, &amp; therefore euery man
doth not denie God in his
heart. <hi>Ans.</hi> We must know
that these two thoughts,
<hi>There is a God,</hi> and <hi>there is no
God,</hi> may be, and are both in
one and the same heart: the
same ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that by the light of

there is no God: for two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
beeing not in the

man by thinking denie God
in his heart?<note place="margin">How a man by thinking denies God.</note> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Two waies
first, by turning the true God
into an idol of mans braine:
secondly, by placing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that is not God in the
roome of the true God. For
the first, the Imagination of
euery man naturally, without
further light from the word
of God, doth turne the true
God into an idoll: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Paul saith of the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
that before, their vocation,
<note n="x" place="margin">Gal. 4. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>they did seruice to them which


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:555:23"/>
were no gods;</hi> and of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians,
<hi>that</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Eph. 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God in the world:</hi> euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did not in their
mindes conceiue of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and accordingly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him, though the wiser
sort amongst them did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
one God the
creator of heauen and earth.
And therefore David saith
plainely, that<note n="z" place="margin">Psal. 96. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>all the gods of the
Gentiles are Idols, or vanities:</hi>
nay, as the Apostle saith, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills.</hi>
1, Cor. 10. 20. <hi>That which
the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
vnto deuills &amp; not vnto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now mans mind turneth
the true God into an Idoll, by
three notorious thoughts,
which are the roote of many
damnable sinnes in this life,
first, by thinking that <hi>God is
not present in all places,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:555:24"/>
god is robbed of his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of <hi>Omni-prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce:</hi> for the
true God being infinite must
be in all places; which when
the heart of man denieth, it
imagineth God to be such a
one as he is not, &amp; so turneth
him into an Idoll; and that
man naturally thinketh thus
of God the scripture is plain,
<hi>Iob. 22. 12. 13.</hi> wicked men
are brought in speaking of
God, as though he were shut
vp in heauen, &amp; had nothing
to do in the world: <hi>Is not God
on high in the heauen? and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the height of the starres
how high they are. How should
God know? can he iudge, &amp;c.</hi>
so the Psalmist expresseth the
thoughts of the wicked in
their practise of sinne, <hi>God
hideth away his face, &amp; wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
see:</hi> &amp; <hi>the Lord shall not see.


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:555:24"/>
Psal. 94. 7.</hi> yea they who seeke
the deepe to hide their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
from the Lorde, whose
workes are in darkenes, say,
<hi>who seeth vs? who knoweth vs?
Isay. 29. 15.</hi> Secondly, by thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>there is no prouidence of
God, whereby</hi> hee ordereth and
disposeth all thinges in the
world particularly: That this
is an other naturall thought
the Psalmist sheweth plainly,
bringing in the wicked man,
saying thus of God, <hi>God
hath forgotten, he hideth his
face, and he shall not see.</hi> And
the prophet Zephanie bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the sinner speaking
thus of God, that <hi>he doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good, nor euill.</hi> Thirdly, by
thinking <hi>there is no iustice in
God;</hi> this is done when men
Imagin with themselues, that
albeit they proceede in the


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:555:25"/>
practise of sinne, yet God will
not punish them according
to the threatning of his word;
If we doubt whether such an
Imagination be in mans heart
read Deut. 29. 19, 20. where
Moses directly forbiddeth the
people to say in their hearts.
<hi>I shall haue peace though I walke
in the stubbornes of my heart;
this is that</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>blessing of a mans
selfe in sinne, which Dauid
chargeth vpon the couetous, and
wicked.</hi> Thus they sinne that<note n="h" place="margin">Amos 6. 3. Amos. 9. 10.</note>
                  <hi>put far away the evill day; and
say, the euill shall not come.</hi>
Hereby God is robbed of his
Iustice, and made a God all of
mercie such a one as will not
punish sinne, and so indeed is
made an Idoll of mans brain.</p>
               <p>The second way whereby a
man denyeth god in thought
is by placing in the roome of


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:555:25"/>
the true God, an Idoll of his
owne braine: This men doe,
by thinking some other thing
beside the true God to bee
their chiefest good: thus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
men make<note n="i" place="margin">Phil. 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>their
bellie their God:</hi> and couetous
men make<note n="k" place="margin">Coloss. 3. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>riches their God</hi> by
placing their felicitie in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and in riches: for looke
what a man thinketh to bee
the best thing in the worlde
for him, that is his GOD,
though it bee the devill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or any other creature.
And for this cause is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
called <hi>the God of the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 4.</note>
because the men of this world
iudge their owne courses,
wherin they serue the deuill,
the best thing in the worlde
for them, yea farre better then
the seruice of god, &amp; therfore
giue their hearts thereto: for


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:555:26"/>
affection followeth opinion,
&amp; that which a man affecteth
most, hee must needes thinke
best of; and therefore what
a man affecteth most, that
maketh hee to become his
God, so that iudging other
things beside the true God to
be best for him, he must needs
place the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in the roome of the
true God, &amp; so in his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
donie God.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The fruit of this thought.</note> What is the

what a cursed thing this is, <hi>to
thinke there is no God:</hi> This
thought bringeth forth the
most notorious sins that can
be, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> 
                  <hi>Atheisme</hi> it selfe; which
is a sinne whereby men sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
waies deny God: And it
is two-fold, either in practise,
or in iudgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:555:26"/>
                  <hi>Atheisme in practise</hi> is that
sinne wherby men deny God
in their deedes, liues, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations;
&amp; so declare this
thought. This is a most horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sinne, and a huge burthen
to the whole earth; and yet
many that liue in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of the Church are fouly
tainted heerewith. This A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme
in practise hath three
speciall branches: Hypocrisie,
Epicurisme, and Witchcraft.
<hi>Hypocrisie</hi> is a sinne whereby
men worship the true God,
but yet in a false manner, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vnto God the outwarde
action, and hold backe from
him the true worship of the
heart. <hi>Epicurisme</hi> is a sinne
wherby men contemne God,
and giue themselues wholie
to their pleasures, spending
their time in eating, drinking,


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:555:27"/>
and other delightes and not
seeking or fearing God: and
this is the sinne of the richer
sort in this age: <hi>Witchcraft</hi> or
Magicke is that sinne wherby
men renounce the true God
and betake themselues to the
aide, counsell, &amp; helpe of the
deuill, either by himselfe, or
in his instruments: This is a
large sinne, and a great part
of Atheisme, and many are
taynted with this sinne, either
because they are practisio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of witchcraft, or else doe
seeke helpe of such.</p>
               <p>Atheisme in iudgement is
that sinne, whereby in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and perswasion of heart
men denie God. And this
likewise hath three degrees:
first, when men hold and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
worshippe the true
God, creator of heauen and


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:555:27"/>
earth, but yet so as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
of, and worship him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
then hee hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himselfe in his word. To
this first degree wee must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the three great religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Turke, of the Iewe,
and of the Papists: for as they
stand at this day, they are
three great partes of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turke</hi> worshippeth
God the maker of heauen, &amp;
earth &amp; likewise reuerenceth
Christ as man, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to be a prophet, yea,
a more worthie prophet then
his Mahomet; And yet his
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> is Atheisme: for he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth
of god out of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and so worshippeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an Idoll.</p>
               <p>Againe, the <hi>Religion of the
Iewes,</hi> at this day is a part of


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:555:28"/>
Atheisme: for howsoeuer they
hold one God, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the bookes of the olde
Testament for the Scriptures
of God, yet they worship not
that God in Christ, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the true God, frame
an Idoll in their owne brain;
for as Christ<note n="m" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 23.</note> saith, <hi>whosoeuer
denieth the sonne the same hath
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

not the father,</hi> so that they
wanting Christ, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
the father also, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and truly haue no God;
but as Christ tould the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans
<note n="n" place="margin">Iohn. 4. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>they worship they knowe
not what.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly the <hi>Religion of the
Papists</hi> at this day is a part of
Atheisme: we must indeed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
it from the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
for in worde they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Trinitie in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and vnitie in Trinitie, &amp;


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:555:28"/>
their doctrine of the vnion of
Christs two natures in one
person, is according to the
scripture: But yet if we marke
the drift, and sequele of their
doctrine in other points, wee
shall find it to bee close A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme:
As may bee prooved
by two reasons: first because
the true God who is the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
of heauen and earth, is
infinite in Iustice, and mercie:
But according to the doctrine
of the Papists, God is not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in Iustice, &amp; mercie: And
therefore to them is not the
true God: for first, Gods
Iustice according to them is
not infinite: for they teach
that a man by his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
workes of penance (which
bee finite &amp; imperfect) may
truly satisfy god for the guils
of temporall punishment.<note place="margin">1. Bellar. Lib. 7 de poenit. c. 7.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:555:29"/>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
vp the some with mans

for Gods mercie
is either euery way mercie
or no mercie, as <hi>Paule</hi>
saith.<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 1. 6</note> If it bee <hi>of grace it is
no more of workes, or else were
grace no more grace, and if it bee
of workes it is no more grace, or
else were worke, no more worke.</hi>
Secondly<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the Christ of the
Papists is a false Christ; this
will appeare by plaine reason
out of their doctrine: for first
they spoile Christ of his true
manhood by their doctrine of
reall presence, wherein they
hould that Christs body is not
onely in heauen, but really &amp;
substantially in all places,
wher the sacrifice of the masse
is offered, thus they make it


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:555:29"/>
omnipotent, &amp; so quite take
away the nature of a bodie.
Secondly, they disgrade Christ
from the three offices of his
mediatorship: first from his
<hi>kingly office,</hi> by<note n="a" place="margin">Rhem. on ephes. 1. 22. sect. 5.</note> placing the
Pope in his Roome, and stead,
as his deputie in Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
for they giue power to
the Pope to rule the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church, and to make
lawes to bind mens conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which bee thinges proper
to Christ alone: where in they
doe as much as if they should
take the Crowne from Christs
head, &amp; set it on the Popes:
for to claime regencie in the
presence of the lawfull prince
is to proclaime rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the prince; for commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of vicegerencie ceaseth
in the presence of him that
appointeth it; nowe Christ is


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:555:30"/>
alwaies present with his
Church, <hi>Math. 28. 20.</hi> And
therefore the Pope by his
claime must needes thrust
Christ out of his office. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
from his <hi>priestly office,</hi>
which consisteth in satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and intercession: Christs
satisfaction they nullifie by<note n="b" place="margin">Rhem on Rom. 8. 17. sect. 4.</note>
ioyning therewith the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of mens workes, for
thereby they make it imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
And they robbe him of
his intercession by<note n="c" place="margin">Rhem. on 2. Co. 1. 11. sect. 3</note> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
the same to Saintes;
yea, they exalt the virgine
Marie far aboue Christ in this
worke, for they praie her <hi>to
aske the Father, to command
Christ her sonne by the authoritie
of a mother,</hi>

                  <hi>to doe thus, and thus,

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:555:30"/>
the Pope the infallible
iudge of all controuersies: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowing,
<hi>that they rather desire
to knowe the auncient institution
of Christian religion from the
Popes mouth,</hi>

                  <hi>then from holy
writte.</hi> Nowe thus robbing
Christ of his offices, they
make him a false Christ: and
so wanting the sonne, they
cannot haue the father, for
<hi>he</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">3. Ioh. 2 23</note> 
                  <hi>that hath not the son hath
not the father:</hi> and therefore
popish religion wanting the
father and the sonne, cannot
bee a true religion, but meere
coloured Atheisme in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The second degree of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme
in iudgement is when
men place some Idoll in rome
of the true God, houlding
the same for their God: thus
did the Gentiles sinne in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:555:31"/>
the sonne, and the
moone, and the starres or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures.</p>
               <p>The third degree is, when
a man doth avouch, hould, &amp;
maintaine that there is no
God at all; this is the highest
degree of Atheisme and the
most notorious sinne that can
bee, and all such persons as
maintain this cursed thought,
are vnworthie the common
breath of men: for if that
man shall die the death, and
that worthilie, who shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch
his lawfull prince to be
no prince, howe much more
ought hee to die the death,
though hee had a thousand
liues that shall affirme the true
God, to bee no God? Thus
wee see the fruites of this euill
thought whereby the hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnes
of it doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:555:31"/>
                  <hi>IV. Point.</hi> The examination
of our owne hearts touching
this thought whether it may
be found among vs or not:<note place="margin">Examination of this thought.</note>
doubtles every one will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to cleare himselfe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
And the reason wherewith
many doe sooth vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
is this, because they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
felt in themselues any
such conceits as this, <hi>that
there is no God.</hi> But wee may
easily deceiue our selues here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
for a man cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
discerne what bee the
thoughts of his owne heart:
There be in man two kinds of
cogitations, or as one may say
reasons: the first is a single co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation,
whereby a man sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
thinketh, or knoweth, or
iudgeth this or that; and this
is properly called the <hi>mind:</hi>


                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:555:32"/>
The other is a reflex cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
or reason, whereby a man
iudgeth that he knoweth or
thinketh this or that; and it is
commonly called <hi>Conscience.</hi>
Now since Adams fall, the
conscience is corrupt by ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
sinne, as be all other
powers of mans soule; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce
it commeth to passe, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
can not doe his dutie
in giuing true testimonie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
mans Imaginations:
but a man may thinke euill,
and yet his conscience not
tell him: and therefore wee
may nor say, because wee feele
not these euill thoughts in
vs; therefore we haue them
not, or we are free from them.<note place="margin">3. Signes of this thought</note>
               </p>
               <p>But that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
examine our hearts, wee
must come to the signes
whereby this euill thought is


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:555:32"/>
best discerned. Dauid in the
14. Psalme setteth downe
three signes hereof: first,<note n="q" place="margin">v. 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>A
disordered life:</hi> secondly,<note n="r" place="margin">v. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>not
calling on the name of God by
praier;</hi> thirdly,<note n="s" place="margin">v. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>contemning of
them that put their trust in God.</hi>
Looke where these are to
be found, there is this euill
thought, <hi>That there is no God.</hi>
Nowe if wee examine our
selues by these signes, we shall
finde this wicked thought to
be amonst vs: for first, many
indeede are content to heare
Gods word; but where is
that man that reformeth his
life according to that he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth?
Certen it is, as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
can witnesse, few turne
vnto God vnfainedly, fewe
doe breake of their course in
sinning. Now this vnrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
life is an infallible token


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:555:33"/>
of this damnable thought.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the exercise of
praier and inuocation on the
name of God, is rare among
men: no doubt many a touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
heart doth euery day
vnfainedly call on God for
grace. but yet generally this is
true: men goe on from day
to day, and from yeare to
yeare, and neuer pray vnto
God for supply of grace. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
men plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
that they vse to pray:
for they say the <hi>Lords prayer:
the Creede, and the tenne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements:</hi>
but wee must
know; that with many this
practise is nothing, but a vaine
repetition of words; for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is an action of the heart,
and not the labour of the
tongue, and lippes onely: so
to say the Lords prayer is not


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:555:33"/>
to pray, for the words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may be repeated with the
heart of an Atheist.</p>
               <p>And thirdly the contempt
of them that put their trust in
God, is rise among vs: for
who is so much scorned and
reproched, as he that maketh
profession of religion? Now
may that complaint be iustly
taken vp by the seruants of
God, Isai. 8. 18. <hi>Behold, I, and
the children whome the Lord
hath giuen me, are as signes and
wonders.</hi> And, <hi>He that refraines
from euill, makes himselfe a pray</hi>
to the euill tongue. Isa. 59. 15.
Yet let these scoffers know,
what euer they be, that seedes
of Atheisme doe possesse their
soules.</p>
               <p>To come yet more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to the triall of this
thought in our selues: <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:555:34"/>
denieth the presence of God
denieth God.</hi> Now let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
answer, whether we
be not afraid to sinne in the
presence of many mortall
men, and yet in the presence
of God doe make no bones
thereof, so the eies of men be
turned from vs. Now what
is this but either flatly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the presence of God, or
at least to yeeld more feare
and reuerence to men, then
we doe vnto God? Againe
what is the cause why men
vse oppression, and iniustice,
deceit, and lying in their
wordly affaires? Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this thought of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme
doth possesse their
hearts, that God regardeth
not these outward things?
Durst men directly sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God in seeking these


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:555:34"/>
outward blessings for natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life, if they did rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vpon Gods prouidence,
knowing euery good gift to
come from his bountifull
hand? Lastly, let the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
speake, doth not thy
heart while thou goest on in
sinne, say thus vnto thee, <hi>God
is mercifull, I will heareafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and so shall I escape punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
If a man doe well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
his owne heart, he shall
finde therin this vile thought,
which directly ouerturns the
infinite iustice of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him a God all of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
when as indeede he is as
well a God of Iustice as of
mercie. By all which it is
more then euident, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
this vile thought
runnes in mans heart, <hi>There is
no God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:555:35"/>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Hereby then we must
learne to see what vile, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and wretched sinners
we are in our selues; though
we had no actuall outward
sinnes, yet this damnable
thought maketh vs accursed:
If a man<note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. 10. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>curse the king in his
heart,</hi> the sinne is so great, and
heinous that <hi>the foules of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
shall disclose it:</hi> How horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
then is this sinn for a man
in his thought to <hi>curse God,</hi>
the king of kings, and Lord
of Lords? This therefore must
humble vs in our selues before
the Lord.</p>
               <p>Againe, hereby we must be
admonished to vse all good
meanes whereby wee may
come to see, and know not
onely the grosse actuall sinnes
of our liues, but especially this
damnable thought of our


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:555:35"/>
hearts; few there be that doe
see it, and therefore we must
be earnest with our selues in
searching our owne hearts, to
find out this and such like ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations
that bee in vs.
And thus much for the first

                     <hi>they were not contented

which religion men abandon
the Gospel, of Christ, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
themselues to another

deuises: And this Papisme,
hath raigned euer since, till
now of late, &amp; so hath Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie
taken place in those

planted; The cause whereof
was in the wicked and sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

men were contented to yeilde
themselues to any other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

hold, and teach the word of

our religion with the times,
the greatest part of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs would forsake the

this ground, because they
iudge the Gospell foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
Let any man among vs

had not suppressed it. And
the reason heereof is this;
mans minde by nature is full
of darknes; he cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

thought;<note place="margin">Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this thought.</note> After due triall wee

where God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
and we doe submit

our owne personal sinnes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaid,

curses of the lawe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against vs for the

this life, iudgements in death,
and also iudgements eternall
after this life: Nowe let the
conscience answere, what is
the cause when wee heare
these things, that wee be not
mooued, why are not our
hearts touched with greefe
and sadnesse, when wee heare
Gods iudgments due vnto vs
for our sins daylie denounced

bee whose hearts tremble at

                     <hi>kindled by the breath of the Lord
like a riuer of Brimstone</hi> as the

mens hearts are nothing

that we should bee so affected
with the burning of an old
house by temporall fyre, and
be not affraid at the voyce of
God, which proclameth vnto
vs eternall burning, with the
fire of Gods wrath? Surely
the cause is this, our hearts
are forestalled with this false
imagination that <hi>the curses of

there bee no such torments as
the world denounceth; It will
not sinke into the heart of a
naturall man that his sinnes
are so heinous, and Gods

iudgements so terrible against
them, as the worde maketh
them: And till such time as

a barre to stoppe the way to

                  <p>Againe, when the minister

their hearts bee filled

<hi>The Gospell of Christ is foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:</hi>
When the Israelites were

                     <hi>a dreame

dreame, what a dreame will
this spiritual deliuerance from
the captiuitie of hell &amp; death,
to the libertie of the sonnes of
GOD in grace and glorie,
seeme to be? And indeede to
a naturall man it seemes foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes
that God should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

death, and by suffering the
curse of the lawe, should take
away the same from vs, and

by his righteousnesse should
iustifie vs vnto life: all which
notwithstanding be points of
the Gospell. This also is the
cause why after long teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is little turning, or
faithfull obedience yeelded

it be better with men, while
this euill thought abideth in
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse. 1.</hi> If this bee a truth,
that <hi>euery naturall man thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the word of God to be foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
then wee must learne this
lesson of the Apostle,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 18</note> 
                     <hi>Hee
that seemes to bee wise in this

reiect his owne naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

wholly to bee guided by

Gods spirite in the thinges of

made wise vnto saluation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must heereby
learne to make earnest praier
vnto God<note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 119. 18.</note> for the opening of
our eyes, that we may bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to vnderstand the Gospell

for of our selues wee

the Lord instruct vs by
his spirit:<note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 65.</note> 
                     <hi>No man commeth
vnto me,</hi> (saith Christ, that is,

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:555:42"/>
From the former ariseth an

<note n="f" place="margin">Iob. 21. 14.</note>

when he purposed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
to cast off the yoake of

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:555:43"/>
say further,<note n="g" place="margin">v. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Who is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
that wee should serue

a disgrace to mee to abase my

bringeth in the Lord saying
thus to his people,<note n="h" place="margin">Ier. 6. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Stand in

but in the same place the
Iewes answer, <hi>We will not walke
in thy waies.</hi> Shall wee thinke
that they durst thus impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
answer the Lord with
open mouthes? No surely; But
the Prophet in these wordes
setteth downe the purpose of
their hearts who hardned the

himselfe to a noble man that

now when he is gone, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
of his countrey send
messengers after him to tell
him,<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 19. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>that they will not haue
him to raigne ouer them.</hi> Which
though it be properly to be
vnderstood of the nation of
the Iewes, who did indeede
say so to our Sauiour Christ,
yet it may also be extended
to all impenitent sinners, who
say in their hearts; Christ shall
not raigne over vs: for so long
as a man is vncalled, he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a purpose to liue in sinne,
some in this sinne, and some
in that, and so doing, saith in
his heart, <hi>God shall not bee my
God, I will not submit my selfe
vnto his lawes, Christ shall not


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:555:44"/>
raigne ouer me.</hi> This is plaine
and manifest by mens beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
when they are reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for their sinnes: Tell the
couetous man of his auarice,
the swearer of his blasphemy,
&amp; the dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>kard of his drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
&amp;c. will he humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in conscience of his sinn?
Nothing lesse: but his heart
will swell against thee, as his
furie and impatience will
soone be wray; and the reason
is, because he neuer thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of his owne estate, how
by creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he oweth homage
vnto God, as to his creator:
for his purpose is to goe on

for the same, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
is crossed, which he can
not abide, and therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth;
shewing thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly,
that in his heart hee

                  <p>For the examination of
our hearts touching this
thought;<note place="margin">Examination for this thought.</note> after iust triall it will
be found among vs, as the
state of all sorts of families
will declare: Among the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
sort you shall see men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
from morning to Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and take great paines to
prouide for the world, but in
the meane time where is the
worship and seruice of God<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
where is prayer and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing,
morning, and euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
Surely it is neglected,
&amp; the reason is because they
thinke thus in their heart, <hi>so
that I may haue prouision for the


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:555:47"/>
world, it is no matter whether I
serue God or not.</hi> Come to the
rich mans house, &amp; there you
shal see them spend their time
in eating, drinking, gaming,
and such delightes; but the
worship of God is not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
for thus they thinke with
themselues, <hi>If they may haue
their pleasure all is well.</hi> Come
&amp; reason with ordinary men,
and exhort them to vse the
meanes of saluation, and shew
forth loue vnto religion sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely:
Their answer is, they
will doe as they haue done,
and as their forefathers did
before them; they trust their
soules are as good to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as the best: And for
ought they see, none are
worser then those that haue
so much preaching, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they hope to bee saued


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:555:48"/>
though they doe not follow
it so much: And this also
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> this euill thought.
<hi>It is in vaine to serue God.</hi>
Marke also in those places
wher the Gospel is preached;
If any seeme to make more
conscience of sinne, and of
seruing God then others, they
are made a by-word and a
mocking stock, and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is turned to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach:
which argues plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that mans thought is this, <hi>It
is a vaine thing to serue God.</hi>
Nay, take a vew of the whole
world, and you shall see euery
wher, men giue themselues to
will-worship: No nation is so
barbarous as to denie vnto
God all worship; but doe they
giue vnto him that which he
commanded in his word?
Nothing lesse: It is either the


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:555:48"/>
meere invention of men, or
altogether stayned therewith:
This is most euident with the
Turke, the Iew, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist:
yea our common sort of
protestants haue their will-worship:
for generally they
content themselues with the
mumbling ouer the words of
the Creede, the Lords Prayer,
and tenne Commandements,
perswading themselues that
by the bare rehearsall of the
words, they haue sufficiently
serued God. Now would wee
know the cause hereof; as
also why men are so slack and
cold in praier, so carelesse, and
vnreuerent in hearing Gods
word? Surely it is nothing
but this vile Imagination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
our soules, that it
<hi>Is a vaine thing to serue God;</hi>
This quencheth the spirit, and


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:555:49"/>

                  <head>Sect. 5. Of mans thought of
distrust.</head>
                  <p>The fourth euill thought
concerning God, is, <hi>a thought
of distrust,</hi> thus framed in the
minde;: <hi>God doth not regard me;
God will not helpe me; God will
not be mercifull vnto me:</hi> This
thought made entrance vnto
the fall of our first parents:
for first Eue looked vpon the
fruit, &amp; saw that it was beuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and then entred into her
heart a thought of distrust
after this manner; It may be
it is not true which god hath
said to vs concerning this
fruit, and it may be God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
vs not as we thinke


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:555:49"/>
he doth, in that he denieth vs
this fruit; heere vpon her will
and her affections were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the breaking of Gods
commandement, and so shee
sinned by disobedience, and
Adam also sinned. When the
people of Israel murmured in
the wildernes <hi rend="sup">a</hi> 
                     <hi>Moses sinned</hi>
a sin for hee was debarred en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the land of Canaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>:<note place="margin">Num. 20. 12.</note>
Nowe what was Moses sinne
for both <hi>he &amp; Aron</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">v. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>prayed to
the Lord, and checked the people
saying heare oh yee rebells, &amp;c.
And at Gods commandement he
brought water out of the rocke?</hi>
Surely his sin was secret euen
inward vnbeleefe and distrust
in Gods promise, for when
hee smote the rocke, he might
thinke thus with himselfe; it
may bee that God will not
nowe giue water out of the


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:555:50"/>
rocke; &amp; this seemes the more
probable because hee went
beyond his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mission in smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thrise vpon the rock, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
God bad him onely to <hi>speake</hi>

                     <hi>vnto it.</hi> This euill thought
takes hould of religious Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
also:<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 31. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>I sayd in mine hast I
am cast out of thy sight,</hi> as
though he should say, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
I haue found Fauour
with God, but nowe in mine
aduersitie I am vtterly reiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Againe,<note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 116. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>I said in my feare,
all men are lyers;</hi> that is, when
feare of death tooke hould of
mee, then I thought that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell
lied vnto mee, when he
saide I should come to the
kingdome ouer Israell. The
children of Israell did often
bewray this thought of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust;
when they were pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with hunger, and famine


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:555:50"/>
in the wildernes, they say,
<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 78. 19. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>can God prouid a table for vs in
the wildernes? can he giue bread
and flesh for his people?</hi> As if
they should say, we thinke he
cannot, nor will not: Yea the
Apostle Peter was not free
from this thought, for when
Christ walking on the waters,
commanded Peter to come
vnto him, hee came out bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and walked towards Iesus,
but when<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 14. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>hee sawe a mightie
wind he began to sinke:</hi> whence
came this? surely from a
thought of distrust which hee
had in his heart to this effect:
<hi>It may be god wil not support me
in this my walking:</hi> &amp; that this
or some such thought was
in his heart appeareth by
Christs answer to him saying,
<hi rend="sup">h</hi> 
                     <hi>oh thou of little faith, why
diddest thou doubt?</hi> By all which


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:555:51"/>
it is euident that this is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
thought in the minde of
man which at some time
troubleth the most righteous
man that is.</p>
                  <p>Now touching this thought
of <hi>distrust,</hi> two things are to
bee skanned:<note place="margin">Time of this thought.</note> first, the time
when it taketh place in mans
minde; and secondly, the
daunger of it. For the time;
This thought doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
take place in the minde
of man, but onely in the time
of some daunger, affliction,
and temptation; and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the time of sicknesse,
and in the pangs of death.
Thus in his grieuous afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was righteous Iob troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with this thought of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust:
for then hee complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that <hi rend="sup">i</hi> 
                     <hi>God did hate him and
gnash vpon him with his teeth,


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:555:51"/>
and as his enemie, sharpned his
eyes against him;</hi> yea, <hi>that</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">v. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>hee
made him as his butt, and marke
to shoote at.</hi> And Dauide in a
greiuous trouble of minde,
thus complained:<note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 77. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Will the
Lord absent himselfe for euer?
And will hee shewe no more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour?
Is his mercie cleane gone
for euer? Doth his promise faile
for euermore? hath God forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to be mercifull? &amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
appeareth, that in his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
hee was greatly troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with this distrustfull
thought; and there is no man
liuing, but when trouble and
affliction comes, hee shal feele
in himselfe these thoughts of
distrust. Indeede while peace,
and ease continue, presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
thoughts possesse the
minde; but when the daies
of peace bee gone, &amp; trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:555:52"/>
times approach, then
presumptuous thoughts giue
place, and thoughtes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust,
come in their roome &amp;
stead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>II. Point.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fruite of this thought.</note> The daunger of
these thoughtes of distrust is
verie great, as the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
declare: for hence arise;
first, all horrours, and terrors
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of conscience, all feares, and
astonishmentes of the heart;
For when the minde saith
(though falselie) <hi>God doth not
regard me, God will not saue me,</hi>
then the trembling heart is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> full of horror and dread. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
hence commeth des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
it selfe; wherby men
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fidently avouch that God
hath forsaken them, and cast
them of, and that there is no
hope of life, but present
death, remaining for them:


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:555:52"/>
this thought troubleth the
minde of the wicked, and of
the repentant person also: for
desperation is nothing but
the strength of this thought
of distrust. Thirdly this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the foundation of our
saluation, which standeth in
the certentie of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
for this thought of distrust
denieth credite to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and maketh them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine:
Among all other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
thoughtes this doth most
directly hinder saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>; for it
is flat against faith, as water is
to fire: for true faith makes a
man say with good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce,
<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ died and shedd his blood
for mee; God the father will bee
mercifull vnto me, and saue me:</hi>
But this distrustfull thought
causeth a man to say the clean
contrarie. <hi>Christ died not for


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:555:53"/>
me: God will not saue me:</hi> so that
where this thought prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
true faith is not, neither
can take place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> Considering the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of this distrustful thought
is so great, we must be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in the feare of God to
vse all good meanes, while
the daies of peace doe last,
that it take no place with vs
in the daie of trouble, and
temptation:<note place="margin">Meanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust.</note> The meanes to
represse it are the preaching
of the worde, and the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Baptisme and the
Lords supper.</p>
                  <p>For the first: the word of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God preached is a speciall
meanes ordained of God, for
the true applying of Gods
promises, of mercie to our
owne soules; and therefore a
most soueraigne remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:555:53"/>
this thought of distrust;
for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the promises of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in Christ, are offered vnto
gods people in the preaching
of the worde by a lawfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
it is as much as if Christ
himselfe in his owne person
should speake vnto them, by
vertue of Gods ordinance. If
God from heauen should say
to any man, mercie belongeth
to thee, hee would beleeue: if
God say to Cornelius, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
thou, and my mercie
belongs to thee, Cornelius
will beleeue: if hee say to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
beleeue thou, and my
mercie belongs to thee, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will beleeue: and if hee say
so to Marie Magdalen shee
will beleeue. Loe heere, when
the minister of God, out of
Gods worde, saith to any
man, beleeue thou, and repent


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:555:54"/>
thou, and Gods mercie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
vnto thee; it is as much
as if the Lord should call him
by name particularly, and
say vnto him, beleeue thou,
and repent, and my mercie
belongs vnto thee: yea, it is all
one as if God himselfe should
say, <hi>I am thy father, and thou
art my childe,</hi> if thou wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and beleeue.</p>
                  <p>The second meanes which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is also very effectuall to cut
off this thought of distrust, is
<hi>Baptisme.</hi> If an earthly prince
giue a pardon to any man, &amp;
put the mans name in the
pardon, and his owne broade
seale vnto it, the man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
doubt of his pardon, but
beleeue it. Beholde, in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
God entreth couenant
with miserable wretched
man, and heerein makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:555:54"/>
of life vnto him; yea hee
puts the mans name in the
couenant, sealing the same
with his owne seale: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the party baptized, must
beleeue against this thought.</p>
                  <p>The thirde meanes, is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Lords supper rightly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
and receiued: for ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the breade and wine giuen
to the hand of euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant
by the minister, are
particular pledges and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
vnto them of speciall
mercie in Christ. These are
the meanes which wee must
vse with all good conscience
in the daies of peace, that
when troubles come, this
thought of distrust may not
preuaile against vs. And thus
much of mans naturall euill
thoughts against God. Many
other might bee added here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,

                  <p>The second euill thought
of man against his neighbour


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:555:58"/>
with consent, is a thought of
<hi>Murther, or of any thing that
tendeth thereto.</hi> Of this wee
haue particular examples in
Scripture. Deut. 15. 9. The
Lord forbiddeth the Iewes
to haue this murthering
thought in their hearts: <hi>I will
not releeue the poore, I will not
doe good vnto them;</hi> giuing vs
to vnderstand, that this was
the common thought of the
Iewes, or els he would not
haue forbidden it: yea the
Lord doth there set out this
thought by two signes; first,
<hi>an euill eye,</hi> when a man turnes
his countenance from the
poore, or looketh on them
without compassion: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>vnmercifull dealing,</hi> when a
man will not helpe the poore
by gift, according to his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
And because all actions


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:555:58"/>
proceede from thoughts, the
heart beeing the fountaine of
our deedes, hence it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that this murthering
thought against the poore, is
rife in this age: for where is
the man that doth pitie the
poore, and doth good to them
according to his abilitie? nay,
the Lords complaint against
the Iewes may be fitly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to our times, in regard of
crueltie and oppression: <hi>The
spoile of the poore is in your hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
what haue ye to doe, that ye
beate my people to peeces, and
grinde the faces of the poore.</hi> Isa.
3. 14. 15.</p>
                  <p>The second example of
a murthering thought, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Gods Church, and it
is this. <hi>I will doe some spite or
hurt to them that worship God.</hi>
For proofe hereof, read <hi>Psal.


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:555:59"/>
74. 8.</hi> Dauid bringeth in the
Babilonians, Edomites, &amp;c.
saying thus one to another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
gods people the Iewes:
<hi>Let vs destroy them all together;
&amp; Psal. 83. 4, Let vs cut them off
from beeing a people.</hi> And <hi>let the
name of Israell be no more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</hi>
Now as this was
their thought, so is it the
thought of all men naturally:
for that which was the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Babel, Edom, Moab,
and Amnon against Gods
Church, is the disposition of
all men naturally; for looke
how generall the hatred of
man is, so generall is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of mischiefe against
those that professe religion:
for all men by nature are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Gods Church, &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
so Christ saith to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 24. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>yee shall be be hated of all

                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 2.</note> Yea,
<hi>whosoeuer killeth you shall thinke
that he doth God good seruice,</hi>
and therefore this thought of
doing mischiefe is as general,
euen in the minde of euery
man by nature. This further
appeareth by the continuall
persecution, that hath euer
beene raised agaiust Gods
poore Church, since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
at Abell, soone after the
giuing of the couenant of
grace to our first parents, and
hath continued to this day, &amp;
shall abide vnto the end: so
that if carnall men could look
into their owne hearts, they
should there behold this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
thought against Gods
people. This murdering
thought commeth from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wicked imagination, set


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:555:60"/>
downe by S. <hi>Peter:</hi> who
bringeth in the wicked of
this world,<note n="h" place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 3. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>thinking it a
strange thing, that Gods children
doe not, as they doe, and
runne not with them vnto all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of riot: liuing in drunkennes,
fornication, and such other abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations;</hi>
for this cause doe
they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ceiue hatred, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
mischeife against Gods
people, and so will continue,
till God giue them grace to
repent. If any shall say this
thought is not generall, for
<hi>Nabuched-nezer</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Danie. 2. 48.</note> an heathen
man <hi>shewed fauour to Daniell,
and highly aduanced him.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
it is true he did so; but
that was a worke of Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
providence who procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him fauour, and disposed
the kings heart to affect him,
as he did also the heart of the


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:555:60"/>
chiefe<note n="k" place="margin">Daniel. 1. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Eunuch;</hi> Otherwise
Nabuchad-nezzer naturally
did nothing but intend mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife
against Gods Church,
as his rage against the three
children did euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tly bewray,
Dan. 3. 19.</p>
                  <p>A third example of this
murthering thought I adde,
which every minister of gods
word may obserue by daily
experience, and that is this;
when mens faults are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
rebuked in the ministery
of the word, and the quicke,
as it were touched by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the word to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce;
then will the heart of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man, thus conceiue of the
minister that reprooueth sinn;
<hi>This man meaneth me, he hath
some spyte, and mallice against
me, that he thus reprooveth my
particular faults;</hi> when as the


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:555:61"/>
minister knew them not to be
his personall sinnes: but it is
the power of the word that
ransaketh the sinfull heart:
this is the fault of all carnall
hearers, who will heare qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
till their faults be rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
but then they thinke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
of the preacher;
Thus Herod dealt with Iohn
Baptist, he heard him gladly
for a while, Mark. 6. 20. but
when he was rebuked for his
<hi>brother Phillips wife then he cast
Iohn in prison: Luk. 3. 19. 20.</hi>
And if conscience might bee
iudge, many an hearer would
be found to haue an Herods
heart towards Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>

                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:555:61"/>
The third thought of man
touching his neighbour, is the
thought of <hi>Adulterie;</hi> which
is the thought with consent
to any vnchastitie. Such a
thought had Iudah co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cerning
Tamar his daughter-in lawe,
when<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 38. 15. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>he iudged her an whore;
and desired to lie with her.</hi> And
with such thoughts was Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<note n="b" place="margin">2. Sam. 13. 2.</note> heart so sore vexed
that hee fell sicke for his sister
Tamar: This makes a man an
Adulterer in heart before
God, though actually he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
not the fact: Mat. 5. 28.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is the thought
of <hi>Theft,</hi> which is the thought
with consent of beguyling or


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:555:62"/>
wronging another in his
goods or substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce. This is that
<hi>Imagining of iniquitie, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of wickednes vpon their
beds, in coueting of fieldsâa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Micah. 2. 1.</note> Micah pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
a <hi>woe.</hi> And this
thought also possesseth their
hearts, that with the wicked
Israelites wish the time were

                     <hi>might
make the Epha small and the

measure, and inhance the
pryce, <hi>and falsifie the weights by
deceit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first euill thought is
<hi>a thought of disgrace, which
some way tendeth to the reproach,
and debasing of our neighbours
good name;</hi> as when a thing is
well done, to thinke &amp; iudge
it to bee ill done, or when a
thing is a misse to iudge it


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:555:62"/>
worse then it is: Thus Elie
thought disgracefullie of
<hi>Hannah</hi> deeming her to bee
<hi>dronke,</hi> saying,<note n="q" place="margin">1. 8. am. 1. 13 14.</note> 
                     <hi>put away thy

deuoutly from a<note n="r" place="margin">v. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>troubled
soule to the Lord;</hi> Thus Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab
Dauids eldest brother
thought disgracefullie of
Dauid, when he shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
willing to encounter
with Golyah that reuiled the
hoast of the liuing God say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<note n="s" place="margin">1. Sam. 17. 28</note> 
                     <hi>I know the pride and mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of thine heart that thou art
come to see the Battell,</hi> when as
indeede the spirit of God put
that motion into his heart to
take away the shame from
Israell, as the happie euent
declared plainly. So when
our sauiour Christ spake most
comfortably to the sicke of
the Palsie, saying,<note n="t" place="margin">Math. 9. 2</note> 
                     <hi>be of good


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:555:63"/>
comfort thy sinnes are forgiuen
thee;</hi> then the cursed hearts
of the wicked Pharisies
thought thus in themselues, <hi rend="sup">u</hi>
                     <hi>this man blasphemeth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 4.</note> And
when the gift of the holie
Ghost, was sent vpon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
causing them to
speake strange tounges to the
great admiration of men of
diuers nations, then some of
the <hi>malicious Iewes thought they
were dronke,</hi> saying scoffingly,
<hi>they were full of newe wine.</hi>
                     <note n="v" place="margin">Act. 2. 13.</note> And
this thought of disgrace is in
euery man naturally bringing
forth continually the fruits of
disgrace, as <hi>Enuie, Strife, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations,
Dissentions, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates:</hi>
for <hi>loue thinketh not euill;</hi>
but naturally true loue is
wanting in all men: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cannot but thinke
euill of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:555:63"/>
We see the fiue euill thoughts
of mans naturall heart against
his neighbour; touching
which two things are yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to bee skanned, to wit,
when these euill thoughtes
doe arise in the minde; and
in whome they are. For the
first: it is true, that they doe
not at all times arise in mens
mindes, but then onely when
occasion is giuen, at which
time they arise so soone as it
is giuen: for mans heart is
like to tinder, or drie wood,
which burneth not of it selfe,
but so soone as fire is put to
it, then presently it kindleth.
When you come to talke
with a naturall man, it may be
for the present, hee thinketh
not to lie; but giue him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to lie, and then hee soone
bethinkes himselfe therof &amp;


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:555:64"/>
will not spare to vtter it if it
may make for his aduantage.
And the like wee may say of
malice, Adulterie, Theft, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
or any other sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our neighbour: Doe
but minister occasion there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to the naturall heart of
man, &amp; he thinketh of them,
and without Gods grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining,
or renuing him, will
bring forth the same in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The second point.</hi> In whom
are all these euill thoughts?
<hi>Answ.</hi> In all men naturallie
without exception, till they
be renewed by Gods speciall
grace: Yea the truth is, these
thoughts doe euery where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound;
for looke what men
doe practise, that first of all
they thinke, for the thought
is the beginning of euery


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:555:64"/>
action; But in the worlde all
sins against the second Table,
doe abound, as the practise
of Dishonour, of Murther, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie,
Thefts, and Disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and therefore these euill
thoughts from whence these
actions come, must needes be
common.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> By this wee may see
what a huge masse of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the naturall heart of man
is, without gods special grace;
for thoughts of dishonour
make a mans heart a pallace
of prid like the table of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni-bezek:
Also thoughts of
crueltie make mans heart a
slaughterhouse: Thoughts of
Adulterie make it a most fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
stewes: Thoughts of theft
make it to become a denne of
theeues, wherein all manner
of fraud, and bad dealing is

it a fountaine of backbyting,
debate, slander, and reuiling:
And therfore howsoeuer the
outward life may be ordered
ciuillie, yet without Gods
grace mans heart is most vile:
And those that pleade their

shew this to bee the nature of
man, to exalt himselfe in his
owne heart, aboue all others.
If any shall say, heereby no
more can bee prooued but
that this thought is in some
proud and insolent persons; I
adde therfore, that as our first
Parents in the beginning, did
learne that proud lesso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the
divell, <hi>Ye shall be as Gods:</hi> so we
being in their loynes when
they sinned, and descending
from them by ordinarie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
doe together with
our nature receiue that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:555:66"/>
from them, whereby
wee thinke thus proudly of
our selues, that <hi>we far excell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and are as little Gods on
earth in respect of others.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
the most will say for

But we must know that the les<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ser

the more it reigneth in our

and bewaile it, the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
place it taketh in vs.</p>
                  <p>Now touching this thought
of pride, two things must bee
obserued: the <hi>danger,</hi> and the
<hi>highest degree</hi> of it.<note place="margin">The danger of this thought.</note> For the
<hi>danger</hi> of this thought; The

pride; But the most
vile and wretched pride of all,


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:555:67"/>
is that spirituall pride of the
heart whereby a man despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
all other, in regarde of
himselfe, and thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
far better then any. This
I manifest by sundrie reasons,
as first, from the fruites of this
inward pride: for hence doe
slowe many damnable sinnes;
in mens liues and conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:<note place="margin">Fruites of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pride.</note>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as first, <hi>Ambition,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

whereby men dare enterprise
things beyond their calling,
and aboue their power, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vppon them more then
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> they are able for. Thirdly, <hi>boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,</hi>
wherby a man speaks of

where this thought of pride

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, such is the danger


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:555:68"/>
of this sinne, that when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinnes die in a man, this
thought of pride dyeth not:
nay, when other sinnes are
mortified, and Gods graces
come in stead thereof, yet this
will then reuiue, and make
the graces of God, matter
whereon to worke: as when
an ignorant person attaines
to some knowledge; this
pride will take occasion from
that gift of God to puffe vp
the heart; yea when a man in
true humilitie of heart shall
renounce the actions of pride,
yet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> wil pride be working,
for this is a fruit of pride to
thinke well of our selues, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause
we are not proud,<note place="margin">The height of this thought</note>
                  </p>

                     <hi>II. Point.</hi> The <hi>highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>
of this pride is, when a
man thinketh himselfe to
bee equall with God. This


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:555:69"/>
is a most notorious, nay
an abhominable height of
pride; and yet the truth is,
some men haue come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.
Thus the king of <hi>Babel</hi>
thought of himselfe, when he
said in his heart,<note n="k" place="margin">Isa. 14. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>I will ascend
aboue the height of the clowdes
and will be like the most high.</hi> It
may seeme strange that men
should thinke thus of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
but we must know, that
men may doe it two waies;
first, when they thinke they
haue power of themselues,
whereby they are able to
match or counteruaile the
power of God: so thought
Nabuchad-nezar whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he said,
<note n="l" place="margin">Daniel. 3 15.</note> 
                     <hi>who is that god, that can deliuer
you out of my hand?</hi> such a
thought had proud Pharao in
his heart, when he said to
Moses &amp; Aaron,<note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 5. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>who is the


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:555:69"/>
Lord that I should heare his
voice, &amp; let Israel goe?</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when they take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
the honour of God, and
thinke it to be due to them:
Thus did <hi>Herod</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 12. 22.</note> when by si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
he approued the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
voice of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who cried vnto him, <hi>the
voice of God, and not of man.</hi>
And thus Antichrist sitting in
the temple of God,<note n="o" place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>exalts
himselfe aboue all that is called
God, or worshipped:</hi> Now that
man of sinne is the Pope of
Rome; for howsoeuer in
word he humble himselfe, &amp;
call himselfe the seruant of
seruants; yet indeede through
the pride of his heart, he sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
as God, taking vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that honour which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to God:<note place="margin">Bellar. de Rom. pontil. lib. 4.</note> for he claimeth
power to prescribe new rules


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:555:70"/>
of Gods worship, to forgiue
sinnes, to make lawes to bind
the conscience properly, yea
to open, and shut heauen, and
to dispose at his pleasure of
earthly kingdomes; he taketh
vpon him to dispence with
the morall lawe, and with
Apostolicall constitutions: all
which belong to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and none dare claime
them to belong vnto him,
but he that matcheth himselfe
with God; and this is the
highest decree of pride.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Vse.</hi> By this euery man
may see what he is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
what a cursed and proud
nature he carrieth about with
him: for euery man naturally
when occasion is offered
thinks highly of himselfe, and
basely of others in regard of
himselfe. Let vs therefore


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:555:70"/>
take notice of this Satanicall
pride that is in our nature, and
striue against it, for who
would not be ashamed to
say with the proud Pharasie,
<hi>I thanke thee Lord, I am not as

                  <head>Sect. 2. Mans thought of

                  <p>The second euill thought
concerning a mans selfe is
this, I <hi>am sufficiently righteous,
and I need no repentance.</hi> That
this is the thought of euerie
man naturally appeareth by
the Lords commandement
to the people of Israell, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
them to say in their
hearts, when they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:555:71"/>
in the promised land,<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 9. 4.</note>
that <hi>for their owne righteousnes
the Lord brought</hi> them in to
possesse it. Wherby he giueth
vs to vnderstand two things:
First, that as the Iewes did
there, so euerie man thinks
himself to be righteous. And
secondly he thinks that God
doth giue his blessings vnto
him for his owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
for the Lord vseth not to
forbidde such a thought as
men naturally haue not in
them: so in like manner when
Ieremie rebuked the people
for their sinnes, they said,<note n="b" place="margin">Ierem. 2. 35.</note>
                     <hi>they were Innocent and guiltles,
they had not sinned:</hi> And the
Church of Laodicea saith
thus of her selfe,<note n="c" place="margin">Rev. 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>I am rich
and neede nothing;</hi> that is, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in spirituall graces.
This is the thought of the


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:555:71"/>
proud<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 18. 9. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Pharisie, who trusts in
himselfe that he is iust,</hi> and
therfore braggeth vnto God,
that he is not such and such,
but he doth this, and that, he
fasteth, he giueth Almes, pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
tithes, &amp;c. and in plaine
tearmes his heart saith this,
<hi>I am righteous, I neede no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi>
for of such Christ spake
when he said,<note n="e" place="margin">Matht. 9. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>he came not to
call the righteous but sinners to
repentance.</hi> And againe, <hi>I say
vnto you,</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 15. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>that ioy shall be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
for one sinner that conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
more then for ninetie and
nine iust men which need none

must obserue that Christ mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not, that there are in
deede some so righteous, that
they neede no amendment;
but he speaketh according to


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:555:72"/>
the opinion, which some haue
of themselues, to witte, that
they are righteous, and neede
no repentance: by all which
it is more then manifest that
this is a naturall thought of a
man concerning himselfe.</p>
                  <p>This euill thought raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in our age and time as all
the former doe:<note place="margin">Examination for this thought.</note> for come to
an ignorant man that hath
not beene instructed in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
reason with him touching
his estate, and aske him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he can keepe the law of
God or not; he will answer,
he can; he loueth the lord his
God with all his heart, and
his neighbour as himselfe:
Aske him how hee lookes to
be saued; his answer is by his
owne righteousnes, and for
his owne goodnesse. If due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
were made, this


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:555:72"/>
would be found to be the
thought of many that liue in
the Church among vs; and
there is none by nature free
from this thought.</p>
                  <p>Hereby then we may see
that the thoughts of euery
man, be he what he will, are
plaine papistry, for Poperie
is naturall: One chiefe pillar
and ground thereof is <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and saluation by workes;</hi>
which opinion euery man
brings with him from his
mothers wombe: And so it is
in the point of merit, men
naturally thinke they receiue
the good things which they
haue from God, for their own
righteousnes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that it is a matter of
great difficultie, to bring a
man throughly to renounce


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:555:73"/>
his owne righteousnes and
soundly, and heartily to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
true religion, and the
righteousnes of Christ by
faith. This is no lesse then the
change of Nature; and yet
this must euery man doe, that
will be saued, he must be
come nothing in himselfe,
that he may be all in Christ
Iesus; which is as impossible to
nature, as to change water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fire, and therfore men
had need to beware how
they put off the time, &amp; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the meanes in which
God shewes his power in
working this change in the
hearts of his elect.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence we see the
euident cause of that prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
course of the world,
which most men take in spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their witte, and strength,


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:555:73"/>
some for riches, others for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and pleasures, and in
the meane while they can
spare no time for religion, to
seeke Gods fauour in Christ,
and the graces of the spirit: It
may bee they will afford a
good worde vnto Religion,
but yet they regarde it not in
respect of other things. And
this is the behauiour not of
some few, but of all sorts, and
degrees of men naturally.
Now the cause heereof is this
cursed euill thought, whereby
men perswade themselues,
<hi>they be righteous, and need no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
and till this thought
be rooted out of mans heart,
he will neuer value the word
and religion of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the worth thereof, so
as with the good <hi>Marchant
he wil part with al that he hath,


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:555:74"/>
rather then he wiil be frustrate of
this pearle.</hi> Math. 13. 45, 46. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
men vse to pleade thus
for themselues; wee confesse
our selues to be sinners, and
therefore wee cannot thinke
such a wicked thought, <hi>that we
need no repentance;</hi> But we must
knowe, that both these may
well stand together, in the
wicked heart of man; he may
confesse himselfe to bee a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and yet thinke that hee is
righteous: for is not this<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon practise to make great
sins, little sins &amp; little sins, no
sins? Doe not men cloath vice
in vertues robe, and turne out
vertue in the rotten ragges of
vice? Is not drunkennes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

neighbourhood? Is not swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

Hypocrisie, and such
like? doth not hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayneth
the common sinnes
of the time, make himselfe a
pray to the mouthes of the
vngodly? Nowe where these
things are, though the mouth
say, <hi>I am a sinner;</hi> yet the heart
thinketh <hi>I am righteous,</hi> and so
it is apparant this thought is

                  <p>In things spirituall which

Heere further wee must
know that this want of good
consideration is a grieuous
evill and a mother sinne, from
whence as from a fountaine,
streames of corruptions and
transgressions both of heart
and life doe issue forth; first,
hereby we are disabled from
yelding vnto God that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of heart which his law
requireth; for how can
we <hi>loue the Lord with all our
thought and mind; &amp; our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

commandeth, when as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
our hearts are void of

God, and towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?
Againe, whence
comes sinning with an high


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:555:84"/>
hand, when men sinne, and
will sinne? whence comes it
that men blesse themselus in
their sinnes, and flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in their owne eies,
while they goe on in sinne,
but from want of considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods presence, and of
Gods iudgements? This A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
knew well, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saide of the people of
Gerar, <hi>because</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 20. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>they wanted the

<hi>therefore they would kill him for

comes that sensualitie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

or hell, but from want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of their dutie to


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:555:85"/>
God? If men did vse to call
themselues to accompt for
their sinnes, or did set before
their eyes the iudgements of
God due vnto them, it could
not be that there shoud be
such want of contrition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, or of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards their brethren, as
euery where abounds. And
the like might be said of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other capitall sinnes, all
which proceede from the
want of good consideration.
Where, by the way, we may
obserue, that our common
people doe farre deceiue
themselues in this perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of themselues, <hi>that by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
they haue good hearts, and
good meaning:</hi> If you charge
them with the sinnes of their

thinges is altogether wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
And therfore while men
doe soothe vp themselues in
their good meaning, they
deceiue their owne hearts
through ignorance of their
naturall estate: and they must
knowe, that they can neuer
come vnto Christ that they
might haue life, till they be
quite gone out of themselues

Hauing seene what euill
thoughts be in euery
man naturally, &amp; what good
thoughts be wanting in him:
it followeth now to make
some vse of this doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
mans naturall Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
                  <p>The first vse shall be against
all <hi>Atheists,</hi> who thinke the
Scripture to be meere poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
deuised by man to keepe
men in awe. But we are to
know, that the holy Scripture
is no deuise of man, but the
very word of the euerliuing
God; which I thus demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
out of the former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
The Scripture saith in
generall, that all the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of euery naturall man
are euill and that continually.


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:555:86"/>
Nowe it doth not onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
this in generall, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
it also in particular; for
elsewhere it sheweth what
those particular euill thoughts
be, which the naturall minde
of man frameth concerning
God, his neighbour, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Againe, the same Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith in generall, <hi>That
good thoughts and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
are naturally wanting in
euery man; and elsewhere it
declareth in particular what
those good thoughts be
which enter not into the
mind of a natural man: both
these haue bin plainly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the word of God.
Nowe herevpon it doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follow that the
scripture is the word of God:
for let the cunning Atheist
shew whence it is that the


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:555:87"/>
scripture doth declare mans
thoughts; hee cannot say, of
man; for no man knoweth
the thoughts of another; nay
he cannot finde out his owne
thoughts: neither can hee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
it to any angell good or
bad; for the minde of man is
hid from them; they knowe
not mans thoughts. It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
therefore, that as God
alone is the searcher of the
hearts, so that Scripture
which declareth vnto man
what bee his thoughts, is the
onely word of the same God;
Indeed God vsed man for his
instrument, in the penning and
deliuerie of the scripture, but
hee himselfe by his spirite is
the sole author thereof.</p>

charge of euill heere layd vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <hi>repent of this
thy wickednes, and pray God that
if it be possible, the thought of thy
heart may bee forgiuen thee:</hi>
both which places doe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shewe, that true repentance
is not outward in change of
speach or attire, but inward
in the change of the thoughts
of the minde, and affections
of the heart. And hence it is
that Paule prayeth for the
Thessalonians,<note n="p" place="margin">1. Thes. 5. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>that they may
be sanctified throughout, in soule,
in bodie, and spirit,</hi> that is, in the
<hi>minde,</hi> where is the framing

bee required in the
minde, then must there be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:555:91"/>
of the sinnes that
are therein. This dutie the
Lord himselfe vouchsafeth to
teach, and therefore we must
make conscience to learne
and practise it, if we would
be truly turned to the Lord.
And to mooue vs hereunto,
consider the reasons follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>First, the curse of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the pangs and torments
of the damned,<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> both in this
life and after death, are due to
the person of man for his
wicked thoughts: for <hi>cursed is
euery one</hi> (saith<note n="q" place="margin">Deut. 27. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Moses) that
continueth not in all things that
are written in the law to doe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>:</hi>
so that hee which breaketh
the law but once, and that in
thought only, is accursed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath not done all
things that are written there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:555:92"/>
Now wicked thoughts are
a breach of the law: for Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
saith,<note n="r" place="margin">Pro. 14. 22. &amp; Pro. 15. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Doe not they erre
that imagine euill?</hi> and againe,
<hi>The thoughts of the wicked are
an abhomination to the Lord:</hi>
yea, the want of good
thoughts is a breach of the
Law: for Christ<note n="s" place="margin">Mark. 12. 30.</note> saith, Thou
shalt loue the Lord thy God
with all thy <hi>thought:</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wicked thoughts must
needes deserue this curse. The
fall of the deuills was most
fearefull and irrecouerable,
&amp; (though it be not certen,
yet) most Diuines agree in
this, that their sinne was first
in thought; and therefore
wicked thoughts are deadly
euills. Also to shew the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
of euill thoughts, God
hath set this brand vpon them
since the fall of Adam, that


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:555:92"/>
by them not onely mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but also his minde and
memorie, are far sooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
then by outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents;
this was not so by
creation, and therefore it is
the heauie curse of God vpon
them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, these wicked
thoughts be the roote and
beginning of all <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

cannot be an action before
there be a thought: for this is
the order whereby our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are produced: first the
minde thinketh; then that
thought delighteth the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<note place="margin">Order of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and from that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

consent of will, commeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of the action, after
executiou commeth trade and
custome by often practise:


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:555:93"/>
and vpon custome (if the
worke be euill) commeth the
<hi>curse,</hi> which is eternall death.
How great a cause therefore
haue we to repent vs of the
wicked Imaginations of our
hearts? The old world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
was drowned for their
actuall abhominations, but no
doubt, the Lord had great
respect in that iudgement to
their wicked thoughts, which
were the roote of all: and
therfore he mentioneth them
as a cause of the flood. Gen.
6. 5.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>repentance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of euill thoughts.</note> three
things are required; first, a
due <hi>examination</hi> of our heartr
concerning these imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
which we may take by
the knowledge of those
points before handled, of
mans naturall thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:555:93"/>
God, his neighbour,
&amp; himselfe: And to further vs
herein we must remember
that all the euill thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned be in vs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
so as if we be left to
our selues, when occasion is
offered, we will conceiue
them in our mindes; as <hi>that
there is no God; that the word of
God is foolishnes, &amp;c.</hi> Againe we
must heare Gods word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
attentiuely, &amp; apply, not
onely our outward senses,
but our mindes also thereto,
that so it may enter into our
hearts; for the word of God,
working in the heart will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
vnto a man what be his
thoughts: <hi>This word</hi> (saith
the holy<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> Ghost) <hi>is mightie

he is rebuked of all men,

                     <note place="margin">2. Prayer for pardon of them.</note> Secondly, after exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,

so that whatsoeuer is of a

concerne <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>our selues.</hi>
That which concerneth God
containeth many branches,


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:555:103"/>
but I will insist in foure espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.
First, <hi>touching Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi>
wherby a man doth
thinke and so resolue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that wheresoeuer he is,
he stands before God, and
that all his thoughts, wordes,
and deedes are naked in Gods
sight: Dauids heart was filled
with this consideration, when
he penned the 139. psalme:
for that whole psalme from
the beginning to the ende
serueth to expresse this holy
cogitation of Gods presence:
the like impression must wee
labour to haue in our hearts
touching Gods presence: for
it is the most notable meanes,
to cleanse the heart from euill
thoughts, to restraine the will
and affections from wicked
delights, and to keepe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the whole man, causing


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:555:104"/>
him to stand in the awe of
Gods commandements. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
saith,<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 19. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>The feare of the
Lord is cleane;</hi> meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that that man which hath
the feare of God in his heart
arising from this considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods presence, hath a
cleane and pure heart. This
consideration also is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
meanes of comfort in the
time of trouble and danger:
hence David<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 23. 4.</note> saith, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hough I
walke through the valley of the

none euill: for the Lord is with
me:</hi> and hence it was that<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 3. 6.</note>
                     <hi>he would not be afraid for tenne

                  <head>Sect. 2. The consideration of Gods
iudgements.</head>
                  <p>The second consideration
touching God, is <hi>of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
not onely those which
were done of old, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in the Scripture, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
histories; but euen his
late iudgements which wee
behold, or heare to fall vpon
Kingdomes, Townes, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
houses, and persons, must
we carefully lay vnto our
hearts. Of the want hereof
the Lord complaineth among
his people saying,<note n="d" place="margin">Ier 12. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>The whole
land lieth wast, because no man
setteth his minde on it:</hi> giuing
vs to vnderstand, that the
neglect of due consideration
of Gods iudgement brought


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:555:105"/>
desolation to the whole land,
and therefore the want ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is a maine and grieuous
sinne, bringing further iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with it.</p>
                  <p>God hath sundry times sent
his iudgements among vs;
generally by plague, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
and particularly on
sundrie families, and persons;
but who regardeth them?
Wherefore vnlesse wee will
double Gods iudgements
vpon vs, let vs remember our
dutie, and seriously thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. And that this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
may be profitable
vnto vs, we must doe three
things: first, we must carefully
obserue, marke, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them: Psal. 119. 52. <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thy Iudgements of old,
O Lord.</hi> The Lords people
were much wanting therein,


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:555:105"/>
as Psal. 78. 11. 42. Secondly,
we must apply them to our
owne person in particular,
so as the thought thereof may
make vs afraid, though they
befall others. When<note n="c" place="margin">Hab. 3. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Haba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuck</hi>
in a vision saw the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, which were to
come vpon the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> the
consideration thereof was so
powerfull with him, that it
<hi>made him tremble and quake</hi>
In a familie when the father
beateth his seruant the child
feareth; and when one
child is beaten, then all the
rest crie: euen so when God
our father powreth downe
his iudgements, though vpon
the heathen, yet wee must
feare; but when any of his
children are afflicted, it must
strike soare to our hearts.
Thirdly, we must make vse of


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:555:106"/>
Gods iudgments that light
vpon others, by applying
them to our selues. When
certaine men brought newes
to our Sauiour Christ of an
heauie iudgement vpon some
<note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 13, 1, 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Galileans, whose blood Pilate
had mingled with their owne sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi>
immediately our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
labours to bring them
that told him to make vse
thereof for their owne good,
saying, that thereby they
ought to be mooued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
for they that were
slaine, were no greater sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
then the rest: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>except they</hi> who told that
newes <hi>did amend their liues,
they should also perish.</hi> So that
whensoeuer we see or heare
of any iudgement of God
vpon others, wee must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be mooued to repent: and


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:555:106"/>
thus doing, we shall come to

                  <p>The third consideration
concerning God, is <hi>of his
word.</hi> Dauid maketh it the
propertie of a <hi>blessed</hi> man,<note n="g" place="margin">Ps. 1. 2.</note> to

                     <hi>delight

spake.</hi> And so ought euery
child of God, high or low,
daily and continually to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:555:107"/>
in the word of God.
But, alas, this dutie is little
knowne and lesse practised:
men are so farre from medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Gods word, that
they are ignorant of it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many families you
shall scarse finde the booke
of God: and such as haue it,
for the most part, doe little
vse it. The statutes of the land
are by very many searched
out diligently, but in the
meane time the statutes of
the Lord are litle regarded:
oh that men knew the sweete
<hi>comfort</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Scriptures,</hi> then
certenly they would account
their meditation therein<note n="o" place="margin">Ier. 15. 16.</note>
                     <hi>the ioy and reioycing of their
heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the right considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods word consists in
three things: first, we must


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:555:107"/>
obserue the true sense, and
meaning of that which wee
heare, or read; secondly, we
must marke what experience
we haue had of the truth of
the word in our owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
as in the exercises of
Repentance, &amp; Inuocation of
Gods name, and in all our
Temptations: this is a speciall
point in this meditation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the former is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Thirdly, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how farre forth we haue
beene answerable to Gods
word in obedience, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we haue beene defectiue
by transgressions. Againe in
the word of God, there bee
both commandements, and
promisses: The consideration
of Gods commandements is
a notable meanes to direct, &amp;
moderate, not onely our


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:555:108"/>
words, and deedes, but also
our secret thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires:
for if before we thinke,
before we will, or speake any
thing, we would first consider
that god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mands vs to think,
to will, and speake thus and
thus; this would mightily
stay, and suppresse in vs all
corrupt Thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
all euill words, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
The promisses of God
likewise duly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sidered would
greatly further vs in good
Thoughts: for <hi>to them that
think on good things, shall be
mercie and Truth.</hi> Prov. 14.
22. The cause then why many
that know the will of God, so
much faile in particular obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is because that with
their knowledge, they doe not
ioyne this serious considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:555:108"/>
and promisses, and
apply the same to their occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                  <p>The fourth consideration
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cerning God, <hi>is of his workes:</hi>
for as Dauid saith,<note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 11. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>The
workes of the Lord are great, and
ought to be sought out of all that
loue him.</hi> This consideration
bindeth vs to enquire, and
search what be the workes
of God toward vs; his worke
of creation, his providence,
preseruation, with all other
his workes of mercie and
Iustice in vs, and vpon vs:
whether ordinary: or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary:
The prophet<note n="d" place="margin">Esay. 5. 11, 12.</note> Isay

not the worke of God, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the worke of his hands;</hi>
whereby we may see that the
neglect hereof, is a grieuous
sinne, and yet it is the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
sinne of this age.</p>
                  <p>Now for the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this dutie, wee
must thus proceede; first we
must consider our <hi>creation,</hi>
how the Lord gaue vs being,
when we were nothing; and
how he made vs reasonable
creatures, &amp; not brute beasts,
yea, he created vs in his owne
image, when as he might if
it had so pleased him, haue
made vs Toades, &amp; Serpents:
Secondly, we must consider
his good providence ouer vs,
howe he hath preserved our
life from time, to time, and


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:555:109"/>
saued vs from many dangers:
And his great patience must
not be forgotten, how he hath
spared vs from the righteous
Iudgements of our sinnes; hee
might haue cast vs into hell,
in our mothers wombe, or so
soone as wee were borne for
our originall sinne: But hee
hath giuen vs a large time of
Repentance. Heere also wee
must consider his exceeding
fauour in the time and place
of our birth, and life: hee
might haue suffered vs to
haue beene borne among In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels:
but behold wee were
borne in the bosome of Gods
Church: hee might haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
vs of the meanes of
our saluation, his holie worde
and Sacraments; but in his
tender mercie hee hath
vouchsafed them vnto vs, to


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:555:110"/>
bring our soules to life. Hee
might haue,<note n="b" place="margin">Isay. 63. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>hardned our
hearts against his feare, and
blinded our eies against his
light,</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 11. 8.</note> but yet he hath enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
our mindes to knowe his
truth, and softned our hearts
causing vs to crie vnto him
for the pardon of our sinne;
he might haue<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 1. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>giuen vs vp to
a reprobate sense,</hi> when wee
swerued from his testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and reguarded not the
knowledge of his will: but
loe, as a louing father he hath
often<note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 12. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>chastened vs. for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
that wee might bee partakers
of his holines:</hi> Hee might haue
left vs comfortles vnder the
reproch of the wicked, but hee
hath vouchsafed vs his spirit,
for our euerlasting comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Thus must we dulie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of all these wonderfull


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:555:110"/>
workes of God towardes vs,
and not like the men of this
world, thinke on nothing but
pastimes, honours, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities;
This will bee a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
meanes to keepe our
hearts from euill thoughtes:
for whose heart will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
towards his God, that so
many waies hath tasted of his
bountie towardes him? yea,
this consideration will bee an
exceeding stay and comfort
to our soules in the daie of
trouble, and distresse: so Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
saith:<note n="a" place="margin">Ecles. 5. 15. 16.</note>

of this that he can not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the workes of God, for he


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:555:111"/>

owne personall
sinnes.</head>
                  <p>THe considerations which
respect our selues are six:
<hi>First,</hi> we must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sider <hi>our owne
personall sinnes;</hi> as well the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of our hearts, as the
actuall Transgressions of
our liues. This was Dauids
practise;<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 115. 59.</note> 
                     <hi>I considered my waies</hi>
saith hee) <hi>and turned my feete,
into thy testimonies.</hi> The Iewes

                     <hi>come let vs search, and
trie our waies, and turne againe
vnto the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this consideration of our
sinnes, wee must doe three
things: First, seriouslly call to


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:555:112"/>
minde in what <hi>manner</hi> wee
haue sinned; whether of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
or of knowledge, of
weaknesse through infirmitie
or of wilfulnesse through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption:
Secondly, we must
dulie waighe the <hi>greatnes</hi> of
our particular sinnes, euen of
the least of them, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
this, that by euery sinne
wee commit, Gods infinite
maiestie is displeased, and his
iustice violated: Thirdly, wee
must consider the <hi>number</hi> of
our sinnes; which wee shall
neerest attaine vnto, by sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
out our Thoughts, our
wills, &amp; affections, our words,
&amp; actions, all which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
obserued, will make
vs crie out, that they bee in
number as the haires of our
head, and the sands by the
Sea-shoare. <hi>Quest.</hi> But what if


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:555:112"/>
a man haue truely repented
him of his sinnes, must he still
vse this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sideration of them?
<hi>Answ.</hi> Yes verily, although he
bee assured of the pardon of
them: so did Dauid after Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
tould him thy sinnes are
forgiuen; hee penned the <hi>51.
Psalme,</hi> and when hee was
high in Gods fauour, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
still for the<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 25. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>pardon of the
sinnes of his youth:</hi> for howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
God in mercie put our
sinnes out of his remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce
vpon our true repentance, yet
we must neuer put them out
of our remembrance, so long
as we liue in this world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the consideration of
them, though they bee pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is a notable meanes both
to mooue vs to renewe our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and also to make
vs watchfull against sinne in


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:555:113"/>
time to come.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, wee must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>the miserie into which euery
one is plunged by nature through
Adams fall, and his owne sinnes.</hi>
This was <hi>Iobs meditation,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

particular view of this our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
miserie: the principall
branches whereof bee these:


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:555:113"/>
first, <hi>a separation from all fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
with God:</hi> for as <hi>Isai</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Isa. 59. 2.</note> saith,
<hi>Our sinnes haue separated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and vs:</hi> and this is
the speciall part of mans mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.
Secondly, <hi>societie and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
fellowship with the damned spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
the deuill and all his angels;</hi>
standing in this, that man by
nature beareth the image of
the deuill, and withall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
seruice vnto him in the
practise of lying, iniustice,
crueltie, and all manner of
sinne. Thirdly, <hi>all manner of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
calamities in this life,</hi> as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie
in good name, paines
and diseases in the bodie, los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and damages in friends,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
and in all temporall blessings
whatsoeuer. Fourthly, <hi>the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of a guiltie conscience,</hi>
which is in it selfe the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:555:114"/>
of hell torments: for it
is our accuser vnto God, our
Iudge to giue sentence against
vs, and the very hang-man of
our soules to condemne vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally.
Fiftly, <hi>the second
death,</hi> which is the full appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the eternall furie
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of Gods wrath, both in bodie
and soule eternally. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
must be often vsed
of euery man, to mooue him
to repentance, and it is very
effectuall thereunto: for if we
doe but consider howe a man
for the paine of one tooth,
will be so grieued, that hee
could wish with all his heart
to be out of the worlde, that
his paine were ended; oh
then how great shal we think
the apprehension of the full
wrath of God to bee, seazing
not vpon one little member,


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:555:114"/>
but vpon the whole man
both bodie and soule, &amp; that
for euer? No tongue can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
nay no heart can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the greatnes of this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and therefore it must be
an occasion both to beginne
and encrease true repentance

euen so, seeing the deuill doth

into serious consideration
of our thoughts, wills; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and see in what part
we bee most weake, and in

                  <p>This consideration concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

the ordinary meanes of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
this done, he seekes to
keepe them in this estate

iudgements due vnto them;
that so bereauing them of all
hope of mercie, he may bring

this temptation, and cast with
our selues euery day how to
auoide it. This we shall doe if

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:555:116"/>

and therefore that we may

befall vs, in regard of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
payne, and torment,
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> then when we little feare
or suspect any such thing.
This consideration will bee a
notable meanes, to stirre vp
our hearts either to beginne,
or renew our repentance:
when wicked<note n="m" place="margin">1. King. 21. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Ahab</hi> heard

                  <p>Fiftly, we must often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
with our selues, and that
most seriously, <hi>of that straight
account, and reckoning of all
our thoughts, words, and actions,
which we must make vnto God
at the last day of iudgement.</hi> This
is the principall consideration
of all, and the want hereof a
fearfull sinne, arguing great
negligence, ignorance, blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of mind, and hardnes of
heart: If a Traveller come into
an Inne, hauing but one pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in his purse and call for
all manner of dainty fare,
and prouision, spending sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously,
will not al men iudge


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:555:118"/>
him void of all consideration,
sith he hath nothing to pay,
when his account is to bee
made? loe, this, or worser is
the most mens case, who in
this life pursue their profits
and pleasures, with all eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
they care not how, neuer
regarding that reckonning
which they must make vnto
God, at his terrible day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
with all the world:
and therefore though the
former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>siderations will not,
yet let this take place in our
hearts, to mooue vs to a daily
forehand reckonning with
God in the practise of true
repentance, and to imploy the
good gifts and blessings we
receiue from God, like good
seruants, vnto the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of his glorie, that when
this account is to be made,


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:555:118"/>
we may giue it with ioy,
and not with feare. And
that this consideration is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
to this purpose, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
teacheth in vsing it as
his farewell with dissolute
youth, with whome other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

thou young man, take thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

for all this, thou must come to
Iudgement.</hi> But how powerfull
it is with Gods child, we may
see in <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">Act. 24. 15.</note> who professeth

                  <p>Lastly, we must seriously
consider <hi>of our present estate
towards God,</hi> whether we be in
the state of sinne, or in the
state of grace; whether we
belong to the kingdome of
darkenes, or be true members
of the kingdome of Christ: It
is not enough to bee in the
Church, but we must be sure,
we be of the Church; For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Gods fould; <hi>They went out from
vs</hi> (saith <hi>S.</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">1. Iohn. 1. 19.</note> Iohn) <hi>but they were

adviseth to this consideration,
saying,<note n="r" place="margin">2. Cor. 13. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>prooue your selues,
whether you bee in the faith or

not for that <hi>oyle of true

their soules to the fruition of
Gods glorie: yea, this is
the common sinne of this age,
men blesse themselues in
their good meaning, saying
they hope well; and doe not
through search, whether
they be true members of gods
Church or not: Now if after
tryall it appeare, that true
faith and repentance be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in vs, which are the
seales of Adoption in Gods
children then with all good
conscience, we must vse the
meanes appointed of God to
obteine these graces for our
assurance; the comfort where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

will be so pretious vnto
our soules, that we shall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor

as any way tend to depriue

                  <p>These are the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which respect our selues;
whereunto if we giue our

as also to the former which

through Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vpon our endeauour, wee
shall vndoubtedly finde by
good experience, <hi>that euill
thoughts shall not preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs:</hi> but beeing reformed
in our cogitations, we shall
send out of our mindes as
from a cleansed fountaine,
such streames of good words
and works, through the whole

course of our liues, as shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
