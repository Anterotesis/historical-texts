         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE FLOCK of CHRIST, Every where to be READ in their ASSEMBLIES.</head>
            <p>GRACE, MERCY and PEACE be multiplied among you all from God the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt who is the Fountain of all: And God who hath called you by his Grace, and gathered you to be a People by his Power and Spirit to his Son Chriſt Jeſus, your holy Heavenly ſpiritual Head, Life, Rock, and Foundation. Now that you may</p>
            <p>All walk in Chriſt Jeſus and abide in him your Vine, and in him you will all bring forth Heavenly Fruit, to the Praiſe and Glory of God.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſaies, <hi>In me ye have Peace, in the World ye have Trouble</hi>; And therefore keep out of the Spirit of the World; Let not the Spirit of the World come into you; for if ye do, ye go into Trouble both Inwardly and Outwardly. But if ye keep in Chriſt, who is not of the World, you keep in your heavenly Peace and Region: For <hi>he that hath the Son of God, he hath Life</hi>; and therefore keep in the Life in Chriſt: And he that hath not the Son of God, is in Old <hi>Adam</hi> in Death without Life.</p>
            <p>And <hi>without me</hi> (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>ye can do nothing</hi>: without his Grace, his Light, his Truth, his Goſpel, his Power, his Spirit, his Faith, ye can do nothing: And <hi>if Chriſt be not in you, you are Reprobates</hi>: And if he be in you, and you in him, you are in your Election, and in the ſeed, in which all Nations are bleſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore my Friends and Brethren, both Males and Females, keep and walk in the ſeed in which all Nations are bleſt, which bruiſes the Head of the Serpent, and deſtroys the Devil and his Works, which brought Miſery and the Curſe upon all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So that in this holy ſeed you all may be the Children of the Kingdom of God that ſtands in Righteouſneſs and Power, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; I ſay, in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt before unrighteouſneſs was; and in the Power of God, before the power of Satan and Dragon Was; and <hi>in the peace of God, that paſſes all the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> of the World, and was before the God of the World was; and in the Holy Ghoſt, which was before the unclean Ghoſt got into Man and Woman.</p>
            <p>And ſo that you may all come to walk in the New Covenant of Light which was before the Prince of Darkneſs was, and Life, that is over Death, and before Death was. Here in this you will know your heavenly Region to walk in, which will keep you out of all the Worlds unruly Waies and Actions, and ungracious Words and Languages, that all <hi>your Words be ſeaſon'd with the Grace of God,</hi> that hath brought your Salvation, that you may Edifie the Hearers, and your Converſation may be in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And keep in the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt the Power of God,</hi> that keeps you Crucified to the World, that is, Dead to the World; and the World Dead and Crucified to you. For if you do not keep in this Power of God, which was afore the World and its God was, to keep you Crucified to the World, but let in the Spirit of the World, you let in his God which will Crucifie the good in you, and you come to Crucifie to your ſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to open ſhame. Therefore keep that killed and Crucified with the power of God, the Croſs of Chriſt, which did and would Crucifie the Juſt and then you keep alive in the power of God, and alive in Chriſt Jeſus, and he is alive in you and you in him.</p>
            <p>And now, All Friends and Brethren, That your Meekneſs, your Temperance, and your Gentleneſs and Sobriety, and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Moderation may appear to all men, <hi>That your Light may ſo ſhine that they my ſee your good Works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And ye being the Salt of the Earth, you will make all Savoury: therefore take heed of loſing your Salt, leſt you be trodden under the feet of Men.</p>
            <p>And keep out of the Reſtleſs, Diſcontented, Diſquieted Spirit of the World about the Government: For you know it has been alwaies our way to ſeek the good of all, and to live peacably under the Government, and to ſeek their Eternal good peace and happineſs in the Lord Chriſt Jeſus: and to lay our Innocent Sufferings before them who have ſuffered as Lambs and Sheep, and made no Reſiſtance; but have <hi>prayed for them that Perſecuted us and deſpitefully uſed us; and hated us,</hi> according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt.</p>
