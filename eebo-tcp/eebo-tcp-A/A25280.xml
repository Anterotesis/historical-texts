         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Scope of this Epistle is to exhort the
faithfull to continue stedfast in that grace
of God wherein they stood, as it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set downe, chap. 5. vers. 12. But because
that grace of God is considered in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
respect; either as it doth put a man
into the state of grace, and so it equally
belongs unto all the faithfull; or as it doth direct the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the performing of their duties towards others, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that speciall condition wherein they are placed:
therefore in the first place the Apostle exhorts them to hold
fast that grace, because it belongs to the state of the regenerate
man: from the beginning of the Epistle to the 13 verse of
the 2 chap. and then he commends and perswades them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that speciall grace, which doth in the first place direct sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in their obedience towards the Magistrates, to the 18
<pb facs="tcp:62450:3"/>
vers. Servants in obedience towards their Masters, to the end
of the chapter. Wives in their subjection to their husbands,
from the beginning of the third chapter to the seventh verse.
Husbands in their duty towards their wives, vers. 7. Brethren
in their duty towards their brethren, vers. 8. The afflicted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their persecutors, from the 9 vers. to the beginning of
the 5 chap. The Elders towards their Churches, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the 5 chap. to the 5. vers. The younger towards
their elders, at the beginning of the 5. vers. and finally, all
both towards others and towards themselves, to the 10 vers.
where the whole foregoing exhortation is turned into a short
prayer which serves for a forcible conclusion of the whole
Epistle.</p>
                  <p>To the Epistle it selfe there belong two common adjuncts.
<hi>An Inscription,</hi> vers. 1, 2. <hi>A Subscription,</hi> in the three last. In
the <hi>Inscription</hi> there is contained, according to the usuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Epistles, a holy <hi>salutation,</hi> shewing first, by whom this
Epistle was written, secondly, to whom, thirdly, with what
minde or affection it was written unto them; which is set
forth by that pious wish, wherein he wisheth unto them the
greatest good, <hi>Grace and Peace.</hi> In the person writing, and
the good wished there are all things the same with those that
are spoken of in the second Epistle. But the description of the
persons to whom it was written, is something fuller here
then there; now they are described, first by their outward
condition, <hi>strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Asia, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
Cappadocia.</hi> Secondly, by their inward spirituall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is set forth, 1. by the fundamentall cause of it,
<hi>Election,</hi> to wit, of God, 2. by the finall cause, <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
3. by the subservient cause, <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> to wit, <hi>conferred in
obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Iesus Christ:</hi> which three
causes of our sanctification are set forth by the three persons
of the Deity, to whom as to the authors thereof they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
ascribed, Election to God the Father, Sanctification
to the holy Spirit, Reconciliation to Jesus Christ. By the
<hi>strangers scattered,</hi> to whom this Epistle is chiefly directed,
we are to understand the Jewes, together with the other Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
who did imbrace the faith. For <hi>Iames, Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi>
discharged their Apostleship amongst the circumcised Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
<pb facs="tcp:62450:3"/>
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2 8, 9. Therefore as <hi>Iames</hi> doth expresly direct his
Epistle to the twelve Tribes scattered, so here also by the same
reason, by the strangers scattered we are to understand the
twelve Tribes scattered.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>foreknowledge of God,</hi> according to which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
are here said to be <hi>elect,</hi> we are to understand election it
selfe, as it is in God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. and by election the same act
of God, as it is terminated in the faithfull, and put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by effectuall vocation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> we are to understand the whole
spirituall change of our condition, even unto perfect holinesse
and glory, because sanctification is the meanes of salvation
unto which we are chosen, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ</hi> we are to
understand the whole worke of Redemption, together with
the application thereof unto justification and reconciliation
with God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 6. 7.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines that we may draw from this are these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The beginning and fountaine of all our happinesse
and consolation consists in this, that we are the elect of God.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from hence, that the Apostle purposing
in this description to make mention of those things that did
most of all pertaine to the consolation of the faithfull, puts
election in the first place, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because all our happinesse comes wholly from
God, who is the author and fountaine of all good: now it
comes from him not by the way of nature, but of counsell and
free election, and so it proceeds from election it selfe.</p>
                  <p>2. Because all his speciall blessings which belong unto our
salvation, depend upon election, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to exhort</hi> us to use all diligence to
make our election certaine and sure. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. There is no other cause or reason to be given of
our election unto salvation, but onely the good pleasure of God.</p>
                  <p>This is drawne from those words: <hi>Elect according to the
foreknowledge of God:</hi> for if there were any cause <hi>extra Deum,</hi>
out of God, that could possibly be discerned by the eye or
sense of men, it is most likely that the Apostle would have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62450:4"/>
named that, as being more knowne and discernable, and so
more properly belonging to that consolation and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
which he proposed to himselfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the counsels and decrees of God do not
depend upon those things that are <hi>extra Deum,</hi> without God,
but they depend upon Gods decrees: for the decrees are first,
and they last.</p>
                  <p>2. Because otherwise all the glory of our election and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
should not wholly be ascribed unto God, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all praise and thanksgiving should not be due unto
him alone.</p>
                  <p>3. Because if our election did depend upon our selves, who
are weake and changeable every houre, our election also it
selfe would be changeable and uncertaine, and so would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
us no sound consolation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to <hi>refute</hi> those, that make Gods
election to depend upon our faith and perseverance, as a cause
or condition requisite.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort</hi> us to acknowledge this wonderfull grace of
God towards us, and to give him all the praise and glory of
it, both in the inward desires of our hearts, and the joyfull
profession of our tongues, and our lives answerable thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. True sanctification is a certaine fruit of election.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words; <hi>Elect to sanctification,
Ephes.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because sanctification is a certaine effect and
signe of the singular love of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 25, 26. Now this
singular love, which hath respect to spirituall blessings, doth
nothing differ from election, as touching the thing it selfe.</p>
                  <p>2. Because sanctification is, as it were, actuall election:
for as by the election of God, the heires of salvation are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from others in God himselfe, or in his intention
and counsell; so also by regeneration and sanctification are
they distinguished from others in themselves. For <hi>to sanctifie,</hi>
according to the generall signification of the word, is to set
apart to some use.</p>
                  <p>3. Because sanctification, although it be imperfect, yet it
is that salvation and life begun unto which we are elected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to refute</hi> those men that make sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62450:4"/>
the common possession of those that are not elect.</p>
                  <p>2. To comfort all those that are partakers of true sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
because thereby they may the more assured of their
election.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us to be very carefull to encrease our sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. The mediation of Christ, and reconciliation made
for us in him, is the only meanes whereby the force of our election
is derived unto us, and our sanctification and salvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from those words: <hi>by obedience and sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because God made Christ our Mediator, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any other name under heaven whereby we may
be saved.</p>
                  <p>2. Because God made him the Mediator of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by vertue of his election: for those whom God elected, he
gave unto Christ to be redeemed and saved, <hi>Iohn 17. 6. John</hi>
6. 37.</p>
                  <p>3. Because Christ is the second Adam, the Father, the
head of all those that are elected and to be saved: therefore
as life naturall was derived unto all men first from Adam, so
also from Christ, and in him is all life spirituall communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto us.</p>

which have chosen to themselves other meanes and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

from God the Father, the dispensation of it is through his Sonne
Iesus Christ, the application of it is through the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>This is intimated in that solemne benediction which the
Church received from the Apostle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because this order of operation doth best agree
with the order of subsisting, which the Scripture attributes
to the Divine persons.</p>

a sunder those operations which God hath joyned together:
Now this they doe, which do either divide Christ from electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or election from Christ, or the election of the Father and
Christ from the sanctification of the holy Ghost, promising
to themselves salvation, either by vertue of election, or of
Christ, when they have not the least part of the sanctification
of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To comfort</hi> all the true faithfull, which do joyne these
things together: because they can want nothing to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is not abundantly provided for them in that co-operation
of God the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost.</p>

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>BEcause the Apostles scope in the generall and former part
of this Epistle, was to commend unto the faithfull that
true grace of God wherein they stood, therefore he doth first
describe that grace, vers. 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>2. By the effect of it, to wit, <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>rejoycing,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds
unto all the faithfull from the partaking of this grace,
from the 6 vers. to the 10.</p>
                  <p>3. He doth illustrate it and confirme it by that testimony,
which the Prophets gave unto this grace, vers. 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>4. From thence he drawes and exhortation to holinesse an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to this grace, from the 13 vers. to the end of the first
chap. The meanes of which holinesse he shewes to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
receiving of the word of God, vers. 1, 2, 3. of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
chapter. The chiefe object of which word he shewes to
<pb facs="tcp:62450:5"/>
be Christ, from the 4 vers. to the 13. where is the generall
end of this institution.</p>
                  <p>The description, vers. 3, 4 5. of the state of this grace is
placed in regeneration or effectuall calling in these words:
<hi>hath begotten us againe:</hi> which regeneration is described,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. by the principall efficient cause thereof, which is set down
to be, <hi>God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> 2. By the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive
cause thereof, the <hi>mercy of God,</hi> which is described by
the quantity of it, <hi>abundant.</hi> 3. By the immediate effect
thereof, <hi>a lively hope:</hi> the singular cause whereof is shewed
to be <hi>the resurrection of Christ from the dead.</hi> 4. By the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and last effect thereof, which is laid hold on also, and in
some sort possessed by that hope, that is, <hi>salvation and life
everlasting,</hi> vers. 4. Betwixt which effect and its cause he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
that there is a very certaine connexion, when he saith,
that <hi>that inheritance is reserved in heaven for all the regenerate;</hi>
and he gives a most certaine reason of his connexion, vers. 5.
which he shewes to consists in three things. 1. In the power
of God, whereby the regenerate are kept unto salvation.
2. In their faith, whereby they adhere to this power of God.
3. in the eternall degree of God, whereby he hath both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
this salvation for all the regenerate, and appointed a
certaine time, wherein to bestow it upon them.</p>
                  <p>But this description of Gods grace is not simply and barely
proposed by the Apostle, but after such a manner as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the nature of the thing, that is, with thanksgiving and
glorifying of the name of God, in that he hath vouchsafed to
bestow so great a grace upon miserable sinners, in that fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The state of grace depends upon and flowes from
effectuall calling.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from hence, that the Apostle speaking of
the grace wherein the faithfull stood, begins with regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by which is understood effectuall calling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because by our true calling we have union with
Christ the fountaine of all grace.</p>
                     <p>2. Because in this regeneration there is begotten in us a
principle of spirituall life, which is nothing else but the grace
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62450:6"/>
of God, or the power and gift of grace quickning our soules.</p>
                     <p>3. Because from this union which we have by being made
partakers of spirituall life, there doth certainly and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
follow a communion with the Father in all spirituall
blessings, and consequently a change of our condition from
that which before it was, to wit, sinne and death, to that
whereunto we are called, grace and life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to exhort us</hi> to use all diligence to
make our calling sure, because without it we have no entrance
to the state of grace.</p>
                     <p>2. To comfort all those that endeavour to obey Gods call;

Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because in Christ our Redeemer, and in our
redemption performed by him, he laid the foundation of all
our restoring to salvation.</p>
                     <p>2. Because he made Christ that great Shepherd, that
should gather his sheepe, that is, the elect into his fold, by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
calling and regeneration. <hi>Heb. 13. 20. Iohn</hi> 10. 16.</p>
                     <p>3. Because through Christ and his name men are called
and regenerated by God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to <hi>informe us,</hi> that in all those things
that belong unto our salvation, we ought alwayes to looke
upon God in Christ, and consequently alwayes to call upon
and praise God in Christ. The solemne title, and as it were
stile of God, that was used in the celebrating of his name, was
not alwayes one and the same from the beginning of the
world, but diverse: first, he was called by <hi>Melchizedeck, the
most high God, possessour of heaven and earth, Gen.</hi> 14. 19. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by reason of that singular covenant which he made
with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his posterity, he began to be called <hi>the
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob:</hi> then againe, after that
wonderfull deliverance of his people out of Egypt, for the
memory of that thing there was added to his title, <hi>The God
which brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, out
of the house of bondage:</hi> so also in the Prophet, after his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of them from the Babylonish captivity, he was called
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62450:6"/>
                        <hi>The Lord which brought up his people out of the North countrey,
Ier.</hi> 23. 7, 8. But now under the New Testament, and the Sunne
being risen, all his other workes and benefits being obscur'd
by the comming of Christ, this title is most congruous and
solemne, <hi>God the Father of our Lord Iesies Christ, 2 Cor. 1. 3.
Ephes. 1, 3:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. A wonderfull great mercy of God appeares in our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because he frees us from the greatest misery, and
makes us partakers of the greatest good.</p>
                     <p>2. Because he doth this of his meere goodnesse, not only
without our deserts, but even contrary to our deserts: when
we did not so much as seek or wish for any such benefits to our
selves, but were altogether aliens from God, and enemies to
him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to exhort us to attribute all to the
mercy of God alone, and to raise up our minds to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of it.</p>
                     <p>2. To be heartily affected with these mercies of God, and
to be stirred up to glorifie him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Regeneration brings men a lively hope of eternall
life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because we are called and regenerated to salvation
and eternall glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
                     <p>2 Because we have the covenant and promise of this thing
confirmed to us in our very calling.</p>
                     <p>Because the Spirit wherewith we are quickned, lifts up our
minds, and makes that hope to be lively.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to exhort us, highly to prize our
calling and regeneration.</p>
                     <p>3 2. to endeavour by all meanes to cherish and increase this
hope in our selves, and to take heed that it be not dead or
languishing, but lively, quick, and operative.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The livelinesse of our hope depends upon the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section
of Iesus Christ from the dead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because by the resurrection of Christ, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
that death was subdued &amp; overcome by him, and God
was appeased in him; for otherwise, had he beene overcome
by death, he would have beene perpetually kept under it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62450:7"/>
2. Because Christ rose, as the first fruits of all the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20. and the first borne from the dead, <hi>Col. l. 8.
Apoc.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to exhort us,</hi> for the confirmation
and quickning of our hope, to put before out eyes the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. That salvation which we hope for, is a celestiall
and incorruptible inheritance, Vers. 4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. It comes from God our Father to us his regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and adopted sonnes, as worldly inheritances use to come
from fathers to their children.</p>
                     <p>2. Because it is not obtained by buying or any other such
like meanes of our owne, but it comes by the will and testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our heavenly Father. Now as for these reasons, it is
rightly called an inheritance; so also in the nature of it it hath
this excellency above all other inheritances, that it is celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and immortall: in which respect it doth not only excell
worldly possessions, but also even that very condition of life
which <hi>Adam</hi> had before the fall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, not to suffer our
hearts at any time to cleave to the things of this world, or to
depend upon them, because our inheritance is not terrestriall,
or of this world, but celestiall and incorruptible.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>To exhort us</hi> to walke as it becommeth those that are
called to so great an inheritance. For this is it which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
meanes, when he usually admonisheth us to walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our calling, and when he prayes, that God would
enlighten the eyes of our mindes, and grant us to know what
is the hope of his calling, &amp; what the riches, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 18. as if
that they that did cleerly see this and meditate upon it, could
not faulter or faile in any duty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. The exceeding great power of God, his fidelity
and constancie, doth make this inheritance firme and sure unto us.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered out of the 5. verse, and you may see it
prov'd, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because God doth powerfully perform all things,
whatsoever hee hath decreed and promised. 2. Because all
the whole businesse of our salvation depends upon the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
of God: for the enemies of our salvation, and the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62450:7"/>
difficulties of it are so great, that no other power is able to
subdue them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to refute</hi> those, that will have our
salvation to depend upon the frailty of our will: they deny
that God doth powerfully worke in us to salvation, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Scripture doth expressely affirme it. <hi>Eph. 1.
19. &amp; 3. 16. 20. 2. For comfort;</hi> for when wee have such a
Keeper as is omnipotent, wee have no cause to feare that any
thing present or to come should ever frustrate our hope, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of our expected salvation. 3. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> to depend
upon that power of God by true faith, as it is in the text.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. These spirituall blessings of God, should never bee
mentioned or thought upon by us, without a pious desire to blesse
God for them.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from that word <hi>Blessed.</hi> So <hi>Eph. 1. 3. 12
2 Cor.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to reprove</hi> that sluggishnesse and Luke-warmnesse
of ours, which is oftentimes so great, that wee are
no otherwise affected when we speak, heare, or thinke of these
things, then when we are talking of common things: yea, we
are scarce so much moved, as we use to be then, when we speak
of any worldly profit, which doth delight us.</p>

wherewith the faithfull are wont to be vexed. 2. From
the nature of that grace, which produceth spirituall joy.
The heavinesse of afflictions is diminished. 1. By the adjunct
of duration, that they are but <hi>for a season.</hi> 2. By the adjunct
of profit, that they bring fruit &amp; utility; and for no other
cause doe they befall them, in these words: <hi>if need be.</hi> 3. By
the singular end and use of afflictions, by which also their
profit is shewed, to wit, that they serve for the triall of their
faith; which triall of faith is set forth by a similie, and that of
a lesser, <hi>the triall of Gold.</hi> 4. By the effect of it, which is <hi>praise,
honour and glory at the appearing of Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The nature of grace he shewes to be such, as that it can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all afflictions: the reason whereof he makes to be this,
because it joynes us with Christ, without the helpe of the
outward senses, and so both against and above sense, it lifts up
the mind to the greatest joy verse 8. of which joy hee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
first the adjuncts of it, <hi>unspeakable and full of glory,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
the cause or argument that moves or stirres up such
joy in the faithfull, to wit, that by their faith they are made
surer of the <hi>salvation of their Souls;</hi> which is the end and scope
of the 9 verse.</p>

                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Ioy and spirituall rejoycing ariseth from the sense
and participation of spirituall grace.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from those words: <hi>Wherein ye reioyce.</hi> For
<hi>exultatio,</hi> rejoycing is a vehement act of joy, as tis intimated
in the end of the 8. verse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> 1. Because it is the nature of joy, for the mind to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62450:8"/>
delight it selfe with the possession of some solid good: now
there is noe good that can be Compared <hi>cum Summo bono.</hi>
with that chiefe good and eternall happines; &amp; this we begin
to have possession of in having possession of saving grace; and
the compleat and full possession of it is laid hold on and made
sure by faith and hope; and hence it is that spirituall joy is
properly the fruit of hope. <hi>Heb. 3. 6. Rom.</hi> 5. 2. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this is so to be understood, as that wee must not
exclude all those from the state of grace, which have not this joy
sometimes; because this joy d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pends upon the sence of grace;
now sometimes they have not the sence of grace, that are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hindered by ignorance, or some grievous temptation,
that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be sensible of that which they have.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to refute</hi> those carnall men, who
suppose the practice of religion to bee full of sadnesse and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinesse,
without any joy or delight; when indeed the joy of
these men is nothing else but madnesse, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2. 2. and is
changed at length into the greatest sorrow: but true and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
joy is the priviledge of all the godly, because they alone
have true cause of joy, and that joy shall never be taken from
them.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>To exhort us</hi> to raise up our mindes to the exercise of
this joy, for thereunto we are called, that we should alwayes
rejoyce in the Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 4. An example hereof we have in
the Eunuch, who went forward in his way with joy, after that
by baptisme he was made sure of the grace of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 39.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Manifold afflictions may well stand with this joy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because although afflictions may makes us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
heavie, yet that heavinesse is not in the highest degree,
that it should wholly possesse and overwhelme our mindes,
but it is mitigated and overcome by spirituall joy.</p>
                     <p>2. Because the afflictions themselves are turned into matter
of joy and rejoycing, <hi>Iames 1. 2. Rom.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us not so much to feare
the afflictions of this world, or at any time so to lye downe
them, as to cast off all our joy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Afflictions are turned into matter of rejoycing,
when there is such use made of them, as that our faith and every
grace is stirred up and increased by them.</p>

                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62450:9"/>
This is gathered from the seventh Verse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because we make great gaine by the triall of
our faith, much more then can be gotten by the triall of gold,
as it is in the Text.</p>
                     <p>2. Because faith by this triall becomes the stronger by
reason of afflictions, and doth more firmely expect praise, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and glory in Christ, as it is in the Text.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to admonish us,</hi> to make it our primary
and chiefest care not to faint in our faith and other graces,
when we are in the midst of afflictions, as those that have but
a temporary faith are wont to do, but to labour to profit by
them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. This joy doth not depend upon the sight or visible
presence of Christ.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from the eighth Verse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because faith and hope is properly of those
things that are not seene, <hi>Rom. 8. 24. Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Now this joy
ariseth from faith and hope, as it is in the Text.</p>
                     <p>2. Because we rejoyce either in the actuall possession, or in
the certainty of the possession of the things we love. Now
Christ having not yet seen we love, as it is in the Text.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to exhort us,</hi> while we live here by
faith, so to walke, rejoyce, and live, as if we did behold Christ
with our eyes: For blessed are all they which have not seen
and yet have beleeved, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 29.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. This joy is unspeakable and full of glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> Because both the thing it selfe wherein we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and the operation of the Spirit in raising our mindes
unto it, is more divine, then can possibly be conceived, much
lesse expressed by us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to admonish us</hi> not to be too curious
in the searching after and declaring of those things that are
unutterable.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>To exhort us</hi> to apply our soules to the sense and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of this grace, because they have a divine and glorious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. By this joy we begin to looke for the end of our

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> Because this spirituall joy is a glorious beginning

                  <p>TO confirme and illustrate the grace and salvation, that
hath hitherto beene spoken of, the Apostle in these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
brings the testimony of the Prophets; which is set
forth, 1. By the principall object thereof, which is nothing
else but this selfesame salvation and grace, wherein the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Christians now stand, in these words: <hi>of which salvation
that should come unto us they prophesied.</hi> 2. By the manner how
they were imployed about this object; They did it with great
care and diligent heed, in these words, <hi>they enquired and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
diligently.</hi> 3. By the singular description of that object
whereabout they were imployed, vers. 11. and the manner
how. The object, to wit, salvation and grace before spoken
of, is described by the efficient cause thereof, namely, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of Christ, consisting of two parts, his humiliation
and exaltation at the end of the verse. And the manner how
the Prophets are said to have been imployed about this cause
of our salvation, consisted in two things: 1. That they did
not only desire to know the very thing it selfe, but also the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moment of time wherein it should be reveal'd, in these
words, <hi>what, or what manner of time.</hi> 2. That it did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62450:10"/>
upon various and uncertaine conjectures, but they did
religiously ask counsell of the Spirit of Christ, that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with them, as of one that did foreknow and could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
of all things that should happen, in these words, <hi>the Spirit
of Christ which was in them, that testified beforehand, did sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The testimony it selfe of the Prophets is proposed in the
12 verse, to wit, that this grace and salvation was to be revealed
at that very time wherein it appeared, and no other: which
testimony of the Prophets is also set forth by the like testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Apostles and Angels. The similitude that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Apostles and the Prophets is shewed herein; that as
the Prophets prophesied of these things by the Spirit of
Christ, that was in them, that foretold it; so the Apostles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the same things <hi>by the holy Ghost sent downe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
The similitude that is betwixt the Angels and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
is shewed herein; that as the Prophets enquired and
searched diligently concerning this salvation; so also the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
did desire to look into it, all and each of which make ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much for the setting forth of this grace.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines drawne from hence are these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct. I.</hi> The chiefe part of the prophesies of all the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
that have beene from the beginning of the world, was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the grace and salvation that should come by Iesus Christ our
Lord and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the tenth Verse. The like you may
see, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 18, 20. and 7. 52.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> I. Because the salvation of the Church in all ages
depended upon Christ: Now it was the office of the Prophets
to direct the Church in the seeking of their salvation.</p>
                  <p>2. All the Prophets were Ministers of Christ, and were led
by his Spirit, Verse 11. and therefore ought to seeke his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>3. Because after this manner were mens mindes to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
by degrees for the receiving of Christ that was to come:
for what is said of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> doth in some sort belong
unto all the Prophets, that they did prepare the wayes of the
Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve for <hi>Information,</hi> to confirme and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62450:10"/>
establish the true faith, not only against the Heathens and
Jewes, but also against the Papists themselves, who say that
this true doctrine of the grace revealed in Jesus Christ, is a
new doctrine, and never heard of before these times; for we
acknowledge no other grace, but that which those Prophets
alwayes prophesied of from the beginning of the world.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> continually to meditate upon this grace
our selves, and as occasion shall serve, to shew it forth unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
with all freenesse and readinesse of minde. for this
doth become us much rather then those, that lived so long
before the comming of Christ, and beheld him only afar off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Those ancient Prophets did not only prophesie of
this grace, but they did also enquire and search diligently into it.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the same words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because it seem'd unto them, as indeed it is, a
very great mystery of godlinesse, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. therefore they
saw that they must use the very utmost of their endeavours, to
come to some measure of the knowledge of that which did
lye hid therein, both for their owne comfort and the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church.</p>
                  <p>2 Because this truth was proposed unto them in a more
obscure manner under types and shadowes so that they could
not look into the thing it selfe without great care and labour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve for <hi>information,</hi> hereby we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what manner of men the true Prophets of God were
heretofore: they did not utter words without sense, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
or care-taking of those things that did lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, as the diabolicall Prophets of the Heathens were
wont to do in their fury: but they did wholly apply their
minds to what they did.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort us</hi> therefore to lay aside all sloth and sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and to use all care and diligence in the enquiring and
searching after these divine things: for this industry is much
more requisite for us, then it was for them, to whom the holy
Ghost did immediately dictate all things.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because the whole mediation of Christ, whereby
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62450:11"/>
our salvation is procured, is contained in those two parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to exhort us,</hi> alwayes to joyne those
two things together, in the seeking of our salvation: for they
are in their owne nature so conjoyned, that if they should be
separated, our faith and hope would be made altogether void.
This is the rock of offence at which the Jewes did, and to this
day do stumble, in that they look for outward glory and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in their Messias, even without any suffering or humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
going before.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort</hi> us alwayes in all things to build upon this

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Not only the essence it selfe of this mystery is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
enquired after by the godly, but even all the circumstances
thereof, as far forth as they may be comprehended.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from those words: <hi>searching what or what
manner of time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because in this mysterie there is nothing of so
small consequence, as that it may be neglected without losse
to our selves.</p>
                  <p>2. Because love is careful to enquire into al things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to the thing beloved, though otherwise they may seeme
to be very small.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to admonish us,</hi> not to think it enough
to have some confused knowledge of the common principles
of the Gospell, but to exercise our selves to come to a more
full and distinct knowledge of every grace of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. All these things were alwayes declared only by
the Spirit of Christ that was in the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the eleventh Verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because as no man knowes the things of man, but
the Spirit of man, so no man knowes the things of Christ, but
the Spirit of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve for <hi>information,</hi> hereby we may
confirme our selves in the truth of Christs divine nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Spirit of God which spake in the Prophets from the
beginning, is here expresly called the Spirit of Christ.</p>

great is our prerogative in this grace above the Prophets, and
those to whom they prophesied before the comming of Christ.</p>

                  <p>2. By reason of the greater efficacy of the holy Ghost, as
it is in the text.</p>
                  <p>3. By reason of the larger communication of this grace,
which is now extended unto all Nations.</p>

                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> that as this grace doth abound, so should

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IN this part of the chapter, there is contein'd an exhortation
to persist and goe forward in the grace of God; which is
the Scope of the whole Epistle, as was shewed before: Now
this duty is described in generall in the 13. verse, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62450:12"/>
is set forth, and pressed by divers arguments in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
following. From the description of the grace before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
there is as it were a conclusion drawne, which is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a necessary connexion and consequence from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that grace, as it was before described; which evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeares by the conjunction <hi>Wherefore;</hi> and that is the
reason why in all the parts of this exhortation, as they
are distinctly propounded, there is a singular respect had to
some part of the description that went before, wherein the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that grace was explained. The duty therefore to
which the Apostle doth exhort, is described. First by the
cause and principall part thereof; which is <hi>a lively hope,</hi>
of which there was mention made before in the third verse.
Secondly, By the singular object of this hope, in beholding
whereof it should be confirmed and strengthned; which
is that grace? that is now in some measure brought unto
the faithfull, but shall hereafter be communicated more
fully and perfectly; in these words: <hi>Hope for that Grace,
which is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</hi>
which part of the description, is taken from the end of the
7. verse. 3. By the adjunct of constancy and perseverance,
which is especially aim'd at in the whole Epistle, as the
chiefe scope thereof; in these words: <hi>hope to the end.</hi> 4. There
is added also the manner and meanes of performing this duty,
when he tells us, that it should be done couragiously and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
with sobriety and watchfulnesse, in these words: <hi>Gird
up the loines of your mind, be sober.</hi> This exhortation is set
forth and pressed by divers arguments; the first of which
is taken from <hi>regeneration</hi> or effectuall calling, whereby
all the faithfull are made the Sonnes of God, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is taken from the 5. verse, where mention is made of the
regeneration of the faithfull, <hi>by the God and Father of our Lord
Iesus Christ:</hi> because by this regeneration or calling, the
faithfull are translated from the state of sin, into the state of
grace: therefore this reason is given in both respects; both
that they should renounce their former sinnes, verse 14. and
that they should conforme themselves to the holinesse of that
calling, wherewith they are called, verse 15. Which is urged
and enforced by a double argument: the first is taken from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62450:13"/>
the likenesse, that ought to be betwixt the person calling and
the persons called, as the Scripture it selfe in the old Test. wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth,
verse 15. 16. The second is taken from the severity
of Gods judgement, which they can by no meanes escape,
that call God their Father, and yet dishonour his name, verse
17. The second argument of the exhortation, is taken from
<hi>redemption,</hi> and the meanes and end thereof, verse 18. 19. Of
which there was mention made before at the end of verse 3.
and verse 11. Because the consideration of this redemption
obtained by Jesus Christ, and of Christ himselfe, is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and effectuall to admonish, and stir up the faithfull, to
take care of their duty: therefore the Apostle stayes a while
upon the description of Christ, as he was from all eternity
fore-ordained to performe the office of a mediatour, at the
beginning of the 20. verse, and as he was manifest in time, verse
20. 21. which is taken from verse 11. 12.</p>
                  <p>The third argument is taken from <hi>sanctification,</hi> as it flowes
from the regeneration of the spirit, and from the word of
God, which are the proper causes thereof, verse 22. 3. 4. 5.
whereby the way that part of Christian duty is commended,
that hath respect to the mutuall love of the faithfull amongst
themselves, verse 22. because all the faithfull by regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are made partakers of the same spirituall life; but yet the
chiefest argument, whereby we are exhorted to constancy in
that and every other grace, is taken from the incorruptible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the word, whereby we are regenerated, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of regeneration it selfe; which is set forth by a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of things that are unlike it. Verse 23, 24, 25.</p>
                  <p>The DOCTRINES arising herence are these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Consideration of the grace of God, that is
brought unto us in Christ, should stir us up to the practice of
Piety.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the connexion, which is intimated
in that particle, <hi>Wherefore,</hi> verse 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because the end of Grace is to free us from sin,
and to make us conformable to the image of God, <hi>Luc.</hi> 1. 74.
75. 2. Because by that meanes it is very fitting for us, to
teach and further us in that practice. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. 12. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62450:13"/>
it cannot be truly learned by us, unlesse it worke this in
us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 20. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to condemme</hi> those that turne the
grace of God into wantonnes <hi>Gal. 5. 13. 2. To exhort</hi> us to use
all care to make this grace effectuall in our hearts, that it may
bring forth great fruits of Piety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The foundation of sound holinesse is firmely to hope
for that grace that shall be revealed at the comming of Iesus
Christ our Lord.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the 13. verse. So <hi>Phil. 3. 20. Tit.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because this hope is the perfection of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our spirituall life doth consist. 2. Because this expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
represents the reward unto us, by contemplating, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we are made unmoveable and abounding in the worke
of the Lord. 1. Cor. 15. 58. Heb. 6. 11. 3. Because this
hope begets patience, whereby with strong consolation it
doth overcome all the difficulties, that are wont to befall men
in the course of Godlinesse. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12. 18. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to exhort</hi> us, to have a care to lay this
foundation very sure in our hearts, and daily to confirme it
more and more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. To keepe this hope firme and lively, we should cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously
gird up our selves that we might be prepared, and ready to
performe all those things that tend thereunto.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from those words: <hi>gird up the loines of your
mind;</hi> for this is it, that is signified by the habit of a man, that
hath his loines girt in Scripture, that he is prepared and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to performe his duty. <hi>Luc.</hi> 12. 35.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because the difficulty to retaine this hope is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great, in so much, that it cannot be kept without earnest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.
2. Because in spirituall duties our loines are too
slack, that is, the sloth of sin, and infirmity hath taken hold of
all our faculties. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to admonish</hi> us, by no meanes to yeeld
to the sloth and sluggishnesse of our corrupt nature, but to
strive against it as much as we can, and laying aside every
weight, and the sloth that doth beset us, to runne the race that
is set before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Sobriety in the use of the things of this life, doth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62450:14"/>
very much conduce to the furtherance of this endeavour.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from this word <hi>Be sober</hi> and hope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> Because the love and immoderate use of the things
of this world, doth so burden the soule, and glue it to the
earth, that it cannot lift up it selfe to seeke after heavenly
things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to admonish us,</hi> not to addict our minds
to any worldly thing, but here to use this world, and not abuse
it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct. V.</hi> The state of adoption, whereby we are made the
sonnes of God, should stir us up to the practise of holinesse.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>As obedient Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because Children should beare the image of
their Father: Now the image of God consists in holinesse
and righteousnesse. 3. Because it is the duty of Children,
readily and of their owne accord to apply themselves to the
will of their Father. Now the will of God is our sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 3. this is it that is intimated in that title,
where the faithfull are called <hi>obedient Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to condemne</hi> those, that with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Jewes say, they are the Children of Abraham and of
God, when notwithstanding, they doe the workes of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
<hi>Iohn 8. 41. 2. 4. 1 Iohn 3. 8. 10. 2. To exhort us,</hi> in all
things to make it appeare, that we are the true sonnes of God,
by obedience unto his will, and our practise of holinesse: for
unlesse we beare the chastisements of the Lord, that by them
we may be made partakers of his holinesse, hereby we shew
that we are bastards, and not true sonnes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 8. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. This filiall obedience, and the fashioning of our selves
a cording to the former lusts of our sins, cannot stand together.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the opposition, that is made betwixt
these two, verse 14. where the one being affirmed, that we
are obedient Children, the other is denyed, that we should not
fashion our selves according to our lusts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because they, which by regeneration are made
the Children of God, are new creatures, have a new nature
and new affections, so that they have wholy renounced their
former nature and affections: and for this very cause they are
called in the Text, <hi>Former lusts,</hi> or, <hi>which were before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62450:14"/>
2. Because the former lusts of sinne do wholly withdraw
us from the will of God, which we ought to obey.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the former lusts of sinne are such, that all that
are come to the knowledge of the truth, may be asham'd of
them; this is intimated in the Text, where they are called
<hi>lusts which were in our ignorance:</hi> because they cannot endure
the light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to condemne</hi> those, that professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the children of God, and call upon God as their Father,
&amp; yet follow the same course of life that the children of this
world do.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> not to conforme our selves to this world,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. where there is a reason also given of this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the 1 Verse, because if we do this we cannot present
our selves to God as a living sacrifice, acceptable unto him.
So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. The calling of the faithfull doth necessarily require
holinesse in them.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from Verse 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because holinesse is one of the chiefe ends of this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lling, therefore it is usually called in the Scriptures a holy
calling, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
                  <p>2. Because God which calleth us is most holy, and he cals
us to have communion with him in holinesse, as it is in the
Text.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the calling it selfe is in its own nature a setting
of a man apart from the common and corrupt use of the
world to a sacred use; and therefore it is a consecration or
dedication of men unto holinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to rebuke and condemne those,</hi> that
seek for nothing by their Christian calling, but justification
and blisse, and in the meane time altogether neglect the care
to live holily.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> in all our conversation to endeavour to be
holy, as it is in the Text; <hi>Be ye holy in all manner of conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
that is, so walke, as it becommeth the calling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ye are called.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. The severity of Gods judgement should stirre us up
to the practise of piety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62450:15"/>This is gathered from Verse 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because God in executing his judgements is no
respecter of persons, as it is in the Text. Now the name and
profession of the faith, is nothing else, but the person of the
Christian; as circumcision and the profession of the law was
the person of the Iew: Such a profession therefore without
sound holinesse cannot stand before Gods Tribunall.</p>
                  <p>2. Because God doth in some sort more severely require
holinesse of those that by their calling draw neere unto God,
&amp; call him Father, as it is in the Text, then he doth of others,
<hi>Levit. 10. 3. I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to admonish us</hi> not to cosen our selves
in relying wholly upon the outward profession of faith, but
to appeare before God alwayes with feare and reverence, as it
is in the Text: because our God is a consuming fire, <hi>Heb.</hi>
12. 29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. The consideration of our redemption should be a
strong argument to stir up in our hearts a desire of holinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because we are redeemed from all our vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
although it be commended unto us by the use and
tradition of our Fathers, Vers. 18. Therefore for a man to
follow such fashions, after that he is come to the knowledge
of redemption, is nothing else, but to oppose himselfe against
his owne redemption, and as much as in him lies, to make
it void and of none effect.</p>
                  <p>2. Because by this redemption we are bought to be the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. &amp; 7. 23. So that we ought no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

owne will and pleasure, but according to the will of God and
our Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the price wherewith we are redeemed, is of so
great worth, that it doth farre surpasse all the most precious
things of this world: therefore there ought to be ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e an
excellent use thereof; and yet notwithstanding only those
that endeavour to be holy, make any esteeme of it. Vers. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to condemne</hi> those that by their life
dishonour Christ, and put their Redeemer to an open shame,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. they doe as it were tread under foot his blood, that
was the price of our redemption, and count it an unholy thing
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29.</p>

2. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> as often as we think of our redemption,
(which we ought to do very oft,) so often should we thinke
that there are as it were coales of fire heaped upon our heads,
wherewith we should be inflamed to this holinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 10. That we may gaine profit and benefit by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of our redemption, we should diligently meditate upon
Christs predestination, his incarnation, humiliation, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from Verse 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because by this meanes alone is the breadth, and
length, and depth, and height of Gods love in Christ made
manifest, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>2. Because by this meanes alone doe we come to know,
what a great worke, and of how great difficulty it was, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
men from their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>3. Because by this also we may easily gather, how fit and
just it is, that we should live unto God and Christ in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
which is the scope of this Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to admonish</hi> us not to passe over this
mysterie slightly in our thoughts and meditations, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in contemplation thereupon, that so we may, as it were,
suck therehence the juice of true godlinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 11. The proper and immediate use of all our contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
upon Christ, and our redemption obtained by him, is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
our faith and hope in God.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from Verse 21, at the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the end of Christs mediation is, that
through him we should believe in God, as it is here affirmed.</p>
                  <p>2. Because Christ left us an example of putting our faith
and hope in God; for he in his way perfectly performed it,
and by that meanes attained the highest glory.</p>
                  <p>3. Because for our sakes and for our good was that glory
given unto Christ, which our faith and hope look and seeke
after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to exhort us,</hi> alwayes to look unto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ the author and finisher of our faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. and

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 12. The calling of the faithfull hath the purification
of the soule joyned with it.</p>

2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. Hence it is that the washing of baptisme repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
that grace which is given in their calling: Now this
purification and washing, which is communicated in their
calling, and signified by baptisme, is not by justification on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which consists in the imputing thereof unto remission of
sinnes, but also by sanctification and the reall clensing of the
soule, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. Tit.</hi> 35. And this sanctification is chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the soule as to its proper object.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because outward purification and sanctification
is nothing worth at all, if it be divided from the inward: for
this was the hypocrisie of the Scribes and Pharisees, that are
said to have made clean the outside of the cup and of the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when within they were full of extortion and excesse,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 15.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the operation of the Spirit begins at the soule,
and from the soule is derived to the outward man: for as all
pollution proceeds first out of the heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 19. so also
purification.</p>
                  <p>3. Because if the soule be once purified within, outward
purity will follow of its owne accord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 26.</p>
                  <p>4. Because this purity doth more properly consist in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
&amp; intention of the soule, then in the outward practise;
for the same outward works may be done by impure men;
but the faithull differ from all impure hypocrites by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
dispositions and affections.</p>
                  <p>5. Because the faithfull themselves are oftentimes sustained
and receive comfort by the purity which they have within in
their will and purpose, though they cannot produce it into

This is gathered from these words: <hi>in obeying the truth
through the Spirit.</hi> Where the word of God, especially of the
Gospell, is called the truth, partly for that excellency of truth
that it hath above all other sayings or writings, and partly
because by vertue of the truth or faithfulnesse of those promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which are contained in the word, this purification is
wrought, together with all those spirituall blessings that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to the consolation and salvation of the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the word together with the Spirit doth
reveale unto us that true purity which is pleasing and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God, whereof we are ignorant.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the word together with the Spirit is the oracle
or power of God unto salvation, and consequently is able to
beget every grace in us.</p>
                  <p>3. Because faith purifies the hearts of the faithfull, <hi>Acts 15.
9.</hi> and faith comes by hearing of the word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to refute</hi> the herefies of those, which
either hold that there is such power in the strength of nature,
that men may sanctifie themselves at their own free will and
pleasure, or, which comes all to one maintaine that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
preaching of the word is sufficient without the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
operation of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> first, to hearken diligently unto the word
of God; secondly, not to rest our selves satisfied in the bare
letter of the word, but alwayes to crave the grace of God and
the operation of his Spirit: thirdly, in the use of the word
through the Spirit to seek the purification of our soules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 14. The effect and signe of a purified soule, is a pure,
sincere, and fervent love of the faithfull, as of brethren.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because hatred, envie, wrath, strife, enmities,

which the soule of the faithfull is purified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. 20.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the purification of our soules makes us to love
purity in others, and no man can take delight in the purity of
others unlesse he be in some measure purified himselfe.</p>
                  <p>3. Because in the mutuall love of the faithfull divers ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62450:17"/>
are exercised, to the performing whereof, their soules
are in a speciall manner purified and sanctified, as doing good,
bearing with infirmities, edification of the Church, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
the name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to condemne</hi> those, that shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
great enemies to godly men: they may rightly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Cainites, for they have gone in the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> with
those to whom the woe is denounced by <hi>Iude,</hi> Verse 12.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort us</hi> by all meanes to endeavour to gaine this
brotherly love of the godly: wherein there is required, First,
sincerity, that it should be without hypocrisie or simulation,
so that it shold not be <hi>in words</hi> or <hi>in shew,</hi> as the Apostle speaks,
but <hi>in heart.</hi> Secondly, that it should be not only from the
heart, but from a pure heart; because there is a kinde of love
that is in some sort sincere, but yet it is impure, whiles that it
doth either neglect the chiefest good or else useth such means
to procure some good as are contrary thereunto: as if a man
to deliver his brother from danger, should perswade him to
deny the truth, or to dissemble. Thirdly, That it should be
fervent, because the affection ought to be set in the highest
degree upon those objects, where there is found to be the
chiefest reason to stirre it up.</p>

is a strong argument to provoke them to love one another.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the end of verse 22. and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the 23. where this reason is given, why they should love
one another, because they are borne againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> Because by this regeneration all the faithfull are
brethren, begotten by the same Father, of the same blood, and
partakers of the same spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to exhort us,</hi> to be mindfull all this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,

that we may upon occasion say as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Gen. 13. 8.
Let there be no strife betweene me and thee; for we are brethren:</hi>
and to admonish others also in those words of <hi>Moses Act. 7.
26. Sirs, Ye are brethren: Why doe ye wrong one another?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 16. The word of God is the incorruptible seed or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of this regeneration.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the 23. verse,</p>

                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because it is the word of God, (as it is in the
Text;) which liveth and abideth for ever; whose nature it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth
in this, that the operation thereof is not momentany
or temporary, but it abideth for ever. 2. Because to speake
properly, it is the word of eternall life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 68. for the
end and use thereof is, to bring men to eternall life. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
where it is once truly received, it never faileth. <hi>Iohn 4.

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to refute</hi> the errour of those, which
hold that they that are truly regenerated, usually fall away
from the grace of God, and so are borne againe and againe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have beene regenerate: This is contrary, not only to
the promise and covenant of God, that he will keepe the
faithfull, that they shall not depart from him <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 40. and
to that comfort which Christ gives his members, that no man
shall pluck them out of his hand, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 28. But also to the
operation of the spirit in the hearts of the faithfull, and to the
nature of the life it selfe, that is communicated unto them,
which is incorruptible and eternall, as it is in the Text.</p>
                  <p>2. To <hi>comfort us</hi> against all those feares and terrours, that
may arise from the consideration of our own infirmities; for
although of our selves we are continually falling to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet there is something borne in us, if we be truly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
which is incorruptible and shall abide unto eternall
life.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>To exhort us</hi> to carry our selves answerable in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
duties, that is, to be constant and incorruptible in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
them: and this is it at which the Apostle doth espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
aime at in this place, when he stirres up the faithfull to
a fervent and constant love one of another, by this argument,
because they are borne againe by the incorruptible word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 17. The condition wherein the faithfull are put by
this incorruptible regeneration of the word, is farre more excellent
then all the glory of this world.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 24, 25. where there is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
made betwixt flesh, grasse, the flower of grasse, and the
glory of man, on the one side, and the word of God on the
other; not as the word is considered in it selfe, but as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the faithfull, and translates them into the kingdome
of God.</p>

                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because as it is in the text, there is nothing in all
the world but vanity, that quickly falleth away: whereas the
word of God endureth for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to exhort us</hi> to make more precious
account of the word of God and of his kingdome, then of all
the world, and that not only in respect of our selves, but of
others also; as the Apostle doth in this place extoll the word
of God and the condition of the regenerate above all the
things of the world, that by this confideration among others
he might move the faithfull to esteeme of others, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
more highly, and to love them more fervently, then
all the things of the world.</p>
                  <p>2. To comfort us, in that God of his bounty and grace hath
advanced us to such a dignity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 18. We ought to have a singular respect unto this
dignity and excellency in the word of God, as it is preached unto
us by the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the 22 verse at the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the same word of God is preached unto
us, that is so much commended by the Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and by Christ himselfe, as it is in the Text, <hi>this is that
word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Because it makes much unto our salvation, as it is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to admonish us,</hi> not to satisfie our selves
with some generall esteeme of the word, as many are wont to
doe, that are weary of the word that is preached unto them,
and loathing it do reject it; but religiously and reverently to
receive the word that is preached unto us, as the eternall word
of God.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He same exhortation that the Apostle had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proposed, he doth here againe repeat
and presse, and that not simply and barely,
but by that principle and meanes, whereof
there may and ought to be very good use
made. For by occasion of those things, which
he had lately spoken of the word of God, he stirres up all the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62450:19"/>
faithfull to the right use of this word, by whose helpe they
might persist and grow in that grace, wherein they stood.
The occasion and connexion of this exhortation with the
words going before is intimated in that phrase or particle,
<hi>Wherefore.</hi> The exhortation it selfe is to a desire or love of the
word of God, which he had before commended, verse 2.
Which exhortation he doth so lay downe, that in the first
place he shewes, that the vices which are contrary to this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
must be laid aside, and taken heed of which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e five: <hi>malice,
guile, hypocrisies, envies, evill-speakings,</hi> verse 1. And in the
second place he gives reasons agreeable thereunto, to stirre us
up unto this duty, (to wit, a desire of the word.) The first
reason is taken, from the use or effect of this word in respect
of them, that it makes much for the edification of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
and this Use is allegorically set forth, verse 2 where the
regenerate faithfull are compared to infants newly borne, and
the word to sincere milke; and the edification which is made
by the word, is compared to that action, which infants ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
by the use of wholesome milk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. The second reason is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
by a continuation of the same allegory, from the object
of the word, which he proposed to be tasted, and that is God
himselfe and our Saviour Jesus Christ: whose perfection and
fitnesse for edification is declared. Verse 3 where he is said to
be <hi>gracious:</hi> and is confirmed also by the experience and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of all the faithfull, who are said to have <hi>tasted</hi> this
graciousnesse, <hi>ibid. if so be yee have tasted that the Lord is
gracious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the explication of this affection that ought to be set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Lord Jesus Christ, as the primary object of this word,
the Apostle continues from Verse 4 to the 11. Where in the
first place the affection and duty it selfe of comming unto
Christ, and adhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing unto him by faith, is proposed, verse 4.
<hi>To whom comming.</hi> And then the reason of this duty is allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically
declared to wit, that Christ is the foundation of the
spirituall building that liveth for ever. <hi>Ibid. as unto a living
stone;</hi> and the faithfull are the parts of the building, or of the
spirituall house that is to be built upon this foundation, at
the beginning of verse 5. And he doth further illustrate both
parts of this reason. The first, concerning the foundation or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62450:19"/>
subject, he doth declare by divers arguments; when he saith
that it was disallowed of men, but yet chosen of God, and
precious, verse 4. The second, concerning the parts of the
building that are joyned to it, he doth illustrate &amp; urge from
the effects, which are allegorically also set forth, to wit, that
by this comming unto Christ, as unto the foundation, the
faithfull are not only made a spirituall house, as the temple
wherein sacrifices acceptable to God are offered up, but they
shall also be the Priests that shall offer up spirituall sacrifices,
acceptable to God through Iesus Christ, verse 5. This that
hath beene spoken of the saving effect of Christ, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
which redounds unto all the faithfull, the Apostle doth
confirme by the testimony of Scripture, verse 6. Which testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
he doth explaine and apply by the contrary affections
and manners, how contrary sorts of men carry themselves
towards Christ, that is, the believers, and the unbelievers: To
the believers Christ is said to be precious, verse 7. at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
because they put their whole trust and confidence in
Christ, and consequently give him the honour of the true
Messias and Saviour: but to the unbelievers he is a stone of
stumbling, and a rock of offence, verse 7, 8. Because being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at his humility they do not receive him as their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:
whose infidelity he doth illustrate by the antecedent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God, whereby it was ordained, verse 8. at the end.
<hi>Whereunto also they are appointed.</hi> As on the contrary the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the faithfull is illustrated. First, by the secret electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, that was the cause thereof, verse 9. at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Secondly, by the dignity which they obtaine by faith
by vertue of this election, to wit, that they are <hi>a royall Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
an holy nation, Gods peculiar people.</hi> Thirdly, by the end
and use of this dignity to which they are called, which is, to
shew forth the praise of God, verse 9. at the end. Fourthly,
by comparing the state that is unlike it, wherein they were
before their calling, to this state of excellency and dignity
whereinto they are now put by their calling unto faith in
Christ, verse 10.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising from hence are these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The right use of the word of God is the proper
meanes to increase grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62450:20"/>
This is gathered from the connexion of this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with that which went before. For when the Apostle
had before exhorted to constancy in grace, and to obedience,
in holinesse, and to brotherly love; by a reason also taken
in the last place from the worde of God, whereby as of
incorruptible seed all the faithfull are regenerated, here in
the beginning of this Chapter. he commends unto us
the right use of that word, as the proper and only meanes
to perfect all those things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because the word is the instrument chosen by
God and sanctified to that use. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. 2. Because the
word, especially of the Gospell, is the ministration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
who is the authour and sinisher of every grace. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
6. 8. 3. Because the word shewes us the good and perfect
will of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
                  <p>4. Because it furnisheth a man unto every good worke.
2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to refute</hi> some fanatick hereticks,
that neglect the word of God and looke for immediate reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and dreame of a greater perfection then is contained
in the word.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> to give diligent heed unto the word of
God in all things, untill we come to the end of perfection in
heaven. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. If we meane to use the word of God aright, wee
must have our minds ready and willing to lay aside all those vices
that are contrary to the power of the word.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the 1. verse. Where five remarkea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vices are propounded, to be laid aside, denyed, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
before the word can have its due effect in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because as the matter, if it be not fitly prepared,
cannot receive the forme; neither can the field, if it be not
manured, cherish the seed to bring forth fruit: So neither
can the heart of man, if it be not subdued by repentance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the word of God with profit. 2. Because such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to forsake all that is contrary to the word of God, is the
first beginning of that saving operation, which the word of
God doth make, wheresoever it begins to be received, and
whereby it makes way for it selfe, to perfect all operations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62450:20"/>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to condemne</hi> those, that will be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of the word of God, but so, that they will not forsake
their accustomed sinnes. 2. <hi>To admonish us,</hi> not to take this
thought and purpose into our minds in the generall, and once
only at our first conversion; but upon all occasions, seriously
to renew this purpose, especially when we prepare our selves
to heare the word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. We must lay aside these vices not in part only, but
wholly.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the word, <hi>all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because repentance is not true and unfained, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it abhor the very nature of sinne; it must with one
and the same kind of hatred hate all kind of sinne. 2. Because
a man may easily deceive himselfe, whiles he thinks that he
hath said aside some vice, if he doth not detest all appearance
of it, what Specious shew soever it may seeme to have.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to instruct</hi> us, seriously to examine our
hearts, least through some deceitfulnesse thereof, there should
lurke some vice, whereof we thinke our selves to be free.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. We should have a singular care to lay aside those
vices, that are contrary to those duties, to which we are in a speciall
manner called; and to that disposition, which is especially required
in Christians, that they may profit by the word of God.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered herence, that the Apostle, when in the
last place, he had exhorted unto unfained love of the brethren
at the 21. verse of the former Chapter, doth here marke out
those vices, that are most of all contrary to this love; &amp; when
he would commend the simplicitie of infants, as a disposition
requisite to receive the word of God with profit, he casts aside
those vices which are directly opposed to that simplicity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. To make a good use of the word, besides the laying
aside of those evill affections, that we speake of before, it is required
that we should stirre up that good affection in our hearts, which is
called appetite or desire.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the 2. verse. Now this desire is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in other places of the Scripture, by a spirituall hunger
and thirst. <hi>Isai. 55. 1. Apoc.</hi> 21. 6. And the degree thereof is
set downe, that it should be the highest. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 20. 81. 82.
Which containes in it, 1. a high esteeme of Gods word. <hi>Psal.</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:62450:21"/>
119 2. 2. An earnest endeavour, answerable thereunto, to
use it and enjoy it. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 27. 3. A delight, whereby we
are well pleased in the sweetnesse thereof, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 103.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because the word is absolutely necessary for us;
without it we cannot live; for it is our milk or spirituall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ood,
as it is in the text, 2. Because we alwayes want something
that may begotten: this is also signified in the text, when we
are called new borne babes; whereby it is intimated that our
imperfection is so great, that by reason o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it, we should ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desire the helpe of the word. 3. Because the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and perfection of the word is so great, that it should of it
selfe delight us, though we stood in no need of it our selves;
this is also intimated in the text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when there is mention made
of the sincerity of the word, and of the goodnesse of God that
appeares therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne that satiety and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the word, that appeares too evidently in too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To admonish us,</hi> not to suffer our affections to be taken up
with the things of this world, thereby to lessen that desire,
which we should have to the word of God. 3. <hi>To exhort us,</hi>
to use the utmost of our endeavours to stir up and increase
these pious affections in our selve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. This affection and desire that wee ought to have
to Gods word, should have respect to the sincerity thereof.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from that, <hi>desire the sincere milke of the word:</hi>
that is, the nature it selfe of the word and of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
therein, as they are pure, and affoord nourishment fit
for our Soules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because otherwise we doe not desire the word, as
it is the word of life, or the bread of life, or the milke of life,
as it is in the text, but as we doe apprehend it under some car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
shew. 2. Because this desire alone proceeds from spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
life, which seekes after that in the word that tends unto
life, which is intimated also in the text by the similitude of
infants, that naturally desire their mothers milke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to reprove those</hi> ministers that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifie
the word of God by their owne mixtures and devices, and
obtrude upon him an adulterate word, in stead of the simple
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62450:21"/>
and sincere word. 2. <hi>To admonish</hi> the hearers not to suffer
their affections to be carried either towards the person of the
speaker, or towards the manner of his speaking, much lesse
towards those strange forgings which many use in their spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
but sincerely to seeke for the sincerity of the word.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> highly to prize this sincerity of the word,
and to endeavour all that we can to preserve it as well in our
selves as in the Church.</p>

of God aright, when we grow thereby.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>that ye may grow thereby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is signified in all those places of Scripture, where the

those that doe yet want some thing, and doe desire to increase
that which they have. 4. <hi>To instruct us,</hi> to examine our selves

and goodnesse of God, that it stirres up all the faithfull, to an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire thereof.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the 3. verse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>that the Lord is gracious:</hi>
Where by <hi>God</hi> we are to understand Christ, as it appeares by

that grace which is revealed in the Gospell, as it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because this glorious grace of God, whch brings
salvation unto men by Christ, is the subject matter and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>2. Because God bestowes this grace upon us, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unworthy of it, enemies to him, and seeking no such

to admire the riches and bounty of Christs grace, that
is revealed in the Gospell. 3. To exhort us, earnestly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
to take delight, and to rejoyce in hearing and meditating
upon Gods word. <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 4. &amp; 65 4. &amp; 119. 103. in this
respect is the use of the word of the Gospell compared to the
banquet of a King, wherein all things are full of Sweetnesse
and delight. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 16. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. This goodnesse of Christ in the Gospell is proposed
to us to be tasted.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>If so be ye have tasted.
So Psal. 34. 8. Taste and see.</hi> That is, we should so lay hold
upon it by faith, that we may have an inward sense, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the vertue and power thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because in the Gospell, we are called to such a
neere union and communion with Christ, that he is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us our spirituall bread and food, So to be tasted and eaten
by faith, that he turnes to our spirituall nourishment. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our comfort depends upon this, if wee perceive in our
selves the savour of Christ, as it were the savour of life unto
life. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. 16. 3. Because the power of Christ in
drawing our soules unto himselfe, for the most part consists
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62450:22"/>
in this, that we have his goodnesse and love, to be tasted, as it
were, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to reprove those,</hi> that doe not use the
word of God, as food to be tasted and eaten, but for custome
and <hi>pro forma</hi> fashion-sake only, or at least account it a thing
to be understood and disputed of only; but not to be tasted.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> to use all care and diligence to preserve this
taste of the goodnesse of Christ in the Gospell; for this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the regenerate, as it appeares in the text: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it is a signe of salvation. Some indeed that are not
regenerate are said to taste of the heavenly gift, of the good
word of God, and the powers of the world to come, <hi>Heb. 6. 4,
5.</hi> but this comes to passe, first, by some speciall operation of
Gods Spirit, whereby such men are enlightned above the
common sort of unregenerate men. Secondly, this is but for
a little while, it is not constantly. Thirdly, in the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it is but a sudden motion of the minde, it is not a rooted
affection. Fourthly, it is either of grace only to come, which
is apprehended also, but by a humane and uncertaine hope; or
else it is a presumption without ground: but the taste of the
faithfull is of grace, not only to come, but also present, with a
divine assurance wrought by the operation of the holy Ghost,
and sound faith and repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 10. The regenerate in the beginning; although they
be truly faithfull, yet they have but a little taste of Gods goodnesse,
they do not fully comprehend it.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the same words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> 1. Because they are new borne babes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
weake.</p>
                  <p>2. Because God useth to bring his children by degrees un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
perfection; so that at first they do perceive but a part or the
first fruits of his goodnesse, and afterwards they have the
whole, as it were shed abroad in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>3. Because in the beginning they want that experience,
whereby the goodnesse of God afterwards is made more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
knowne unto them.</p>
                  <p>4. Because oftentimes they are also somewhat negligent;
whereby it comes to passe, that they do not use the meanes of
grace with that affection as they ought, as it is intimated in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62450:23"/>
text, when they are stirred up to a more fervent desire of the
word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>for consolation</hi> against those feares
that arise sometimes in the soules of the godly, for that they
have but a little measure of peace joy, and the like fruits of the
Spirit, whereby men perceive the goodnesse of God towards
them: for they must understand that the faithfull do usually
perceive but a little measure of this grace at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>2. For exhortation, so much the more to long for the state
of perfection, and not to rest in these small beginnings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 11. That taste of the grace of God which we either
now have, or formerly had, should stirre us up to desire and seeke
after the same more and more.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the connexion of these words with
those that went before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because to that end is there a taste of this grace
given, to stirre up the appetite.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the goodnesse of God it selfe is in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
and vili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied, if it be neglected, after it hath beene once
tasted: &amp; therefore in this respect they sinne more grievously,
who when they have tasted this grace of God, do little esteem
of it, then they, who out of ignorance make no reckoning of
it at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove those that have left their
first love, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> in meditating upon the goodnesse of God
in Christ, and from the sense and experience that God hath
given us of it heretofore, to inflame our mindes with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire to have a fuller measure of this grace, and to that
purpose religiously to use all meanes, whereby it is usually
communicated unto men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 12. The primary duty of Christians, whereby it is
also that they are made Christians, is to come unto Christ.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered out of the fourth verse. Now to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, is nothing else but to believe in him. So <hi>Iohn 6. 35.
He that comes unto me,</hi> and <hi>he that beleeves in me,</hi> are made all
one. So <hi>Iohn 5. 40. To come unto Christ, to receive Christ, and
to believe in him,</hi> are one and the same. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. We
are said to draw neere by an assurance of faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:62450:23"/>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because our salvation depends upon that union
which we have with Christ: whence it is also, that we are
said to come unto Christ, that we may have life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 40.</p>
                  <p>2. Because by nature we are strangers and far remote from
Christ, and salvation obtained by him, yea and after that we
are called unto Christ, we are not so perfectly conjoyned.</p>
                  <p>3. Because all Christian piety is nothing else, but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
and renovation of this accesse unto Christ, and by
Christ unto God. In the hearing of the word we come unto
Christ, as our Teacher; in our prayers we come unto him as
our advocate; in the administration of the Lord Supper we
come unto him as the Authour of a Kingly mariage feast, Mat.
22. And all other duties do so depend upon these, that looke
how we approve our selves in these, such must we needs be in
the others also.</p>
                  <p>4. Because Christ cals and invites us especially unto this, to
come unto him, Matth. 11. 28. John 7. 37.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to convince all those of death and of
sinne, that have either no knowledge of Christ at all, or doe
not endeavour according to that knowledge which they have,
to come unto him, and partake of his grace.</p>
                  <p>2. To refute the Papists and such like, that draw men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from Christ to the holy Angels, to the Pope, and to
themselves.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us, alwayes to set Christ before us, as our
marke and scope, <hi>Phil. 3. 8. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 13. We must come unto Christ as unto a living stone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is gathered from Verse 4. Now Christ is called <hi>a stone</hi>
for that firme power, whereby he doth sustaine and beare up
the edifice of the whole Church Zach. 4. 7. And he is called,
<hi>a living stone,</hi> because that power whereby he doth beare up
the Church is quickning, and communicates spirituall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life to the whole edifice, John 5. 26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because by sinne we were bereft of all life both
the principle and foundation of life, nor can it be restored
unto us any other way but in Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. Because unlesse we come unto Christ under this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we do not imbrace him as he was ordained by God, and is
proposed unto us; and consequently we do not hold the true
Christ, but a feined and imaginary one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62450:24"/>
3. Because our faith cannot rest satisfied but in him that
hath this strong power to quicken, for faith seekes life from
a firme and undeceiving principle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute that blasphemy of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
who will have the Pope, a dead stone, to be that rock or
stone, whereupon the Church is built. For <hi>Peter,</hi> under the
pretence of whose name the Pope challengeth this to himselfe
never exhorted the faithfull to come to him as unto a living
stone, but unto Christ only. And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe in
these words explaines unto us, what was the minde of Christ,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. when he said: <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
will build my Church,</hi> that is, upon this living stone whom <hi>Peter</hi>
at that time confessed to be the Son of the living God, that is,
the living stone. Now <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apostles together with
the Prophets may be called the foundation of the Church by
a Metonymy of the adjunct for the subject; because they laid
and preached Christ as the true foundation, <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s.</hi> 2. 20, 21.
but the Popes can in no other respect challenge this unto
themselves, but as they are stones of offence and ruine.</p>
                  <p>2. To instruct us, wholly to depend upon Christ, and to
put all our confidence in him.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us, with all joy and rejoycing to helpe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the building of the Church upon Christ, shouting and
crying out, as it is in the Prophet <hi>Zachary, Grace, grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 14. Christ is refused by men, when they will not
come unto him as unto a living stone.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the fourth Verse. So <hi>Psalme 118.
22.</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 34.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because he hath not that outward Majestie and
pompe wherewith naturall men are taken, <hi>Isay 53. 3. 1 Cor.</hi> 1.
22, 23.</p>
                  <p>2. Because men by nature are blinde, so that they cannot
perceive their owne misery <hi>extra Christum,</hi> out of Christ, nor
that salvation which is offered in Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>3. Because they too much love themselves, and put trust
in themselves, so that they cannot endure that doctrine of
Christ, whereby they are called to deny and forsake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to put their confidence in Christ alone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:62450:24"/>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to informe us, that we should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
nothing to the world in those things which belong
unto Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, not to trouble our mindes, for that the
world is averse from Christ and true faith.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us, patiently to beare it, if we be refused and
scorned by men; for the servant is not greater then his
Master.</p>
                  <p>4. To instruct us to beware that we do not communicate
in the least respect with the world in refusing of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 15. Christ was chosen and ordained by God, that he
should be exceeding precious unto us.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the fourth verse. Now we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this so, as that we comprehend both the predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ, and the sending of him into the world, and his
unction, together with all those testimonies, which were given
by God unto this mysterie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the love and mercy of God is so great
towards us: for so God loved the world, that he gave his
Sonne, &amp;c. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>2. Because in the obedience of Christ God is well pleased,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>3. Because Christ hath perfected and finished all those
things, which belong to our salvation and the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to enforme us,</hi> that we ought to be
assured of this, that howsoever the world opposeth it selfe
against Christ, yet Christ shall prevaile and raigne for ever,
because he is chosen of God.</p>
                  <p>2. To comfort all the faithfull, that beleeve and put their
confidence in Christ, because they beleeve in him that was
chosen of God, to save them.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us, in all our practise throughout the whole
course of our lives, to make it appeare, that Christ is more
precious to us, then all the things in the world, <hi>Phil. 3. 8.
Prov.</hi> 8. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 16. The faithfull are living members of the same
building, whereof Christ is the foundation.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the beginning of the 5. verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because Christ together with all the faithfull
makes one mysticall body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62450:25"/>
2. Because being compacted in this body, they partake of
the very life of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                  <p>3. Because they shew forth this life or power in bringing
forth fruits answerable thereunto, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 5, 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to comfort us,</hi> when we rightly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
of the dignity of this condition, it will strengthen our
mindes against all the troubles that can befall us therein.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, so to carry our selves as it becommeth
those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are called to partake of the life of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 17. By that union which all the faithfull have with
Christ, they are made spirituall temples, Priests, and sacrifices ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the 5 verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because God is in an especiall manner present
with them, and dwels in them by his Spirit and grace, as in
his Temple, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
                  <p>2. Because By the same spirit he makes them fit and ready
to performe those duties, that are more acceptable unto him,
then were ever any externall sacrifices, <hi>Psalme 51. 18, 19. Heb.</hi>
13. 16.</p>
                  <p>3. Because in performing these duties before God they do
offer and dedicate themselves wholly unto God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, to have a care ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
not to defile the Temple of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16, 17.
that our Priesthood doth not dishonour God, and that our
Sacrifices be not lame, and maimed, and such as are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
unto God.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to addict our selves wholly to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and his worship; for God will be sanctified in those that
draw neere him, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 3.</p>
                  <p>3. To refute the Papists, that rob Christians of this honour,
and obtrude carnall Temples, priesthoods, and sacrifices up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God and men in stead of spirituall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 18. Those duties which we performe in Christ are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
unto God by Christ.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the 5 verse, at the end. But they are
acceptable not as merits, but as sacrifices of praise and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
as it is intimated in the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because by Christ our persons are reconciled
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62450:25"/>
unto God, and received into the number of those whom God
approves, and by whom he delights to be worshipped.</p>
                  <p>2. Because Christ covers our infirmities.</p>
                  <p>3. Because by his intercession our duties are commended
unto God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to comfort us, even when we looke
upon our owne infirmities, and the unworthinesse of all our
performances.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to go cheerefully about the duties of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because our worke shall not be in vaine in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. 58.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 19. The same Christ was after the same manner a
Saviour in the Old Testament, as he is in the New.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the sixth Verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because he was a Lambe slaine from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

acceptance of God, and according to the faith and hope of
the godly, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the Catholick Church is but one, consisting of

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute those, that make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

of the Church.</p>
                  <p>That is, he doth conjoyne, uphold and direct all the parts

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because he is the beginning or foundation of the
Church.</p>
                  <p>2. Because he unites those people that were before farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Jewes and Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>3. Because he is the rule or line of direction in all the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. For the dignity of his person.</p>

our salvation.</p>

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, to have no common
conceit of Christ, or to rest in a vulgar esteeme of him, but
earnestly to endeavour to conceive of him so, as his dignity

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because Christ was appointed by God by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and immutable decree to be the Saviour of all those that
beleeve in him.</p>
                  <p>2. Because all power is given unto him both in heaven and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to comfort us against those feares and

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 23. The faithfull are not only delivered from misery,
but are also highly honoured by Christ.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the seventh verse at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because they are made partakers of Christs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
for in him they are made sonnes of God, heires of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove our blindnesse and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that cannot discerne and esteeme of this honour as wee
ought, but are set upon the honours of this world more then
is fitting.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, piously and seriously to glory in Christ
and the honour which we have in him, though for his sake
the wicked world reproach us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62450:26"/>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 24. As Christ is unto the unbeleevers honour and
salvation, so he is unto the unbeleevers confusion and perdition.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered out of the seventh Verse, <hi>Psal. 118. 22. Isay
8. 14. Matth.</hi> 21. 42.</p>
                  <p>But this similitude doth not hold in all things. For first,
the proper end of Christ our Saviour was to save man, not to
destroy him. Secondly, Christ is the cause of faith in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
but he is not the cause of unbeliefe in the unbeleevers,
though something of Christ may be the occasion of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe;
like as his humiliation was both unto the Iewes and
many of the Gentiles. Thirdly, Christ merited salvation for
the believers, and not they themselves; but the unbelievers
merit their owne perdition, and not Christ: but yet Christ
is truly said to be confusion and perdition to the unbelievers,
1 As they take offence at him, and so runne headlong into
their owne destruction. 2. As he doth justly punish their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and impiety, as he is the just Iudge of all the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because those unbelievers to whom Christ is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
in contemning his goodnesse, doe directly as it were
provoke him to use the greatest severity upon them.</p>
                  <p>2. Because by this meanes alone is the glory of God and
of Christ preserved, when his enemies are put under his feet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us to beware of all infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, when we compare our beliefe with the
misery of unbelievers, to learne to be thankfull unto God and
to give him the glory of it in Iesus Christ: for these ends is
this amplification made in the text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 25. Men come unto this confusion and perdition by
stumbling at the Doctrine of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the 8 Verse. Now men stumble at
the word of the Gospell, when they apprehend the Gospell
to be such, that they owe no assent and subject on thereunto:
so the Iewes were offended at the infirmity of Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. and the Greekes at the foolishnesse of that
word which bringeth salvation, <hi>Ibid.</hi> For the Iewes, like as
the Papists, with many others, are offended, for that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
requires them to deny their owne righteousnesse and
workes, and to seeke to be justified by Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 32.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62450:27"/>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because this offence is the cause of their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it doth not produce a bare unbeliefe only, but
unbeliefe with contempt, so that they doe infinitely wrong
Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, to beware that we doe
not in any thing stumble at the word of God, or conceive any
thing in our mindes, whereby we may be in the least respect
alienated from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 26. The infidelity and confusion of the wicked doth
not fall out by chance, but according as God had most certainly
fore-ordained it.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>whereunto also they are
appointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because God is both the King and Lord of all
living creatures, so that nothing can happen unto them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his will.</p>
                  <p>2. Because there can be no cause of their infidelity imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which God did not foresee, or which he could not have
hindred.</p>
                  <p>3. Because we also which do believe, were aliens from the
faith as well as they; neither did we make that difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our selves and them, but God:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to direct us, that the infidelity of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whatsoever, may not deface our faith, we must give God
the glory in the dispensation of his grace, and appointing of
things according to his counsell, whose wayes are past find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 27. We should often call to mind that dignity, whereunto
we are called in Christ, and that, by comparing of it to that misery
wherein all unbelievers are plunged.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from that repetition, Verse 9. which is
used comparatively by the dissimilitude that is betwixt it and
the condition of unbelievers, before described, as it is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in that word <hi>But.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because we are called to spirituall joy, which is
chiefely increased by this meanes.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it belongs to the thanks which we ought to give
unto God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:62450:27"/>
3. Because it makes us cheerefull in the performing of all
duties, that we may be worthy of so excellent a calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to make this contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
familiar unto us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 28. The end of our calling, is to shew forth the praises
of God, that hath called us.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the ninth verse, that is, that we should
render unto God the glory which hee hath shewed unto us.
1. In the inward thoughts and affections of our heart. 2. In
the outward profession of words. 3. In our actions through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole conversation of our lives. This is to sanctifie
God, <hi>Isay</hi> 8. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because this is that glory which may redound
unto God from us, or from our calling.</p>
                  <p>2. Because our calling it selfe tends thereunto, that we
should turne unto God, seeke God, glorifie God.</p>
                  <p>3. Because this is very profitable for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute those, that take care of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lesse: they shew that they are not yet partakers of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
calling.</p>
                  <p>2. To stirre us up more and more to fulfill this duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 29. That state into which we are translated by our
calling, is a state of marvellous light.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the 9 Verse at the end, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 8. Now
it is called <hi>light,</hi> both for the illumination of the mind, which
it brings; and for the comfort of heart, which we receive
thereby: and it is called <hi>marvellous,</hi> because it farre surpasseth
all worldly knowledge, and whatsoever the naturall man can
conceive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to us, to carry our selves answerable
to this light, and to walke in it, not according to the common
fashion, but marvellously.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 30. It is very profitable for us alwayes to compare our
present happy condition, with the misery that is past.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the tenth verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because <hi>contraria juxta se positamagis eluces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt,</hi>
contraries being put one by another, make each other to

                  <p>2. Because it tends to our humiliation.</p>

                  <p>HEre the Apostle doth in generall exhort to lead such a
life as is answerable to that happy condition, which
was spoken of before: Now this life consists of two parts:
The one is abstinence from evill, <hi>abstaine from fleshly lusts;</hi> the
other is, to follow that which is good, <hi>having your conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
honest.</hi> The first of which he doth perswade them unto
by an argument taken 1. From the disagreement that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Godly, and the fleshly lusts of this world in respect
of their state and condition, because in this world, they are
strangers and Pilgrims, and therefore they ought not to set
their hearts and desires upon this world, but upon another.
2. From the danger that hangs over them, from the desires of
this world, because they tend to the destruction of their
soules, in these words, <hi>which warre against the Soul.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part together with the former, he doth perswade them
unto, by an argument taken from those witnesses which they
ought to have regard of in their conversation; <hi>among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
by whose testimony hee shewes there will a twofold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
arise from their honest conversation.</p>
                  <p>1. That they will cease to speake against them as evill doers.</p>
                  <p>2. That in beholding their good workes, they will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give them an honest testimony, but they will also glorifie
God for them; which benefit is shewed by the adjunct of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62450:28"/>
time, wherein it should be expected, to wit, <hi>in the day of visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi>
Now this whole exhortation, that it might be the
more effectuall, and the more acceptable unto them, is set
forth with a double affection, in the manner of proposing it;
of love or charity, in that title which is given unto them,
<hi>Dearely beloved;</hi> and of humility, in that he doth not so
much command these things, as intreat them, <hi>I beseech you.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to direct us,</hi> alwayes to thinke upon
our spirituall warfare, and accordingly in all things to carry
our selves, as it becommeth the good Souldiers of Christ.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>To admonish us,</hi> to take speciall heed of those enemies
which we have within our selves; those enemies that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
can doe us no hurt, if those that are within have not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
over us, and so doe as it were give us up into their hands.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because all filthynesse proceeds from the lusts of
the flesh.</p>
                     <p>2. Because the true honour and honesty of a man consists
in that spirituall victory which he hath over himselfe.</p>
                     <p>3. Because by overcomming the lusts of the flesh, the way
is made easie to all vertues and good duties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to refute and reprove</hi> those men, that

the lusts thereof.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>To exhort us,</hi> cheerfully to oppose our selves against the

                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The faithfull should have a care to live honestly, not only
amongst the faithfull, but also amongst the unbeleeving Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from these words, <hi>among the Gentiles;</hi>
Which notwithstanding we must so understand, that we doe
not follow all those things that seeme honest unto them, nor
omit those things that doe displease them; but only that we
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62450:29"/>
shew forth a true evidence of our piety, love and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in our conversation.</p>
                     <p>Then againe, that thereby their consciences may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that the way, which we goe, is in that respect at least
praise-worthy, and to be approved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> This we ought to doe. 1. For Gods sake and his
glory.</p>
                     <p>2. For our owne sakes and our owne comfort.</p>
                     <p>3. For the unbeleevers sake, to draw them unto true piety.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to refute and reprove</hi> those, that under
colour of contemning fame, contemne vertue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. It is the property of unbeleevers, to seeke occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to speake against the faithfull, as if they were wicked.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from the 12. verse, at the beginning. Now
there are two kinds of such obloquies. 1. When they speake
all manner of evill for Christs sake, for faith and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
sake, cap. 4. v. 14. Math. 5. 11. 2. When they find some
occasion in the defects of the faithfull, and observe something
in their lives, which they may justly taxe. This also admits
of a two fold difference; for sometimes such is the impiety of
those that professe the true faith, that it gives scandall to the
unbeleevers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24. and sometimes they take occasion
from the infirmities that are incident to the faithfull, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
their profession.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because there is an inveterate enmity betwixt the
children of the light, and the children of darknesse.</p>
                     <p>2. Because in this respect men flatter themselves, and in
some sort seeme better and happier, when they make others,
that would seeme better, either to be like themselves, or worse
then themselves.</p>
                     <p>3. Because by this meanes they seeme to bring some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
against the very doctrine of piety, which the wicked
hate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to admonish us,</hi> 1. To take speciall
heed, that we have no communion with unbeleevers, in this
maliciousnesse, that is, that we doe not willingly seeke or take
occasion to speake against the Godly; for this is a certaine
marke of impiety.</p>
                     <p>2. To beware also, that we give no occasion to the wicked,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62450:30"/>
either to speake against our persons or our professions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct, 7:</hi> Good workes alone doe stop the mouthes of the
wicked.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from the 12. v: at the middle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because men, especially unbeleevers, cannot
judge of us, but by the works which they see.</p>
                     <p>2. Because the sincerity of our religion properly appeares
in our works.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to exhort us,</hi> alwayes to endeavour to
bring forth good works.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. The good works of the faithfull make others also
to glorifie God.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from the 12. v. at the end. So <hi>M.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because by this meanes they are convinced of the
truth of our religion, whose author is God.</p>
                     <p>2. Because thereby they are drawne also to embrace the
same religion, and to cleave unto God.</p>
                     <p>3. Because they are moved and stirred up to give God
thanks, for those things that were the meanes of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to exhort us,</hi> to use this argument to
stir up our selves to the practise of good works, because they
make not only for our owne salvation, but for the glory of
God also.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. We must looke for a day of visitation, that men
may glorifie God therein.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from the 12. v. at the end. But the day of
visitation may be understood either <hi>in judgement,</hi> or <hi>in grace
and mercy.</hi> Here it is to be understood of the grace of God.
So <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 68.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> Because without grace there is no inclination in the
heart of man to glorifie God. The tree must be good, that
shall bring forth good fruit, Men doe not gather grapes of
thornes, or figges of thistles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 16. 17.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to admonish us,</hi> to use all patience and
meeknesse towards the wicked, alwayes provided, that we doe
not faile in our duty to seeke their conversion. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25.</p>

                  <p>IN these words the Apostle sheweth that particular part of
obedience, which did in a speciall manner pertaine to the
honesty of the faithfull among the Gentiles, that is, subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Magistrates, which some at that time did begin to
cast off, as not agreeing with Christian liberty. Now this
subjection he doth. 1. Generally command and direct us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
to performe it for religion sake towards God, v. 13. 2. By
a distribution of the object, to wit, that we ought to performe
it, not only to the King and the supreme Magistrate, but also
to the governours that are sent by him. v. 13. 14. 3. He doth
perswade us thereunto, 1. From the end of this ordinance,
to wit, that it is to represse and punish the evill doers, and to
preserve and cherish the good v. 14. at the end. 2. From the
efficient cause, or command of God, v. 15. 3. From the end
and benefit of performing this subjection, to wit, to stop the
mouthes of the enemies, who are described by their ignorance
and their foolishnesse, v. 15. 4. He removes an objection
that might be made against it, about Christian liberty. v. 16.
Where he distinguisheth betwixt faigned liberty, which is
joyned with maliciousnesse; and true liberty, that makes
men to be addicted unto the service of God: Now that this
subjection to superiours belongs to the service of God, he
shewes v. 17. by a short repetition of those precepts, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to this and the like duties.</p>
                  <p>Here a Question may be made.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Why is the Magistracy called an ordinance of
man v. 13. seeing all powers are ordained of God, and every
power is the ordinance of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The superiority of power, or government it selfe is
simply and absolutely commanded by God, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is called the ordinance of God; but this or that speciall
manner of power or government is not determined by God,
but by men; and is therefore called <hi>an ordinance of men,</hi> which
as touching the nature of it, may also be called <hi>an ordinance of
God:</hi> And this is the difference betwixt an Ecclesiasticall and
a civill office. An Ecclesiasticall office is not legitimate, if it
be not directly determined by God himselfe, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

is this, because God and Christ alone hath dominion
and power in spirituall matters; but in civill matters men are
also Gods, though not absolute.</p>

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>HEre the Apostle makes a speciall exhortation about the
duty of servants to their masters: and this duty he doth
1. As it were define by a speciall kind of subjection wherein it
consists. <hi>Be subject with all feare.</hi> 2. He doth illustrate it by
a distribution of the object, or the masters, to whom this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is due; <hi>not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
3. He proves that this subjection is to be made to both
sorts, by an argument taken from the adjuncts thereof, grace
and glory, that is, Gods praising and approving of it, which
accompanies the subjection that is made unto wicked masters
verse 19. <hi>For this</hi> is <hi>thank-worthy.</hi> The reason of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62450:32"/>
is set forth. 1. By a description of that subjection
which is due unto wicked Masters, to wit, that it is <hi>a patient
suffering of wrong for conscience towards God</hi> v. 19. 2. By a
comparison that is made betwixt those that suffer justly, and
those that suffer unjustly, which he shewes to be unlike, in
that the former can looke for no glory from their sufferings,
but the latter may expect great glory, <hi>verse</hi> 20. In the second
place, he proves the same duty from that relation which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from our generall calling, because we are thereunto cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that we should patiently suffer the injuries of the world:
and this he confirmes by the example of Christ; to whose
imitation we are called: for he shewes two ends of the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Christ; one was to dye for us, that is, to expiate our
sinnes, which is the primary end. The other was, to leave us
an example to imitate. <hi>verse</hi> 21. which is the secondary
end. Now a speciall part of this secondary end was, that
when he was without sinne <hi>v.</hi> 22. Yet he patiently suffered
all kinds of reproach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s and afflictions, <hi>v.</hi> 23. And the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
end of Christs sufferings, which was to redeeme us from
sin, is upon this occasion also declared <hi>v.</hi> 24. 25. Because
therehence also may be drawne a powerfull argument, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us to imitate Christ in doing righteously, and suffering
unjustly: And this is declared, 1. From the nature of
Christs death, that it was a sacrifice for our sins to take away
the guilt of them; 2. From the end of this propitiation,
which is the death of sinne, and the life of righteousnesse. And
hereof there is an illustration made by comparing that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which went before our conversion, with that condition
which followes it, <hi>verse</hi> the last.</p>

their good workes glorifie God in that condition.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because servants also are called to liberty and
glory in Christ, neither is there any difference, as touching
life spirituall, betwixt the freeman and the servant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:62450:33"/>
2. Because there is the same reward for servants and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>3. Because the servile condition hath a proper occasion
and meanes to glorifie God, which other conditions have not,
like as other conditions have their occasions &amp; meanes, which
the servile hath not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to comfort us, in regard that no man
is excluded from having a part in this honour, that hath a part
in advancing the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>2. To exhort all, both servants and all other sorts of men,
to endeavour to promote Gods glory: for if servants ought to
do this; much more ought free masters, and those that are in
any place of dignity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Servants, to the end that they may glorifie God in
their servile condition, must be subject to their Masters with all
feare.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because subjection to another mans will is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
that wherein service consists; and therefore all they that
are bound as servants, are bound to subjection.</p>
                     <p>2. Because the subjection of a servant is such, that it doth
necessarily command a feare to displease, not only in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
because in every duty, both towards God and man, we
should feare to offend by doing amisse, but also in respect of
that singular power, which masters have to punish their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
This is that feare, which we usually call servile, which
is not to be disliked in servants, though in the children of
God there be another feare required over and above, which
ariseth from love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish, first, Servants and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
not to separate feare from subjection. Secondly, all men
to subject themselves to God with all feare, as it becommeth
servants.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>This is gathered from the 18 Verse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the ground of our duty doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in the goodnesse or naughtinesse of men, but in that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
which the law of God imposeth upon us, which may
consist with the naughtinesse of men.</p>

                     <p>

                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. We ought to doe our duty for conscience toward
God, though we are wrongfully afflicted by men.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from Verse 19.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because conscience alwayes lookes to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God and not to the qualities and judgements of men.</p>
                     <p>2. Because the conscience is by this meanes constant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable,
and alwayes like it selfe, howsoever mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may alter.</p>
                     <p>

God, if we suffer wrongfully, and not justly.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from the 19 and 20 verses.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> 1. Because this is proper and peculiar to Christians,
as is the love of our enemies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44, 45.</p>
                     <p>2. Because by this meanes we give great glory unto God,
when we suffer the bitterest things out of conscience toward
him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, cheerefully to set our

                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. The calling of Christians doth in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
lead to the patient suffering of afflictions.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from the 21 verse, at the beginning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they are called unto glory by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
of all kindes of afflictions, as by the way that leadeth
thereunto, cap. 5. verse 10.</p>
                     <p>2. Because they are called to overcome their enemies and
evill doers by well-doing, and if it be possible to winne them
thereby, <hi>Matth. 5. 44. Rom.</hi> 12. 21.</p>
                     <p>3. Because they are called to imitate Christ, as it is in the
text.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, not to imitate or
follow the men of the world in these things, because we have
another manner of calling.</p>

2. To exhort us to have a great care that we make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of this duty, because it doth most neerely belong to our

                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. Christs actions are a most perfect example for our

                     <p>This is gathered from Verse 21.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because Christ is unto us an example given by
God, as it were the <hi>praxis</hi> of Divinity and rule of living well.</p>
                     <p>2. Because he hath no imperfection at all, such as may be
found in all mens examples.</p>
                     <p>3. Because the Spirit of Christ makes us to be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto his image.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to direct us, that beholding Christ as it
were in a glasse, we may be as it were changed into the same

                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. The Chiefest manner of imitating Christ in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
afflictions, consists in this, that we commit our cause unto
God.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from verse 23, at the end.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> Because this is the rule of patience in such cases,
not to revenge our selves, but to commit the whole businesse
unto the Lord, and to rest well contented and pleased in his
will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, never to please our own
carnall will, but to subject our selves wholly to the good will
of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. Christ by his death did not only leave us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of our lives, but also expiated our sinnes, and procured for us
such power, whereby we may imitate him in living well.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from verse 24.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because after the same manner are we restored in
Christ, as we were lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> which was not by imitation
and example only, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>2. Because Christ ought to be a sacrifice to pacifie God
towards us, which is not done by example.</p>
                     <p>3. Because an example would have nothing at all profited
those that were dead in sinne and hated of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute the Socinians and others,
which feine that the redemption of Christ consists in doctrine
and example only.</p>

2. To direct us, alwayes to joyne these two together, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 10. Without Christ we are nothing else but sheepe
going astray and lost.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> Because upon him alone depends our salvation and

The second is chastity of conversation, in the same verse. The

same kinde of duty in all these in all respects, but that there is
the same kinde of obligation, whereby every one is bound to
doe his owne duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because it is the same Law-giver and the same
law that commands every man his duty.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the disparity of the condition makes no dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the obligation, which is the formality of the duty; but
only in those things, to which the obligation binds us, which
is the materiality of the duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, not to cast off from
our selves those things which we either reade or heare to be
commanded men of another condition, but alwayes to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that <hi>quamvis non ad similia, tamen similiter,</hi> though we are
not tyed to the like duties, yet we are in the like manner tyed
to our own duties: when servants are commanded any thing,
then masters should think, that they likewise are commanded
something; when wives are commanded any thing, then hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
should think that they likewise; and when husbands
are commanded any thing, then wives should think, that they
likewise.</p>

                  <p>This is gathered from verse 1. See <hi>Colos. 3. 18. Ephes.</hi> 5. 22,
23, 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the husband is the head of the wife,
<hi>Ephes. 5. 23. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 3.</p>
                  <p>2. Because there can be no order kept in a family, except all
therest be subject to the father of the family.</p>

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to reprove those wives that are undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
and will not be subject; and those husbands also, who
by their owne fault lose this authority and dignity, and are
themselves the causes that their owne power is lessened and
diminished.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. The conversation of wives should be such, that it
should winne their husbands to approve of the true religion.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because all should, as much as they can, co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with God for the conversion of men.</p>
                  <p>2. Because this generall Christian duty is in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
determined and intended in respect of those, with whom
we have a neerer communion.</p>
                  <p>3. Because love, which doth in a singular manner belong to
man and wife, requires that they should desire and seek for one
anothers greatest good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to reprove those, which in wedlock so
live, that they have no care at all, either to advance Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or to further their own salvation, in that state: and they
are to be condemned much more, which so carry themselves
in that state, that they doe more and more alienate their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
from true religion and piety either touching the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or touching the practise of it. And if this belongs to
wives toward their husbands, much more will it belong to
husbands toward their wives.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because not only is impurity to be shunned, but
also all suspicion of impurity, or of a minde inclining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish man and wife, to shun
all those courses, that may any way be any blemish to their

                  <p>2. To admonish all Christians, to preserve their spirituall

thae we should make account of.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the outward adorning belongs to the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62450:36"/>
vanity of this world, but the inward is spirituall life it selfe.
For Christ and grace is called the inward adorning of the
heart or minde, because it makes a man amiable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
him in the sight of those which esteeme and prize it.</p>
                  <p>2. Because only men look after the outward adorning, and
and those none of the graver sort neither; but God himselfe
lookes after the inward, as it is in verse 4.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the outward adorning is not durable, but the
inward is incorruptible, as it is in verse 4. <hi>which is not corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,</hi>
and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, every day more and
more to renounce this outward and worldly adorning, and to
looke to the inward and true adorning of the mind and soule.</p>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. Meekenesse and mildenesse of spirit in women, as in
all others also, is an adorning that is precious in the sight of God.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because many filthy unbeseeming things, which
arise from anger and perturbation of the minde, are removed
by such a disposition.</p>
                  <p>2. Because such a disposition is very apt to please, and all
men desire that others should be well pleased with their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve to refute those, which affect a kind
of glory and honour by their fiercenesse and impatiency.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, not only for civility sake, but also for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

regard to those that are most commended in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from those words, <hi>Abraham, Sara, and the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. Then and not before are we the children of such
holy ones, by a true imitation of them, when we do so persist in well
doing, that no terrour or any other temptation is able to remove us
from this our purpose and resolution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:62450:37"/>
This is gathered from the 6. verse at the end. For this is
proposed in <hi>Sara</hi> to be chiefly imitated by women, that out
of her duty, she followed <hi>Abraham</hi> in all his journey, nor

as the wives doe theirs.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because there is the same obligation of Gods
law on both sides.</p>
                  <p>2. Because there is a mutuall relation betwixt these duties,
that one doth necessarily require the other.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the duty of husbands to their wives, and of
wives to their husbands is almost the same, but that the wife
is to doe her part with subjection, and it is the husbands part
to rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to admonish us,</hi> not rigidly to exact the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 11. It belongs unto men to excell in knowledge and

                  <p>This is gathered from those words: <hi>according to knowledge.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because by nature they have a kind of perfection
above women in those things which belong unto know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
whereupon the woman is in this place called the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
vessell.</p>
                  <p>2. Because by their duty they should be the heads of their
wives, to direct and governe them.</p>
                  <p>3. Because they have greater meanes to gaine knowledge;
for as it is not lawfull for women to speake in the Church;
so neither have they any thing to doe in other exercises,
whereby mens wits are ripened.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to reprove</hi> those men, that either
through drunkennesse, or sloth, or the neglect of divine
things, or through too much care of earthly things, doe not
only come behind women, but children also in sound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and understanding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 12. It is the husbands part to be meeke unto their
wives, and not to put them in feare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because they are not servants, but companions.</p>

                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:62450:37"/>
2. Because their conjugall love should shew it selfe in all
such duties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to admonish</hi> as well husbands as wives

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 13. That duty which we owe unto all the coheires of
grace and life eternall, should direct and governe our particular
duties towards our superiours, inferiours and equalls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because that is the principall duty; to which all
the rest are subordinate.</p>
                  <p>2. Because that love doth vertually at least containe in it all
vertues.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the dignity which redounds from the relation
to grace and eternall life, makes all those that are partakers of
that grace, in some sort equall, and therefore restraines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
opposition, and all kinds of injuries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to direct us,</hi> in all parts of our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 14. All our conversation, as well in publique as in
private, should be so ordered, that it should not hinder, but rather
further our Prayers.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the last words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because otherwise we should wrong God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
in violating his honour.</p>
                  <p>2. Because we should diminish at least our greatest comfort,

                  <p>THe Apostle doth in these two verses briefely comprehend
those duties, which belong unto all sorts of men. For
because it would be too long particularly to describe all the
particular vertues, nor can there be such a doctrine delivered,
that should direct * every particular man in his duty, * <hi>singules
quà singulos,</hi> as such a particular man, as before it was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
touching masters and servants, wives and husbands, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he doth here commend some generall duties unto all,
from which all particular ones will easily follow. And the
first of these is Concord. 2. Mutuall sympathy. 3. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
love. 4. Pitty. 5. Courteousnesse. 6. Christian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
whereby we doe not only forbeare to curse those that
curse us, but also blesse them; of which last duty, as being the
difficultest of all, he gives a speciall reason, which is taken from
the end of our calling, whereby we come to the possession of
all blessings, and as much as in us lyes, ought we to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because God hath endued all those, that are truly
faithfull, with one and the same Spirit, and therefore with
one heart as it were. For they have received a new heart of
one and the same making and nature.</p>
                     <p>2. Because they propose unto themselves one and the same
end, and they should goe one and the same way unto that end.</p>
                     <p>3. Because if there be any difference in other things, which
doe not belong unto that way, they are not so great, as that
they should cause any discord: For there may be some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of opinions in many things without any discord or
alienation of mens minds. And if there be some difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
those things, which doe belong unto that way, a bearing
one with another, when they doe both earnestly desire the
truth, will preserve concord safe and sound betwixt those

are estranged from their brethren, and turne the smallest dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
even the least controversie into discord. And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are guilty of this fault, and how closely it sticks unto them,
may evidently appeare by this, that they cannot lay aside their
anger and hatred, no not for Gods sake, for Christ sake, and
their owne salvation sake. And this we may see in too too
many, when they forbeare to come to the Lords Supper by
reason of those contentions, which they maintaine betwixt
themselves and their neighbours; for they doe thereby shew
that they cannot pray unto God to forgive them their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes,

not loose the bond, or take away the duty of our loue.</p>

                  <p>IN these three verses, the Apostle proves by the testimony of
Scripture, that which he had spoken in the last place, to
wit, that Godly men shall inherit a blessing. In which testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
there is in the first place the blessing set downe, which
all desire, <hi>He that will love life, and see good dayes.</hi> 2. The pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of those, to whom this blessing is promised, is synecdochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
declared by a distribution of the subjects, as it is in the
speech, v. 10. or in the deeds and conversation of life v. 11.</p>
                  <p>3. The connexion of the blessing, with this piety is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the most powerfull cause thereof, namely, the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, watching over the Godly for their good, verse
12. at the beginning. Which is illustrated by a contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the same providence toward those that doe evill, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he watcheth over those alwayes for evills, v. 12. at the
end.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because * <hi>omnia appetunt bonum,</hi> all things desire their

<hi>summum bonum,</hi> the chiefest good.</p>
                     <p>2. Because all nature tends unto its owne perfection, and
this perfection is happinesse.</p>

but in some measure desire it, because it is in all respects
desireable.</p>

and to increase in our selves the true, genuine and effectuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
thereof.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>For direction,</hi> not to corrupt this desire that is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because God hath promised it to the Godly alone.</p>

namely, peace of conscience and sound consolation, which is
a great part of happinesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to convince</hi> those of folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

                  <p>THat which the Apostle had before proposed concerning
the practise of piety, he doth there perswade them unto
by an argument taken, 1. from the effect thereof, that by this
meanes men are freed and delivered from those harmes, which
the wicked seek occasion to bring upon them, v. 13. 2. From
the happinesse adjoyned, because no afflictions that are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for righteousnesse and godlinesse sake, are able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that, verse 14. at the beginning. 3. He shewes the right
manner of undergoing afflictions, so that happinesse may
follow thereupon, which consists 1. in the laying aside of
that feare and perturbation, which usually mens mindes are
troubled with in their afflictions, in these words, <hi>be not afraid
of their terrour.</hi> 2. In that confidence and relyance of our
hearts upon God, whereby his name is sanctified, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
whereof that immoderate feare may be laid aside. And
this confidence is set forth by its proper effect, which consists
in couragious and ready confession of the faith; of which
confession he sets downe two properties, namely, <hi>meekenesse</hi>
and <hi>feare</hi> or <hi>reverence,</hi> and moreover he shewes the helping
and preserving cause thereof, namely, a good conscience, and
the effect also which it will worke in others, verse 16. to wit,
that it will make their enemies with shame to leave off their
speaking evill of them.</p>
                  <p>But here-hence ariseth a question.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer</hi> 1. Because the nature of godlinesse and goodnesse
tends thereunto, to winne the minds of all men, and to take
off all ill-will.</p>
                  <p>2. Because often times also it hath this effect, that taking
away all pretence and occasion of unrighteousnesse, it doth
in some measure mollifie the enemies minds, except they be
quite and cleane savage and furiously mad.</p>

                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they are called to the imitation of Gods

                  <p>2. Because there are begotten again unto the image of God,

we give unto him that glory, which is due unto his name
from our hearts.</p>
                  <p>3. Because thereby we advance his glory amongst others,

                  <p>

unto religion, but of the very substance of faith, hope, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as it is in the text: <hi>a reason of the hope that is in you:</hi>
nor is it either a naturall reason that is required, or such a
kinde of reason that may stop the mouths of every gainsayer;
for this all are not able to do, nor doth it belong unto all; but
some sure ground out of Gods word, whereupon our faith

to give it to Dogs and Swine, (that is, to uncleane persons)
without a necessary cause, but to every one that asketh us, so
that our profession or answer may probably at least turn to the
glory of God, as it is in the text, <hi>to sanctifie God.</hi>

sanctification of Gods name, as in the profession of his religion.</p>
                  <p>That is, a conscience bearing us witnesse, both of the grace

                  <p>IN this part of the chapter, the Apostle urgeth that exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which he had before proposed concerning an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to do well, even unto those that wrong us. And this he
doth perswade them unto, 1, by a comparison which he
makes betwixt those which suffer for evill doing: which
comparison although it may seeme to be of a greater or lesser
good, when it is said, <hi>It is better to suffer for well doing,</hi> yet it
is indeed a dissimilitude, which is intimated by this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation,
as appeares by the 19 and 20 verse of the second
chapter. For it is thank-worthy and it will turne to our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
if we suffer for well-doing; not so, if it be for evill doing.
2. He confirmes this by the example of Christ, verse 18. who
though he did most justly, yet suffered unjustly; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
he shewes to be of great force, by the end of his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
because therefore he suffered, that he might bring us
the same way unto God: which that he doth now effectually
doe, he shewes by the cause thereof, to wit, life and glory,
which he assumed unto himselfe by his divine Spirit after his
suffering. And to shew that that effect, namely, the bringing
of men unto God, doth proceed from this cause, to wit, the
Spirit of Christ, the Apostle makes a comparison of the like,
betwixt those things which the Spirit of Christ did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> and those things which he doth
now since the comming of Christ in the flesh. Heretofore he
preached the way of salvation, and patiently waited for the
performance of obedience, upon the disobedient he inflicted
condigne punishment, and a few that were obedient he saved
in the Arke: so now also he preacheth the way of salvation,
he waits for obedience, and by Baptisme, as it were a figure
like unto the old Arke, he saves those that are obedient and
have a good conscience before God, and that by the glorious
life and power which he hath in heaven since the time of his
resurrection, verse 21, 22. All which things rend hereunto,
that we should hold fast a good conscience, even when we are
evill intreated; because it is better as he said before, verse 17.
and hath now shewed as well by the example of Christ, as by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62450:44"/>
his effectuall dispensation throughout all ages, as it is, vers. 18,
19. of which we may sue more, if we look back to chap. 2. ver.
21. to the end. All the other things almost are explained in
the answer to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> about Christs descending into hell.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising here-hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It was the Spirit of Christ, which preached here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
from the beginning of the world by the Prophets and men of
God, before that he appeared in the flesh.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the person of Christ was the same from
everlasting in the unity of the Divine Essence, so that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Spirit of God did, that also may the Spirit of Christ
be truly said to have done.</p>
                  <p>2. Because Christ was the Mediator of mankinde from the
beginning of the world, in vertue and force: therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Spirit did, which belonged to the furtherance of
the Churches safety, all that he did by vertue of Christs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation,
and that no lesse then since his comming in the flesh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to instruct us in the truth of Christs
divine nature.</p>
                  <p>2. To comfort us and strengthen our faith, in that we have
the same Teacher, which instructed the Church from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world, and brought it to salvation; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
we imbrace the same religion, as touching the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it, that all the faithfull imbraced from the beginning
of the world.</p>
                  <p>3. To admonish us, never to reject or make light account
of those things which are preached unto us out of Gods
word, because it is the Spirit of Christ, which preacheth unto
us those things, like as he preached unto others from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because in neglecting the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
they neglect and refuse the only meanes that can keepe
them from damnation, and bring them unto salvation.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they doe greatly dishonour Christ and his

eares and hearts, ready and willing to yeeld all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
thereunto.</p>

the disobedient.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because by this meanes Gods clemency and
mercy is manifested.</p>
                  <p>2. Because by this patience of God all are invited, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are drawne unto the obedience of faith.</p>
                  <p>3. Because this patience makes those that are stubbornely
disobedient altogether inexcusable, and so justifies God in his
just judgements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to direct us, to give the glory of
this patience unto God, when we see sinners to go unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
for a time.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us not to abuse this patience of God, but
to make it a meanes for the amendment of our lives, and our
own salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. In the destruction of the disobedient, God hath a
speciall eye over the faithfull; to save them from the destruction.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because he disposeth his judgements according
to his certaine and perfect counsell, not rashly or confusedly,
therefore he passeth over whom he pleaseth.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the punishments of sinne should not fall alike
upon the godly and wicked, for then he would not be a just
disposer of them.</p>
                  <p>3. Because it stands upon Gods glory to save those that flye
unto him, as he promised them in his covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to comfort us, in the time of publick
calamities, wherein God revengeth the wickednesse of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. God doth often times preserve those that are his,
partly by the same meanes wherby he destroyeth others.</p>
                  <p>For it is said that the Arke saved <hi>Noah</hi> and those seven souls
in the waters and by the waters. The same water that drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
others, by lifting up the Arke on high, was the meanes of
their preservation. So <hi>Ieremy</hi> was delivered by the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
by whom the Iewes were oppressed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:62450:45"/>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because God can use the same instrument to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
divers and contrary effects, and when he doth this, his
glory is the more manifested; because thereby it appeares that
the effect doth not depend upon the instrument, but upon
God: nor doth this come to passe rashly, or by chance, but is
ordered and directed by Gods certaine counsell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to direct us, in the time of danger not
to looke so much upon the meanes which God useth, as to
depend upon God himselfe, who can turne any meanes unto
the good of those that are his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. Baptisme is such a meanes of our spirituall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
as the water of the flood together with the Arke,
was heretofore of the corporall safety of Noah and his family.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is gathered from verse</hi> 21. It is called the Antitype
of that water, not because the water was the type of Baptisme,
and Baptisme the exemplar of it, but because there is a typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
representative similitude betwixt these two waters. And
the similitude consists herein, that as the water of the flood
lifted up the Arke and saved <hi>Noah</hi> and his family in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the rest, so baptisme strengthning our faith, and
lifting up our soules unto God reconciled in Christ, saves us
in the mortification of our sinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because it is Gods institution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove those, which make little
esteeme of baptisme.</p>
                  <p>2. To direct us, to seeke this right and proper use of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
together with it and by it, and to apply it unto our
selves to our comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. The outward baptisme doth not save us of it selfe,
but the inward.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 21. Not the putting away of
the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because outward baptisme is common to the
hypocrites as well as to the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it comes not unto the soule.</p>
                  <p>3. Because it hath no saving power in it selfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, not to put too much
trust and confidence in the outward Sacraments, or to relye
thereupon, that we are baptized and partake of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62450:45"/>
but alwayes to seeke the spirituall grace of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. A singular effect and signe of the inward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
and effectuall grace, is the answer of a good conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God.</p>
                  <p>For when the Apostle meant to oppose inward Baptisme
unto outward, in steed of the inward he puts the answer of a
good conscience, as the proper effect thereof, by which it
may be perceived and knowne. Now by the answer of a good
conscience is meant all that confidence which we have before
God of his reconciliation, which chiefely appeares in our
prayers, and in a pious confession of the faith, and a holy care
of obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because then are we properly said to be saved, at
least according to our apprehension, when our consciences
are freed from the guilt and bondage of sin.</p>

his glory and power in heaven.</p>

was mightily humbled, should afterwards be exalted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
great glory.</p>
                  <p>3. Because this glory and power is necessarily required,

                     </gap>ehence that
which he proposed to be concluded <hi>chap.</hi> 3. v. 17.
and before that v. 11. that is, that all Christians
should eschew evill, &amp; follow that which is good.
And this conclusion he layes downe in such manner, that if a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62450:46"/>
due proportion be observed betwixt Christ as our example,
and Christians that are regenerated, and renewed according
to his image, he shews it doth necessarily depend upon &amp; flow
from the example of Christ. He concludes with such a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme
as this:</p>
                  <list type="syllogism">
                     <item>All Christians should be armed with the same mind, concerning
sinne and righteousnesse, as Christ himselfe was:</item>
                     <item>But Christ having suffered in the flesh ceased from sinne, and
lived in the spirit unto God:</item>
                     <item>Therefore all Christians should be wholy bent, and endeavour all
that they can to cease from sinne or the lusts of men, and live
unto God, or the will of God.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Both the proposition &amp; Assumptionare in v. 1. The conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in v. 2. The conclusion is illustrated by a comparison made
betwixt the time past, and that which is to come; or betwixt
that kind of life, which men are wont to lead before their
calling, and that, which they should lead after they are called.</p>
                  <p>For the time past he affirmes, that we lived according to the
manner of the Gentiles in all the lusts of the flesh, v. 3. And for
the time to come, he denies that we should follow those lusts,
but that we should live unto the will of God. v. 2. and the
beginning of the 3. <hi>It may suffice us &amp;c.</hi> where he intimates
a reason also, why we should now leave off such courses,
namely; Because we have too much offended God already in
the time past, and if we should abuse his mercy and patience
any longer, we could expect nothing else but the revelation of
his just anger and indignation, to our eternall confusion.
The same conclusion and Comparison is farther illustrated by
anticipation of an obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ction and difficulty, which might take
off our desires and endeavours to change our lives, and live
contrary to the fashion of others. And the objection is this;
that it will seeme strange unto many; and for this very cause
will they revile us, and speake evill of religion it selfe, verse
4. The answer is, that this is not our fault, but theirs; and
they shall give an account for it unto God at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
verse 5. Which judgement is set forth by a distribution
of the object, and upon occasion of that distribution he makes
a new argument to remove the fore-named difficulty out of
our minds; namely, because the Gospell had the same end, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62450:47"/>
the same effect amongst the faithfull that are now dead; to
wit, that they being condemned by men, did patiently beare
that condemnation, and lived according to God in the
spirit, verse 6.</p>

comes to passe, that the unregenerate speake evill of the truth of
God.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from verse 5 at the end. For although

blasphemies, then in most of the other sinnes.</p>
                     <p>2. Because those sinnes are most hainous, and come neerest
to the sinne against the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>3. Because they directly tend to the hinderance of the
kingdome of God, and the righteousnesse thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, to take heed of all
those, that do any way partake in such a sinne.</p>
                     <p>2. To comfort us: because God revengeth such injuries,
we should commit themunto him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. God keepes a just account of those things that are
done to the faithfull, not only while they live, but also after their
death.</p>
                     <p>For in that sense is he said to be <hi>ready to judge the quick
and the dead,</hi> where by the quick and the dead the faithfull are
most properly understood, as appeares by verse 6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because God alwayes lives, and his word and
covenant lives.</p>
                     <p>2. Because it stands upon Gods glory, to defend the cause
also of his servants that are dead, and to revenge their injuries.</p>

                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:62450:49"/>
3. Because oftentimes the iniquity of the wicked is not
come to its full measure, before the death of Gods children
whom they have vexed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to comfort us, as well in life as in
death.</p>
                     <p>2. To admonish us not to judge rashly of Gods wayes in
his patience and long-suffering; but to compose our mindes
to a patient waiting for the wished event.</p>

of those that lived heretofore in all ages, is wholly alike, as touching
the substance of it.</p>

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>FRom the last discourse about the judgement of God, the
Apostle takes occasion to presse his exhortation to the
duties of piety, by that very argument. First therefore he
layes downe that third argument for a ground, that the last
judgement, the end of all things, is at hand; and thereupon
concludes that we must seriously and diligently apply our
selves to the duties of piety. And these duties he sets downe
by an induction of the principall parts, 1 Prayer, with the
adjuncts and helping causes thereof, to wit, temperance and
fobriety, verse 7. 2. Mutuall charity, verse 8. which he sets
forth, 1. By the singular care, wherewith we should labour
for it above other vertues, in these words: <hi>above all things,</hi> and
then by the degree, wherein we should have it, and exercise it
in this word, <hi>fervent:</hi> of which exhortation he gives a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
also from the effect, <hi>for charity covers a multitude of sinnes.</hi>
3. To charity he joynes hospitality, verse 9. as it were a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
act of charity, whereof he shewes the due manner how it
should be used, that it should be <hi>without grudging,</hi> that is, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
not by constraint. 4. A mutuall communication of
all the gifts of God, verse 10. And the reason of this duty is
taken partly from the nature of the gift in respect of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62450:50"/>
thereof, that it is the grace of God, and partly from that
relation, which they that have received the gift, have unto
such a grace, to wit, that they are not masters, but stewards of
it. And of this communication he propounds two chiefe
kinds, which he describes and perswades them unto, verse 11.
The first is communication in speech, or in the word of God,
the description and rule whereof is, that it should be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the nature of Gods word. The second is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in our abilities and wealth, the description and rule
whereof is common to both, together with all the foregoing
exhortations, taken from the end and benefit of them, <hi>that
God in all things may be glorified;</hi> which glorification of God
is set forth by a present declaration of it; <hi>to whom be praise
for ever and ever, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrines drawne here-hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The end of all things is at hand.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 7. Now this may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
1. of the end of all men, that live together, because a
generation of men soone passeth away, and so the end of all
those is properly said to be at hand. 2. It may also by the
same reason be understood of the finall condition of all those:
because looke how every one dyes, so shall he continue for
ever, either happy or wretched. 3. It may also in some sort
be understood of the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because these are the last ages, after which there
is no comming of Christ to be expected; but unto judgement,
nor any change of worship, but upon the consummation of
all things.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the Lord doth not delay the promise of his
comming, but prepares all things for himselfe, and in their
order shewes forth the judgements of that day which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, not to think with the
evill servant that the comming of the Lord is farre off, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to look for it, and accordingly to prepare our selves
for that day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 44. 46.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. For the preparing of our selves aright against the
comming of the Lord, it is chiefly required, that we should pray
continually.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:62450:50"/>
This is gathered from verse 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because in our prayers we do stirre up our faith,
hope, and desire touching those good things, which the Lord
will impart unto us at his comming.</p>
                  <p>2. Because by our prayers we do turne aside and remove
those evils from our selves, which make his comming dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
unto sinners: for by flying unto Gods mercy, we do flye
both from our sinnes, and from his wrath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to be diligent in prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Temperance and sobriety should be joyned with our
prayers.</p>
                  <p>This is also gathered from verse 7. It is the same which is
said every where, <hi>Watch and pray.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the effectuall consideration thereof, that
the end of all things is at hand, makes us to love this world
the lesse, and so to use it, as not to abuse it, that is, soberly
and temperately, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31.</p>
                  <p>2. Because these are the meanes whereby our prayers are
helped and furthered; therefore it is said in the text, <hi>Be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and watch unto prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to make conscience of
doing our duty in prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Above all things we should labour for brotherly
love, that it may be sincere and fervent.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 8. Not that charity towards
men is more excellent then faith hope and love towards God,
but because it is the chiefest of those things which belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men, and should be preferred before all those things, which
might any way hinder it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because love is the summe of the whole law, and
so containes in it all other duties.</p>
                  <p>2. Because charity covers a multitude of sinnes, as it is in
the text: <hi>amongst men themselves, that they stirre not up anger,
hatred, and contention, Prov.</hi> 10. 12.</p>
                  <p>2. Because charity also doth in some sort cover a multitude
of our sinnes before God, to wit, that they procure not the
revenge of his anger. For this it doth, as a signe and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby we are the more assured of the forgivenesse of
our sins, because we forgive others their offences, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:62450:51"/>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to labour for charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Hospitality is one of the principall acts of charity.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 9. So <hi>Rom. 12. 13. Heb.</hi> 13. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because in hospitality we do not only commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
our goods unto our brethren, but our selves also by a
fami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iar conversation.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it is more acceptable unto others to receive a
little upon such an occasion, then in any other respect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
much, because the seasonablenesse and courteousnesse
makes that which is given to be the better accepted.</p>
                  <p>3. Because by this meanes friendship is more increased then
by other bountifull expences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to reprove the mercilesse mindes and
conditions of men, for luxury and coverousnesse hath quite
taken away all hospitality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. The duties of this kind should be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
grudging.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because God loveth a ready and cheerefull gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7.</p>
                  <p>2. Because grudging makes the benefit unacceptable to
him that receives it.</p>
                  <p>3. Because grudging is as it were a repenting for doing the
duty, and so makes it void and of no effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> The use hereof is, that in doing good we should watch
over our mindes, that they be rightly and fitly disposed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. It is an office of charity to minister unto others the
gifts which we have received, of what kinde soever they be.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the gifts of God do in their nature tend
unto the glory of God in promoting the good of men.</p>
                  <p>2. Because to this end are all the gifts of God committed
unto us, as stewards of the grace of God, as it is in the text.</p>
                  <p>3. Because this very thing doth the communion of Saints
require, to the believing and exercising whereof are all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
called.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to comfort us, in that there is no
faithfull Christian, but hath some gift, whereby he may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
something unto others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:62450:51"/>
2. To exhort us, every one to use that gift which he hath,
to the good of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. In exercising those gifts, which belong to the
preaching or declaration of Gods word, our chiefe care should be, so
to carry our selves as becomes the word of God.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 11 at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because every action rightly ordered should
have a just proportion to its object.</p>
                  <p>2. Because so great is the dignity of Gods word, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such a care it cannot be kept safe, without wronging of it.</p>
                  <p>3. Because all the power of our speech concerning Gods
word is lost, if it take not its whole strength from the word it
selfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish, not only the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that they handle the word of God holily, faithfully, and
gravely, but also all hearers, that they judge aright of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and make distinction betwixt those Preachers, which
speake as the Oracles of God, and others, which speake as a
humane speech or oration; and that they themselves also, if
upon occasion they should treat of the word of God in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
should doe it holily, gravely, and reverently, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the word of God to be handled.</p>

                  <p>This is gathered from verse 11, that is, he must do it not
by constraint, sparingly, and slowly, but with a ready and
cheerefull affection, to his power, and beyond his power vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because this communicating is as it were a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>THe Apostle doth here repeate that exhortation, to suffer
persecution aright, which he had heretofore used againe
and againe; because this exhortation was very necessary, and
containes in it the primary scope of the Epistle. But in this
place he repeates it as a pre-occupation or anticipation of an
objection or difficulty, which might be made against the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
exhortation, wherein he perswaded them to a constant
care of all the duties of piety. For they to whom this Epistle
was to come, might thus thinke with themselves, that by this
profession and practise of piety most grievous persecutions are
like to befall them, and that contrary to their expectation,
and therefore they are not to be requested by walking in the
same way to heape so great evils upon themselves. Of these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62450:53"/>
therefore the Apostle warnes them. 1. In generall,
that it should not seeme any new or strange thing to any
Christian, thereby to be troubled at it, which he shewes,
1. From their proper end, that they are as it were fire to try
the faith, sincerity and constancy of the faithfull, verse 12.
2. From the similitude that is betwixt the faithfull and Christ
in suffering afflictions, in which respect they should be so farre
from being troubled at it, that they should rejoyce, which is
contrary to perturbation. The reason of which consequence
is taken from the effect, to wit, because by suffering afflictions
after this manner the faithfull come to partake of glory and
eternall joy with Christ. 3. From the blessednesse which is
adjoyned unto it, in respect of the communion of the holy
Spirit, who when he is blasphemed by the persecutors, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with those that suffer, and is glorified by them, verse 14.
But that this which the Apostle hath spoken, may be rightly
understood, he tels them, that this cannot be meant of every
affliction, but of that alone which a man suffers for the name
of Christ, verse 24. as it is explained, verse 15, 16. when a man
suffers not for his owne deserts, but meerely as, or because he
is a Christian: from which consideration the conclusion
which he laid downe before is effectually deduced, verse 16.
to wit, that in that respect he should not be ashamed, or so
troubled, as if he were ashamed of the name of Christ, but
therefore to glorifie God. 4. From the ruling cause which
orders and governes such events, namely, the will of God,
whereby he hath appointed a certaine time to exercise judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his house or Church, verse 17. at the beginning. For
that which is there spoken of the time of judgement, is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
referred to the will of God, verse 19. 5. To the same
purpose is the condition of the faithfull set forth by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the condition of the unbelievers, verse 17, 18. which is
declared by such a connexion: If the condition of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
be so hard, the condition of the unbelievers must be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
intolerable; whence he doth closely intimate, that we
must neither envie the unbelieving persecutors, or revolt
from the faith by reason of persecutions. From all these
things the primary conclusion is specially inferred, verse 19.
that the faithfull in suffering afflictions should arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62450:53"/>
with true confidence, against all the perturbations and
temptations which may arise unto them from afflictions.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines drawne herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Afflictions and persecutions should not seeme
a new or strange thing unto Christians.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they were foretold by Christ and his
Apostles.</p>
                  <p>2. Because Christ himselfe and his chiefe Disciples were
used after the same manner.</p>
                  <p>3. Because such is the disposition of the world, that we
must alwayes expect such things from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us not to be troubled at

Christians.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the same verse. See the same doctrine
Chap. 1. verse 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. The faithfull in suffering afflictions and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are partakers of Christs sufferings.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because when they suffer for the name of Christ,
Christ suffers in them, according to that of the Lord, <hi>Saul,
Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Because they are made conformable unto Christs death,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to comfort us, because therein we have
matter of rejoycing, as it is in the text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. From these afflictions, if we suffer them joyfully,
we have a sure argument of our eternall joy and glory to come
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they that are partakers of Christs death,
are partakers also of his resurrection and everlasting life, <hi>Rom.
8. 17. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
                  <p>2. Because that joy which we have in afflictions, is the
first fruits of our eternall joy and glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us to learne to suffer joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
for the name of Christ, <hi>Iames 1. 2. Acts</hi> 5. 41.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The reproaches which the faithfull suffer for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
sake, are to be reckoned amongst those persecutions, which
they suffer for the name of Christ.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they tend to the dishonouring and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing
of us.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they shew that the mindes of the authors of
them are as ready to bring greater evils upon us, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>occasion
should serve.</p>
                  <p>3. Because reproaches doe worke more upon some mens
minds then reall injuries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish, 1 all men, to take heed
that they have no communion with the wicked world in scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
at any part of true piety. 2. The godly, to have a speciall
care, that they be not moved at such reproaches, but to beare
them with the same patience, that they ought to beare other
persecutions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. In these reproaches which the godly suffer for the
name of Christ, the Spirit of God is in a speciall manner blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
on the one side, and glorified on the other.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because looke how farre forth the faithfull
make profession of true piety, so farre forth are they the
temples of the holy Ghost: therefore when in that respect
they are reproached, the holy Ghost is evill spoken of: and
when they hold fast and adorn their profession notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these reproaches, the same Spirit which is evill spoken of
by the reproaches, is glorified by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve for terror to those that do reproach
others.</p>
                  <p>And 2. For comfort to those that are reproached.</p>
                  <p>Those things which are in the 13 verse, were handled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. God hath certaine and appointed times to execute
his judgements.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 17 at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the patience and long-suffering of God
must have their time.</p>
                  <p>2. Because there is a time also required, that men may fill
up the measure of their sinnes.</p>

                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:62450:54"/>
3. Because there are certaine opportunities of time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Gods judgements are executed with greater benefit, then
they could be at other times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, not to condemne
God any way either of slownesse or rashnesse in respect of his
judgements, but to rest well satisfied in his most wise orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. Judgement doth often begin at the house of God,
that is, at the Church.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the same place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the sinnes of those, which professe Gods
name, do in a speciall manner wrong Gods name and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and therefore the more they offend God, the more
ought they to be punished.</p>
                  <p>2. Because Gods chiefe care is, to purifie his Church by
such chastisements.</p>
                  <p>3. Because God oftentimes useth the unbelievers as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
to correct his Church; they must therefore be first
tolerated, that they may accomplish Gods counsell, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
punished, because they have done so wickedly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to direct us, not to be troubled in
minde, when we see the Church afflicted before and above
other people, but to acknowledge Gods divine ordering
of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. The judgement which God exerciseth upon his

judgement that shall in its due time come upon wicked men and

                  <p>This is gathered from verse 17, 18. So <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because God deales with his Church as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

mercy, but towards the wicked and unbeleevers he
exerciseth revenge.</p>
                  <p>3. Because to the beleevers judgement worketh together

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because their sinnes oftentimes are not the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

                  <p>2. Because it is the revealed will of God, that such affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are the lot of the faithfull, and the way by which they
usually come to the kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>3. Because this suffering of such afflictions is part of our

                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they cannot suffer for the name of Christ
but as they suffer for well doing.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they cannot preserve the liberty of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
but by a good conscience, that is, by well doing.</p>
                  <p>3. Because to commend an evill cause unto God, is, to
make God as it were the Patron of evill.</p>

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, to take heed, that we
doe not deprive our selves of this great priviledge by evill
doing.</p>

                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because it is easie for him to preserve our soules,
as it was heretofore to make them: and in this respect he is
called in the text, <hi>God the Creator</hi> not <hi>the Preserver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Because it stands upon his glory to do this.</p>

as much.</p>
                  <p>This may serve to comfort us in all straits and adversities:

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is a speciall exhortation propounded towards
the Elders, that they should performe their duty
and office in a holy manner. The duty in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
is set downe to be, to feed the flock, whereof
they were made overseers, by a diligent over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

them, verse 2. at the beginning. And withall it is described
by 3 conditions that are in a speciall manner required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which are set forth by a dehortation from the three
contrary vices, that are opposed to those three conditions.
1. The first condition is, willingly to feed the flock; the
contrary vice whereunto is, to do it by constraint. 2. To do
it readily and freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the contrary vice unto this, is, to seeke
after fifthy lucre thereby. 3. Not only in doctrine, but in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62450:56"/>
example of life to go before the Church; the contrary vice
whereunto is, to Lord it over the Church. This duty being
thus declared and described, they are perswaded unto it by
the reward that is adjoyned, which for that cause all faithfull
shepherds do receive, verse 4. at the end. Which reward is set
fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th both by the internall nature of it, that it is a crowne of
glory that fadeth not away; and by the authour and giver of
it, to wit, that the chiefe Shepherd our Lord Jesus Christ,
will give it; and also by the time of this giving of it, when
the chiefe Shepherd shall appeare, that is, at the last day of
judgement. Now this exhortation, that it might be the more
effectuall, and might worke the more upon them, is urged and
set forth by the person of <hi>Peter,</hi> who was the ministring cause
thereof, 1. From the parity and fellowship of the same du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as <hi>Peter</hi> an Elder prayed the other Elders to do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
2. From the knowledge which he had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which he could give of the afflictions of Christ, which he
suffered for the Church, the remembrance whereof should stir
up all shepherds to a diligent care of the Church. 3. From
that certaine expectation which he had of the glory to come,
which glory he promiseth to all shepherds in the name of the
chiefe shepherd.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Those exhortations are most effectuall which are
propounded in an humble manner.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 1. where the Apostle prayes,
not commands, in humility and charity. So <hi>Phil. 1. 9. 1 Tim.</hi>
5. 1. He prayes the Elders also as a fellow Elder, although he
was placed in a higher degree, as Apostle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because by this manner of doing it appeares,
that he which exhorts doth not aime at his owne good, but
the good of another.</p>
                  <p>2. Because by this manner of doing his zeale shewes it selfe
to be the purer.</p>
                  <p>3. Because he, to whom such an exhortation is made, is
honoured thereby, and to takes it the easier and better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to direct us, in all our exhortations
and admonitions to have respect unto this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. It makes the exhortation the more eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ction.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered herehence, that <hi>Peter</hi> makes way for his
exhortation in that he was a witnesse of the sufferings of
Christ, and so had a certaine knowledge of those things
which belong unto Christ, and that he was partaker of the
same glory; and therefore he was affected after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
himselfe, as he desired they should be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because knowledge gives ability and authority,
and communion of affection addes zeale and charity to the
exhortation.</p>
                  <p>2. Because these two will take away those obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

either that he gives his judgement of things that he doth

                  <p>This is gathered from verse 2. where the shepherds are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hored
to feed the flock.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because every mans particular function is that
condition wherein God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath placed him to advance his
glory.</p>
                  <p>2. Because a mans faithfulnesse is most of all made triall
of in that condition.</p>

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish every one to take greatest
care of those duties which are proper to his calling or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. It is the proper duty of a Shepherd, to feed the
flock that is committed to his charge.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the shepherds are appointed for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62450:57"/>
of the Church: now to feed is nothing else, but to
use all meanes that are appointed by God to procure the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Church.</p>
                  <p>2. Because Pastors are properly given to the faithfull that
are converted, who as new borne babes should be nourished
and brought up with milke and food, untill they come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the overseers of the Church should take most
care of those things, that are most necessary for the Church;
but it is most necessary for the faithfull being imperfect, to
have their spirituall life preserved and increased by feeding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish, 1 The Ministers not to
thinke that it is a light or common duty that lies upon them,
but that the very life of the Church doth in some sort depend
upon their labour and Ministery, and therefore so to carry
themselves, as befits and becomes so great a duty.</p>
                  <p>2. The people, not to expect from their Ministers vain and
light things which might tickle their eares, but to come to a
Sermon as to the Lords Table, and seeke for spirituall food
to feed their soules unto everlasting life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Pastors should performe their duties willingly,
not by constraint.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the same verse. Now by constraint
is meant that forcing which proceeds from outward things,
whereby a man performes the part of a Minister in some sort,
either to avoid poverty, or disgrace and infamy, or the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because that which is done by constraint, comes
not from the heart as from an inward principle, nor from the
Spirit sanctifying; and therefore it is not a duty pleasing and
acceptable unto God.</p>
                  <p>2. Because that which comes not from the heart, and is
not done willingly is done only perfunctorily and for fashion
sake, not with that diligence and care which God requires.</p>
                  <p>3. Because that which proceeds not from the heart and the
deerest affection of the soule, doth not usually worke upon
other mens mindes, and therefore is not effectuall to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Church, which is the end of the Ministery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This should admonish us, to look not only to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62450:57"/>
but also to the disposition of the will and heart
in the Ministers of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. They should do the same of a ready minde, not for
lucre.</p>
                  <p>Now by <hi>lucre</hi> is meant all kinde of worldly profit, which
men acquire unto themselves, either in doing the thing, or in
getting fame, or in gaining friends, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because that which depends upon lucre or some
such like end, must necessarily be applyed thereunto, and this
is to corrupt the word of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                  <p>2. Because that which depends upon mutable things, that
also it selfe is mutable and inconstant.</p>
                  <p>3. Because he which seeketh after lucre, is not a Minister
of God, but of Mammon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish, 1 The Ministers not
to follow after lucre. 2. The people not to suffer their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to be tempted by poverty, and so to be the lesse cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and ready in performing their duty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. The affectation of Lordlinesse should be far from
Christs Ministers.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they are called to meere service, not to
Lordlinesse.</p>
                  <p>2. Because Christ himselfe, whose Ministers they are, did
purposely live amongst men as one that serveth, that he might
leave an example unto those that should minister unto others
in his name, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 27.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the worke wherein they are imployed, is not
subject to the command and authority of men. For men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
command religion, but only perswade unto it.</p>
                  <p>4. Because the Lordlinesse of Ministers alienates mens
mindes from their testimony, because they neither willingly
subject themselves to such as affect Lordlinesse, and they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
too that those men, whom they see to study their owne
glory and power, do neither look after the glory of God, nor
the good or the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish all Ministers, to take heed
not only of all affectation but also all shew of Lordlinesse.
Now these men have a shew of Lordlinesse, 1 That would
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62450:58"/>
have others in some sort to depend upon their authority.</p>
                  <p>2. Those that prescribe something as necessary to be believed
or done, which is not taken out of Gods word. 3. Those that
expound the will of God it selfe too imperiously, having no
regard to the infirmity of those with whom they have to doe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. Ministers should go before the people not only in
doctrine, but in example also.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they are called to feed the flock with all
their strength; and therefore they should edifie the Church
not only by their words, but by their deeds also.</p>
                  <p>2. Because a wicked life doth either utterly destroy their
preaching, or at least much weaken it.</p>
                  <p>3. Because a good example is of a singular force, in that it
sheweth that that very thing may be done, which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
should be done.</p>
                  <p>4. Because it takes away all prejudice out of mens minds,
and all suspicion of affecting Lordlinesse and vaine glory,
when they see Ministers seriously to do that, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
and perswade others to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort, first, the Ministers, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to leade an exemplary life. Secondly, the people, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the good life of their Ministers, for therefore are they
proposed as examples. The common vices contrary to this
duty, are: 1. That many observe those things only in their
Ministers, which they may carpe at or calumniate, and not
those things which they should take notice of, with intention
to imitate them. 2. That many imagine that there is a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
kinde of holinesse belonging to Ministers, which others
are not bound to labour for. 3. That many excuse their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
courses by this pretence, that they are Lay-men, not Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
or Clergy-men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. Ministers should expect the j ust reward of their
labour and care, not from men, but from Christ.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because Christ is the chiefe shepherd, and Lord
of the flock, as it is in the text.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they must expect many injuries from men, and
those good things which doe happen, are not such, or so
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62450:58"/>
highly to be esteemed of, as that they should depend upon
them.</p>
                  <p>3. Because they will labour to please him most from whom
they expect their reward. Now they should please Christ,
not men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to comfort godly Ministers against
those troubles, which they finde men to make against them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 10. Their reward is a crowne of eternall glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because glory is the reward of the faithfull for
all kinde of obedience towards God. Now in the Ministery
there is a speciall kinde of obedience.</p>
                  <p>2. Because those that did strive or runne lawfully in a race,
there was wont to be a Crowne set before them; so for those
that carry themselves well in the exercise of the Ministery,
besides the glory common to all the Saints, there is a speciall
kinde of addition prepared, which is like as it were a crown.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort Ministers, couragiously to
contemne all temporary ignominy and disgrace for this
Crowne of eternall glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 11. This Crowne of glory shall be fully given at
Christs second comming to judgement.</p>
                  <p>

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>THe Apostle having in the former verses described the duty
of the Elders towards the Church or the younger sort, and
perswaded them unto it, he doth there-hence conclude the
duty of the younger towards the elders by a comparing of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62450:59"/>
things that are alike unto it, as the first word of the 5 verse
shewes unto us, <hi>Likewise.</hi> This duty is in generall pointed
out by subjection, which is set forth by the other duty, that
is due not only to the Elders, but also to all the members of
the Church, by reason of that nature which it hath common
with the former; and it is also called subjection in those
words, <hi>yea, all</hi> of you <hi>be subject one to another.</hi> Now this subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as well unto the Elders as unto all, is first described what
kinde of subjection it ought to be, to wit, not only outward,
but proceeding from the inward subjection of the soule unto
God, <hi>be clothed with humility.</hi> And that it is meant of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
towards God may be gathered from verse 6. Secondly,
He doth perswade them also unto this humility: 1. Because
it is an ornament of the minde; that by the way. 2. From
Gods blessing adjoyned, which followes thereupon, <hi>God gives
grace unto the humble,</hi> which is illustrated by Gods curse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thereunto, that fals upon the proud, <hi>God resisteth the
proud.</hi> Thirdly, he doth urge and presse them unto this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
towards God, verse 6. <hi>Humble your selves therefore;</hi>
and he shewes the proper reason of this subjection, which is
the mighty hand or omnipotency of God: and withall hee
explaines that reason, which he had before propounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the blessing and grace of God towards the humble, to
wit, that by that grace they shall be exalted: the time of which
exaltation is marked out, that it shall be in due time, <hi>that hee
may exalt you in due time.</hi> In the last place by anticipation of
a close, but weighty objection, whereby this subjection is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
made very difficult, he shewes the true manner thereof,
to wit, that it should be joyned with that confidence, which
casts all care upon God, so that no feare or worldly care can
hinder this subjection, which confidence he doth perswade
them unto by that effectuall providence which God hath over
the faithfull for their good, verse 7, at the end, <hi>For he careth
for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The doctrines arising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is the like duty of the people towards their
Pastors, as there is of the Pastors towards the people.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 5 at the beginning. <hi>Likewise ye
younger.</hi> Now by the younger in this place is chiefely meant
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62450:59"/>
the flock, which depends upon the Pastors, because the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Presbyters were for the most part chosen of those
that were elder in age, and therefore the greatest part of the
flock consisted of youngers. Now their duty is said to be
like, not for that it is in the same kinde, that the people should
guide their Pastors, as the Pastors do gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de the people, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is the like reason of both their duties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the same God and Lord both of Pastors
&amp; people, hath imposed and prescribed to both their duties.</p>
                  <p>2. Because that relation which is betwixt the Pastor and
people, requires a mutuall intercourse of duty.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the Pastors labour and care is made void, if the
people do not in some sort answer the same.</p>
                  <p>4. Because the Pastors care and labour, tending to the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the people, deserves it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vs.</hi> This may serve to reprove those that are very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and rigid in exacting their Pastors duty, when in the
meane time they are nothing carefull of their own dutie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The duty of people towards their Pastors consists
chiefly in subjection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because their Pastors are set over them in Gods
name.</p>
                  <p>2. Because faithfull Pastors propound nothing else to
themselves to observe, but the will of God, whereunto sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and obedience must necessarily be yeelded.</p>
                  <p>3. Because in the calling of their Pastors, they did either
expresly or covertly at least promise this very thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to reprove those that come unto Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
as Judges, to play the Criticks, not to subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the will of God, and such as cast off all discipline as
an intollerable yoke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. There is a kind of subjection also due unto all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words, <hi>Be yee all subject one to
another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because as occasion shall serve, we should hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our selves to performe the meanest offices unto our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>2. Because we should submit our selves unto the private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
of our brethren.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:62450:60"/>
3. Because we should with all patience beare all the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of our brethren.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to reprove the arrogancy and pride of
men, which cannot endure any such subjection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Humility is a great ornament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because humility is a singular vertue, and in
some sort the foundation of all the rest.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it makes us acceptable unto godly men, to
whom in this regard we are made more profitable.</p>
                  <p>3. Because it doth greatly commend us in the sight of <hi>God,</hi>
when for his sake we are subject not only to our superiours
and equals, but also to those of the lowest degree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to refute all those, that seeke for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and reputation by arrogancy; and shunne humility as it
were a vile debasing of a mans selfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. God resisteth the proud.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the proud resist the will of God.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they seeke unfitting things, or at least not after
a due manner.</p>
                  <p>3. Because whatsoever proceeds from pride, turnes to the
dishonour of God, to whom all subjection is due.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to condemne proud men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. God giveth grace to the humble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the promise of grace was made to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>
                  <p>2. Because humility is the disposing and fitting of a man
for to receive grace.</p>
                  <p>3. Because only the humble men have a worthy esteeme of
Gods grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, greatly to labour for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. The strength and power of God should stirre us up
to subjection towards him.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 6 at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because it were madnesse to resist the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>2. Because Gods omnipotencie is the protection of those
that humble themselves before him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to suffer our selves
so much as in thought to be led away from our obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62450:60"/>
God, but from the meditation of Gods omnipotency
and our own infirmity to increase daily more and more in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. God will exalt the humble in due time.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 6 at the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because glory is the reward of obedience.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they glorifie God, and therefore God will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
them according to his promise, <hi>Those that honour me, I will
honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to direct us, to seek for true exaltation
by humilitie and submission.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. They that humble themselves before God, may
safely, and also should cast all their care upon God.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because this is Gods covenant, that he will be
alwayes all-sufficient unto them that walke before him.</p>
                  <p>2. Because God by a singular care and providence watcheth
over those that have a care of his glory, &amp; seek his kingdome,
as it is in the text, <hi>He careth for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to comfort all the godly, because
God hath freed them from all care; and they should imbrace
this libertie by true faith, and putting their trust in him, and
apply it to themselves.</p>

                  <p>FOr conclusion of the whole Epistle, to the foregoing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
there is added one generall one, which doth
most neerely belong to the scope of the Apostle, to wit, that
notwithstanding all opposition, difficulty, and temptation,
they should constantly persist and go forward in that grace,
which they had received. Now this care is described, 1 by
two duties, which belong to the due manner thereof, sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and vigilancy. 2. The necessity of these duties is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the grievous danger, to which otherwise they should be
exposed. And this danger is set forth by the efficient cause
thereof, the Devill, of whom the Apostle makes a descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that purpose: 1 By the opposition and enmity which
he hath against us; in respect whereof he is called, <hi>our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
or enemy.</hi> 2. By the manner and degree of that enmitie,
that it is joyned with cruelty, <hi>as of a roaring Lion.</hi> 3. That
besides this cruelty there is over and above in him very great
diligence and greedinesse to do us hurt, in these words: <hi>seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whom he may devoure.</hi> Now the Apostle gives us warning,
that we must not yeeld to this enemy and danger which he
threatens us, but resist it, verse 9 at the beginning, which is
nothing else, but not to suffer our selves to be removed by his
temptations from the grace of God: and the chiefe meanes
of this resistance he shewes to consist in the stedfastnesse of our
faith: which faith may in this respect be wonderfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the example of our brethren in the world, who have
experience of the like afflictions and temptations of Sathan.
Agreeable to this exhortation he addes a prayer verse 10. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the successe of all our endeavours depends upon the
grace and blessing of God: And in this prayer he beseecheth
God to strengthen the faithfull, and make them perfect in all
grace, at the end of the verse, <hi>make you perfect, stablish, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
settle you.</hi> The arguments whereby he confirmes their
faith that they shall obtaine this petition, are two: 1. The
all-sufficiencie of the grace of God in it selfe, in which respect
this title is given unto God, that he is the God of all grace.
2. The communicating of this grace in the calling of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62450:61"/>
faithfull, in these words: <hi>who hath called you:</hi> the grace of
which calling is shewed, first, by the end and scope, that it is,
to partake of the eternall glorie of God. Secondly, by the
principall cause, <hi>in Christ Iesus.</hi> Thirdly, by the condition
that goes before the accomplishment of this calling, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belongs to this exhortation of the Apostle unto constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in afflictions, to wit, because we are so called unto eternall
glorie, that in the meane time we must suffer afflictions, <hi>after
that ye have suffered a while.</hi> In the last place upon occasion
of this prayer he addes a religious doxologie, glorifying God,
verse 11. wherein is contained both the last end of that petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a confirmation of the same that it shall be heard; as
also an indirect exhortation to the faithfull, to bend all their
care thereunto, to glorifie Gods name really and effectually,
by persisting in the grace of God.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising here-hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. We had need to watch continually. Be vigilant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because sinne and danger doth naturally steale
upon us, if we do not resist it.</p>
                  <p>2. Because we cannot do our duty without diligent care
and labour, and therein consists the manner of watching.</p>
                  <p>3. Because if we could avoid danger, &amp; obtain our desires,
if we did not seeke it with care and diligence, it would be no
praise to us, nor peace of conscience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to direct us, to imitate watchmen,
which watch and ward to keepe the Citie; the like diligence
should we use in keeping our soules, to examine all that goes
in and out, our thoughts, affections, words, and actions, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the occasions of them, what they are, whence they
came; and whither they tend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That we may watch as we ought to do, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that we should be sober.</p>
                  <p>Now by sobernesse is meant the moderation of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
touching all worldly things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the cares of this world do so burthen
the soule, that they leave no place for spirituall cares.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the care of the world doth draw and distract
the minde, so that although it doth not altogether exclude
religion, yet it doth diminish and weaken it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:62450:62"/>
3. Because under the shew of some worldly profit, pleasure,
or honour, we do oftentimes admit of those things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
and destroy our soules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us not to drown our selves
in the things of this world, but so to use the world, as if we u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. We have such a spirituall enemy, that we had need
to watch and ward continually against him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because he is full of spirituall malice and craft.</p>
                  <p>2. Because his diligence is answerable to his malice.</p>
                  <p>3. Because he is most cruell, seeking not to bring some
small inconvenience upon us, but our utter destruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, never to be secure, but
day and night to be mindfull of that danger wherein we are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. We must couragiously resist the Devill.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because he is such an enemy, that we can make
no peace or league with him.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they which yeeld unto the devill give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up into his hands, as being overcome.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the courage of our minde to resist is a great part
of spirituall victory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to strengthen our mindes
in all things to make this resistence.</p>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The chiefe power of resisting, consists in a stedfast
faith.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words, <hi>Whom resist stedfast in
the faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because faith layes hold upon Christ who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the devill, and in him they lay hold of victory it selfe.</p>
                  <p>2. Because saith laies hold of the truth of all the promises,
whereby the soule is invincibly fortified.</p>
                  <p>3. Because faith, seeing it is the foundation of all grace, if
it be stirred up and strengthened, it confirmes and strengthens
also all the other vertues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to direct us, to have a speciall care to
raise and build up our faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. The examples of other beleevers doe make much
for the confirmation of our faith in afflictions &amp; other temptations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:62450:62"/>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because thereby it appeares that such conflicts
are not contrarie to faith and pietie.</p>
                  <p>2. Because therehence we have a cloud of witnesses, to
shew, that at length we shall obtaine the victorie by faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to direct us, to stablish our mindes
more and more by such meditations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. All those things which we desire, either for our
selves or for others unto salvation, we must aske of God.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 10, compared with the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
verse. For all those things which the Apostle had before
required of the faithfull, he doth now at the end of the Epistle
in their name crave of God, and he askes it with discretion,
as appeares by that particle, <hi>But</hi> as if he should have said,
Although all these things which I have proposed unto you
by way of admonition, exhortation, and consolation, are
duties which you ought necessarily to do, yet it is not to be
expected, that you shold accomplish it by your own strength:
I do therefore call upon God, (which you likewise should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
do) that he would increase his grace more and more in
you, whereby you may receive both to will and to do all these
things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because of our selves we can doe nothing that is
good.</p>
                  <p>2. Because in such like purposes and endeavours we are let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and hindred by divers temptations, and such as are most
strong through our infirmitie.</p>
                  <p>3. Because all our spirituall life proceeds from God, and
of him should we aske it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, not to rest in good
purposes and intentions, but alwayes to seeke for grace from
God, to accomplish the same happily.</p>
                  <p>2. To direct us, when we reade, heare, and meditate upon
Gods word, to water it, as it were, with our prayers, that it
may be fruitfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note.</hi> By such conclusions of the Apostles, wherein
they do close up their Doctrine with prayer, the Ministers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
are warned and admonished, after their Sermons to
desire God to give both themselves and the people grace to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62450:63"/>
observe those things, which they have learned in the Sermon:
and others also are admonished diligently and earnestly to
seek the same, both in publick with the Minister, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
by themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. We stand in need of manifold grace.</p>
                  <p>As it is set forth by divers words in the text: <hi>Make perfect,
stablish, strengthen, settle,</hi> which may be thus distinguished,
that <hi>to make perfect</hi> is to adde those degrees of grace, which
are yet wanting: <hi>to stablish,</hi> is to protect and defend from
temptations and dangers: <hi>to strengthen</hi> is to give inward pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and strength: and <hi>to settle,</hi> is to fasten the root it selfe of
grace more and more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because all those good things which we have,
we have but in part.</p>
                  <p>2. Because we are assaulted by continuall temptations, and
are over and above prone to revolt.</p>
                  <p>3. Because great and manifold is that perfection, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
we are called.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, not to rest in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge,
but by much prayer to aske much grace of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. God is the fountaine and author of all grace.</p>
                  <p>For this title is given unto God in this place, because it is
most agreeable to the petition for manifold grace. For Holy
Men in their prayers day hold of that in God, and propose
those titles of God unto themselves, which make most for the
furtherance of those prayers which they make.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because God hath in himselfe infinite riches of
grace.</p>
                  <p>2 Because grace is not given but by grace, and not for any
merit of our own.</p>
                  <p>3. Because every degree and all kinde of grace is revealed
and exhibited unto us by God in the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to direct us to build up our selves
in this beliefe of Gods grace.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, not so to rest in that grace which we
have received, as if there were nothing farther to be looked
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62450:63"/>
after, because God is God not of this or that particular grace,
but of all grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 10. The chiefe effect of this grace, which is in us, is
our calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because before our calling we lye in sinne and
spirituall death.</p>
                  <p>2. Because by our calling we come to the hope of eternall
glory; <hi>who hath called you into his eternall glory,</hi> as it is in the
text.</p>
                  <p>3. Because in our calling wee are ingrafted into Jesus
Christ, that by him we are brought unto this glory, <hi>who
hath called you unto eternall glory in Iesus Christ,</hi> as it is in the
text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, to labour to make
our effectuall calling more and more sure.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to give God all the thankes for this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and to leade a life answerable thereunto, which seemes to
be aimed at in the text, <hi>viz.</hi> that for this eternall glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we are called, we should contemne all worldly things,
whether good or evill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 11. The sufferings of this life are not repugnant to
the comfort of this glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because we suffer but a while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for although the
time of affliction may seeme long, yet it is but short, if it be
compared either with eternall death, which the wicked shall
suffer, and we have deserved; or with eternall glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we are called.</p>
                  <p>2. Because these afflictions are the way, whereby accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Gods wil we come unto glory.</p>
                  <p>3. Because glory it selfe appeares the more glorious for
the afflictions going before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to comfort us against all the sufferings
of this life.</p>
                  <p>Doct. 12. For this grace of God we should give all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto God.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62450:64"/>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because therein consists our thankfulnesse.</p>
                  <p>2. Because therein also consists the perfection of the work
of grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, not to give place to
luke-warmenesse, but to make such high reckoning of the
saving grace of God, that upon every mentioning thereof our
mindes should be stirred up sincerely to glorifie the name of
God, and alwayes endeavour so to do.</p>

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Uch kinde of writings, as well Ethnick or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,
as sacred, are usually divided into three
parts, whereof the first is, the Superscription,
Salutation, and Preface. 2. The Epistle it
selfe. 3. The Subscription or Conclusion.
But more accurately me thinks, we may say,
that the preface and conclusion are only adjuncts of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
which depend upon the Epistle it selfe, and are also use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thereunto. But in this Epistle only one of these adjuncts
is used, namely, the Preface. For there is no subscription
made, or any such conclusion, as is used in the Epistles of
<hi>Paul,</hi> and in the first of <hi>Peter.</hi> The Preface is contained in
foure verses, and it consists of two parts, a salutation, and a
confirmation of the salutation: that in the two first, this in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62450:65"/>
the third and fourth verse. In the salutation there are those
three things expressed, which are in every action; namely, the
agent, the action it selfe, and the object of it. For so is there
the person saluting, the persons saluted, and the salutation it
selfe. The person saluting is described, first, by his name ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.
Secondly, by his office adjoyned, and that both ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
that he is a servant of Jesus Christ, and speciall, that he
is an Apostle of his. The persons saluted are described by a
speciall adjunct, which is in stead of the forme, namely, by
faith: which faith is set forth, first, by a comparison of the
like, that it is like precious with the faith of the Apostles.
2. By the principall efficient cause, God and Jesus Christ.
3. By the meanes thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> righteousnesse. The confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the salutation containes, 1. the good that is wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which consists of two parts, <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi> 2. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and quality of this good, <hi>be multiplyed.</hi> 3. The helping
cause of this multiplication of good, which is <hi>the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God and Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Analysis.</p>
                  <p>As for the person, he hath a double respect. For he is here
considered as the Author of the Epistle, and also as the Author
of the Salutation: in the former respect we have these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The very names of Christs famous Disciples,
were heretofore of great force for the confirmation and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the truth in the Church.</p>
                  <p>For to that end did the Apostles usually set downe their
names in the Epistles, which they wrote unto the Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may bee for exhortation, that we also accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our abilities should labour so farre with those amongst
whom we live, that our names may be like precious ointment,
and may make something for the edification of others.</p>
                  <p>2. It may serve to reprove those which so carry themselves,
that they are a disgrace to godlinesse, and to the Church.</p>
                  <p>In the latter respect the person yeelds us this observation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The salutation of the Apostles and Ministers of
God is more highly to be prized.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because it is not only a good and godly prayer, as
are the salutations of all the faithfull, but it is also a ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62450:65"/>
application of the good things which God communicates
unto us by them. For it proceeds not only from a pious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
but from their singular office and duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, not to neglect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
such blessings, whether they be publick or private.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. It is an honourable title, if a man be rightly and
deservedly called a servant of God or Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because the chiefest men in the Church of God
alwayes gloried in this title; not only the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
but also Kings and Princes, as we see in <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to comfort poore Christians that have
no titles whereof to boast. For if they be the servants of God
and Christ, they have no cause to envie others, or to complain
of their owne condition. Now that it may be knowne who
are the servants of God, we must know that there are two
things, as it were essentiall to a servant, 1. To depend upon
his Masters will and pleasure, for direction in his worke.
2. To referre all that he hath to the use and profit of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
not to his owne. So also every faithfull servant of God,
1 depends wholly upon God for the direction of his life, not
upon himselfe and his owne counsell, nor upon the examples
and customes of the world, much lesse upon the suggestions
of the flesh and the devill. 2. He referres himselfe and all that
he hath to advance and set forth the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Those servants of Christ which are called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
have the chiefest authority in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>For that is the reason why <hi>Peter</hi> saith that he is an Apostle
of Jesus Christ. All the faithfull are Christs servants, but
they are not Apostles: even the ordinary Ministers themselves,
although in a large sense they may be called Apostles and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
of Christ, yet not in that sense as <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and
the like are called. For the word <hi>Apostle,</hi> in this and the like
places, signifies not only an Embassage, but a singular privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or prerogative in that embassage. Now the priviledge
of the Apostles above other Ministers consists in these foure
things: First, In the manner of the embassage, <hi>viz.</hi> that they
were called neither of men, nor by men but immediately of
Christ. Secondly, in the office imposed upon them by vertue
of this embassage, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were chiefly sent to plant
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62450:66"/>
Churches, to feed and build them up. Thirdly, in the object
whereabout their labour should be imployed, <hi>viz.</hi> that they
were sent not to any one Church, but to divers, and for the
conversion of the whole world. Fourthly, in their gifts and
assistance of the Spirit, which alwayes accompanied this their
embassage, <hi>viz.</hi> because in executing this their office, as well
in preaching as in writing, they were freed from all errour.
As in the Creation of the world God first made light, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
set some lights in the Firmament of Heaven to give
light upon the Earth: So also in the re-creation and restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the world, God first gave light in Christ himselfe, who
was the Sonne of Righteousnesse, as he is called in Scripture,
and afterwards ordained the Apostles, as great lights, to
bring this light upon the Earth. And this is it which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
saith unto them: <hi>Ye are the light of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to exhort us, to give God thanks, that
he hath not left us in darknesse, to wander at uncertainties,
but hath set up these shining lights for us, by whose meanes we
might be directed unto heaven.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, to observe also and believe those things
which they have prescribed us. For we must receive the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Apostles after the same manner, as we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Christ himselfe, if he were with us on earth.</p>
                  <p>3. To refute the Pope, who brags that he is an Apostle,
and hath Apostolicall authority, (whereupon also he cals his
seat at <hi>Rome,</hi> Apostolicall,) when as he hath not so much as
one of those conditions, which are necessarily required to
make an Apostle.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the person saluting. It followes now to speak
of the persons saluted, where we have these Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Apostles wrote not properly to the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but to the Church.</p>
                  <p>For so here and elsewhere are they described to whom the
Epistles are sent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because the preaching of the Gospell, not the
writing, is the effectuall meanes of conversion. The writing
and reading do more properly serve for the confirmation and
edification of those that are converted, then for the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:62450:66"/>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort, first of all, that they will
principally apply themselves unto Sermons. Secondly, those
that have received some benefit by Sermons, that they would
also diligently apply themselves to the reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that they might more and more confirme and edifie
themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Faith is the proper marke of difference, whereby
the Church is distinguished from all other societies.</p>
                  <p>For therefore are the Christians here described by faith,
that they may be distinguished from all other men: and the
same which in other Epistles are wont to be called the elect, the
called, the Churches of God, those which are in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in Jesus Christ, are in this place barely called the
faithfull.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Therefore it is here called <hi>precious faith;</hi> and in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Epistle, Chap. 1. v. 7. <hi>faith</hi> is said to be <hi>more precious then
gold that perisheth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to exhort us, to make more account
of faith then of all worldly things, according to that of

in this world. For if they have true faith, they have that
which is more excellent then silver and gold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. The faith of common Christians is as precious as
was the faith of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Which is not to be understood of the degree or quantity, but
of the nature or quality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because the faith of all Christians layes hold of the
same good, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ and his benefits. Hereupon <hi>Paul</hi> cals
it common faith: for as one that is sick of the Palsie, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
some precious thing with a shaking hand, doth possesse
it as well as the other, that is strong; so the faithfull, though
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62450:67"/>
they be weake, if they do truly lay hold of Christ, have him
to be their Saviour as well as they that are most strong.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to comfort weake Christians; for if
they have true faith, though it be but like a graine of Mustard
seed, they have the same comfort that the Apostles themselves
had. If they be truly knit unto Christ, though it be but with
a slender thred as it were, yet they hold Christ as well as they
that are tyed unto him with the strongest cords: which yet
is not so to be taken, as if we were not to seeke for a stronger
and surer faith; for although the weake possesse the same good
that the strong do, yet they have not the same fruit and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of this possession.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The cause of this precious faith is not in any man,
but in the righteousnesse of God and Christ.</p>
                  <p>Now by righteousnesse is not meant any recompence of
desert; but the faithfulnesse and truth of the promises, which
depend upon the meere goodnesse of God. And these promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
made unto <hi>Abraham</hi> himselfe, that his seed should be as
the starres of heaven, and the sand of the Sea, out of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and they were afterwards often repeated by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
                  <p>Use 1. This may serve <hi>to refute</hi> those, that ascribe it unto
mans free will; so that first they make the calling of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be uncertaine, as if the promises of God could be made
void; and then they take away the glory it selfe of mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
from God, and give it unto man.</p>

two words, Grace and peac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>For by <hi>Grace</hi> is meant both the free favour of God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the application and manifestation thereof in the hearts of
the faithfull, by the operation of the holy Ghost; in the word
and Sacraments. And by <hi>peace</hi> is meant quietnesse of mind,
which is the fruit of grace. So that <hi>Grace</hi> is the first benefit,
and <hi>Peace</hi> the last. And therefore all benefits that passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
are included therein, as in two extreames. Hereupon
in all the Epistles almost the Apostles prayer and salutation
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62450:67"/>
is contained in these two: To <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> he addes
<hi>mercy</hi> also, <hi>Grace, mercy and peace.</hi> But that is only an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the same thing, which is signified by grace, and
for a peculiar reason is added in those Epistles, because <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> wanted a speciall kind of grace, in respect of
the service, which they did undergoe in the Churches, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their age, and those divers temptations, whereunto
they were obnoxious in that Service. In the old Testament
peace onely was usually wished in their salutations, without
any mention of Grace; but yet grace also at that time was
understood: But in the time of the new Testament, which is
the time of grace, and wherein all things are more fully deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
it was most fitting, that grace should be named in such
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ke salutations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to exhort and direct us,</hi> above all things
to wish grace and Christian peace unto all those, to whom
we are well-wishers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 11. The desires of the faithfull are chiefly for those
spirituall good things, Grace and peace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> The Reason of the Collection is this, because the
Apostle in this beginning of the Epistle, labours to get the
good will of those to whom he writes, by shewing the prayer
that he had made for them: Now he could not effect this, if
his prayer were not according to their desire; for if he should
have wished any of those things, that they cared not for,
such a wish would have done no good with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to exhort us</hi> all, to examine our selves
according to this rule. For if wee make no reckoning at all,
of the meanes and instruments of grace, but doe reject or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
those, that labour most to procure this grace and peace
for us, we have cause to feare, that we are yet farre from the
nature, and disposition of true beleevers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. They which have gone farthest in faith and grace,
have yet need of grace.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered therehence, that the Apostle wisheth grace
unto those, that have obtained like pretious faith, with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
themselves.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>2. <hi>To exhort us</hi> to humility, and continuall prayer for the
grace of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62450:68"/>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Without Grace, there is no true peace.</p>
                     <p>Grace is the cause and foundation of peace, peace the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and fruit of grace; it is the inheritance, which Christ left
unto his disciples alone, <hi>Iohn 14. 27. Isay 48. last.</hi> For this
peace is not an externall and worldly peace, but spirituall and
internall. Before we are partakers of grace, we are called in
Scripture, <hi>Gods enemies,</hi> so that we doe wage a kind of warre
against God himselfe, and therefore also against the Angels
of God, and other of his creatures. Now by grace, and by
it alone is peace made.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve <hi>to refute and reprove</hi> the folly of those
men, which so please themselves, in that outward quietnesse
which they enjoy, when in the meane time, they are utterly
void and ignorant of the grace of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. We must seeke not only for grace and peace, but
also for great abundance of it.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from that word, <hi>Grace and peace be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</hi>
For the good things of that grace are such, that they
cannot be too much: in this there is no sinning in excesse.
Hence it is that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> alwayes exhorts the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and prayes also that the faithfull may abound more and
more in all grace. And to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> he proposeth the
breadth, and length, and depth, and height of this grace, that
they may be rooted and grounded in it, Chap. 3. verse 18.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute and condemne those, that
so rest in the present grace which they have, or seeme to have,
that they looke for no more. Such do those men seeme to be,
that thinke they know enough, beleeve enough, love enough,
&amp;c. And therefore they neglect both the publick and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
meanes, whereby they might be farther edified. The state
of a Christian in this life is a state of building, not perfection:
therefore as he would shew himselfe to be a foolish builder,
that should rest in the middle of his worke, and not make up
the perfect structure, so also in a Christian life.</p>
                     <p>2. To exhort us to stirre up our selves, and labour for more
abundant grace and peace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 1. The first argument may be taken from the
nature of grace and peace, which is such, that he that hath
once tasted the sweetnesse thereof, cannot but desire a fuller
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62450:68"/>
draught of it, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2. 3. Desire the sincere milke, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 2. From the imperfect degree, that we have
yet attained: We are for the most part, as new borne babes,
as the Apostle speakes in the same place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 3. From the will of God, to whom nothing
is more acceptable, then that we should seeke for plenty of his
grace, <hi>Isay 55. 2. Prov.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 4. From the sinne or guilt, which followes
the neglect of that duty. For as amongst men, if one should set
before us most precious wares, and should commend them, and
also offer them freely unto us, he could not but take it ill, if
we should refuse them: so much more may we think that
Gods anger is incensed towards those, that neglect and despise
the riches of this grace, that he hath set before them and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. God is the only author of grace and peace.</p>
                     <p>This is gathered from 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 10.</p>
                     <p>God is called the author of all grace. Hence by a kinde of
appropriation he is called <hi>the God of grace,</hi> as in another place
he is called <hi>the Father of mercies, and God of all consolations;</hi> and
grace also in this signification is called the grace of God; so
also of peace we finde in Scriptures, that God is called <hi>the God
of peace,</hi> and true peace is every where called <hi>the peace of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute all the Papists, that mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
the contrary both in their words and practise. For they
are wont to call the blessed Virgin <hi>the Mother of grace:</hi> so
also they runne unto her and to other Saints, as if they were
the authors of grace and peace.</p>
                     <p>2. To instruct and confirme us in this truth, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
of grace and peace depends upon the meere good will
and pleasure of God. For when God is called <hi>the God of grace,</hi>
it is meant also that he is <hi>the Lord of grace,</hi> who can accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his good pleasure give it to whom he will, and deny it
to whom he will. This is gathered from 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 23. and
2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 16. for he that in the former place is called <hi>the God
of peace,</hi> in the latter is called <hi>the Lord of peace.</hi> Therefore
when we see that grace &amp; peace is granted unto some, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
unto others, we should rest satisfied in the good will of
God, according to the example of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. For by
so doing we give glory to God, as is evident.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:62450:69"/>
3. To exhort us, to pray unto this great God to give us
grace and peace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. Jesus Christ is the beginning of all grace and peace.</p>
                     <p>God is the first and principall author, and so also Christ,
as he is God: but as he is God and man, our Mediatour, so he
is the beginning ordained by God, as the head, from whom
all grace is to be derived unto his members, as into the vessels
of grace; so that God is as it were the first and principall
fountaine, Christ as the secondary fountaine, in whom is hid
all grace that is to be given unto the faithfull, and the faithfull
themselves are the vessels that draw and receive this grace,
which runnes into them from these fountaines, and the word
and Sacraments are as the channels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to informe us of the manner, how we
should seeke for grace, <hi>viz.</hi> that we should alwayes go unto
God in Christ, because <hi>extra Christum,</hi> out of Christ, he is
unto sinners not a God of grace and peace, but of vengeance,
and a consuming fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. True faith is the instrumentall cause of grace and
peace, and of the multiplying of both, whereby it is derived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> Because by knowledge in this place is meant faith.
For it is not meant a bare knowledge, but something more,
which followes this knowledge, therefore it is not called,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, that is, an acknowledging. 2. Thereby
is meant an effectuall knowledge, such as there is no other
taught us in the Scriptures, but faith. Now faith is signified
by the name of knowledge, because by the hearing and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the word it is usually begotten in us. And faith is
called the instrument of grace, not as it is in God himselfe,
willing, intending, and ordaining spirituall good things unto
us, for so grace is the cause of faith; but as the sense, fruit and
knowledge of this grace is communicated unto us. For faith
is so the fruit and effect of grace, that it hath the first place,
and is the instrumentall cause of all following grace. And this
efficacy it hath in respect of the object, which it layes hold of,
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> because as we said before, he is the beginning of
all grace, so that as <hi>Adam</hi> was the beginning of nature and
the corruption thereof, and that relation which we have unto
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62450:69"/>
                        <hi>Adam</hi> by naturall generation, makes us partakers both of his
nature and corruption: so Christ was made the beginning of
life spirituall, and grace, and that relation of faith which we
have unto Christ in our regeneration, makes us partakers both
of the life and grace which is in Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, 1. To have a speciall care
of our faith, if we would not be destitute of all the grace and
peace of God. This is it which the Apostle saith elsewhere,
<hi>above all, take the shield of faith,</hi> that is, above all things get
faith, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 16. This is it which is often pressed, <hi>By faith
we are saved, by faith we stand, by faith we obtaine the victory,</hi>
&amp;c. 2. To labour also for the increase of faith, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> desire the
increase of grace and peace. For grace is multiplyed by the
multiplying of faith, and the knowledge of God. As in a
house, which is inlightned by the Sunne, the more the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
stand open, the more it is filled with light: so also in
us, the more our faith is increased, the more is grace and peace
increased in us. Let that therefore be our daily prayer, which
was Christs Disciples, <hi>Lord increase our faith.</hi>

                  <p>THe scope of the Apostle in this verse is to confirme the
faith of Christians touching the multiplying of grace and
peace through the knowledge of God, which he had wished
unto them in the former verse. And the argument is taken
from the comparing of things alike, as that particle, <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as,</hi> intimates unto us. The things compared are. 1. The gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of peace and grace; and 2. The consequent multiplying
of them. And of these he shewes that there is the same reason,
both in respect of the principall cause, and the lesse princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
or instrumentall cause; so that the whole argument runs
after this manner; <hi>If God and our Lord Iesus Christ will give
unto us grace and peace through the knowledge of him, then will
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62450:70"/>
he also multiply unto us the same gifts by the same: But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is true: Therefore the latter.</hi> The Assumption is contained
in verse 3. And it is not barely set downe, but with an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
although he addes some things to confirme the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it selfe and our faith. For in stead of <hi>grace and peace</hi> the
Apostle here puts things necessary unto <hi>life and godlinesse;</hi> and
in the second place <hi>glory and vertue:</hi> like as by <hi>life and glory</hi>
he meanes the same thing, that he did before by <hi>peace,</hi> though
in a different respect: so also by <hi>godlinesse and vertue</hi> he means
the same thing that he did before by <hi>grace.</hi> The principall
cause of this gifting he explains by the power which he hath,
which he cals <hi>divine;</hi> the instrumentall he explaines by the
object thereof, namely, Christ. For he argues from a singular
effect, which doth most of all pertaine to the thing it selfe,
namely to our calling, <hi>glory and vertue.</hi>

by peace, is called <hi>life</hi> in respect of that inward and permanent
principle of the most perfect operations, wherein consists
mans felicity, which is given unto all the faithfull. And it is
called <hi>glory</hi> in respect of the compleat happinesse, which
flowes from that principle, and shall in its due time also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
with outward splendour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to informe and instruct us, not to
think meanely or contemptibly of the condition of faithfull
Christians, but to judge aright according to the nature of the
thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that the only life and chiefest glory is proper
to them.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to preserve faith, grace, and Christian
peace before all worldly things, yea, before this present life it
selfe, and the glory thereof, because by our faith we shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a farre more perfect life and glory, according to that of
Christ, <hi>He that loseth his life, shall finde and obtaine a farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Christian grace brings with it godlinesse and
vertue.</p>
                  <p>For the same thing is called grace, which is the effect of
Gods favour; it is called <hi>godlinesse,</hi> as it hath God for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62450:70"/>
and it is called <hi>vertue,</hi> as it perfects a man in operation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to instruct us, not to boast of the
grace of God, unlesse we shew it by our godlinesse and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p>2. To reprove and condemne those, that either out of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
or fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ned simulation, do either separate grace from
godlinesse, or grace from vertue, or vertue from either.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. All things necessary unto life and godlinesse are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by God unto the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>Now to make a gift perfect 3 things are required. 1. That
the gift which is given be made the receivers, or his to whom
it is said to be given; for otherwise it is not a gift, or a thing
actually given, but potentially only. 2. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t be made his
absolutely or irrevocably, not conditionally, that the gift it
selfe should depend upon a condition. 3. That the giver be
moved for no other cause to give, but to shew and exercise
his bounty and liberality. the more perfectly and purely
these conditions are found in any gift, the more perfect and
pure is the gift. Now all these do most exactly agree to those
gifts of God, which pertaine unto life and godlinesse. As for
example, Christ is said to be given for us, and also given unto
us: the holy Ghost hath that name as it were appropriated
unto him, that he is the gift of God: faith and repentance are
expresly called the gift of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to instruct us, against the error of
those, that will not take such like good things as a gift, but
teach us that we must seeke for them by our own merits; for
as the Apostle saith <hi>If of grace, then not by workes, for othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wise
grace were not grace:</hi> so may we also say; if of gift, then not
by workes, for otherwise the gift would be no gift.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, throughout our whole life to seeke for
such good things after that manner as is agreeable to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that is, to ask, pray, and supplicate for them, &amp;c. And
in the second place to use all our endeavour to shew our selves
thankfull unto God for such divine gifts.</p>
                  <p>4. Hee gives these spirituall gifts unto us by his Divine
<hi>Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Divine Power haeth given unto us all things,</hi> as it is in
the text: the like hereunto is that in the first Epistle, <hi>c. 1. v. 5.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62450:71"/>
Ye are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.</hi> And
Christ tels us, <hi>Matth. 19. 26. With men this is unpossible, but
with God all things are possible:</hi> where we are expresly taught,
that salvation and spirituall good things are given unto us by
the power of God, to whom all things are possible, that is, his
omnipotency, <hi>Ier. 31. 35. Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the
Sunne, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because such a power is necessarily required to
bring this to passe, by reason of those strong impediments,
which withstand and crosse this worke. For so Christ tels us,
that the Devill <hi>as a strong man holds his palace, till a stronger
then he comes upon him and overcomes him, and takes from him all
his armour wherein he trusted, Luke.</hi> 11. 21, 22. This is also ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
explained by the Apostle, <hi>Ephes. 4. 8. When he ascended up
on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> Where
he shewes that gifts are given unto us by that very power,
whereby captivity is led captive. It is expresly said <hi>Ephes. 1.
19. that it is the exceeding greatnesse of Gods power, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in us by the might of his power,</hi> and Verse 20. <hi>the same power
whereby Christ was raised from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute the Remonstrants and such
like men, that deny faith to be begotten in us, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
to be wrought by Gods almighty power. For they
make grace only morally perswading, that may be resisted,
impotent, and consequently uneffectuall.</p>
                  <p>2. To comfort the weake and all the faithfull, in that they
have no reason too much to feare the gates of hell, because
they have the gates of heaven making with them: although
they must wrestle not only against flesh and blood, but against
principalities and the powers of the world, &amp;c. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 12.
Yet they have a divine power, farre beyond all those enemies,
to uphold them in this wrestling.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us, 1. To behave our selves stoutly, and shew
our selves men in the cause of God, answerable to so Divine a
Power, as he is ready to afford unto us. 2. To give God
thankes, that hath not left us in our owne infirmities to be
exposed as a prey unto our enemies, but by his divine power
helpes our infirmities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. This Divine Power is the power of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:62450:71"/>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to confirme our faith, touching
Christs divine nature. For the divine power is not separated
from the divine nature.</p>
                  <p>2. To comfort us, that he who so loved us, that he gave
himselfe for us, hath such sufficient strength to perfect our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
He useth this argument to comfort his Disciples.
<hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 28, 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. Christ gives us these things by his divine power,
when he doth effectually call us, through the knowledge of him that
calleth us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to apply our selves with
feare and reverence unto the meanes of our calling, because
Christs divine power is shewed therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. The consideration of the end whereunto we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Christ, should build us up in faith, hope, and all those things
which pertaine unto life and godlinesse.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Apostle here puts us in minde, that he hath
called us to glory and vertue; so in the former Epistle, c. 5.
v. 10. <hi>who hath called us unto his eternall glory, &amp;c.</hi> To that
purpose the Apostle <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 18. earnestly prayes for the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians,</hi>
that <hi>the eyes of their understanding may be enlightned, to
know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches, &amp;c.</hi>
Now this consideration is of great force for these reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because it is an argument confirming our faith,
whilest we thus thinke with our selves: If God hath called
us unto glory, then there is no doubt, but that he will in due
time bring us unto glory, and in the meane time keepe us in
the way that leadeth thereunto.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it is an argument whereby we are stirred up to
labour for vertue, whilest we thus thinke with our selves: if
we are called unto glory and vertue, we must not carry our
selves sordidly and basely, defiling our selves with the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the flesh, like Swine wallowing in the mire, but as it
becomes such a calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. There is the same reason of this calling and the
first gift of grace, that there is of the multiplying of all grace and
peace.</p>
                  <p>For they are alike free, they do depend alike upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62450:72"/>
power, they are alwayes knit and linked together: this
followes from the connexion of verse 3. with the second.</p>
                  <p>Vse. <hi>This may serve to comfort us, as it is set forth,</hi> Phil. 1.
6. That he which hath begun a good works in us, will performe it
untill the day of Christ.</p>

                           <hi>Verse</hi> 4. Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>THe Apostle had before confirmed his prayer and the hope
of the faithfull, touching the multiplying of grace and
peace, by the comparing of things alike, that is, from the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of all things which are necessary unto life &amp; godlinesse.
Now he confirmes and proves the assumption also, touching
the giving of things necessary to life and godlinesse. And the
argument is taken from the testimony of God, that is, from
Gods promises: for his promise is a testimony of the good
that he will bestow. Now while the Apostle disputes from
the promises to the gifts promised, he disputes from the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to the things testified, which kinde of argumentation
he doth sufficiently intimate, when he puts the things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in stead of the promise. And the things promised are thus
explained; 1. In generall, by two adjuncts, that they are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great and precious,</hi> that is neither concerning small
things, or things of little moment, nor concerning things,
that we have nothing to do with, or are little to be esteemed
by us, but things of exceeding great weight, and of exceeding
great price. 2. In speciall, by those effects, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in these things promised, and they are two. First, A
lifting up of the faithfull to perfection, which is explained by
a likenesse unto the divine nature. Secondly, A freeing of
them from corruption, which is set forth by the subject and
the cause thereof. The subject is the world, the cause is lust or
concupiscence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:62450:72"/>
The Doctrine arising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Gods promises carry in them the vertue of a gift.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because they make the thing promised certainly to
belong unto those, to whom it is promised. For although it
be not yet actually in their possession, yet it is that power that
is certainly produced into act. The cause is, 1. The truth of
God that promiseth. 2. The Divine Power which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
Gods promises, wherof mention was made in the former
verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute those that make Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
wholly to depend upon mans will.</p>
                  <p>2. To comfort all the faithfull, that they may be of good
courage, and have a firme hope in the good things that are
promised by God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2 Gods promises are of things exceeding great.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that the Scripture often speakes of the wondrous
things of Gods word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 18. And it evidently appears
by the things themselves, if they are well weighed and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
whether we look unto the divine properties which
breake forth in the things promised, or their divine effects.
For wonderfull is the mercy, and power, and providence
whereupon they depend; and the effects also are wonderfull,
for many of them are such, that they do so transcend mans
capacity, that they seeme unto many utterly unpossible and
incredible: as the resurrection, immortality, and life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne the stupidity of those,
that are nothing moved or taken with these things that are
so great and wonderfull.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to labour and strive in our prayers with
<hi>David,</hi> that our eyes may be more and more opened, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to see the wonderfull nature of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Gods promises are as precious unto us, as they are
great in themselves.</p>
                  <p>So they are distinguished: for if God had promised that
he would make another World, yet so, as that it should no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pertaine unto us, this indeed had been an exceeding
great promise, but nothing precious unto us; but when he
so promised a world to come, wherein immortality and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62450:73"/>
great glory shall dwell, as that we should possesse it, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is as precious as it is great. Hence it is, that in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
the testimonies of God are extolled, whose promises
are exceeding great above all riches, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 14. Above
gold and silver, and all precious things, as we often read in
the <hi>Psalmes</hi> and <hi>Proverbs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to exhort</hi> us, both in judgement,
affection and all our endeavour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, to carry our selves answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to these divine promises, as to the most precious thing
that is, as we are admonished, <hi>Prov. 2. 4. To seeke them as
silver, and search for them as for hid treasures. And Prov. 8.
10. to receive them, and not silver, &amp;c.</hi> And to be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with these then with the sweetest gifts, to get these
promises at any price, how great soever, though we sell all
that we have, as it is in the parable of the Merchant, who
found a precious Jewell.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To comfort</hi> those Christians that are poore in spirit, even in
this present world; for though they have nothing excellent in
these outward things, yet they have those exceeding great &amp;
precious things provided by God for them. They are in this
like unto that heire, of whom <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. By vertue of these promises we are made partakers
of the divine nature.</p>
                  <p>Now by nature is not meant the essence of God, but those
perfections, whereof we have a representation made by
the Spirit <hi>Epist. 1. c. 2. v.</hi> 9. They are called the vertues of
God, and in other places, it is called the life of God,
the Image of God, and the Spirit of God. And this nature
is communicated by vertue of the promises, because the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the Gospell in this differs from the Law, for the Law
considered in it selfe is a killing Letter, and the ministration
of death in respect of sinners, but the Gospell is the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the quickning Spirit 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because the Spirit of God together with the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
worketh our salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to direct us,</hi> to examine our selves
whether the promises of God have beene effectuall in us yet
or no? for if we have nothing in us above naturall men, or
our corrupt nature, wee are yet strangers to the promises
of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:62450:73"/>
2. To reprove those, that are wont to say, when they
are stirred up to Christian duties, that they are not Saints or
Angels, but flesh and blood, and therefore cannot either
abstaine from common vices, or come neere unto a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life. For Christians besides and above that nature, which
they have from <hi>Adam,</hi> are made partakers also of a divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whereby they are able to doe all things through him
that strengtheneth them, namely Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us, to labour with all diligence, that the
grace of God may be unto us like a second nature, as some
say of <hi>Custome.</hi> And so it will be, when we performe the
workes of grace and new obedience, not by constraint or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly,
as many use to doe, but with delight and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
as if we were carried hereunto by the inclination of
nature, as the fire is upward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The corruption of sinne is contrary both to this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Gods promises.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because the presence of the divine nature and the
vertue of the promises drives out this corruption, as heat
doth cold, &amp; as light dispells darkenesse, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 14, 15, 2 Pet.</hi>
2. 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve <hi>to condemne</hi> those, that will joyne
together these things that are so inconsistent and repugnant
and contrary to God himselfe, that is, those that joyne the
profession of Religion with most corrupt practise.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, if we believe the promises of God, and
love the divine nature to our own salvation, then to eschew
all these corruptions. Thus much the Apostle intimates,
when he saith: <hi>Having escaped the corruption,</hi> as if a flying
away were required, and that quickly, as it were from a fire,
wherein we are almost burned, or from a plague that rageth
in our houses, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 11. 2 Cor. 4. 1. Having received mercy,
let us not faint, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Chap. 7. v.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. This corruption of sinne beares rule in the world.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered herehence, because this is the true descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of corruption made by the Apostle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, 1 not to love the world
too much. This use the Apostle makes of it, 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is in the world.</p>
                  <p>For it is not from the fabrick of heaven and earth, nor in
any created substance, but in the naughty affections and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
together with the actions flowing therehence, so
that every man carries this world in his owne bowels. And
the reason why this wickednesse is signified by concupiscence
or lust, is:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because in mans conversion to worldly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

things, sinne is more manifest then in a simple aversion
from God.</p>
                  <p>2. Because this desire of unlawfull things is most contrary
to that affection, which we should have towards God, and
divine and heavenly things.</p>

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>Now the Apostle comes unto that which he chiefly aimed
at in this Epistle: and the scope of the Epistle is shewed
expresly, Chap. 3. verse 1. namely, <hi>to stirre up the pure mindes of
the faithfull, by way of remembrance;</hi> and verse the last, more
distinctly, <hi>that they should grow in grace, and in the knowledge of
our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> This same thing he proposeth in these
verses, 5. 6, 7. and confirmes it in the rest of the Chapter, and
in the two following Chapters, he vindicates it from those
things which crosse this purpose, namely, the seducings of
false teachers, chap. 2. and the derisions of prophane scoffers,
chap. 3. Now his scope and purpose, as it is explained in these
three verses, is, to exhort the faithfull, to apply themselves
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62450:74"/>
wholly to those duties that are answerable to the faith, which
they have obtained and do professe. And those duties are set
forth; 1. By the common conditions and all the properties
of the vertue and duty; and 2. By the species or kindes of
vertues and duties. The common conditions and properties
of vertue are foure, which are usually called cardinall vertues,
<hi>Iustice, Prudence, Temperance, and Fortitude.</hi> Justice is here
signified by the name of vertue, because it doth most neerely
belong to the efficacy of vertue, to be according to the rule,
which is generall justice. Prudence is signified by knowledge,
because prudence and Christian wisdome consists in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall
knowledge of Gods will. Temperance is called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
because this is generall temperance, if a man contains
himselfe or abstaines from those intisements, whereby he may
be withdrawne from his duty. Fortitude is meant here by
patience, because this is true Christian fortitude, patiently to
suffer all afflictions, and to persist in his duty notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all afflictions. These are such conditions, that they should
be in every duty, which if they be, they make every duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat;
nor can any of them be away, without hurting of
the vertue and duty. The kindes of duties are two: <hi>godlinesse,</hi>
which containes the duties of the first table; and <hi>charity,</hi>
which belongs unto the second table: which charity is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by a speciall manner, whilest it is called also <hi>brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love,</hi> whereby we love those, that are joyned in the same
faith with us. Concerning these duties the Apostle proposeth
first the common act, that we should use in them, namely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
as he saith, <hi>adde;</hi> Secondly, The manner how we should
use this act, namely, <hi>giving all diligence:</hi> where both the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and the degree is shewed; the manner, is <hi>diligence,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
is <hi>all diligence.</hi> Thirdly, the end and scope of the act and
duty in these words, <hi>besides this,</hi> or <hi>hereunto,</hi> that is, to that
end of which hee had spoken before, <hi>viz.</hi> that wee might be
made partakers of the Divine Nature, and have grace and peace
multiplyed.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Our endeavours must be joyned to our prayers,
and to the operation of Gods grace.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered herehence, that the Apostle saith; we
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62450:75"/>
must labour for that very thing which he wished unto us, and
so proposed unto us to be prayed for, and which he said the
grace of God did worke in us.</p>
                  <p>Our endeavours must be joyned unto our prayers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because otherwise we cannot have a sincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
in our prayers, without which our prayers are in vaine;
for what we sincerely desire, that also we do alwayes labour
to attaine.</p>
                  <p>2. Because our prayers themselves do bind us to such an
endeavour. For in every prayer there is a promise and vow,
wherein we promise unto God that we will seeke that which
we aske of him: so that to aske any thing of God without
such an endeavour, is not only to take Gods name in vaine,
but also plainly to mock his Majestie.</p>
                  <p>Our endeavours also must be joyned with the grace of God,
because grace tends thereunto, both to afford us strength to
endeavour, and also to stirre us up to exercise that strength.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove those slothfull men,
which wish for many things, and after their manner also ask
them of God, but yet will not move so much as their finger to
obtaine them: these men are like that slothfull man, that the
wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e man describes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. and elsewhere, where the
<hi>slothfull man carries his hand in his bosome,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, daily to be mindfull of this obligation,
when we pray unto God for the forgivenesse of our sinnes, for
deliverance from temptations, for newnesse of life, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, let us constantly also use our endeavours to attaine
these ends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Our endeavours must alwayes tend to the increase
of the grace which we have received.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that the summe of our duty
consists in adding: the reasons are divers;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because that is imperfect which we have: while
we remaine in this life, we are in a state of progresse and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
not of rest or perfection, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>2. Because that which we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eceived, is given unto us to
be an earnest, a pledge, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rst fruits of that which we
yet looke and seek for.</p>
                  <p>3. Because it cannot be, that we should rightly esteeme the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62450:75"/>
grace that we have received, if we do not labour to attaine the
highest degree thereof, but rest contented with the benefit that
we have received, and never look for any more of that kinde.</p>
                  <p>4. Because we cannot keepe that which we have received, if
we doe not labour to increase it; for as the vitall heat doth
alwayes either increase or decrease, and he that goes up a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-hill,
must still labour to get up, or else he will slide downe;
so it is in a Christian life.</p>
                  <p>5. Because we should do that unto God, which we would
have God doe unto us; for we would have God alwayes adde
unto those benefits and blessings which he bestoweth upon us;
we therefore should likewise adde unto those duties which
we performe unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne those, that rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with that which they have, and never seeke farther, and
much more those, that by diminishing and losing, waste and
consume that which they had, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. 4. This may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
by the parable of the talents.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to exercise a holy kinde of covetousnesse
in these spirituall things; for as covetous men joyne house to
house, field to field, <hi>Isay</hi> 5. 8. so should we also joyne faith to
faith, obedience to obedience, charity to charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. We must use our endeavours about these spirituall
things with all diligence.</p>
                  <p>Now by all diligence is meant, 1. The greatest heedfulnesse
of the minde. 2. The greatest earnestnesse of the will. 3. The
greatest care, that is intimated by that phrase, whereby wee
are commanded, to <hi>seeke the kingdome of God and the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof.</hi> For when Christ had told them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 31.
that they should not be carefull what they should eat, or what
they should drink, he explaines this care, verse 32, 33. by the
phrase of <hi>seeking.</hi> 4. A diligence in the use of the meanes,
whereby we may come to attaine that which we desire. And
the reasons why we should use this diligence about spirituall
things, are,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. The dignity and excellency of these things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all earthly things, which worldly men are so busie
about.</p>
                  <p>2. The difficulty, for in their nature they are above our
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62450:76"/>
strength, and there are many impediments also, as well inward
as outward, which we cannot overcome, but by using all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
                  <p>3. The necessity of these things, without which we are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
wretches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove the slothfull and slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish
Christians, that are so remisse, so cold and luke-warme at
least in these things, which require so great diligence. Here
appeares the crossenesse of mans disposition: for when God
hath forbidden us, to be over-carefull about worldly things,
because all these things should be added unto us without such
care; and hath commanded us, to be diligent and carefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
spirituall things, because we shall never be partakers of
them without diligence; we on the contrary are carefull and
diligent about the world, and neglect Heaven.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, by all meanes daily to stir up our selves,
and to provoke one another to this so necessary d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ligence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Faith is the fountaine and beginning of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
vertue.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the text. Because faith is here laid as
the foundation upon which all vertues are to be built.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because without faith no man can please God
unto everlasting life, and therefore the very vertues of unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
although they be pleasing unto God in themselves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
if a comparison be made betwixt them and vices, yet
they are not pleasing unto God unto salvation, or such as that
they may expect a spirituall reward from God; and therefore
if a comparison be made betwixt them and the vertues of the
faithfull, they may not unfitly be called, <hi>splendid peccata,</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
sinnes.</p>
                  <p>2. Because to the making up of vertue there is required not
only good matter and forme, but also the beginning and end.
Now in a heart destitute of faith there is not the beginning of
Christian vertue, and from the defect of this beginning there
followes also a defect, both in the end, and in the forme. The
manner how faith produceth vertue, is, 1. In regard of the
object which it layes hold of, because all grace and vertue is
derived from Christ. 2. In regard of the effect, because faith
purifies the heart of man, and so makes it fit for such operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62450:76"/>
and dispositions. 3. Because faith it selfe is an impulsive
argument, moving us to labour for vertue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove those imprudent builders,
that neglect faith and seeke for vertue, as if they would build
the roofe of the house, and not lay the foundation.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to have great care of faith, because all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
depend upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Vertue is the glory of faith.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that it is said, it must be added
to faith as something belonging to the perfection thereof.
Now it is not an essentiall perfection, but complementall;
not internall properly, but externall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because faith without vertue is not a living, but
a dead faith.</p>
                  <p>2. Because vertue is the end of faith.</p>
                  <p>3. Because it is the adorning thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove those, that boast of faith
and neglect vertue, such were many even in the Apostles time,
as appeares by the Epistle of <hi>Iames.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to give all diligence, to adde vertue to
faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. The perfection of vertue depends upon knowledge.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from that; <hi>To vertue adde knowledg.</hi> By
knowledge we meane, not so much that intellectuall vertue,
which is properly called <hi>scientia,</hi> knowledge, as understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
wisdome, and prudence, all which are signified in the
Scriptures by the right <hi>knowledge of Gods will.</hi> Now this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is necessary unto vertue both in generall and particular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because <hi>virtus est habitus electivus,</hi> vertue is an
habit pertaining to election, or hath good election joyned
with it. Now to this election it is required, that a man should
rightly know the end, and also the meanes that lead unto the
end, and the manner also how he may come to the end by
those meanes.</p>
                  <p>2. Because <hi>actiones virtutum versantur in particularibus,</hi>
the actions of vertues are in particulars, and therefore it is not
sufficient to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>udge aright of good and evill i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> generall, unlesse
that judgement be also applyed to particular actions, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their circumstances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:62450:77"/>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove those, that please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their ignorance, as if ignorance were the mother of
devotion, or of any vertue, whereas it is the greatest enemy to
vertue, and the mother of all profanenesse, especially if it be
voluntary, as <hi>Peter</hi> shewes, Epist. 2. Chap 3. verse 5. Where
he gives a reason of their great wickednesse, because those
scoffers of whom he speaks, were willingly ignorant of those
things which pertaine unto true godlinesse.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to seeke for knowledge, and when wee
have gotten it to apply it also to the increase of vertue. For
vertue without knowledge is blinde, and knowledge without
vertue is vaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. Continence or temperance is the perfection of
knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Now by continence and temperance we meane a modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereby all lusts are suppressed that might allure or
withdraw us to any thing that is contrary to vertue and
knowledge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because knowledge tends to such a moderation
and governement of the affections.</p>
                  <p>2. Because knowledge it selfe cannot subsist without this
moderation. For unlesse the affections are directed by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
knowledge it selfe is corrupted by the affections: hence
it is, that many errours and heresies oftentimes take their
rise and beginning from evill manners and affections, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
4. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove those, that are puffed up
with knowledge, when in the meane time they shew by their
intemperance that they know nothing yet, as they ought to
know, 1 <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to use all our knowledge to the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

perfection of vertue.</p>
                  <p>By patience we meane that grace whereby we continue and
persist in well-doing, although we are crossed by many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
things. Therefore it includes in it patience, constancy,
and stablenesse of minde, or Christian fortitude. Continence
strengthens vertue against alluring intisements, and patience
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62450:77"/>
against all adversity, so that vertue is quite perfected, if it be
grounded on faith, directed by knowledge, and strengthened
on the one side by continence, and on the other side by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>

whole and intire.</p>

                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because it hath the noblest object, that is, God
himselfe.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it doth most of all perfect all other vertues,
whiles it refers them and all their acts to a divine beginning,
and a divine end. For godlinesse subjects the minde to God
in all things, so that it acknowledgeth God to be the author
of all good, <hi>from whom every good and perfect gift commeth,</hi> and
makes him the chiefest good and the last end to whom all our
actions are to be directed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove those, that attribute so
much to some morall and humane vertues, that they preferre
them before godlinesse.</p>

in publick and in private, to increase this godlinesse in our

towards our neighbour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because godlinesse it selfe commands and begets
this love. For we love our neighbour with Christian love,
when we love him for Gods sake, not for our own, or any
worldly respect. Now godlinesse produceth this love towards
our neighbour, 1 Because it teacheth us to obey Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
who hath commanded us to love our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
2 Because it teacheth us to love the image of God, and
every gift of God in our neighbour. 3 Because it brings us to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62450:78"/>
imitate God himselfe in the communicating of good. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
godlinesse, which is separated from charity, is not true
godlinesse; and that charity which is separated from godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
is not true charity, but either hypocrisie, or some hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
civility.</p>

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to exhort us, to shew and adorne our
godlinesse towards God, by our love towards our neighbour.</p>
                  <p>2. To reprove those, that make shew of much godlinesse
towards God, when in the meane time they take all occasions
to wrong their neighbours, if so be they might by any means
advantage themselves thereby.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 11. This love should be extended unto all men, but
chiefly to be used towards the brethren.</p>
                  <p>For so they are distinctly set downe, verse 7. <hi>Brotherly
kindnesse and charity:</hi> Both of these is proper and peculiar to
Christians. For the Christian alone loves all, even his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and he alone also loves the brethren, that is, the house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
of faith. We should love all, 1. As they are partakers
of the same naturall good with us. 2. As they are capable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of the same spirituall good. And we should love the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
also, as they are partakers of the same spirituall good
with us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to edifie our selves in this

                  <p>HEre the Apostle begins to confirme the exhortation,
which he had before made, to adde vertue to faith, and
knowledge, &amp;c. And he confirmes it by a twofold argument;
1. The first is taken from the benefit which is joyned to these
vertues, whereunto he exhorte them. 2. The second from the
disprofit, which followes the privation or absence of them.
The first is laid downe, verse 8. the second verse 9. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62450:78"/>
proposed is contained in these words, <hi>they make you that ye
shall neither be barren nor unfruitfull:</hi> where by a negation is
meant the contrary affirmation, namely, that by these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
they shall be quick and active, and also fruitfull; which
benefits are explained by the primary efficient cause, which is
the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; and the secondary
cause, which are the vertues themselves whereunto he exhorts
them. And these vertues he explaines according to that way
which he had intimated before in the exhortation, touching
the manner, and touching the degree: touching the manner,
that they <hi>be in you;</hi> touching the degree, that <hi>they abound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There are spirituall benefits arising from vertues,
whereby the faithfull are stirred up to labour for vertue.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the scope of this verse, and from the
connexion which it hath with the former exhortation. These
benefits are such, that they cannot be understood by carnall
and worldly men; but the faithfull do not only understand
them, but also seeke for them with great and continuall dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
Otherwise this argument which the Apostle useth to
the faithfull, would have beene altogether uneffectuall. But
these benefits are such, that they make men rich, not in this
world, but in the Lord, 1 <hi>Tim 6. 18. Luke</hi> 12. 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to reprove those earthly men, which
are not moved with such arguments, but covet the gaine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
and pleasures of this life, and savour not those things that
belong to the kingdome of God.</p>

                     </hi> It is a great benefit to the faithfull, and so they
esteeme it, if they can be ready to do good works.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from that, <hi>they make you that ye shall not be
barren,</hi> that is, not idle or slothfull in the profession of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because it is the greatest misery for men to be
reprobate unto good workes.</p>
                  <p>2. Because by this readinesse to do good, the faithfull
come to obtaine their desires.</p>
                  <p>3. Because by this meanes the life spirituall is exercised and
increased. For as all life is the beginning of operation, and
tends unto operation, so also is it increased by operations.</p>

                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:62450:79"/>
4. Because the glory of God, wherein consists the chiefest
good, and mans happinesse, is by this meanes advanced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove those foolish and sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Christians, that neglect their owne proper good, or rather
do not understand what that is wherein it consists.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, by all meanes to make our selves ready to
do good, and therefore according to the minde of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
in this place, to get all vertue, <hi>that we may not be barren in
the knowledge of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Good workes are fruits that the faithfull should
continually bring forth.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that fruitfulnesse is both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
and promised in this place. It is required therein, that
the Apostle intimates, that this is necessary for the faithfull,
to be fruitfull. It is promised thereby, that it is made as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
arising from vertues. Good workes are called <hi>fruits</hi> by a
metaphor, for the likenesse that they have unto the fruits of
trees and plants. Now in naturall fruit many things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
which according to the Scripture must be applyed
unto good workes. 1. That it be something agreeable to the
nature of the seed from which it ariseth. 2. That it hath noe
only some good in it, but also perfections; hence flowers and
leaves are not wont to be called fruits, although they come
from the same seed that the fruits do, and be the last two that
comes forth, and hath in it that perfection, that it is the end
both of the seed, and all other things that arise from the seed
before the fruit. 3. It is required also, especially in those
that arise from good husbandry, that there be something that
is de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>red and expected and will be acceptable to the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and master, or owner. All these things in the Scriptures
are to be applyed unto good works, 1. That they be agreeable
to the word of God, which is the seed, as it is in the Parables
<hi>Matth. 13. Marke</hi> 4. of the good seed: and good workes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ares, as grapes differ from wildegrapes, <hi>Isay</hi> 5. 2.
2. That they have goodnesse in them. For bad workes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are properly fruits according to Scripture, unlesse it be
with an addition, <hi>evill fruits.</hi> Nor do they bring any fruit to
their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 21. They must also have perfection in
their kinde: for as the seeds which are said in the parable to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62450:79"/>
arise, perhaps unto the eare, yet because they did not come to
just perfection, are said to have brought forth no fruits: so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
Christians, which have only the flowers and leaves of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and not the solid workes of godlinesse, are accounted
by God unfruitfull and barren plants. 3. Our workes also
must answer the expectation of God, and that care which he
hath taken in manuring our soules, <hi>Isay 5. 2. Luke</hi> 13. 6, 7. &amp;
20. 10. Although in all these things our good workes and
fruits are alike, yet one thing may be observed, wherein they
are unlike; namely, that whereas the profit of naturall fruits
is wont to returne to the husbandman and master, the profit
of these fruits redounds properly to those that beare them,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>2. Although hence also something redounds unto
God our master, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne those, that bring forth
no fruit, <hi>Matthew 3. 10. Iohn 15. 2. Luke</hi> 13. 7. Much more
are they to be condemned, that are like unto the cursed
ground, and in steed of fruits bring forth thornes and briers,
<hi>Hebr. 6. 8. Deut.</hi> 32. 32.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, by all meanes to labour to bring forth
good fruits, and so also that they may be answerable unto
those meanes which God used towards us, to make us fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
according to Gods expectation, and in that season where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God expects them, and in that measure also which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
of some thirty, of some sixty, and of some an hundred
fold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Without these fruits the knowledge of God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</p>
                  <p>For it is as it were choaked with thornes, or withered
away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, to be so much the
more carefull to bring forth fruit, that we may not heape up
this sinne of barrennesse unto the other, by making the word
of God void and of no effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. That we may be fruitfull, vertues must not only
be in us, but also abound in us.</p>
                  <p>They are in us when we have gotten a habit of them; they
abound, when we do seriously and diligently endeavour to
make that habit more perfect.</p>

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>THis is the second argument whereby the exhortation of
the Apostle is confirmed; and it is taken from the dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
that befall all those that are strangers to these vertues. And
these disprofits are contrary to those profits whereof mention
was made in the former verse. For the Apostle would say that
they which have not these vertues, are quite barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull.
But he doth not barely expresse this, but sets it forth
by the causes thereof. And the causes are two, blindnesse and
forgetfulnesse. For he that is blinde, must needs be barren and
unfruitfull, and unfit to do those businesses especially, which
require the eye sight: and he that forgets the benefit which
he hath received, it is no wonder, if he bring forth no fruit
worthy of that benefit. Their forgetfulnesse is set forth by the
object or benefit which they should remember, that is, their
purification from their old sinnes. By blindnesse in this
place is meant, not the privation of their corporall sight, or
of their naturall understanding, but of that spirituall perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
whereby we come to the saving knowledge of those
things that pertaine to the kingdome of God, and our eternall
life. By those things that are <hi>farre off,</hi> are meant things truly
spirituall which as touching their nature and condition, are
as farre off from carnall men as heaven is from earth.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising here-hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. All that are destitute of vertue are spiritually
blinde.</p>
                  <p>They are blinde in a twofold respect. 1. In respect of that
naturall blindnesse, wherein all the sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are born,
like that man that was blinde from his birth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 1 And
secondly, in respect of another adventitious blindnesse, which
they have brought upon themselves by their sinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through
the just judgement of God blinding those that will not see,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62450:80"/>
like that sorcerer, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 11. upon whom the hand of the
Lord seemes to have beene, to blinde him. The former blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
goes before as the cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the neglect of vertue; the
other followes as the effect. And both of them appeares by
those signes that corporall blindnesse doth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because those men know not the speciall way
wherein they should go.</p>
                  <p>2. They cannot see those stumbling-blocks that lye in the
way, but continually stumble and fall.</p>
                  <p>3. They cannot so much as discerne the colours of those
things which they handle, and therefore as it is, <hi>Isay 5. 20.
They call evill good, and good evill, &amp;c.</hi> And one thing there
is that addes to their misery more then is in those that are
corporally blinde; namely, that they seeke not fit guides to
leade them, as it is said of the sorcerer, that he did, <hi>Acts 13.
11.</hi> for either they trust wholly to themselves, because they
doe not know that they are blinde, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 17. or else they
follow some blinde guide, so that both fall into the ditch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, to acknowledge
our spirituall blindnesse, and to labour to get out of it. For it
is in every one of us either in whole or in part. We should
therefore thinke with our selves how great a misery it is to
continue in perpetuall darknesse and in a most thick myst.
Christ wept over Jerusalem for this their blindnesse.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us earnestly to pray unto God, who can open
the eyes of our minde. The blinde man, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 38. never
ceased to cry out, saying, <hi>Iesus thou Sonne of David have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on me,</hi> and when Christ asked him, what he would that
he should do unto him, he desired nothing else, but that he
might receive his sight, verse 41. So also in spirituall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

and sinne and brings misery along with it.</p>
                  <p>For it is here attributed unto those, that are strangers unto
vertue, not only as a sinne, but also as a great disprofit, and is
opposed to that fruitfulnesse wherein the happinesse of the
faithfull doth consist. It is a sinne, because it containes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
in it, and that not the least degree of ingratitude; for
though a man be mindfull of the benefit which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
purposing to be thankfull for it, yet if he doth not render
thankes, he is said to be ungratefull; yea, and though he doth
render thankes, if he doth it coldly, and doth not endeavour
to answer the merits of him that bestowed this benefit upon
him, and the dignity of the benefit, he is not yet free from
this vice; but if he doth quite forget the benefit which he hath
received, then he is rightly said to be as it were twice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull.</p>

so that there is no <hi>medium</hi> betweene them. <hi>Deut. 32.
18.</hi> The Israelites are said to have forgotten God for that
reason only, because they had forsaken the true worship of
God, and his due obedience, as it is explained, verse 15. So
<hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 13. where they are said to have forgotten God and
his workes as, often as they murmured against him, although
there is no doubt but if they had beene asked, they could have
easily related the whole history of those things that God
hath done for them in Egypt. After the like manner are the
words of Christ to be understood, when he asked his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
whether they had forgotten the miracle of the five loaves
and two fishes, intimating that it was a manifest token of their
forgetfulnesse, that they were at that time so troubled about
bread.</p>

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, not to rest satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with such a memory as consists in bare contemplation,
which God accounts forgetfulnesse.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, by all meanes to study this art of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:</p>
                  <p>Which that we may the better do, let us observe these
Rules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 1. That we do not slightly passe over the thought of
these things, but look narrowly into the natures and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of them. For the more plainly we come to understand
them, the more firmely do we retaine them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 2. That having come to such a cleare knowledge of
them, we should also call them to minde, so as to consider
the efficacy of them; for the more they worke upon the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
the stronger is the impression upon the memory:
thence is it, that children are wont to remember many things,
which others forget, because they use to admire all things as
new and strange; and wee also doe not easily forget those
things which we admire, as being things wherewith we are
much taken, <hi>Psal. 119. 16. I will delight my selfe in thy statutes,</hi>
there is the affection; <hi>and I will not forget thy word,</hi> there is the
memory flowing from the affection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 3. That we should alwayes carry a memoriall with
us, whereby the memory of these things may be kept, <hi>Numb.
16. 40. This is a memoriall.</hi> Now our memoriall is the word
of God chiefly, which in that respect we should daily read
and meditate upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Our purification from sinne is a benefit never to
be forgotten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 1. Because it is very great in it selfe and its owne
nature, seeing by it we are freed from the guilt and dominion
of sinne, from the the curse of the law, from the anger of God
and eternall death.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it is of great force and efficacy to stirre us up to
labour to be thankfull, and to abound in vertue, as here it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the manner of arguing, which the Apostle useth.
For that cause also <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12. 1. and in other places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
the faithfull <hi>by the mercies of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne those, that do either
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62450:82"/>
not think at all upon the mercy of God, and redemption
through Christ; or else turne it into an occasion of sinne.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, daily to meditate upon this benefit, and
not to satisfie our selves, unlesse we are daily stirred up by this
argument to the practise of piety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. All the sinnes from which we are purged in Christ,
must be accounted old, that is, out of use, forsaken, dead, never to
be taken up againe.</p>

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>IN these word is contained the conclusion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
exhortation, as it is intimated in the first word,
<hi>Wherefore.</hi> Now because the conclusion and the question
must alwayes be the same, as touching the thing it selfe,
although they differ in some respects, there is no doubt but
the Apostle here concludes the same thing, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
verse 5. propounded to himselfe to be concluded, <hi>viz.
That they should give all diligence to adde to their faith vertue,</hi>
&amp;c. And as repetitions in the Scripture are not wont to be
vaine, nor bare, but for the most part with some usury or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease;
so also in this place he doth not barely repeat the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
to labour for vertue, but he doth illustrate this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
and labour by the proper office thereof, that is, by
the confirmation of our calling and election; so that he doth
both repeat the exhortation, and also adde a new argument,
and that a most weighty one, to presse it the more, after this
manner: <hi>If by the exercise of good workes ye make your election
and calling sure, then should ye most of all apply your selves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
but the former is true, Therefore.</hi> The assumption is laid
downe in the text, and proved by a double argument. 1. By
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62450:82"/>
removing the contrary or Apostasie, which is most opposite
to the assurance of ou election and calling; and is alike op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
also to the exercise of vertue and good workes, which
is shewed in these words: <hi>If ye do these things, ye shall never fall:</hi>
wherein is such a reason contained, if ye shall never fall, then
ye will have your calling sure. The second argument is taken
from the felicity adjoyned, which is set forth by the proper
cause thereof, that is, <hi>by the abundant entrance into the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kingdome of Christ.</hi> And this argument strengthens both
the conclusion and also the foregoing argument, after this
manner: <hi>If ye have abundant entrance into the everlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ, then ye shall never fall, but hold your calling sure;
But if ye labour to be vertuous and to do good workes, ye shall have
abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdome of Christ: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if ye labour to be vertuous and to do good workes, ye shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fall, but have your calling sure.</hi> But before we consider
the conclusion it selfe which the Apostle layes downe, there
comes the manner to be observed, how he doth propound it,
that so it may worke the deeper. Now the manner is shewed
in that title which he gives unto the faithfull, when he cals
them <hi>brethren,</hi> which is not only a title of good will, but of
some speciall and singular love, such as useth to be betwixt
these men that are most neerly joyned together.</p>
                  <p>Obser. <hi>Here we may observe in generall,</hi> That our exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
must be seasoned with love and good will; <hi>but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
it affords us this Observation,</hi> That there is not a more
brotherly office, then to stirre up and bring those that we love, to
labour and endeavour to lead a Christian life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because by this meanes they are delivered from
the greatest evils, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they are made partakers of the greatest good, as
it appeares in the text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, to take in good
part such exhortations and admonitions that are given us,
whether they be in publick or in private.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to season our exhortations and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
after this manner, and so to be more frequent in these
duties. For oftentimes he that neglects these duties, shewes
that he doth hate his brother and is his enemy; they being

proper to brethren, and the neerest and dearest friends, <hi>Levit.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The assurance of our calling and election i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>thing
greatly to be desired.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the text: because <hi>Peter</hi> in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
presupposeth some such desire in the faithfull, and
then stirres them up to a more fervent and earnest desire of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because our happinesse and all spirituall good
things are greatly to be desired, and they depend upon this
assurance of our calling and election. For election is the free
love of God, whereby he intends saving grace, or superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
blessings unto u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Our calling is the manifestation of
that love by the application of this saving grace. The assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of both consists, 1. in Gods unchangeable purpose,
2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. The foundation of God standeth sure.</hi> 2. In the
effectuall operation, which those blessings of God have in
us, as in that place of <hi>Timothy, that foundation hath this seale,
that whosoever cals on the name of Christ, should depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
3.</hi> In assurance of faith, confidence, and experimentall
knowledge, which we come to have both of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ds purpose
towards us, and the effectuall and saving operation thereof in
our hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne those that have no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
at all unto these spirituall good things, but rest well
pleased in the things of this world. They are like unto the
rebellious Israelites, who more desired the Onions and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
of Egypt, then the Milke and Honey of the promised
Land, or the celestiall Manna, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 5, 6. They are farre
worse then the Prodigall Sonne, if they alwayes rest satisfied
with the Sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nes husks, and never desire the bread that is in
their fathers house, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 16. 17.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to labour for a spirituall hunger and
thirst after these spirituall good things: God himselfe
shewes us the best meanes, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, when he would stirre up the
people of Israel to desire the promised land, forthwith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto them the riches of the land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherewith it did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound:
so also should we alwayes set before our eyes those
innumerable blessings, which depend upon our calling and
election.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:62450:83"/>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. It belongs to our duty to make this our calling and
election sure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Give diligence.</hi> Not as they are in the purpose of God,
but as they havean effectuall operation in us, whereby they
are certainly manifested and sealed unto us; and this is the
reason why our calling is set before election: for although
election be eternall in God, and our calling be in time; yet
we come to know our calling before our election, and the
knowledge of our election depends upon the effectualnesse of
our calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because although God himselfe causeth this,
yet he doth it partly by morall perswasions and by those
meanes wherein our endeavour is required.</p>
                  <p>2. Because there ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> no effects of our calling and election,
which are not also our effects, because God makes us to doe
them.</p>
                  <p>3. Because that very thing which God doth in this kinde,
we are in some sort said to doe, if we beg it of him by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
prayer.</p>
                  <p>4. Because Gods confirmation of it is such, that it requires
also the like confirmation of us. God confirmes our calling
and election by his promise, his covenant, Sacraments, oath,
and spirituall pledge: And these things do in like manner
require of us our promise, and vow, to cleave unto God, our
covenant, faith, and endeavour, and all those things whereby
we may be confirmed in that communion which we have
with God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to comfort us, because the certainty
and assurance of our calling and election is not only possible
for us to attaine unto, but also commanded us; so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more pleasing unto God, then that we should labour
to be more and more assured of these things: for this is the
end both of the promise and the precept.</p>
                  <p>2. To reprove those, that either altogether neglect this
primary duty of the faithfull, or take such slight care of it, that
they must n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eds alwayes waver in their minds touching those
things whereof they should be most assured. Dangerous is that
doctrine of the Papists, that holds mens minds alwayes in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense,
both in life and death. For in life they accuse this
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62450:84"/>
firme confidence of presumption, and in death they leave
wretched men in doubt, how long they shall be tormented in
Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us to this labour and diligence; and indeed
this indeavour is inseparable from a true and lively <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith: for
look how it is amongst men; if one did beleeve that he had an
inheritance left him by his Father, or any other, he would
never be at quiet, till he had gotten it assured unto him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the lawes and customes of the countrey wherein
he lives, so is it with the faithfull also touching these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
good things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. All those, and those alone, make their election
sure, that make their calling sure.</p>
                  <p>These two God hath joyned together, as the Apostle doth
in this place, so that no man ought or may dis-joyne them.
Hence election and calling are taken sometimes in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
for one and the same, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26, 27. that which is
called <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lling,</hi> verse 26. is called <hi>election,</hi> verse 27. There is
indeed an outward and ineffectuall calling, which is many
times separated from election, as when it is said, <hi>Many are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

alwayes a sure connexion with election, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

2. They are the causes of that knowledge which we have
of our calling and election. For the knowledge and assurance
of these things depends upon the reflex act of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
whereby we see in our selves the markes and signes
of effectuall calling, and consequently of eternall election.
Hence this assurance increaseth and decreaseth in us, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as our endeavour to abound in vertues, and to do good
workes is greater or lesser.</p>

                  <p>2. To condemne those, that from this doctrine of the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of election, take occasion to cast off all care of piety:
these are they that the Apostle speaks of, <hi>c. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> v. 16. who being
unlearned and unstable, wrest the Scriptures unto their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</hi>
Although the election of God be sure in it selfe,
yet no man is sure of it without the practice of piety. Then
againe the certainty of election that is in God, makes this
certaine, that no man shall ever be saved by vertue of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
unlesse there be in him the practise of piety: such words
or thoughts are certaine tokens of a profane soule, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cares for election nor salvation, nor hath any feare of
God. For whereas it is alike certaine with God, how long
every one of us shall live in this world, yet there is non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t
cares not for his life, or useth not the meanes to live, unlesse
he be quite mad: so from the certainty of election none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
after such a manner, unlesse he be altogether profane.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us, to stirre up our selves more and more to
do these things, whereby we shall receive so great fruit and
benefit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. By labouring to do these things we are fore-armed
against the dangers of all temptations.</p>
                  <p>If ye do these things, ye shall never fall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because we are never led into temptation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our owne fault, and consequently without the neglect of
this duty.</p>
                  <p>2. We are never led into temptation, unlesse we have first
tempted God, by forsaking those meanes, whereby we might
be upheld and preserved.</p>

3. God can and will defend those that flye unto him, and
that seeke him in his wayes. Hither tend those frequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
such as are <hi>Psal. 15. the last words,</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. The more we are freed from the fals of sinne, the
more are we assured of our calling and election.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the opposition, which is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the assurance of our calling and our fals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> The reason is taken from the contrariety; for like
as the more the darknesse is dispelled, the more the light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth,
and on the contrary; so is it in these things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. Look what progresse we makein grace and vertue,
so much progresse do we make in glory and happinesse.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the connexion of the eleventh verse
with the former, the force whereof consists in this, that by
adding vertue unto faith, and knowledge unto vertue, we shall
adde also something unto that participation, which we have
in the kingdome of God: where it is to be observed that the
same word is used in this eleventh verse, where he speakes of
glory, that was used, verse 5. where he spake of vertue; there
it was <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> The reason is, because as in evill the sinne is never
separated from the punishment, but in the sinne it selfe there
is the spot or blemish, which is like unto misery; so also in
good the obedience and vertue is never separated from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
For it hath alwayes joyned with it that consolation
which pertaines to the reward of happinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This may serve to comfort us against the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this life; for although the faithfull receive no reward
from this world, by reason of the iniquity of men, but hatred,
disgrace, contempt, and persecutions: yet they may rest well
contented in this, that they shall not only receive an ample
reward in the life to come, but also they shall receive it in some
sort in this life present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 10. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. 29.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us to labour to increase in piety, for as much
as this labour is not in vaine, but hath its reward even in this
present world, 1 <hi>Cor. 15 last.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct</hi> 8. This happinesse consists in being made partakers
of the everlasting kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>kingdome of God</hi> is meant properly that condition
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62450:85"/>
into which the faithfull are translated by their effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
now seeing there are no degrees of this condition, this
kingdome is distinguished into the kingdome of <hi>grace,</hi> and the
kingdome of <hi>glory.</hi> Into the kingdome of <hi>grace,</hi> because the
preaching and ministery of the Gospell is the efficient cause
thereof, therefore the Gospell it selfe is called in Scripture <hi>the
kingdome of God,</hi> and because the Church is the proper sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of this state and condition, therefore the Church is also
called <hi>the kingdome of God;</hi> and because spirituall grace hath
the chiefe part in this condition, therefore that also is called
the <hi>kingdome of God, Rom.</hi> 14 17. but most properly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
it selfe is <hi>the kingdome of God.</hi> And it is compared to a
kingdome rather then to a Democracy or Aristocracy, or any
other society.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because of the dignity and splendour which it
hath.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the rule or governement is in the power of one.
For although it is called sometimes the kingdome of God,
sometimes the kingdome of our Lord Jesus Christ, as in this
place; yet they are not made two Kings as touching the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
but thereby it is shewed that he hath a singular charge
in this kingdome.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the lawes and edicts of this society are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kingly and Monarchicall; the seales also, and all things
that pertaine to this government, beare the effigies as it were,
or image of one King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to comfort the faithfull, who should
think with them selves, and often call to minde, unto what a
great happinesse they are called. For that which <hi>David</hi> said
heretofore, 1 <hi>Sam. 18. 23. Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a
kings sonne in law?</hi> that may all the faithfull say of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in respect of this kingdome, that it is not a light thing
to be made Citizens of this kingdome, and especially seeing
we are poore and vile creatures, the greater will our comfort
be, when we consider the glory and eternity of this kingdome.
The glory is such that the kingdomes of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi>
even in the greatest glory that ever they had, were but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
representations and shadowes as it were of this kingdome.
For they were but types of it. So great is the glory of this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62450:86"/>
kingdome, that all the Citizens and Subjects thereof are in
some sort Kings, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 6. The eternity is such, that neither
in whole nor in part is it lyable unto an end, or any essentiall
change. Compare all the kingdomes of the <hi>Persians, Medes,</hi>
and <hi>Grecians,</hi> all which are abolished; this kingdome of God
alone continues for ever.</p>
                  <p>2. To reprove those, that professe themselves Christians,
and yet live so as if they were under no lawes, &amp; did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no King. For as this is reckoned as the cause that the
Israelites did runne into all kind of wickednesse, because there
was no king in Israel, but every one did that which was right
in his owne eyes, <hi>Iudges 17. 6. &amp;</hi> 18. 1. So also do these men as
it were proclaime, that they neither acknowledge Christ nor
God for their King, while they do that which seemes right in
their own eyes, not caring whether it do please God, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
him. Such men must expect that sentence of Christ,
which is laid downe, <hi>Luke 19. 27. Those mine enemies which
would not that I should reigne over them, bring hither and slay
them before me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. To exhort all to seeke this kingdome of God above all
other things, according as Christ bids us; <hi>first seeke the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God.</hi> And not only the happinesse of those that are
admitted to be partakers of this kingdome, but also the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y
of all those that are excluded from it, should be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to perswade hereunto: for there are two spirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and every man must needs be a subject of one of them:
the kingdome of light and the kingdome of darknesse; the
kingdome of righteousnesse and grace, and the kingdome of
sinne; the kingdome of God, and the kingdome of the Devill,
who is called the Prince of this world. All those that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
out of the kingdome of God, of grace and salvation,
are necessarily included in the kingdome of the Devill, sinne
and darknesse; and deservedly doth this befall all unbeleevers
and impenitent men, according to that commination, <hi>Deut.</hi>
28. 45.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. The faithfull must seeke not only to have an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the kingdome of God, but also an entrance in a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and abundant manner.</p>
                  <p>Men may be considered to be in a fourefold condition in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62450:86"/>
respect of the kingdome of God. For some are very farre off
from it: namely, such as the Apostle speaks of, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12.
<hi>That are without Christ, and without God, aliens from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
of Israel, strangers from the covenants of promise:</hi>
such are all those that either understand nothing at all of those
things which pertaine unto this kingdome, or else nothing
care for them, having their consciences feared as it were with
a hot iron, as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. Others there are
which come neere unto the kingdome of God, although they
are not partakers of it, such as that Scribe was of whom Christ
saith, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 34. that <hi>he was not farre from the kingdome of
God;</hi> and King <hi>Agrippa, Acts</hi> 26. 28. Others there are that
enter into the kingdome of God by faith and repentance,
<hi>Iohn 3. 3. He that is borne againe seeth the kingdome of God,</hi> that
is, <hi>he enters into it,</hi> as it is, verse 5. But then againe others there
are, (with whom also in that respect God is very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,)
that do not only enter into it, but enter in a plentifull
and abundant manner, as in this place. The difference betwixt
these two last sorts is such, as is betwixt those that make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
only into the borders of a countrey, and those that go
even into the most inward parts of it: or as is betwixt those
that make entrance only into a discipline, and those that have
throughly learned, and do exercise the very mysteries thereof.
This Doctrine is confirmed, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is that in <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because these spirituall things are such, that they
can never exceed measure: there is nothing in them too much.</p>
                  <p>2. They are of such a nature, that they do whet and stirre
up the desire, so that whosoever hath tasted the sweetnesse of
them, doth still desire to be more and more filled with them,
untill he shall come to the highest perfection, as we may see in
their examples, who in this respect are most commended in
Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove and condemne those,
to whom the bare profession of piety seemes to be enough and
too much, that feare lest they should be too godly, that is, lest
they should be too happy: this is a certaine token of a carnall
minde.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, 1. To give God thanks, that he hath not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62450:87"/>
only admitted us into the suburbs, as it were, and gates of
this kingdome, but hath also revealed unto us those things
which are more inward and secret. 2. To be diligent and
carefull, that we do not neglect or despise so great grace, but
day by day earnestly to strive to make a greater progresse in
this kingdome, which we shall do, if we be more diligent and
religious in those exercises, whereby this kingdome is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>IN the former words the Apostle had given a reason of his
exhortation, why all the faithfull should imbrace it: and in
these words he gives a reason of the same, why he should use
it unto them; which reason he delivers by way of anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereby he meets with a close objection by a kinde of
modest excuse, or by removing the cause which they might
suspect, why he should put them in remembrance of these
things, namely, because he did think they were ignorant and
unstable. Now he shewes that this was not the cause, in these
words, <hi>though ye know them, and be stablished in the present
truth.</hi> And then he brings divers true causes that moved him
to make this exhortation unto them. 1. The great profit that
would redound unto them by the performance of these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
whereunto he exhorts them. This reason is intimated in
that causall particle, whereby he joynes these words with the
former, <hi>wherefore,</hi> that is, for those benefits sake which you
shall receive by this meanes, I thought it my part to put you
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62450:87"/>
in remembrance of these things after this manner. 2. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
reason, which depends upon the former, is the desire
and care that he had to further their good; this is intimated
in these words, <hi>I will not be negligent.</hi> 3. The third reason is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the duty of the Apostle, because justice and equity
required this of him, in these words, <hi>I think it meet.</hi> 4. The
fourth reason is taken from the opportunity of time, which he
had now, and was not long to continue; that he had it now,
he shewes in these words, <hi>as long as I am in this tabernacle;</hi> that
it was not long to continue, in these words, <hi>Knowing that
shortly I must put off this my tabernacle,</hi> which he confirmes by
the testimony of Jesus Christ. 5. The fifth reason is taken from
the fruit which this exhortation might bring forth; which
is set forth by the adjunct of time, that it would be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto them, not only while <hi>Peter</hi> lived, but also after his
death, <hi>after my decease to have these things alwayes in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi>
verse 15.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. In our exhortations and admonitions, we must not
only looke unto it, that that which we say be just and right, but also
that we speak it with a right minde and good intention, and that it
may so appeare also unto those with whom we have to do.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the scope of this text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. The first reason is taken from our duty; for that
which is good in it selfe, becomes evill unto us, and our duty
is turned into sinne, unlesse <hi>quod bonum est bene agamus,</hi> we do
that which is good after a good and right manner: as if a
man out of anger, hatred, envie, or a desire to disgrace him, or
pride, should tell his neighbour of any vice, or stirre him up
to do his duty.</p>
                  <p>2. From the profit of our neighbour, or the benefit of our
admonition and exhortation. For it depends oftentimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the mind or manner of doing it, which is chiefly looked
unto in such like duties; so that they do either make way for
our neighbours receiving it, or cast an obstacle in the way to
hinder him from receiving it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to reprove those, that never exhort
others but for revenge sake, when there is some contention
and strife betwixt them; and then they please themselves most
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62450:88"/>
in reprooving other mens vices, when they should not, and
when they should, they are altogether silent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. We must put our neighbours in remembrance of
those things which make most for their good.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from that particle, <hi>Wherefore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because admonition and exhortation are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their nature, workes of charity, and tend unto the good
of our neighbour: therefore we should use it most unto those
from whom we may expect most good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove those, who, if their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
do any thing unseemely or uncivilly, or to the losse of
their honour, or some outward profit, do presently take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it in them; but never looke after those things that doe
most pertaine to the kingdome of God: those things indeed
should not be neglected, but these things should chiefly be
looked after.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, in those things which pertaine to the
kingdome of God, and the salvation of soules, to have an
especiall care of our duty towards our neighbour. Hitherto
belongs that which <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>that he would not be negligent,</hi>
that is, that he would never lay aside the care of these things:
which although it did in a speciall manner pertaine to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Peter,</hi> an Apostle, and other Ministers of the word, yet
it is proportionably to be extended to the common duty of
all Christians, because the reasons which strengthen it, are for
the most part common.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. In justice and equity we are bound to put one an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in remembrance.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words, <hi>I think it meet:</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it doth not pertain unto that particular justice, which
consists in the equality of the thing received and repayed, yet
it is called justice, because it hath as strong an obligation, as
any thing that is due by justice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 14.</p>

truth, do yet stand in need of admonitions and exhortations.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words, <hi>though ye know them
and be stablished in the present truth.</hi>

                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they are not so learned and stablished,
but that they may be yet farther instructed and stablished.</p>
                  <p>2. Because if they had all knowledge and also faith, yet
their will and affections must be by these meanes stirred up
unto their duty. For our will is like unto a slow and dull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
to whom it is not enough once to heare the commands
of his master, but they must be often told him. Then againe,
if they had not only all knowledge and saith, but also a most
ready will and affections, yet because they are continually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
by temptations, they have need on the other side of
continuall remembrances and puttings in mind, to strengthen
them. The speech of the Captaine and the sound of the
Trumpet, and such like excitements, do put some courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into the most valiant souldiers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove the pride of those men,
that put such confidence in themselves in their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and faith, that they do utterly contemne such kinde of
helpes.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort all to be constant and diligent in the hearing
of Sermons. For if there be any that abound in knowledge,
and perhaps exceed the Preacher himselfe, so that they cannot
be taught any more by him, yet they may be stirred up by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
and exhortations, and in that respect they should
alwayes be present there; but much more should they, that
are not yet learned and stablished in the truth.</p>
                  <p>3. To direct, as well the Preachers as the hearers, not only
to teach the truth, but also to bring a word of exhortation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
that is, to apply it to the use of the truth which they
deliver, and then the hearers, to come unto Sermons, not as
being greedy of novelty or speculation, but being prepared
before hand and ready to receive exhortations and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to turne them into practise.</p>

which we have, diligently to exercise such Christian duties.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words, <hi>As long as I am in this

how soone this shall be, yet we are told that it shall not be

                  <p>This is gathered from verse 15. We cannot all profit the
Church by our writings, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, but yet through Gods
grace we may either by some other workes, or at least by our

                  <p>IN these verses is contained the reason and cause of those
things, which he had spoken of before, as it is manifest by
the causall particle <hi>For.</hi> Now he had said before, 1. That all
the faithfull must adde vertue unto faith. 2. That he had a just
reason why he should so seriously stirre them up unto this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and in these words he shewes the reason and cause of
both, which is taken from the certainty that is in the things
themselves, and the assurance that all the faithfull may have
of those things that were proposed unto them to beleeve. The
certainty is set forth first by something unlike it, that is, by
<hi>cunningly devised fables.</hi> Secondly, by the testimonies of the
Apostles, who were both eye-witnesses, and care-witnesses
of these things. Eye-witnesses, in these words, <hi>we were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of his Majesty.</hi> Eare-witnesses in these words, <hi>and this
voice we have heard.</hi> The sight and hearing of the Apostles,
wherein lies the foundation of the testimony, are set forth first
by their objects: The object of their sight was the majestie
of Christ, the object of their hearing was a voice which came
from Heaven concerning Christ. Secondly by the cause,
which was God the Father, communicating glory unto
Christ both by word and deed, Verse 17. Thirdly, by the

                  <p>For this is the reason why the Apostle cleares himselfe
from all suspicion of such like fables, because there were many
at that time, and many would come afterwards, that would
deceive the Church with such like fables, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1. Where
<hi>Paul</hi> saith that <hi>he came not with excellency of speech,</hi> thereby
closely rebuking some false Apostles and Preachers, who did

<hi>Peter</hi> makes mention of fables, by reason of such impostors,

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, not to receive all
things that are proposed, without triall and examination: for
so we may imbrace fables in steed of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to give God thanks, that we live in those
Churches, out of which all such old wives fables are wholly
removed, and wherein nothing is proposed but the sincere
word of God.</p>

                  <p>This is gathered from the connexion of these words with
the words foregoing, which were explained in the Analysis.
For this is the force of the Apostles reason; If I did account
the truth of the Gospell like unto a cunningly devised fable,
I could not so earnestly, and with such constancy stir you up
to imbrace and adorne it; nor could ye receive those things
that we have spoken of, without an endeavour to abound in

fables.</p>

to appeare, that they make no more account of the Gospell,

                  <p>2. To exhort us, to give all diligence to sanctify, as it were,
the Gospell of Christ which we professe, and to shew it in

This is gathered from these words, <hi>We made knowne unto
you the power and comming of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> For his
power hath respect unto his divine nature, together with the
effects thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. And his comming hath respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his humane nature, together with the end and benefit of his
incarnation. Now if these two be joyned together, namely,
that Christ came to save us, and that he came with power, so
that he had all sufficiency &amp; efficacy at his comming, nothing
more can be desired to comfort the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish, 1 Preachers, to make
the power and comming of Christ the center as it were of all
their Sermons. The Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 2. Determined to know
nothing save Iesus Christ and him crucified,</hi> &amp; then also, 2. the
hearers, to have a speciall eye unto that in the hearing of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
how they may profit in the understanding of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to fetch all the obedience which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
unto God, from him as from the fountaine. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
duties flow not from the power and comming of
Christ, are not Evangelicall, but are infected with hypocrisie,
or consist in civility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. The certainty of this Gospell, even as it may be
had after the manner of men, is as great as any we can have of any
things that are done and past.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words; <hi>We have seene, we have
heard.</hi> For it is confirmed by the testimony of those, that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
perceived it; who by the confession of all were men at
least worthy to be believed, having no reason to witnesse any
otherwise then the thing it selfe was; in regard that they could
not expect to receive any profit thereby from men; and being
such as confirmed it unto us, not by the bare testimony of
their words, but also with their life and blood: so that even
after the manner of men we may be as certaine of the Gospell
as we are, that there was sometimes a Monarchy of the Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Grecians, Romans: that there were Captaines, and
Knights, of such and such a countrey, or the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove and condemne the pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of men, who easily believe all other things, though there
be but weak arguments to confirme it; but they can scarce be
brought to receive the Gospell of salvation.</p>

we our selves have not seene these things, yet we must

barely declare unto us his will, but also confirme it by testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 2. For this was one of the speciall offices of
the Apostles, to witnesse those things which they had seene
of Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 32.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. A great Majesty was sensibly perceived by the
Apostles.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words, <hi>We have seene his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie.</hi>
So great was this Majestie, that the Disciples could not
beare it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 6. It astonished and amazed <hi>Peter, Marke</hi>
9. 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to instruct us, to conceive by this
proofe, how great the glory and Majestie of Christ is now in
Heaven, how great it shall be at the last day, and how great
we also shall be made in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to have Christ in high estimation: We
have no cause to be ashamed of so great a Majestie; according
to that of our Saviour; <hi>If any one be ashamed of me in this adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
generation, him will I be ashamed of before God and his
Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. This majestie was expressed in those words of God,
<hi>This is my beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these words is contained both the power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Christ, whereof the Apostles witnessed, and wherein
is contained the summe of the Gospell, as we said before.
This is gathered from the connexion of the words, which
these have with the former, <hi>We made knowne, &amp;c.</hi> For in the
title of <hi>Sonne</hi> is declared the honour and glory of Christ,
where he is called <hi>this my Sonne:</hi> in the title of <hi>beloved</hi> is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the comming of Christ, and the end thereof, namely, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
us unto God, and make us beloved of him: whence
he is called, <hi>My beloved in whom I am well pleased.</hi> By the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>Sonne</hi> is chiefly signified the kingdome of Christ, by the
title of <hi>beloved in whom I am well pleased,</hi> is signified the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62450:91"/>
of Christ; and by the third thing which is added, <hi>Mat.</hi>
17. 5. is signified his Propheticall office: <hi>heare ye him.</hi> And that
which is there expressed, is here understood; so that there is
nothing in Christ and the Gospell which may not fitly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to these few words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to instruct us, for the building up
of our faith, to have alwayes in our mindes that divine voice;
for therefore came it twice from Heaven, once in the Baptisme
of Christ, and once in this transfiguration which <hi>Peter</hi> hath
reference unto in this place: All the word of God indeed
comes from him, but there are some parts of it which come
from him unto men in a more speciall manner, that is, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
Such was the Decalogue in the Old Testament: such
was the voice, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 28. and such was this voice that was
twice repeated: Now as we should magnifie every word of
God, so in a speciall manner should we observe and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of such words as these.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, to depend upon Christ alone, and to
have recourse unto him only, in those things which pertaine
unto our salvation. 1. Because such a testimony was never
given of any one besides Christ. 2. In this testimony, power,
honour, and glory is so given unto Christ, that it is denied
unto all others: for the demonstrative particle <hi>that,</hi> as it is in
the originall, <gap reason="foreign">

all others, excluding all others from being partakers
of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. This voice of God did effectually bring honour
and glory unto Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is gathered from these words,</hi> He received from God
the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice unto
him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the testimony of God is infallibly true.</p>

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to instruct us, by faith to relye upon
every testimony of God. For that which God promiseth or
any way witnesseth, is as sure as that which we have already
received or do see brought to passe. We may oftentimes doubt
of mens words, because they have neither perfect truth, nor
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62450:92"/>
perfect power: but the excellent glory of God, whereof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is here made, requires far otherwise of us.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, for the confirmation of our faith, to have
alwayes in our eyes the excellent glory of God, whereby he
can and also will do whatsoever he hath said.</p>

they are declared, in some sort holy.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>in the holy Mount.</hi> For
this Mount was not holy, but by this transfiguration, and this

                  <p>PEter had before proved the certainty of the Gospell by
the testimony of the Apostles, who were eye-witnesses
and eare-witnesses of it; now he proves the same certainty by
the testimony of the word of prophesie; which he sets forth,
1. By the adjunct of stability, and that in comparison to the
testimony of the Apostles, in respect whereof this word of
prophesie is said to be more sure. 2. By the duty adjoyned
which is due unto this word of prophesie, namely, a religious
heed and attention which should be given unto this word.
W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> attention is declared, 1. By the end and use of this word
of prophesie, which is by way of comparison set forth by the
use of a light, 2. by the helping cause, 3. By the esteeme
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62450:92"/>
which we should have of the Prophesie of Scripture, verse 20,
21. namely, that it is by the instinct of the Holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which is set forth by those Prophesies that are contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
namely, such, as are of private interpretation, or by
the will of man. By prophesie is meant, not the foretelling
of those things, that depend upon any naturall causes, (for so
the Astrologers and Physitians can foretell many things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
skilfull in the naturall causes,) nor of those things that
depend upon the will of any creature (for so those that know
other mens counsell, may foretell many things, probably at
least) but prophesie is a fore-telling of those things, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
only upon the will of God, and can be knowne by God
alone, and those to whom he hath revealed it. By the word
of Prophesie is meant the Prophesie of holy Scripture, as it
is expresly set downe, verse 20. which is distinguished in this
respect not only from false prophesies, but also from other true
ones, which were never in the Canon of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines rising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The word of Prophesie is a more sure testimony
then the testimony of any men, or of those things that our senses
themselves can give us.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the comparison which is here made
betwixt this testimony and that which went before. But it is
said to be more sure, not more true: because that which the
Apostles witnessed, was as true; but their testimony did not
carry with it so great a confirmation of the truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because it appeared not so much to be a divine
testimony, being not as yet expressed in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it could not prevaile so much upon the mindes
of the Jewes, as the word of prophesie, which had now for
many ages bin as it were habitually confirmed in their minds.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the testimony of one that foresaw the truth, hath
more divine operation in it, then the testimony of him that
witnesseth what he hath seen or heard being present, <hi>Ioh. 5. 36,
39.</hi> There are three degrees of testimonies, 1 Of <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. Of the
workes of Christ. 3. Of the Scripture or word of prophesie.
The testimony of works is said to be greater then the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the testimony of the Scripture by way of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
is intimated to be greater then both.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to instruct us, in all those things
that pertaine unto faith and our salvation to depend only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Scriptures, because nothing can be more sure.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to give God thankes, that he hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made knowne unto us his truth, but hath also confirmed
it by strong and sure reasons, and in all respects hath had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to and provided for the weaknesse of our faith.</p>
                  <p>3. To reprove many Christians, which do too much stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and doubt of these truths. For there appeares such a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
and doubting of the minde, where the life is doubtfull
and uncertaine, and is not surely grounded and ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rules of Christ. Now we should be as sure of
these matters of faith by the Scriptures, as we are of those
things that we our selves see now present before our eyes; and
go on as firmely and constantly in the way of Christ, as if we
did now with our eyes see Christ himself, and all those things
that he hath promised us; or as if we did now heare that voice,
<hi>Arise ye dead and come to judgement.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The prophesie of the Old Testament gives a most
sure testimony of the power and comming of Christ.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the reference which this 19 verse
hath to verse 16. So <hi>Luke 1. 20. Acts</hi> 3. 18, 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 43.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> 1. The greatnesse of this mystery, which was such,
that it must not be shewed on a sudden to the world, but, for
dignity sake, as it were, by such like messengers going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>2. That it might the more appeare that these things come
from God, who was the only author of such like prophesies.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the salvation of the people of God from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world depended upon the beleeving of this
mysterie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to instruct us, to confirme our faith
more and more by such like arguments.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, highly to esteeme of this mysterie, because
God himselfe alwayes made such reckoning of it, that he
would have his Prophets from the beginning of the world to
be exercised in the declaration of it.</p>
                  <p>3. To admonish us, that it should never seeme tedious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, to heare and meditate upon those things, which pertain
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62450:93"/>
unto this mysterie, seeing God would have this alwayes pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by all his Prophets.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. It is most praise-worthy in Christians alwayes to
give diligent heed unto the Prophesies and the rest of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>Ye do well that ye take
heed.</hi> By <hi>taking heed</hi> is meant, 1. A search and inquiry after
the sense of the Scriptures, or the truths that are contained in
them. 2. An applying of those truths unto the ends and uses
whereunto they serve. 3. A religious affection of the minde,
whereby the conscience is subdued unto those truths as unto
the rules of faith and manners: now they do well, that do thus
give heed unto the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because this obedience pleaseth God.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they provide well for themselves, to be directed
unto eternall happinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute the Papists, and some other
foolish men, who deny that they do well, which give heed
unto the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>2. To reprove all profane and worldly men, who take great
care about their worldly profits, or their carnall pleasures,
but give little or no heed at all unto the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us, to stirre up in our selves daily this care of
attention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. The Scripture is a light shining unto those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously
give heed unto it.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words; <hi>Take heed as unto a light
that shineth.</hi> Now it is called a light,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because it is cleare and manifest in it selfe.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it makes all other things cleare and manifest.</p>
                  <p>3. Because it enlightens also the eyes of our minde, so that
we are able to behold the heavenly mysteries of the kingdome
of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute the Papists, who tax the
Scriptures of obscurity.</p>
                  <p>2. To reprove and condemne those, that walk in the midst
of this light, and yet perceive no more of the things of God,
then as if they were in darknesse.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us, 1. To give God thanks for so great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.
For God now deales with us, as he did heretofore with
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62450:94"/>
the Israelites, in whose dwellings there was light, when in
all the land of the Egyptians there was thick darknesse, <hi>Exod.</hi>
10. 22. 23. 2. To walke in this light, not to sleepe or have
fellowship with the workes of darknesse, as it is <hi>Ephesians</hi> 5. 8.
11. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The whole condition of this our life hath much
darknesse in it.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words; <hi>A light shining in a
darke place.</hi> We may see the explication of these words in
<hi>Calvin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because without the light of the Scriptures and
faith we are nothing but darknesse; seeing therefore this light
is communicated unto us but imperfectly in this life, there
must needs be as yet much darknesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, not to puffe up our
selves with the opinion of knowledge, but humbly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
our imperfections.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, so much the more diligently to give heed
unto the light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. We must give heed unto the Scriptures, untill a
greater light be communicated unto us, then we can have out of
the Scriptures, that is, untill the last end of this life.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words, <hi>untill the day downe.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were very strongly confirmed, verse 12. Yet they
must still give heed unto the Scriptures. <hi>Daniel</hi> himselfe,
though a Prophet, gave heed unto the Prophesies of <hi>Ieremy,
Daniel, 9. 2. Peter</hi> himselfe gave heed unto the Epistles of
<hi>Paul,</hi> c. 3. v. 15. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe had great care of the Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that is, of the volumes and books of Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
4. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute the Anabaptists, who say
that the Scriptures are only profitable for novices and young
beginners, and not for the stronger.</p>
                  <p>2. To reprove those, that rest in that knowledge of the
Scriptures, which they have, and seeke no farther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. Very great knowledge, light and cleerenesse shall
be communicated unto us in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the comparison that is made betwixt
the life present and the life to come: In the present we have
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62450:94"/>
a light as it were in a darke place, but in that to come we shall
have full noone as it were, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us earnestly to desire to come
unto that perfection, and in the meane time to exercise our
selves in those things that lead thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. The light of the Scripture profiteth none but the
faithfull.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>Knowing this first,</hi> that
is, beleeving, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 2. No great or noble effect is produced,
unlesse the matter, or the object wherein it should be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
be prepared before: the seed it selfe that is cast into the
ground, doth not grow, unlesse the ground be plowed and
harrowed. Besides, whereas the Scripture is a testimony, and
the strength of the testimony depends upon the authority of
him that witnesseth, the Scripture can be of no force, if the
authority of God be not acknowledged in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to direct us, when we come to the
reading or hearing of the Scriptures, alwayes to lift up our
mindes unto God, and stirre up true faith in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. The first thing to be believed is, that the Scriptures
are not of any inhumane interpretation, but of divine revelation.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>Knowing this first, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Papists and some others gather from this place, that
the interpretation of Scripture doth not belong unto private
men, but unto the Church, that is, the <hi>Pope</hi> and the Councels
whom he approves of: but in this sense this place makes
most against them: for first it is not here said that a private
man may not interpret the Scriptures, but that he may not
make an interpretation of his owne; now by a mans owne
interpretation is meant a humane interpretation, that is made
by the will of man; as it evidently appeares by the oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
verse 21. So that the Prophets themselves, although they
were publick Doctors of the Church, yet if they should have
said any thing of themselves without the revelation of God,
that would have beene their owne, that is, a humane inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation:
whence also it followes that every interpretation
of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which he takes not from cleare Scripture, or hath
it not by some extraordinary revelation, is his owne in that
sense as this word is taken in this place. Secondly, By <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:62450:95"/>
in this place is not meant the interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that was before revealed, but the revelation it self, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the 21 vers where this interpretation is made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
therein, that the Prophets spake their prophesies as they
were moved by the holy Ghost. 3 <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe, who in the
opinion of the Papists was at that time head of the Church,
bids the faithfull here, search the Scriptures, he doth not bid
them depend upon him, and alwayes look for interpretatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.
4 He attributes more and greater strength unto the Scripture,
then to his own testimony. 5 He cals the Scripture a light,
and the condition of the Church a dark place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Papists
on the contrary attribute darknesse unto the Scripture, and
light and clearnesse unto the Church. 6 He commends the
vulgar sort of the faithfull, that they did take heed unto the
Scriptures, in these words, <hi>Ye do well.</hi> But the Papists by this
interpretaion debarre the faithfull from the reading of the
Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute the Papists, that put the
Church before the Scripture, and say that the first thing to be
believed is, that the Church cannot erre.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to lay this foundation firme and sure in
our hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 10. The holy Ghost moved those men that were authors
of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>As they were moved by
the holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to instruct us, by continuall prayer to
seek for the aid of the Spirit, for the understanding of the
Scriptures. The Scripture must be understood by the help of
the same Spirit, by whom it was dictated, as <hi>Hier. Eodem spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu
debet intelligi Scriptura, quo fuit dictata.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 11. The men which the holy Ghost made use of, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Scriptures, were holy men of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Holy,</hi> because they were sanctified inwardly, &amp; also set apart
to this most holy work. <hi>Men of God</hi> they were, because they
were called by God to this office, and they did declare the will
of God, and they did labour also to bring men unto God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to labour to be like unto
them, according to our ability, both in holinesse, and in zeale
of the Lord.</p>

<hi>fals teachers</hi> and <hi>profane scoffers:</hi> of these former he speaks Ch.
2. Of the latter chap. 3. The false teachers he doth first, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe:
secondly, reprove: he describes them from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to those words in vers. 3. <hi>whose judgement, &amp;c.</hi> Then
he reproves them, 1 in generall in these words, <hi>that they are
damned men;</hi> which he doth afterwards prove, 1 by the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
course of Gods justice, from verse 4. to the 10. 2. By their
deserts, whereby they bring upon themselves the revenging
justice of God, from verse 10. to the end of the Chapter. In
the description of the false teachers he makes, 1 A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the like betwixt the false teachers and those that were
false prophets among the people of Israel, partly that he might
joyne together this discourse with the former, where he
spake of true Prophets; and partly that he might meet with
the scandall which might arise by such seducers; and partly
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62450:96"/>
that he might stirre up the faithfull so much the more, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of their seducing. In the first respect, the last words of
the former Chapter, and the first of this Chapter, make such
a <hi>discreet axiom</hi> as this; although there were many Prophets
among the People of Israel, that were holy men of God, and
were moved by the Spirit of God in those things that they
spake; yet among the same people also there were many false
Prophets. This <hi>discretion</hi> is shewed in these words: <hi>But there
were.</hi> In the second respect these words make a <hi>copulate axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om</hi>
thus: Like as there were false Prophets among the People
of Israel, so also shall there be false teachers among you. In
the third respect there is intimated and implicitely contained
such a <hi>connex axiom</hi> as this: If there shall be false teachers
among you, like as there were false Prophets among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Israel, then must you be alike careful to beware of these,
as the Israelites were warned heretofore to beware of them.
After that description which is made by way of comparison,
followes an absolute description; wherein the false teachers
are described by their effects. Which eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

immediate reference unto the false teachers themselves, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others by them. Those that have reference unto the false
teachers themselves, are 1 The bringing in of heresies, which
are set forth by their adjunct, that they are damnable, whereof
he gives a reason also, taken from the nature of heresies, which
is said to be such, that <hi>it brings in a denying of the Lord.</hi> 2. The
second effect is, that <hi>they bring upon themselves swift destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
In respect of others the first effect is, that <hi>they shall have

                  <p>The use hereof according to the Apostles intention is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To admonish us, not to be offended, nor to be top
much troubled in minde, when we see heresies to arise in the
Church, but to say as the Apostle did, <hi>There were, there
shall be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. To instruct us, not to believe every spirit, but to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are of God, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Every heresie hath damnation joyned with it.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>damnable heresies.</hi> Some
are more damnable then others, yet all do in their nature tend
to damnation. For all are contrary unto the way of truth,
whereof mention is made, verse 2. which way alone leads unto
life. But there are some heresies which can by no meanes
consist with salvation or eternall life. Hereupon such opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are by a kind of appropriation called heresies in the
Church, that is, opinions altogether damnable. For there is
a difference to be observed betwixt things rashly spoken, bare
errors in faith, and heresies properly so called. In the heresies
themselves also we must distinguish betwixt the materiality,
and the formality of it. For to make a formall heresie, for
which a man is properly called an heretick, there is required
besides an errour in those things that pertaine unto the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of religion, a reluctation against the cleare light,
and obstinacy in that reluctation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to condemne those that under the name
of peace and charity, make so little reckoning of the bringing
in of heresies into the Church. They would have all things
received in and tollerated; which is all one, as if they would
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62450:97"/>
for peace and charity admit of damnation it selfe. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
have damnation joyned with it.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, 1. to take diligent heed that we do
not by any means further such heresies. 2. Not rashly or for
a light cause to pronounce any man an heretick. 3. As care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to beware of heresies, as we should of damnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> In the reason which is here given of this property
of heresies, that they are damnable, a question is moved, What
is meant by denying the Lord? <hi>denying the Lord that bought
them.</hi> For many gather from this place, that all and every
particular man were redeemed by Christ, because it is here
said that he bought even those wicked hereticks: but it may
be answered divers wayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That these false teachers were members of the
visible Church, and therefore, 1. they accounted themselves
such as were redeemed by Christ, and made shew of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
2. Men were to account them such, as long as they
continued in the Church; and in this respect they may be
said to be such as were redeemed by Christ; like as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
are wont to call whole Churches justified, sanctified, and
elect. There is not the same reason therefore of all and every
particular man, as there was of these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. He doth not here speak of Christ properly, as he is
Redeemer, nor of the redemption of his blood, but of that
right, whereby masters chalenge their servants, as having
bought them; which may be thus shewed: 1. Here is no
mention of Christ as being Lord properly, but Master. For in
the Greek it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is properly, a Master in respect
of a servant, not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Lord. And these two names are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distinguished, <hi>Iude</hi> v. 4. where the same thing is spoken of
the same false teachers: there they are said to deny their <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum
&amp; herum</hi> Lord and master; although he may be called
their <hi>Herus, Master,</hi> he is not properly called their <hi>Dominus,
Lord.</hi> Then againe, the Lord is not said to have redeemed all
men, but only to have bought them: now although the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to buy, be sometimes used in the same sense that the
other is, yet it is not alwayes so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. The comparison here is plainly made betwixt
the false teachers and the false Prophets, bewixt the visible
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62450:97"/>
Church and the people of Israel; for the Lord is said to have
bought those men in the same sense, that he is said to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
and delivered all the people of Israel; that is, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
them out of Egypt, and challenged them to himselfe
in a peculiar manner, that by a solemne covenant they should
be his servants; so also all those that give their names unto the
Church, he may in this respect be said to have bought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a
Master, that they should serve him for ever. To deny the Lord
is, not to acknowledge God or Christ for the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.
32, 33. to confesse and to deny are made contrary one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Luke</hi> 12. 8, 9. The reason is, because it hath once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the name of the Lord, and afterwards departs from that
profession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is all one as if he did plainly say, that he would
no longer be a servant of that Lord. For this denying is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
either<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verball or reall. A verball denying was in <hi>Peter,</hi> a
reall denying is in all those that after they have made profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> return unto a profane life, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 8. 2 Tim.</hi>
3. 5. The denying in this place is properly meant of a reall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying.
For the description of these men doth rather expresse
their profane courses, then their open renouncing of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. It is a damnable impiety to deny Christ either in
word or deed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because by this means Christ is greatly disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured;
for men, our lusts, and Sathan himselfe are preferred
before him, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 38. where the indignity of this sinne is
shewed, that an adulterous and sinfull generation is preferred
before Christ. Christ also by this me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns is accused of iniquity:
for no servant usually goeth away from his master, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
him to be a just master; therefore this going away is as
it were a professing that he doth accuse that master from whom
he goes of some iniquity. Hereupon was that contesting of the
Lord against his rebellious people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was a just and right
master, neither did he give them any cause to depart from
him, <hi>Ier. 2 5. Mich. 6. 3. Deut.</hi> 32. 4.</p>
                  <p>2. Because Christ threatned a most heavie judgement against
this sin, when he saith that he will deny those men; that he wil
be ashamed of them before God and his Angels, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne, not only the manifest
Apostates, but also all those, that with the profession of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62450:98"/>
godlinesse joyne a profane life, or turn aside from that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
The sinne of these men is more grievous, then of Turks
and Infidels, that never gave their names unto Christ; for the
neerer any man commeth unto God, the more doth he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
his name, if he doth fall back againe. He that hath in
some sort forsaken Sathan, and given himselfe up unto God,
and afterward forsakes God again, and gives himselfe up unto
Sathan, seems to have known both masters, and advisedly to
pronounce that he is the better, whose servant he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be, that is, Sathan.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, 1. Carefully to beware, not only of
the damnable sin it selfe, but also of all appearance, and every
degree of it, and every occasion that might leade us thereunto.
2. If in any respect we have turned towards such like abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
to recall our selves betimes, and seriously to bewaile
our offence, like as <hi>Peter</hi> did after his denying of Christ,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 75.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon men.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words; <hi>bring upon themselves
destruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because sinne in respect of the guilt that is joyned
with it, hath a kind of power whereby it drawes all evill; like
as faith and prayers obtain every good gift from God. Hence
is it, that our sins are said to cry for vengeance; and also to
draw punishment unto it as it were with strong cords, <hi>Isay 5.
18.</hi> For while men draw sin with such-like cords, they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
draw the punishment of sinne, which is joyned unto it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, in this respect to
beware of sin.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, by faith, repentance, and prayers, to turn
away that destruction from us, which our sins would bring
upon us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The destruction which hangs over the heads of
grievous offenders will come swiftly.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words; swift destruction.</p>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. Men are wonderfully prone to imbrace errors.</p>

                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. By reason of that darknesse, which hath taken
hold of mens mindes; thereupon they may be easily drawne
under any shew or glimps of light.</p>
                  <p>2. By reason of that disposition which they have, alien
from the truth; thereupon they easily imbrace those things
that are contrary to this truth.</p>
                  <p>3. By reason of that disposition which they have, agreeing
with the nature of errors. For sinners have in themselves the
seeds, of all sins, errors and heresies; so that the nature of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
man doth as easily receive errors, as the tinder fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e.</p>
                  <p>4. By reason of the just judgement of God, whereby for
the punishment of other sins they are given over to the power
of errors, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to instruct us, to shew the corruption
and wretchednesse of our nature, how hardly are we brought
to imbrace the heavenly and saving truth, when we are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
headlong unto damnable errors.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, that it should not be an offence unto
us, if we see many given unto errors; because this was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
us by the Apostle, and it hath a manifest reason; so that
it is not to be wondred at, that many are given unto errors,
but that rather, that any one doth believe the truth.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us, 1 Unto humiliation, in respect of this
pronenesse unto error, 2 To care and circumspection that we
be not overswayed by it. And an Argument whereby we may
and should be stirred up unto this care, we have in the text,
whiles they which follow heresies and hereticks, are said to
follow their destruction. For not only the authors of heresies
run unto destruction, but also their followers, as in the place
of the <hi>Thess.</hi> before cited. <hi>In those which perish,</hi> so that it is a

the way of truth.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words, <hi>By reason of whom the way
of truth shall be evill spoken of.</hi> By <hi>the way of truth</hi> is meant the
Gospell, or the will of God revealed in the Scripture, which
shewes the true way of salvation. It is said <hi>to be evill spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

them,</hi> namely, by the authors of the heresies and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
in a two-fold respect, 1. When they themselves speak re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully
of it, as the Scribes and Pharisees did of Christ.
2. While they give others occasion to speak reproachfully of
it, as the Jewes did unto the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24. both respects

nature of sinne, that never staies till it hath brought men to
blasphemy against God, and to speak evill of the way of God.</p>

shall never be forgiven. 2. To beware also of those men, that

                  <p>For God as judge of all the earth, pronounceth sentence
upon men for their sins, and the execution of that sentence is
called punishment. Now he pronounceth sentence according

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because it comes long before their expectation
of it.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it is not deferred beyond the time which is
most fit, and appointed by God, and in that respect it is said
<hi>not to linger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Because no impediment can hinder it, but it is deferred
through Gods mercy and long-suffering; in that respect it is
said <hi>not to slumber,</hi> because slumbring and sleepe bindes the
mind, and hinders the actions.</p>
                  <p>4. Because now of a long time before, way is made and
prepared for this damnation.</p>
                  <p>5. Because the damnation it selfe, although the wicked of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
are not sensible of it, yet it takes hold of them, and
spiritually worketh in their minds and consciences.</p>

                  <p>NOw the Apostle proves that which he had before laid
downe concerning the punishment that should befall
false teachers. The conclusion of this arguing is, 1 In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
propounded of all the wicked, v. 9. For there is the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
part of that connex axiom, the antecedent whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
v. 4. and is shewed by the connexion <hi>If,</hi> as, <hi>If God spared
not the Angels,</hi> &amp;c. Then afterwards in speciall, of these false
teachers themselves and their followers, v. 10. In the generall
conclusion, v. 9. he doth not barely set downe the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the wicked, but also by a copulate axiom joynes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with it, the deliverance of the godly from that tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which ariseth unto them by means of the wicked. And
the reason is, because the Apostles purpose was, so to reprove
the wicked, that he might in the mean time comfort the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and strengthen them against all the temptations, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they were obnoxious by means of the wicked. In the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
part of this arguing he sets downe three arguments,
which are as so many examples &amp; judgements of God against
the wicked; &amp; they may make three syllogismes to prove one
and the same conclusion. The first example is of the Angels
that fell, v. 4. The second is of the old world, v. 5. The third
is of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi> The syllogismes are knit together,
after this manner: <hi>If God spared not the Angels, nor the old
world, nor Sodome and Gomorrha; then he will not spare these false
teachers; nor the like wicked men; But the former is true, by the
testimony of Scripture, Therefore, &amp;c.</hi> These examples in respect
of the generall conclusion, which is set downe, v. 9. are as <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
unto their <hi>genus.</hi> But in respect of the speciall conclusion
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is set down, v. 10. they are as <hi>comparata,</hi> partly alike, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
greater. That wherein they are alike, consists therein, as God
condemned those sinners so also will he condemn these. Their
inequality therein; if God spared not his most excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the Angels, nor the old world, nor those cities; then much
lesse will he spare these false teachers.</p>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The judgements of God which he hath executed
from the beginning of the world were ordained to be examples
for us.</p>
                  <p>This is evidently gathered from all this arguing of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
and it is plainly taught us, verse 6. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6. they
are called <hi>types,</hi> that is, <hi>ensamples;</hi> which appears also by vers.
11. which sense of the words <hi>Beza</hi> and others have missed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> The reason of this truth is Gods unchangeable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and constant justice, whereby he is alwayes like himself,
not only inwardly and in himselfe, but also outwardly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us in the dispensation of his punishments and rewards,
if we look to the substance of God. Hence is it, that by this
argument the godly are both confirmed in their hope, <hi>Isay</hi>
59. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. 9. 10. and assured of the destruction of all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and of all those that give themselves over unto impiety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to instruct us, so to read the sacred
History, not as we read profane histories and fables, either for
delight, or to be informed only in the knowledge of the times,
or in things that have bin done; but alwayes to observe Gods
warnings and apply them unto our own use.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, not to deceive our selves, as if we had a
priviledge to sin above other men, or as if God wold not deale
so severely with us, if we should continue in our sins, as he did
heretofore with those whom he destroyed: * Other mens
harmes should teach us to beware of the like sins. In the first
example we have, first, The object of Gods judgement, <hi>The
Angels that sinned.</hi> Secondly, the manner how he dealt with
them, <hi>If he spared them not.</hi> Thirdly, the degree of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
present, and to come: present, that they were adjudged
unto damnation; and to come, that they were to be reserved
unto judgement. The fin of the Angels is not particularly set
downe in the Scriptures, because it doth not so much pertaine
to our edification and salvation, to know their sin, as it doth to
know our own sins. But in generall we are taught, that they
kept not their first estate. <hi>Iude</hi> v. 6. that is, they left that estate
wherein God had placed them, and afterwards exercised en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,
lying, murther towards men. We are taught also that the
number of those that fell was great; thence it is that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62450:101"/>
here speaks in the plurall number. They are said to have
been cast down to hell, 1. By reason of the change of their
estate, because from that wonderfull high condition, which
they had received by creation, they were cast downe to the
lowest of all. 2. By reason of the change of their place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
from the place of blisse, where they were round about
the throne of God with the other Angels, they were thrust
downe into a lower place fit for sin and misery: But that this
place is in the lowest parts of the earth, as the Papists would
have it, it cannot be shewed out of the Scriptures, but rather
the contrary: for they are said to be in the aire, and to rule
there, and to go about the earth seeking to devoure men. This
at least is plaine out of the Scripture, and it should suffice such
as are not over-curious: 1. That they suffer a great change of
estate. 2. That they are excluded from their first habitation.
3. That they are in that place, where they receive <hi>poenam dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
&amp; sensus,</hi> the punishment of losse, and the punishment also
of sense. They are said to be delivered into darknesse, partly
in respect of sin, partly in respect of misery: for both are sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by <hi>darknesse</hi> in the Scriptures. They are said to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into chains, by a metaphor taken from malefactors that
are condemned, who are kept inprison bound with chains.
Now these chains are, 1 A hardning in their sins. 2 A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire
of all deliverance. 3 A fearfull looking for that misery
whereof mention is made, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. 4. The providence of
God which alwayes watcheth over them, to keep and punish
them. They are said to be reserved unto judgement, because
they are bound so fast with these evils, that they can never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape;
and yet these are but the beginnings of the evils, which
they must farther undergo.</p>

                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because dignity doth not lessen the sin, but aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because sin is an aversion from God. Now as the

a high condition, even into Heaven it selfe, so that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
is in heaven, as it is <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. So also aversion from

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, not to follow a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to do evill. And so much the more necessary is this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
because we are all too prone to go in the way of
the multitude; which fault also we seeme to commit with
some reason.</p>
                  <p>1. Because that we presume that many eyes see more then
one, whence it is that the voice of the people is often taken
for the voice of God.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the labour of examination seemes too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
and almost impossible.</p>
                  <p>3. Because that which all men do, usually goes unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
among men, and we conceive the like thing of God.</p>
                  <p>4. Because he that doth not follow the multitude, shall
gaine a multitude of enemies, and such as hate him.</p>
                  <p>But the contrary reason, which is of greater value then all
those is that of Christ, <hi>Matth. 7. 13. Broad is the way that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat.</hi> To the
first reason or object on we answer; that one eye of a man that
seeth, perceives more then a thousand blind eyes. The world
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62450:103"/>
or the multitude of the world is blinded; therefore one
Christian which hath the eye of his mind inlightned by the
Spirit, and followes the light of Gods word, can see more
then a great multitude of others. To the second we answer,
that the duty of examination lies upon all and every one. And
they had need to do it, not only as they are Christians, and
as Christ commands them, to prove all things, and hold fast
that which is good, but also as they are men: for it is not a
humane, but a brutish thing to follow the multitude of those
that go before, without judgement. To the third we answer,
that the wayes of God are not as the wayes of men: Men
winck at many, either out of ignorance, or impotency, or for
feare, and the like imperfections which are not incident to
God. To the fourth we answer, If God be with us, who can
be against us?</p>

                  <p>This is gathered from the flood of waters, that destroyed
the old world. Now nothing is more necessary and profitable
unto us then water.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>

to the fiercenesse of his anger or fury, as men oftentimes
use to do, but according to the counsell of his most perfect
wisdome.</p>

                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that <hi>Noah</hi> is called the eighth
of the godly, or rather he may be called the seventh, because
<hi>Cham</hi> was cursed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. In respect of God, because he gives this grace
but unto a few, that his goodnesse and mercy towards them
may appeare the more abundant.</p>
                  <p>2. In respect of the second causes, and of the nature of the
thing it selfe, because that which is most difficult, and of the
greatest care and perfection, is not wont to be found but in
few. The gifts of nature are common unto all; of art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
to fewer, but the gifts of grace to fewest of all. There
are more good Taylors then good Physitians, and more good
Physitians then good Kings. So that that hath the greatest
perfection, which is given but to a few.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, to be so much the

us partakers of that happinesse, which he grants but to a few.</p>

                  <p>IN these verses is contained the third example, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
after the same manner, as the second was. For here he
speaks of the judgement of God upon the wicked, and his
mercy towards the godly. The object of his judgement are
the Cities of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha;</hi> the manner is, by fire,
which is intimated in these words, <hi>turned into ashes.</hi> The degree
is, in their utter overthrow; the end and use is, to warne those
that should after live ungodly. For such judgements are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samples
not of a wicked life, but of the condemnation that
hangs over the heads of those that live ungodly; and so they
are ensamples to move men, not to do the like; but to take
heed lest if they do after the like manner, they suffer also after
the like manner.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> No society of men or policy can hinder the judgement
of God, which he will bring upon them for their sins.</p>
                  <p>For as in the first example there was the dignity of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
in the second the multitude of men, so also in this place
society and policy; and Cities that were so noble, <hi>Sodome</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrha.</hi> For they were Cities that were brought into go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
they had Kings, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14 2. This Doctrine is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
and proved, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11 21. &amp; in 16. 5. it is repeated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because the guilt of sin is not lessened, but increased
by means of societies, if they favour sinnes: for they pervert
the end whereunto they were ordained. For whereas the end
of all societies is to restraine sinne, and to advance righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. and they on the contrary cherish sin and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne

then if they were not such societies. The sin of these Cities is
said to be grievous, and crying, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 20.</p>
                  <p>This may serve for admonition, that Citizens or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
should not trust too much to their wealth, so that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they should be made the more bold to sin.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that whereas the old world
was destroyed by water, those Cities were overthrowne by
fire.</p>

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve for admonition, that sinners should

another is ready to fal upon them, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 19.</p>

                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that this was an utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,

                  <p>2. To exhort us to increase in godlinesse by the examples
of Gods judgements upon sinners. For that is the use and end
of them, <hi>Amos</hi> 4 12.</p>
                  <p>The other part of the Analysis.</p>
                  <p>The object of mercy is <hi>Lot,</hi> who is described, 1 By the
adjunct, that he was righteous. 2 By the effect, that his soule

largely set forth, v. 8. 1 By the internall cause, which was his
righteousnesse. 2 By the externall cause, which was their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62450:105"/>
3 By the means, wherby the external cause or the

tormented.</p>
                  <p>Besides those that are common unto <hi>Lot</hi> with the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Men are accounted righteous or unrighteous in
the sight of God, not so much for some one deed, as for the whole
course of their life.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that <hi>Lot</hi> is here called <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
who notwithstanding is spoken of in the Scripture to
have committed a most hainous sin. For those that are said to
be <hi>righteous</hi> in the Scriptures, are so called, either in respect
of the imputation of Christs righteousnesse, or in respect of
some particular cause wherein they shew themselves righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
or in respect of that inherent righteousnesse, which,
though it be imperfect, yet is it sincere and pleasing unto
God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute the Papists and others, who
as soone as they reade that any one is called righteous in the
Scriptures, presently conclude that a man may fulfill the
whole law, and stand upon his own merits before God.</p>
                  <p>2. To comfort the godly, who sometimes fall through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.
For if they continually labour to please God, God
in mercy accounts them righteous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. There are sometimes righteous men found in the
midst of the ungodly.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that righteous <hi>Lot</hi> dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Sodomites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute those, that when they sinne
put the fault upon others with whom they live, as if they
could not be godly because others are wicked.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to strengthen our minds against the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
of the age, and places, or men, amongst whom we
live. For like as that servant deserves well of his Master, that
sticks close unto him, when all others forsake him; so also are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62450:106"/>
they most acceptable unto God, that adhere unto him, when
all others not only forsake him, but also are against him; so
did <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Those that are righteous, even whiles they live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the ungodly, are grieved for their impiety.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that <hi>Lot vexed,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 158 <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because when godly men do most of all desire, and
take care for to advance the glory of God and the salvation of
others, they cannot but be grieved, when they see no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
made of either.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne those, that take delight
in no company so much as in the company of the ungodly.
2. Those that are not sorry for their own sins, much lesse for
others.</p>
                  <p>2. To instruct us, to judge of our selves hereby, in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
which we have with wicked men. For if we are
thus wrought upon, when we see it, then it is a signe of a good

                  <p>THis is the generall conclusion, the premisses whereof the
former examples make up, and it is disposed in a copulate
axiom, the former part whereof is of the mercy of God, and
the latter of his justice. Where we may take notice of the
reason of this order, which may be two-fold. 1 Because in
the premisses he had spoken of mercy in the last place; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the connexion might be evident, he puts it first in the
Conclusion; and because he intends to speak more at large of
the wicked afterwards, therefore he mentions Gods justice
towards them in the last place. 2. The Apostle doth first of
all conclude the mercy of God towards the godly, because it
was his primary intent and purpose to comfort and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62450:106"/>
the godly. The object of Gods mercy is the godly. The
act and effect thereof is, to deliver them from temptation.
The object of his justice is the wicked. The act and effect
thereof is, to reserve them unto the day of judgement. Where
he addes the manner how they shall be reserved, namely so,
that they shall in the meane time suffer punishment. The cause
and reason of these acts and effects, as well of his mercy as his
justice, is the wisdome of God, or his knowledge joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his will; as that first word intimates unto us, <hi>The

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because faith is not, as knowledge and sense is,
to have such a full and evident assurance, as excludes all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

                  <p>IN this verse is contained the particular conclusion of the
former arguing: because he doth particularly apply unto
the false teachers of that age, that which he had affirmed in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of the unjust, verse 9. Therefore this particular conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is joyned with the generall, not by a bare <hi>copula,</hi> but by
a gradation from the lesse to the greater, as it is intimated in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62450:107"/>
that first word, <hi>But chiefly:</hi> as if he had said, that all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
should indeed suffer punishment, but those most certainly,
and most heavily, that are such as the false teachers are here
described to be. Now they are described both in generall, and
in particular. In generall the effect of their wicked walking,
in those words, <hi>them that walke.</hi> Of which effect, 1 he shewes
the principall cause, which is, <hi>the flesh.</hi> 2 The administring,
or next cause, which is <hi>the lust of the flesh,</hi> that is, the vicious
motions and inclinations of corrupt nature: which is illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the proper effect thereof, <hi>uncleannesse,</hi> because the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the flesh do spiritually defile the soules of men, so
that it makes them polluted in the sight of God. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
description is by a particular sin, which is, a contempt
of lawfull authority: which sin is illustrated by its effect, that
is, that they do contemptuously reproach dignities; where he
shewes the manner of this effect which is adjoyned, that they
do it boldly and selfe-willed.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising here-hence.</p>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Although all sinners may deservedly feare the
judgement of God, yet there are some that may more certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the severity of that judgement.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words; <hi>But chiefly them.</hi>

                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the act of sin doth not so much condemn
as the habit of sin; like as on the contrary, the habit of any
vertue doth much more commend a man, then any particular
act, though it be of great note.</p>
                  <p>2. Because he that walks in the way of sin, addes impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency

more then any sin, because there is no way to escape the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of God, but by repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne those, that please
themselves therein, that they are not murtherers, nor adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
nor robbers, &amp;c. when in the meane time they walk in
the way of other sins, who do either contemne the worship
of God, or neglect faith, hope, and charity, and are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorant of the like vertues.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, to take he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d unto our selves, by a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and daily repentance, that we walk not in sins, though we
cannot abstain from all sin. Sinners are not so much hatefull
unto God, as the workers of sin, and such as walk in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. There is in all men while they are in this world,
some cause pricking and stirring them up unto so.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that the flesh is here put as the
beginning of all those sins, whereunto these wicked men were
given. Now it is called the flesh, because it doth extend it selfe
as largely as the flesh or body of man, being carnall: and so
is in all and every particular man in common and without
any exception. This is proved first <hi>Gol 5. 17. Iames 1. 14. Mat.</hi>
15. 19. Secondly, it is confirmed also by reason and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
because when there is no outward object or perswasion
that can induce us unto sin, yet we feele such little sparks ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in our selves, that will set the whole man on fire, if they be
not quenched betimes.</p>

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve for instruction, 1 To refute their

                  <p>2. To admonish us, diligently to beware not only of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
provocations, that might lead us into temptation, but
also of our selves and our own hearts; for there lyes our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
danger.</p>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Sinne doth not consist only in outward words and
deeds, but also in the inward lusts and affections, which are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto the law of God.</p>

                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:62450:108"/>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. The first reason is taken out of the places of
Scripture, wherein God is called a Spirit, and is said to look
most unto the Spirit and heart of man.</p>
                  <p>2. The second is taken out of those places,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 19</note> where sins are
said to come from the heart, For sin can come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart no
other way, but by the means of such vicious lusts of the flesh.</p>
                  <p>3. From the expresse words of God, <hi>Ger.</hi> 6. 5. &amp; 8. 21.</p>
                  <p>4. The same is shewed unto us by the contraries, because
the inward affections of men, that are good, are very pleasing
unto God: Therefore after the like manner evill affections
and desires must needs displease him. The amplification of
this truth may be taken therehence, that there is no sin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
in the outward words, and deeds, but as they depend
upon the inward affection of the heart. For if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
then a man might be compelled unto sin, which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
untrue, and contrary to common sense.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to refute and condemne those, that
take little or no care at all, about their thoughts or inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
so that they can any way excuse their outward words
and deeds. 2. To admonish us, therefore to watch over our
inward affections and thoughts. For this is the property of a
true Christian. Those that are out-side Christians, look only
unto outward things; they that do inwardly and in heart
feare God, are no lesse carefull of their inward thoughts then
they are of their outward words.</p>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Sins of this kind, like as all others also, do defile a mar.</p>
                  <p>Some sins are said in a speciall manner to defile a man, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such, as pertain unto the unlawfull copulation of the flesh,
and transgresse the tenth Commandement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> Because they do in their nature also defile the body
and person of a man. But all sins do also defile the soul of man,
because they leave a blemish behind them, which makes the
soul of the sinner deformed, and lesse pleasing unto God, <hi>Mat.</hi>
15. 20. This is it which was heretofore signified in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
Law by all those uncleannesses separations, washings,
and purgings, which are so frequently spoken of by <hi>Moses,</hi>
This also is that, which is intimated unto us in Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemn those, that do not only
take delight in their sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also seeme to boast of them, as if
they should glory in their own dung.</p>

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:62450:109"/>
2. To admonish us, to learne hence more and more to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
all sin, as a most filthy and detestable thing. Besides that
generall defiling which is common to all sinne, the Apostle
seems here to intimate that speciall defiling, which is in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse,
as it appears by v. 14. &amp; 18. But of this we shall have
a fitter opportunity to speak afterwards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. It is a most heinous sin to despise government, or
the superiour lan full power.</p>
                  <p>This is confirmed, Rom. 13. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they which despise lawfull power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the ordinance of God. It is the Apostles reason in the
same place. For although God hath prescribed unto men no
speciall forme of government, yet he hath appointed, that
there should be some certaine kind of governing, and so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
of all power, which is not contrary unto nature, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his revealed will.</p>
                  <p>2. Because such a contempt is against the common good,
and tends to the disturbance of humane society.</p>
                  <p>3. Because it gives occasion to the overflowing of all other
sins. For this is the reason why the authority of superiours
is established in the first Commandement of the second Table,
because if that be despised or neglected, all the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
not only of the second, but also of the first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
are quite destitute of those things that should strengthen
them, as touching those means which men can use.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to refute the Anabaptists and those
that tread in the steps of such hereticks, whiles they maintaine
that the civill Magistrate is clean contrary to Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>2. To reprove those, that although they confesse the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in words, yet in their deeds resist it, nor do they respect it
farther then it makes for their lusts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. The effect of contempt is, to reproach a man, and
speak evill of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because reproaches and contumelies come proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from pride, whereby a man thinks himself better then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For otherwise he could not reproach another man,
but the same reproach would fall upon himselfe also. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
is the daughter of pride, and the mother of such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes.</p>

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish all Christians, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
from reproachings and evill speakings. For there is none
that dares affirme that it is lawfull for him to despise his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, to beware of pride and the contempt
of others, if we would not break forth into such sins, that are
so unworthy of a Christian man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Here ariseth a question, Whether we may not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
reprove the sins of men somewhat sharply?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> That this is lawfull is proved by the approved pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the Prophets, Apostles, and of Christ himselfe also;
but with these cautions. 1 That the sin which we reprove
be manifest. 2 That the check be so directed, that it be done
to the sin rather then to the man. 3. That there be together
with it a manifestation of our charity. 4 That we be not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
unto this vehemency chiefly by our own private injuries,
but by the zeale that we beare unto the glory of God and the
salvation of others.</p>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. Amongst those circumstances of sinne, mentioned
in the text, there is none whereby it is more aggravated, then stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
boldnesse, and selfe-willednesse.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>Presumptuous, selfe-willed,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they are tokens of a will sinning with
full consent.</p>
                  <p>2. They are tokens of a seared conscience.</p>
                  <p>3. They are most contrary unto repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne those, that account it
a great praise unto themselves, that they are bold to commit
all kind of villanous acts: they neither feare men, nor God
himselfe; as it is said of the unjust Judge in the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, although we cannot wholly abstaine
from all sin, yet to take heed that we do not please our selves
in any sin, nor to go on and persist stubbornly, and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
in it.</p>

                  <p>THat the Apostle may aggravate that sin, which he had
laid to charge of the false teachers in the former words he
makes a comparison betwixt them and the Angels, such as is
made, verse 9. and the 10. But in this comparison there is
contained a two-fold dis-similitude, namely, of their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and their actions. Their condition, because the Angels
are high and mighty, but these men were of a low mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Their actions, because the Angels abstained from speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evill of dignities, but these men gave their minds unto it.
The former dis-similitude is set forth by a kind of Inequality,
of greater and lesser, because there is indeed a very great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality,
but this dis-similitude ariseth from the inequality.
Both parts of the comparison are disposed in a discreet axiom
as it were to this sense. Although the Angels do farre exceed
these dignities in power, yet they do not speak evill of them;
but these men, although they be far inferiour unto them in
power, yet they fear not to speak evill of them.</p>
                  <p>Touching the former part of the comparison two questions
may be made.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> The Angels are said to be greater in power and
might, not so much in respect of the false teachers, as in respect
of the dignities themselves, whereof the Apostle here speaks.
And the reason is, not only b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cause they are of a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

accusation against dignities, when God himselfe sometimes
speaks evill of them, and makes the Angels to execute his
malediction?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer:</hi> They are said to abstaine from speaking evill,
1 Because they do not speak evill, but when God commands
them, and therefore it is not their malediction so much as
Gods. 2 Though they do speak evill of the men that are set
in authority, and do evill also unto them sometimes, as we s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the example of <hi>Herod,</hi> and in the Host of <hi>Sena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>herib,</hi> yet
they do not speak evill of the dignities themselves, which was
the sin of these impostors, of whom the Apostle speaks.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Their sin is the greater, who are of a lower condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
if they wax proud and despise dignities, then if they were set
in a higher degree.</p>
                  <p>This is the ground of the Apostles comparison. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it would make nothing to the aggravation of the sinne of
these men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because his sin is the greater, that is drawn unto
sin upon the lighter occasion or smaller temptation.</p>
                  <p>2. Because such men are not moved by those reasons, that
might and should with-hold them from committing such a
sin, which other men have not after the same manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve for condemnation, to condemne the
fashion of some men of the lowest rank, who even in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of life are as proud, and more also sometimes, then
they that are in the highest degree of dignity and honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The Angels are greater in power then all men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve for the comfort of the faithfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God hath given the Angels a speciall charge over them,
so that they are said to pitch their tents about them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. These powerfull Angels do most religiously ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
from all sinne.</p>
                  <p>For what is here said in speciall, is to be understood also in
generall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, therefore the more
carefully to beware of sin; both because we are bound by the
Law at least as well as they, and also because other wise we
cannot have those good and powerful ministring Spirits to
take care of us.</p>

speaking evill of dignities, is aggravated by a new comparison
of the like, so that in this verse there is both a shewing of the
dissimilitute, and also a whole similitude explained by its
parts. The proposition of this similitude containes a descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of naturall bruit beasts: the Apodosis contains a descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of false teachers, according to those qualities which
they have proportionably with those bruit beasts. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the bruit beasts contains three things: 1 Their
inward nature, which is expressed by a negation, that they are
<hi>void of reason, bruits.</hi> 2. Their acts or operations, which are
said to proceed, not from counsell, but <hi>from nature, naturall.</hi>
3 Their end and destruction, that they are <hi>taken and destroyed.</hi>
To these there are three also answerable in false teachers:
1 That they are void of judgement, <hi>they understand not.</hi> 2 That
they are carryed with a naughty passion to speak evill, <hi>speak
evill of the things that they understand not.</hi> 3 That they bring
upon themselves destruction; <hi>they shall perish in their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>

                  <p>This is shewed in all those places of Scripture, where wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men are compared unto bruit beasts, either in generall, or
in speciall, to Horses, Mules, Dogs, Swine, Foxes, Wolves,
Beates, Lions, &amp;c. Yea, they that are in greatest honour and
esteeme in this world, are accounted no otherwise of by God,
then as bruit beasts. The Monarchs, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> are alwayes
compared unto wild beasts; and the Roman Emperours that
persecuted the Church, are pointed out in the Apocalyps by
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62450:111"/>
the name of the Dragon. And the Pope is not only called a
beast, but is described as a very great monster among the
beasts, with seven heads, and ten hornes.</p>

them by three chiefe vices, 1 By the luxury, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

means, as spots and blemishes, defile not only themselves, but
also those with whom they were conversant. Of which effect

so that the eyes and such like corporeall instruments are filled
two wayes, both in the ingresse and the egresse of sin: Whence
it comes to passe, that as the gates of a great City use to be

and increaseth the habit.</p>

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, according to the
counsell of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. to exercise our selves unto
godlinesse, not unto wickednesse. For as the Apostle there
saith, verse 8. that <hi>bodily exercise profiteth little;</hi> so in this
comparison may it be said, that the exercise of sin is not only
unprofitable, but very hurtfull.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle here still continues in explaining and illustrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the covetousnesse of these men by way of a similitude,
which he makes betweene them and <hi>Balaam</hi> the son of <hi>Bosor.</hi>
Now the quality wherein they are compared is first propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in generall, that they followed his way, that is, they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
him in the like manner of doing, and then set forth in
particular, 1 By the effect, that they forsook the right way,
and went astray into by wayes, that is, into naughty and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
wayes. 2 By the proper cause of this effect, that they
loved the wages of unrighteousnesse, like as he loved it, that
is, for the desire of filthy lucre they gave themselves over unto
impiety and unrighteousnesse. 3 By the adjunct that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
upon this effect namely, Gods rebuking of him, v. 16.
which is set forth by the instrument, that he made use of to do
it, namely, a dumbe Asse. The fitnesse also of this instrument
as he was made use of at that time, is declared by their inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
because he shewes that this Asse was in some sort wiser
then his Master. For when the Master, though he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,

The Doctrines arising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The wicked of every latter age do in their courses
imitate those wicked men, that lived before them.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>Following the way of
Balaam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For these men did not propose <hi>Balaam</hi> unto themselves for
an example to imitate, but because they went in the same
wayes, therefore they are said to have followed him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because that in-bred corruption, from which
such wicked courses are derived, as from their originall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
is one and the same. For although it doth not work
alwayes and in all altogether after the same mannor, yet when
it meets with natures alike, and the like occasions also happen,
then it is no lesse like it selfe, then an egge is like an egge.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the same teacher of wickednesse, the tempter
and old Serpent works effectually in his bond slaves through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all ages.</p>
                  <p>3. Because oftentimes also the courses fore-going do not
only by tradition, but by transmission as it were also beget
courses like themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to enforme us, not to be too much
troubled at the wickednesse of men, that live with us, because
there is nothing new under the Sunne in that kinde.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, not to expect any singular thing from
wicked men, while they remaine such, above that which we
read of other wicked men before them in ancient time.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us therefroe, to labour to be like the ancient
godly men, that are commended in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. This is common to all the wicked, to forsake the
right way, and go astray in that which is not good.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words, <hi>Which having forsaken
the right way are gone astray:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the right way is in observing the will
of God, or in doing the good works which God hath before
ordained that we should walk in them, <hi>Ephes. 2. 10. Psal. 119.
1, 2, &amp;c.</hi> But wickednesse is another crooked way, which
men have found out themselves, cleane contrary to the will of
God.</p>

                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:62450:115"/>
2. Because that is the right way which certainly leadeth
unto life, and eternall happinesse, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 14. but wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
tendeth unto death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 27. &amp; 8. 36.</p>

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, diligently to beware
of this going astray, alwayes looking unto the right way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Covetousnesse, where is prevaileth, doth most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
produce this going astray from the right way.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>who loved the wages of
unrighteousnesse:</hi> so 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. He that trusts in uncertaine
riches, doth not trust in the living God; and therefore he
doth necessarily follow a new way clean contrary unto that
which the true and living God hath shewed us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because a covetous man is obnoxious unto all the
temptations of the devill, which have any shew of gaine; so
that he accounts gaine godlinesse, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. 9. and this is it
which is meant in the text, <hi>they love the wages of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
that is, they seek lucre, though it be joyned with the

and flye from covetousnesse, as from the greatest plague
and enemy of godlinesse, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 50.</p>

transgressed by sin, doth therefore rebuke that sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7.</p>
                  <p>2. The consciences of sinners do usually also check them,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>3. The very creatures do it also after their manner, <hi>Deut,</hi>
31. 28. and if they should not in their appointed order suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
rebuke sinners, there should some extraordinary mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
be shewed rather then they should not be convicted, as we
see here in the example of <hi>Balaam.</hi>

unto these rebukings of God, and not to be carelesse of them,
as desperate men use to be; but to yeeld unto them, and shun
all those things that are rebuked by God, either in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or in our consciences, or in the creatures.</p>

that will not be rebuked or stopped in their impiety, unlesse it be by
some miraculous work.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the end of verse 16. <hi>the dumbe Asse

                  <p>

                  <p>IN these verses is contained a refutation of the false teachers,
of whom a description was made before. Now the sum of
this refutation consists herein, that all those things were vain,
which they promised to their disciples or followers. And this
is in generall shewed by those comparisons which are made
verse 17. Where these teachers are said to be wels as it were,
without water, and clouds without raine, because they make
shew of many things worthy to be desired, but they performe
nothing at all. Upon occasion of these similitudes, by the
way he repeats the punishment which God had prepared for
them, by a continuation of the same Allegory, namely, that
whereas they are wels as it were, or clouds making shew of
some mist, they shall at length certainly find the mist of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
darknesse. 2. The same vanity is illustrated by the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
cause that moved them to spread abroad their new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which was their swelling vanity, verse 18. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and by the effect thereof, which was their crafty sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of Christians to give themselves over to the lusts of the
flesh, at the end of the same verse. 3 The same vanity of their
promises is set forth, verse 19. at the beginning, by the great
dissimilitude and opposition that is betwixt them and their
promises. For they promised liberty unto others, when they
themselves were servants of corruption. Thence the vanity of
their promises is made manifest and palpable as it were; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they promised that, whereunto they themselves were
strangers, and far remote from it. 4. That which is put in the
dissimilitude, namely, that they were servants of corruption,
because some might make a doubt of it, the Apostle confirmes
it at the end of verse 19. by the generall definition or descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a servant, or that bondage which he meant, namely,
that he is another mans servant, that is overcome by him. For
he that is taken by the enemy in warre, is brought in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to him, at least untill he hath payed the just price of his
ransome. 5. The misery of this bondage is amplified in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of those, that have made profession of faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
by comparing things unequall, betwixt that condition,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62450:116"/>
whereunto they were obnoxious before their calling, and
this which they have brought upon themselves by their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie,
where the misery of the latter condition is made greater
then the former, vers. 20. and the reason of it is given, vers. 21.
Because the sin is greater, which is committed after and against
the knowledge of the right way, then that which is done
through ignorance; which inequality is also illustrated by a
comparison of the like things, that is explained in proverbiall
sentences, of the Dog and the Sow, verse 22.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Here ariseth a Question, Whether those that were
seduced by the false teachers, were before true believers?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> They had that faith which we use to call temporary
faith, but they were never soundly rooted in faith. This is
proved out of the 14 verse, where all those that were seduced
by these deceivers are called <hi>unstable soules.</hi> For if they had
beene by sound faith grafted into Christ, then they should
have been stable and corroborated in him also. And whereas
they are said verse 18. <hi>to have cleane escaped from the wicked,</hi> this
was, 1 In respect of the profession which they had made of
their true conversion. 2. In respect of the assent, which we must
think that they did give inwardly also unto the word, by
which they were called to this conversion. 3. In respect of
the change which they had made in their outward carriage.
4. In respect of some small beginning also, whereby they
tended towards holinesse it selfe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. They that go astray themselves from the right way,
and cause others to go astray, whatsoever they make shew of, they
have nothing else in themselves or in their errours but vanity.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered out of verse 17. and the beginning of 18.
For they are said in the text to be as it were vanity it selfe, as
<hi>Solomon</hi> faith of all things that are under the Sunne, in respect
of happinesse they are vanity of vanities. Now they are said
to be vain, 1. Because they have only a shew of some truth or
good, not the thing it selfe. 2. Because they make a shew of
communicating some good unto others, but they do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it, nor can they. For that is properly called vaine, which
is void of that thing which it should have, or which is unfit
for that use and end whereunto it should serve.</p>

                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they have forsaken God, who is the
fountaine of all true and solid good.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they are led by Sathan, who is the father of
lyes and of all vanity.</p>

this were to imbrace vanity in stead of eternall happinesse.</p>

much more must we think so of that knowledge which hath
a shew of some singular excellency, when there is no solid
good in it at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because such men seeme to themselves to be wise,
not only above the ordinary sort, but also above those that
excell in the Church of God, yea sometimes above the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
themselves and Prophets, and therefore are wont to boast
of some depths which they have; which the holy Ghost
therefore cals the depths of Sathan, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to informe us, alwayes to suspect those
men, that are in a wonderfull manner puffed up with their
own private conceits of some part of religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. That such men do oftentimes seduce many, and
have divers followers, it comes to passe chiefly thereby, that their
doctrine, either for the matter of it, or the manner of their teaching,
is very agreeable to the carnall lusts of men.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>they allure through the
lusts of the flesh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because as the flesh doth easily apply it selfe at all
times unto carnall doctrine, by reason of that communion
that is betwixt them; so especially and most easily doth it,
when the doctrine is covered with a shew of religion or truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve for admonition, that if we would be
safe from infection and seducing, we should diligently labour
for mortification of the flesh. For neither are they only in
danger of seducing that have not yet known the truth, but
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62450:117"/>
they also that have in some fort clean escaped from those that
live in errour, as it is in the text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. The chiefe lust of the flesh, whereby men are wont
to be seduced, is the love of carnall liberty.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the beginning of verse 19. So <hi>Psalme</hi>
2. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the flesh alwayes seeketh its peace and
quietnesse, which it cannot enjoy, but by giving it selfe over
unto the lusts thereof; and hence it is that carnall men account
the command of God and his Word, a yoke, and strong cords,
and bands, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. Because in liberty there is some kinde of shew of that
dignity and excellency, whereof all the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> are most
desirous ever since they drank in that poyson of the Serpent,
<hi>Ye shall be like Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Because it hath a false shadow of that Christian liberty,
whereunto we are called, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 32. 33, 34. Hence it is, that
the cursed sect of Libertines, which under a shew of liberty
overthrowes all religion, findeth many well-wishers thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
even amongst those that are Christians in name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne those, that alwayes
follow after liberty of what kind soever it be. For Christians
are the servants of righteousnesse, although they be free from
sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, to represse and restraine in our selves
this carnall desire of liberty, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. They that most labour for this carnall liberty, are
the most wretched servants of sin.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words; <hi>they are the servants of
corruption.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they are overcome and led captive by
sinne.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they give up themselves wholly to obey sinne,
Rom. 6. 16. 19.</p>
                  <p>3. Because they remain in this bondage, although it be the
worst of all, with a kind of pleasure; so that they are the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of sin more, then those are the servants of men, that are
gally-slaves: for these mens minds alwayes wish for liberty,
but the others are very well pleased in their most servile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:62450:118"/>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to infrome us, how we should stand
affected towards such men. For although they seem to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be the only happy men almost, yet they are in truth
objects most worthy of pity, and not of envie.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, more and more to get out of this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
by yeelding our selves wholly unto God and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18, 19, 22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. They that are brought into this bondage, after
that they have made profession and confession of the truth, their
condition is more deplorable, then the condition of other sinners.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from, verse 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because their sin is greater then other mens. For
where no law is, there is no sin; where the law or the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the law is lesse, there the sin is lesse: but where the
knowledge of Gods law and his will is greater, there the sin
is made greater and heavier.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they do wonderfully dishonour God, while
they professe themselves to have known his discipline, and to
have had experience of it in some measure, and do afterwards
reject it, and prefer sin before it.</p>
                  <p>3. Because the devill the Prince of sin doth more severely
beset those, that he hath withdrawne unto himselfe from the
flight as it were, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 45.</p>
                  <p>4. Because the anger of God is incensed against such men,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>5. Because there is scarce any place left for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish all those, that know the
way of God, to labour also to continue constantly in the
same, in all parts of their life and conversation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. The filthinesse of sinne should make men to abhorre
a returning to the bondage thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because we are called unto purity.</p>
                  <p>2. Because we have professed an abomination of that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which is in fin.</p>
                  <p>3. Because it is abominable unto God, and makes men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
in his sight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to condemne those, that take delight
in this filthinesse, and think they gain credit unto themselves
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62450:118"/>
thereby, by gracing and setting out their speech with oathes,
and labour to make their conversation pleasing, by applying
themselves unto the customes and vicious and filthy courses of
men.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, to put before out eyes this filthinesse
of sin. So shall we renew our repentance, and be confirmed in
the grace of perseverance.</p>

their blaspemies, from verse 5. to verse 11. 4 He shewes
the use and fruit of his doctrine, which all the faithfull should
make of it, from verse 11 to the end. In repeating the end and

it <hi>stirres up.</hi> 3. By the object, that it was directed unto them,

the manner how all these things might be made the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall:

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62450:119"/>
in the title which he gives them, when he cals them <hi>beloved.</hi>
Of the putting in remembrance we spake before, c. 1. v. 12 13.
and also of stirring up: Therefore passing over them, we come
to the next.</p>

purity, and sincerity, that they may receive the divine admonitions
as they ought to be received.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>I stir up your pure minds.</hi>
Now he doth not so much commend them by this his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because, as in all things that are of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there is alwayes required some preparing of the subject,
for example, as in husbandry, plowing and harrowing of the

sincerity to lay aside all those things, that are contrary to the

sincerity in those that receive it, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> c. 2. v. 2.</p>

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove those, that have no care

and sincerity of heart.</p>

and retain those things that are proposed unto them out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

                  <p>This is gathered from verse 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because Christs sheepe know his voice and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

                  <p>VPon occasion of the Apostles testimony before cited,
there is in these words a new description made of some
wicked men of whom we must greatly beware. For in that he
saith, that this is first to be knowne, what these wicked men
are, of whom he doth admonish us, he doth thereby mean not
only to shew that this is necessary to be known for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and applying of the Apostles words with benefit,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62450:120"/>
but also that this may and ought to be chiefly observed out of
the Apostles words, namely, that there shall come such men
in the last dayes. For so is this phrase explained, <hi>Iude,</hi> v. 18.
These wicked men are described in generall, 1 By their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
towards God, that they are <hi>scoffers.</hi> 2. By their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of life and deeds, that <hi>they walke after their own lusts.</hi>
Then in special by their arguing, that the wicked scoffers used,
to defend their impiety, and to remove the contrary doctrine
from themselves, verse 4 For in those words is expressed,
1 their scoffing, which was before noted in generall, and
2 their argument is set forth, wherby they would perswade
themselves and others, that they might walk after their own
lusts, without feare or danger: namely, because the comming
of God, the expectation whereof did deterre men from such
a life, is not to be feared, in these words: <hi>Where is the promise
of his comming?</hi> Now this they confirmed to themselves and
others by a vaine comparing the times that went before with
those that were to come; that whereas there was no comming
of the Lord to judge the world since the times of the Fathers,
and from the creation of the world, there was no cause to feare
that any such thing would happen at the end of the world,
in these words, <hi>For since the Fathers fell asleepe, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
as they were from the beginning of the creation.</hi> Now this
whole description, or rather the thing described, that is, this
impiety, is illustrated by the adjunct of time, wherein chiefly
and by a speciall kind of eminency or abundance it is found,
namely, <hi>in the last dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising here-hence.</p>

heed unto those things whereof we have greatest use.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>Knowing this first.</hi> For
the Apostle would, that for the present they should first and
chiefly think of those things, that the Apostles had spoken for
their present use, touching those wicked men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The Scripture foretels most grievous things of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. For that iniquity doth abound more in the last

                  <p>2. Because the last ages, by reason of that depravednesse and

troubled in mind, when we see as it were inundation of
iniquity and impiety, flowing every where; because such
things were foretold us before, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 4.</p>
                  <p>2. Not to fashion our selves to those courses, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they are not only unbelievers, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisers
of the faith also. For scoffing is from contempt.</p>
                  <p>2. Because their consciences are feared as it were with a
hot iron, that can be wrought upon by no instruction, and
therefore they are quite desperate. For they have quenched
and choaked even those naturall sparks, which are wont to
break out in all mens hearts.</p>
                  <p>3. Because they are the chosen instruments of the devill to
turne aside others from godlinesse, and to make the faithfull

that they may with all licentiousnesse, give themselves wholy

                  <p>2. Because such wicked opinions or imaginations do let

loose the raines to all concupiscence, and therefore are the
cause of increasing that wickednesse, whereof at the first they
were the effect.</p>

                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to informe us, not to think that
wicked and profane and Atheisticall men do speak from any
reason or judgement, when they scoffe at religion. For they
are beasts in their life, and therefore they have also beastly
imaginations, which they are wont to bring forth under a

deceive themselves, consists therein, that they will believe nothing
above their senses, and do oppose their sense against the testimony
of God.</p>

that the contradictions of profane men are void of
all reason, and therefore are to be contemned with detestation.

                  <head>The Analysis.</head>
                  <p>IN the refutation of this profane opinion, the Apostle doth
first reprove the ignorance of these profane men, verse 5. 6 7.
Secondly, he doth instruct the faithfull touching the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Lord in those things, that did most pertaine to
the confirmation of them in the truth against such temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that might arise from such humane cavillings, verse 8. 9,
10. The Apostle reproves their ignorance, 1 From the cause,
that it was voluntary or affected ignorance. 2 From the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
namely that truth, which they willingly were ignorant
of, and did oppugne. Now that truth which is affirmed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
that assertion, whereby these men would confirme
their opinion. For when they had said it, and had brought
it for an argument, that all things did continue in the same e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
from the beginning of the creation, the Apostle denies
this, and shewes the contrary by the history of the flood, v. 6.
then by comparing things alike, he gathers that the same also
is to be expected concerning the destruction of the world by
fire at the comming of the Lord, that was before in some sort
performed by the destruction of it in water, v. 7. 3 The reason
of this consequence is taken from the common cause of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
preservation, and both destructions of the world, namely,
the word &amp; will of God, v. 5. 7. 4 He doth illustrate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
it selfe concerning the destruction of the world by the
end thereof, that it may withall be applyed unto those wicked
ones, with whom he now dealt, v. 7 at the end, while he cals the
day of the Lord <hi>the day of judgement, and perdition of ungodly
men.</hi> For in these words he threatens eternall damnation unto
those profane men, that denied his comming, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be expected at the comming of the Lord.</p>

                  <p>The Doctrines arising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the property of wicked men to be willingly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of all things, that crosse their lusts.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>They willingly are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of.</hi> All men are ignorant of many things, but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
are not ignorant of those things that are necessary for
them unto salvation, nor do they please themselves in the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of any truth, much lesse in the ignorance of those
things that pertaine unto the practise of religion: nay they
do very much labour for this knowledge, whereby they may
be brought unto eternall life: but the wicked, although they
do very much desire to know other things, yea and are too
curious in it, yet they love to be ignorant of those things that
pertaine to the bridling of their lusts and reproving of their
sins. This is that ignorance which is called voluntary and
affected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they affect those vices whereunto this
knowledge is repugnant. Therefore they eschew knowledge
as a thing that is evill unto them, and makes against them; and
affect ignorance as a thing that is good for them and very
well agreeing with them. For he that hath resolved with
himselfe to give his mind unto sin, and to continue therein,
seekes to have peace and quietnesse in that condition, and
therefore abhorres that truth which convinceth his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of sin, and suffers him not to sleep in it.</p>
                  <p>2. Because he is given unto those lusts that stop up the way
unto saving knowledge, and hold him ensnared and intangled
so that he cannot freely endeavour and labour for true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
therefore he affects ignorance in this respect, not so
much in it selfe, as in the cause of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to convince those, that please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the ignorance of holy things, because this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of a wicked man.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, never to shut our eyes against the light
of the truth.</p>
                  <p>3. To exhort us, on the contrary to use all our endeavour
and give all diligence to gaine knowledge, especially
in those things that pertaine to our own practise and
life.</p>

of our ignorance, to look upon the works of God that are past,
that from them we may gather the works that are to come.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the comparison that is here made, v.
5. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because the works of God are as looking-glasses,

to behold.</p>

                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, not to look slightly
upon the works of God, nor to read the histories of them as
we read humane histories, but so, that we may alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
God in them.</p>
                  <p>

and destruction of the world, first by water, secondly by fire,
are often to be meditated upon, and compared one with the other.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the same comparison.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because God hath proposed those, as very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
arguments, to worke some sense at least of religion in
mens minds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to exercise our selves in
these meditations, which God hath commended unto all sorts
of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. In all such works of God, that is especially to be
considered that they are by the word of God, and do depend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 5, 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because we can receive no benefit by meditating
upon Gods works, unlesse we do behold the perfection of
God in them. Now the perfection of God in his works doth
very much appeare therein, that all things are done by his
word and according to his will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, to turne our eyes from
all second causes, and to acknowledge God and his word in
all things. For thence it comes to passe, that men often times
attribute those things unto fortune, which are done by God,
because they are ignorant of the power of Gods word. And
such an opposition there seems to be in the text, betwixt the
words of the wicked, (when they say that all things conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
making no mention in the mean time of God, by whose
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62450:123"/>
power they continue; but rather closely attributing this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
to fortune or second causes,) and that assertion of the
Apostle, whereby he affirmes that the world was at first by
Gods word, and is kept by the same word:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Every consideration of the works of God should be
applyed to the comfort of the faithfull, and terrour of the wicked.</p>

                  <p>IN this other patt of the refutation the Apostle propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
unto the godly and faithfull those things that might
establish and confirme their hearts in the truth, touching the
comming of the Lord. 1 Therefore he perswades them to
understanding and knowledge, contrary to the ignorance of
the wicked. For whereas he had spoken before of the wicked,
<hi>this they are willingly ignorant of,</hi> now turning to the faithfull
he exhorts them unto the contrary. <hi>But be not you ignorant of
this one thing.</hi> 2. He propounds the thing it selfe, which he
would have them in a speciall manner to understand and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
which containes two things. 1 That the prolonging
of the Lords comming is not with that slacknesse, which
should be a stumbling-block to any man, both because it is
not to be judged of according to our sense, but by the eternity
of God, in respect whereof that space of time, which seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s
very long unto us, is but as one day, v. 8. and also because the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62450:123"/>
end of this prolonging is the conversion and salvation of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
and therefore this prolonging proceeds not so much
from slacknesse, as from patience, verse 9. 2 That the manner
of his comming, (both because it shall be sudden, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it shall be with majesty and great terrour,) is such, that
it should rather make men carefull to prepare themselves for
it, then to be curious in inquiring about the time it selfe, or to
complaine of slacknesse.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When wicked and profane men are reproved, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and condemned in Scripture, this is done for the faithfull and
elects sake, whose edification and salvation God hath respect unto,
even when he seemes to speak unto others.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from the beginning of verse 8. where the
Apostle turning himselfe directly unto the faithfull, shewes
that these wicked men were refuted for their good. So 2 <hi>Thess.
2. 13. Iude,</hi> v. 20. 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 11. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the whole Scripture and all the meanes
of salvation do by a speciall kind of propriety belong unto
the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>2. Because God will not have his word to passe without
some fruit: Now wicked men are oftentimes so fore-lorne,
that no congruous fruit can be expected in them, but only in
the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to informe us, to judge aright of
Gods intention in those things that he doth about men that
are past all hope and incorrigible. For as the Apostle saith
of Oxen, that God taketh not care for Oxen, but for men;
so should we think that God taketh not care so much for these
bestiall men, as for the faithfull and elect whom he doth
chiefly speak unto, even when he seemes to speak unto others.</p>
                  <p>2. To admonish us, not to neglect or despise such rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
of the wicked, as if they did nothing belong unto us,
but wisely to turne it to our own use.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The faithfull do then profit by the word of God,
which is against the wicked, when they are become much unlike the
wicked.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that whereas the Apostle did
reprove the wicked of ignorance, he doth now exhort the
faithfull to knowledge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 15.</p>

                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because the courses and fashions of the wicked are
therefore set forth unto us, that we might avoid them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, not to suffer our selves
to be led away by the example of the wicked multitude. For
God doth not propose it as a thing to be followed, but to be
shunned and avoided.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. We should in a singular manner differ from the
wicked therein, that we judge of the wayes of God not according to
the sense of the flesh, but according to the nature of God.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>One day with the Lord.</hi>
With men it is otherwise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because spirituall things are to be judged of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually.
Now all the wayes of God are in some sort spirituall
and divine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to reprove those, that in such exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
are wont to consult with flesh and blood, and not
with the word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. The end of all Gods wayes, as they have respect
unto men, is the repentance and salvation of the godly.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from v. 9. Now here ariseth a question.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether all and every particular man be meant
thereby, when it is said, that God is not willing that any
should perish, but that all should come to repentance?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The patience of God according to its nature hath
that use and end, to lead all sinners unto repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.
and in that sense might their interpretation be admitted, who
understand these words and the like of all and every particular
man: But that the Apostle in this place hath speciall refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the elect, it appears thereby, that he speaking of the
beloved of God, verse 8. and reckoning himselfe amongst the
number of us, saith, that God is long-suffering to us-ward,
that is, towards those beloved, and is not willing that any
should perish that is, any of them: because Gods principall
work towards men is the salvation of the faithfull, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all his wayes tend thereunto, as unto the scope and mark
whereunto they are directed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to reprove the madnesse of those men
that blame those things in God, which make most for their
use and good, as these men do in the slacknesse of the Lords
comming.</p>

shall be with swiftnesse, majesty and terrour.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 10.</p>
                  <p>First, it shall be sudden, because the houre and day thereof
is not revealed, and because the most part of men expect no
such thing. And it shall be full of majestie and terror, because
it is the comming of the Lord not in humility, as his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
was, but in glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, to prepare our selvs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly

                  <p>IN these verses is contained an application of the doctrine,
that was before propounded concerning the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
to the use and edification of the faithfull. Now this
application is made by an exhortation to piety and holinesse,
which is first of all propounded, v. 11. Secondly, confirmed
by the doctrine that was before proposed concerning the
manner of the Lords comming, v. 12, 13. Thirdly, it is againe
repeated and pressed, v. 14. Fourthly it is againe confirmed
by the doctrine that was before proposed concerning the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and long-suffering of God, v. 15. begin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>which is in this
place confirmed by the testimony of the Apostle <hi>Paul:</hi> whose
testimony is illustrated, 1 Thereby, that he was frequent in
such testimonies, v. 16. begin. 2 By a preoccupation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the faithfull are admonished not rashly to wrest any thing
that <hi>Paul</hi> spake concerning such things, to a contrary sense,
because although he spake some things that are hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
yet they are such that they are not wont to be
wrested, but by some perverse men, who wrest the other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
also unto their own destruction. From all these he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres
in the last place a conclusion both of the fore-going ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
and also of the whole Epistle, which is, to have a
care to be stedfast, v. 17. and to labour for growth, v. 18. The
end whereof is shewed to be the glory of Christ in that doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
wherewith the whole Epistle is closed up.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines arising herehence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. All Scripture must be applyed unto a practicall use,
that it may advance holinesse and piety.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from v. 11. Now not only in this place is
this order of instruction observed, but in all the Epistles and
Sermons that are propounded in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the end of all Theologicall doctrine is
to live well.</p>
                  <p>2. Because a bare apprehension and speculation of the
truth, and a meere assent thereunto, is nothing worth, if it be
separated from the practise. For this is found in some sort in
the devils themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:62450:125"/>
3. Because the temptations of the Devill tend chiefly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
that if he cannot hide the truth, yet so to choak it, that
it can bring forth no fruit in the life; and thereupon he takes
occasion to mock and deride men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us all, to labour for this
both in private and in publike, in preaching, hearing, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and meditating upon Gods word; and never think that
we know any thing as we ought to know, unlesse we know it
unto piety and holinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. In piety and holinesse we must alwayes aime at and
labour for the highest perfection.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered 1 From the question, <hi>What manner of
persons ought ye to be?</hi> 2 From the plurall number, which is
used in the originall, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in your conversations, that
is, in all piety and holinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because every degree of piety and holinesse is as
desirable in it selfe as the first is.</p>
                  <p>2. Our desire and affection towards the highest degree of
holinesse and piety is a part of the very first degree. For
there is no true holinesse without a desire of perfect holinesse.</p>
                  <p>3. Because we are called unto perfect holinesse, neither can
we see God without it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to reprove those, that rest in a kind of
luke-warme profession, or in a partiall practise of piety and
holinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. It makes much for the advancing of piety; to look
for and hasten unto the commming of the day of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from v. 12, 14. So <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because it takes off our minds from all those
things, that belong unto this present world.</p>
                  <p>2. Because it makes us to prepare our selves for the world
to come, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to raise up our minds, as
much as may be unto this spirituall looking for the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Our chiefest care touching the comming of the
Lord, should be, to be found of him in peace.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from v. 14. Now by peace is meant that
condition which is pleasing unto God and approved of
him; whereupon not the anger, but the goodnesse and grace
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62450:126"/>
of the Lord is shewed in communicating all happinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the Lord is looked for, as the supreme
Judge, whose anger is to be flyed from and avoided, and his
approbation and good liking greatly to be sought for.</p>
                  <p>2. Because unlesse peace be then had, afterwards it cannot
be had for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, while we live here, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to seek to confirme our peace with God, and in our
own consciences. Now this is done by raising up in our selves
a lively faith and confidence, establishing our hearts with all
assurance of salvation, and following all those means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our calling and election is made sure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. From the long-suffering of God we must gather
those things which make for the promoting of our peace and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from v. 15. For when the Apostle tels us,
that we should account, that the long suffering of the Lord is
salvation, he means that we should so think wich our selves
and dispute of these things, that we should gather nothing
else from thence, but that God aimes at our salvation, and
therefore we also should take great care of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because by these meditations we should confirme
and increase both our faith and our sanctification. For our
reasonings and disputes, when they are rightly directed either
by the word, or by the works of God, as by a third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the strengthning of our faith and increase of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> unto a conclusion drawne from thence; they are those
morall means whereby we work out our salvation with feare
and trembling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to exercise our selves
more and more in such meditations: for being accustomed
thereunto, from them we shall gather honey and medicine,
whence others suck poyson; as we may see in this example,
where from the Lords prolonging of his comming the wicked
men did conclude those things whereby they might confirme
their profane opinions; but the faithfull are taught on the
contrary, by the same argument to conclude those things,
which make much for their salvation. Such is the Apostles
admonition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:62450:126"/>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. In the writings of the Apostles and Prophets, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
must have a speciall heed to those things, which do most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them to such connexions or conclusions.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from verse 15. Where <hi>Pauls</hi> testimony is
cited to confirme &amp; illustrate this connexion, &amp; not to prove
other things, which might easily be proved out of his writings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because these are most necessary for us to know,
and of perpetuall use.</p>
                  <p>2. Because that was the wisdome of God communicated
to the Apostles and Prophets, that they might explaine these
truths unto us most frequently, and clearly, which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that elogy which is given unto <hi>Paul</hi> in the text, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the wisdome given unto him he hath written unto us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to reprove those, that doe more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
by far give heed unto those things, which do little or
nothing at all touch the conscience of a man, or the practise
of his life. The inward inclination and disposition of a man
appeares manifestly by those things which he doth chiefly
heed in his reading and hearing: As if a man be given only to
the tongues, he will observe nothing but the words and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
If he be a lover of Chronology, he will take notice of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the things that have beene done, and the moments
of time wherein they were done: If he be a Disputer, one that
seeketh praise by arguing, he will marke nothing, but those
things which make for controversies: so a godly man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he will not neglect other things, which serve for his
use, yet he doth chiefly fix his mind upon those things, which
do most directly tend unto godlinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7. We must understand all these things so, as if they
were directly written unto us.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words, <hi>Hath written unto us.</hi>
So <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because such was the wisdome of God, which
spake in these holy men, that they wrote those things which
do belong unto us, as well as unto those that lived at that time.</p>
                  <p>2. Because God would have the Scripture to be the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
instrument of the Church, not of one age only, but of all
ages. Therefore every part of it is the rule of life both to me
and thee, as well as unto those to whom it was first given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:62450:127"/>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, not so much to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in the Scriptures, as if we were in another mans ground,
or in those things which belong unto others, and not unto our
selves.</p>
                  <p>2. To exhort us, to raise up our minds to receive the word
of God with a congruous affection. We may easily think with
our selves how our minds would be affected, if we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a letter that was written by the hand of God in heaven;
and directed unto us by name, and sent unto us by one of his
Angels: after the same manner should we be affected in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and hearing the written word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. In other truths that are lesse necessary for us to
know, there are some things hard to be understood.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from v. 16. He doth not say this of all
<hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, nor of any one whole Epistle, much lesse of the
whole Scripture, (as the Patrons of traditions, and Enemies
of Scripture would have it,) but of some few things: And he
seemes to point chiefly at some of those things, which <hi>Paul</hi>
wrote concerning the comming of the Lord, because he speaks
of that in this place, &amp; therefore it is very likely that he hath
reference unto those things which are spoken of, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because there are some divine mysteries so farre
remote from us, that in what words soever they be expressed,
they will alwayes be hard to be understood.</p>
                  <p>2. Because God would have some things, that are not of so
generall and necessary a use, out of his singular wisdome to
be more obscurely propounded: which seemes to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
reason, why those things of Antichrist, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. were in
the Primitive Church hard to be understood. For God would
for just causes, that Antichrist should come, and that most
men should be ignorant who he was, untill he did come.</p>
                  <p>3. God would exercise the industry and diligence of the
faithfull in searching the Scriptures, and finding out the sens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
and meaning of them, not to deter men from reading them as
the Papists use to do, by wresting this argument amisse. For
<hi>Peter</hi> in this place doth not discourage so much as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
sort of the faithfull from reading the Scriptures, but rather
stirs them up to read all the Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> although he tels
them that there are some things in them that must be read wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:62450:127"/>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. This may serve to admonish us, not to think it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
that we know the words of the Scripture, but to give all
diligence and labour to find out the true sense and meaning
of them.</p>
                  <p>2. To comfort us, that we should not be too much cast
down, if we do not fully understand some things in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
because we are told that there are some things hard to be
understood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 9. They are unlearned and unstable men, that wrest
the Scripture to maintaine their impiety.</p>
                  <p>For that the Apostle means, when he saith that they wrest
the Scriptures to their own destruction; not that it is such an
exceeding dangerous thing to interpret some place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
otherwise then it should be, but that it is the property of
a very wicked man to argue out of the word of God against
God, or against his will. Now they are called unlearned, not
because they have no skill in the tongues or arts, wherein
such pestiferous men may sometimes excell; but because they
never effectually learned or were taught those things which
pertaine unto religion: And in the like manner are they called
unstable, because in that knowledge of the truth which they
had and professed, they were not grounded and rooted, but
as men not grounded nor setled they are easily turned from
their profession.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve for admonition, that the people should
not therefore be deterred from reading the Scriptures, as the
Papists would have it, (who in this very thing shew themselves
to be unlearned and unstable, because they do mischievously
wrest this place, where they are expresly told, with how great
danger it is wont to be done:) but that we should labour to
cast off all ignorance and unsteadfastnesse, that so we may be
made fit to read the Scriptures with profit. For this is the
scope of the admonition, as the Apostle useth it in this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 10. The end and scope of all divine information and
instruction in respect of the faithfull is, that they may be stablished
and grow in that grace which they have received.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered therehence, that this is the conclusion of
this generall Epistle, as it was of the former; which holds good
also in all other Epistles and Sermons, in respect of those that
are now faithfull:</p>

                     <hi>Reas.</hi> Because by their effectual calling they have faith, hope,
and charity begotten in them, so that they have the principle

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 11. To obtaine stedfastnesse in grace there is required a
fore-knowledge of those things that tend to the confirming and
strengthening of our minds.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from these words: <hi>Seeing ye know these
things before.</hi>

whereof he spake.</p>

stedfastnesse of grace a continuall and vigilant heed.</p>

This is gathered from this word, <hi>Beware.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because knowledge is unprofitable, if it be not
reduced to practise. Now practise in difficult things cannot
be had without care and heed.</p>
                  <p>2. Because many are the fallacies wherewith we are assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
both in the Devill and his instruments that are without
us, and in our selves also, by reason of that marvellous deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of our hearts, such as cannot be expressed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, above all to take notice
of our selves, and those things that tend to the strengthning

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 13. It should be an argument to the faithfull to beware
of the errors of some men, because they are wicked men, ungodly,
and profane.</p>
                  <p>This is gathered from that title, <hi>the error of the wicked.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> Because all those things that have any agreement
with ungodlinesse are to be shunned and avoided. Now those
things that are in a speciall manner approved of by profane
men, must necessarily have an agreement with profane ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to admonish us, by this means amongst

                  <p>This is gathered from the connexion of v. 17. with the 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because like as trees and all plants, and also li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creatures, from which this metaphor is taken, are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborated
by growth, while they acquire greater and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
strength, so also do the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>2. Because the stedfastnesse of grace consists not therein, that
it continues in the same degree, but that it is formed in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
one property whereof of is, to grow untill it come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> This may serve to exhort us, to labour therefore to be
so stablished, that we may also grow and increase in all grace.</p>

                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because we are the servants of Christ bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
