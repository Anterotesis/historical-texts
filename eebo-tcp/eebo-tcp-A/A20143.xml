            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat is the force of Vertue (Right Honorable Counseller) to wynne loue and good will vniuersally, in whose minde soeuer it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitelye knowne, to haue once gotte a dwelling. I speake it for this ende, that being so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie of late time from my other studies, and musinge on this world, in the middest of my bookes: I did then (as I haue oftentimes else done) deepelye thinke of Sir Iohn Checke Knyght, that rare learned man, and singular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of this lande. And as the remembrance of him was deare vnto me, for his manifolde great gifts and wonderfull vertues: so did I thinke of his most gentle nature and godly disposed minde, to helpe all those with his knowledge and vnderstanding, that any waye made meanes vnto him, and sought his fauour. And to say for my selfe amongest others, I founde him such a friende to me, for communicating the skill and giftes of hys minde, as I cannot but during my life speake reuerentlye of so worthie a man, and honor in my hart the heauenly remembrance of him. And thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of my being with him in Italie in that famous Vniuersitie of Padua: I did cal to minde his care that he had ouer all the Englishe men there, to go to their bokes: and how gladly he did reade to me and others certaine Orations of Demosthenes in Greeke, the interpretation wherof, I and they had then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mouth. And so remembring the rather this world by the very argument of those actions: I did then seeke out amongest my other writings for the translation of them, and happily finding some, although
<pb facs="tcp:10092:6"/>
not all: I was caried streightways (I trust by Gods good motion) to make certaine of them to be acquainted so nigh as I coulde with our Englishe tongue, aswell for the aptnesse of the matter, and needefull knowledge now at this time to be had: as also for the right notable, and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent handling of the same. And here must I saye, confessing mine owne weakenesse and imperfection, that I neuer founde in my life any thing so harde for me to doe. Yea, the more that I looke vpon this Orator to bring his sentences and wordes knowne to our common speach and language: the more doe I finde him harde and vnable to be translated, according to the excellencie of his tongue. And manye times I haue bene ashamed of my selfe, when I compared his Greeke and my English togither. And no marueyle neyther. For the Latine translatours being otherwise most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men, haue not alwayes satisfied themselues, much lesse aunswered to their charge and enterprise in the opinion of others that compared their doings and the Greeke togither. Hyeronymus Wolfius hath translated all Demosthenes (the like thing neuer yet done by anye other) and herein he is very carefull to keepe himselfe to the Greeke, and doth (as it shoulde seeme) better vnderstande Demosthenes than any other, and yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, either he is not well vnderstoode, or else he fayleth of Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes meaning. And beeing thus very curious in his translation to followe his Author as nigh as may be: his Latine is now and than somwhat harsh, and more harde than is the Greeke it selfe. Christopherus Hegendorphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us a notable learned man vndoubtedlye, makes himselfe ouerbolde with Demosthenes, enlarging his speach after the maner of a Paraphrasis, where as Demosthenes prayse was chiefly, his short knitting vppe of his matters togither. Philip Melanchthon, misliketh himselfe, and yet he hath done very well, but compared to the Greeke he is to seeke. Ioachimus Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius (for that which he hath taken in hande) deserueth great prayse with the best, and yet he doth not fully satisfie all men for his doings. Petrus Clobardus hath very learnedly translated the three first Orations made in fauour of the Olynthians, and varieth from others in sense, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their misliking, and perhaps not alwayes expressing the verie force and pyth of the Greeke phrase. Nicholas Carre our Countrieman one notably learned in the Greeke tongue when he liued, as it is well knowne: hath done all these Orations passing well in eloquent Latine, that I haue done in English: who varieth from all others euen in the very sense some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times and vnderstanding of the Author, &amp; seemes to haue reason with him. Maister Cheeke (whome I dare match with anye one before named for his knowledge in the Greeke tongue,) hauing traueyled in Demosthenes as much as any one of them all, and famous for his learning throughout Europe: yet was he neuer so passing in his translations that no exception
<pb facs="tcp:10092:6"/>
coulde be made against him. And then what shall I thinke of my selfe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the naming of so manye excellent learned men, but onely submit my doings to the fauour of others, and desire men to beare with my weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For this must I needes confesse, that I am altogither vnable to doe so in Englishe, as the excellencie of this Orator deserueth in Greeke. And yet the cunning is no lesse, and the prayse as great in my iudgement, to translate any thing excellently into Englishe, as into any other language. And I thinke (although there be many doers) yet scant one is to be found worthie amongst vs, for translating into our Countrie speach. Such a hard thing it is to bring matter out of any one language into another. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be that euen those who take themselues to bee much better learned than I am (as what is he that is not, hauing any name for learning at all?) will finde it an harder peece of woorke than they thinke, euen to make Greeke speake Englishe, if they will make proofe thereof as I haue done. Whose labor and trauayle I woulde as gladly see, as they are lyke now to see mine, that such an Orator as this is, might bee so framed to speake our tongue, as none were able to amende him, and that he might be founde to be most like himselfe. The which enterprise if any might haue bene most bolde to haue taken vpon him, Sir Iohn Cheeke was the man, of all that euer I knew, or doe yet know in Englande. Such acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance had he with this notable Orator, so gladly did he reade him, and so often: that I thinke there was neuer olde Priest more perfite in his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>eise, nor supersticious Monke in our Ladies Psalter as they call it, nor yet good Preacher in the Bible or testament, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in Demosthenes. And great cause moued him so to be, for that he sawe him to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitest Orator that euer wrate for these two thousand yeares almost by past (for so long it is since he was) and also for that he perceyued him to haue before his eyes in all his Orations the aduauncement of vertue as a thing chiefly to be sought for, togither with the honor and welfare of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Besides this, maister Cheekes iudgement was great in translating out of one tongue into an other, and better skill he had in our English speach to iudge of the Phrases and properties of wordes, and to diuide sentences: than any else had that I haue knowne. And often he woulde englyshe his matters out of the Latine or Greeke vpon the sodeyne, by looking of the booke onely without reading or construing any thing at all: An vsage right worthie and verie profitable for all men, aswell for the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the booke, as also for the aptnesse of framing the Authors mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and bettering thereby their iudgement, and therewithall perfiting their tongue and vtterance of speach. Moreouer he was moued greatly to like Demosthenes aboue all others, for that he sawe him so familiarly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himselfe to the sense and vnderstanding of the common people, that
<pb facs="tcp:10092:7"/>
he sticked not to say, that none euer was more fitte to make an English man tell his tale praise worthily in any open hearing, either in Parlament or in Pulpit, or otherwise, than this onely Orator was. But seeing maister Cheeke is gone from vs to God, after whom we must all seeke to follow, and that this thing is not done by him, the which I woulde with all my hart had bene done, for that he was best able: it can not be counted now I trust, any fault in me, if I endeuour to doe that, the which I neuer sawe done before me. And in dede my labor can be no hurt to any body, except it be to my selfe. For the Greeke is as it was, and those that weare Grecians may read the Greke stil notwithstanding my English. And such as haue no Greeke, may goe to the Latine for all my doings, or any other translation else in any other strange tongue or language. For as I do heare say, certaine peeces of Demosthenes are translated also into diuers other tongues. But such as are grieued with translated bokes, are lyke to them that eating fine Manchet, are angry with others that feede on Cheate breade. And yet God knoweth men would as gladly eate Manchet as they, if they had it. But all can not weare Veluet, or feede with the best, and therefore such are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented for necessities sake to weare our Countrie cloth, and to take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to harde fare, that can haue no better. But what reason haue they I pray you that will not suffer men to write reason as well as to speake rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? for this I dare say, that euen those men, if they haue any reason with them at all, will vse in their proofes vpon weightie matters, the arguments of Demosthenes or reasons of like value. And may not I or any other sette downe those reasons by penne, in our English language, the which are vttered daily in our common speach, by men of vnderstanding? Now wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is that minde the which doth enuie welfare or wisedome to an other bodie, bicause the same man can not be so welthie, or as wise as the best. And therefore in my simple reason, there is no harme done I say to anye body by this my English translation, except perhaps it be to my selfe. For whereas I might haue liued peraduenture vnder the colour of silence and stilnesse in some opinion of learning: I may now perchaunce with myne ouermuch boldenesse in seeking to fashion so famous an Orator out of Greeke into English: happen to bewraye mine owne vnskilfull dealing. But howsoeuer it is, I had rather hazarde rebuke, if by this meanes I could towle out some other to do this perfitely, the which I haue only assaide to do plainly and homely: than to suffer so noble an Orator and so necessarie a writer for all those that loue their Countries libertie, and welfare, to lye hid and vnknowne: especially in such a daungerous worlde as this is. And although your honour hath no neede of these my doinges, for that the Greeke is so familiar vnto you, and that you also, as well as I, haue hearde Sir Iohn Cheeke read the same Orations at other times: yet I thinke for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb facs="tcp:10092:7"/>
causes I shoulde in right present vnto your honour this my traueyle the rather to haue it through your good liking and allowance, to be made common to many. First the sayd Sir Iohn Cheeke (whome I doe often name, for the honour and reuerence due to so worthie a man) was your brother in lawe, your deare friende, your good admonisher, and teacher in your yonger yeares, to take that way of vertue, the fruite whereof you do feele and taste to your great ioy at this day, and shall for euer be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred therefore. Againe, by him you haue hearde these Orations redde and translated, as I after you (although out of Englande) haue hearde the same likewise of him, to my great comfort and profite in learning. Thirdly the Orator himselfe hauing bene a Counsellor in his Countrie as you now are in this Realme, he is your glasse I am wel assured wherevpon you do often loke, and compare his time, with this time: Countrie with Countrie: neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with neighbours: and King with King. Lastly your great goodnesse vsed to me from time to time, togither with that your good conceyued o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to enhable me to deale in things much aboue my power: (for so it pleased you to like and allowe of me) all these respectes I say, doe mooue me at this time, to offer most humbly to your honor this mine enterprised traueyle of so noble an Orator of those his seauen seuerall famous Orations wherof three are made in fauour of the distressed Olynthians sometimes a warlike people in Thracia, now called Romania: and the other fowre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled against king Philip of Macedonie by name. The arguments wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and Orations also shall hereafter appeare translated in order. And after this done his lyfe and dealings shall be truly set forth, and his faultes tolde aswell as his vertues rehearsed. That it may appeare hee was a man subiect to imperfections &amp; lacks as others are: and though he was in some things for his rare vertues and singular giftes most excellent and passed all others: yet had he his wants, as what is he that hath not?
according to that saying in Titus Liuius of Maharball to Anniball, after that great victorie gotte at Cannas in Italie against the Romanes. <q>God neuer gaue all thinges to any one man.</q>
And thus hauing done my voluntarie taske, I desire none other thankes for all my labor and traueyle herein, but your fauourable defence against certaine, that will doe nothing themselues, and yet will finde fault with all thinges, being in nature Drones, and no Bees: Lubbers and no learners: as voyde of sounde iudgement and vnderstanding, as they are out of reason curious iudges, ouer the traueile and paines taking of others. But who can stoppe these open mouthed talkers? emptie vesselles make the greatest sounde, and ringe out a hollowe noyse to small purpose, and so doe these that haue the least skill and smallest knowledge, make the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest bragge, and are the boldest of all others without cause or reason God he knoweth. Of which croking paddockes, and manifest ouerweeners of
<pb facs="tcp:10092:8"/>
themselues: I doe make verie little account, or no reckoning at all. Your sounde iudgement Sir and good likyng, maye be of sufficient value with me to holde my selfe well contented whatsoeuer shall be sayde to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. And thus most heartilye I doe wishe to that heauenlye minde of yours a strong and lustie bodie, that in these perillous dayes your payne and trauayle may runne in equall course with your knowledge and vnderstanding.

And thus I begyn after a sort to chalenge prayse to my selfe, euen at the very first chop on Gods name: for that I haue thus trauayled &amp; bene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaynted wyth this famous Orator. But how I haue profited I know not, nor yet if I knewe, would I make any great bragge of it. Thus much I thynke I may boldly say, it is no small happe for any man to hit
<pb facs="tcp:10092:9"/>
vpon the best, euen at the verie first beginning. As for prayse (as I sayd) I doe not looke for any, much lesse do I desire it, and what good I haue done to my selfe, that wyll appeare hereafter: Once vertue is contented with hir owne selfe, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is of hir owne nature ful sufficiency, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neede of outward ayde or borrowed fauour. And therfore he that doth well, and profiteth in vertue &amp; learning, nedeth not much to long after the good liking or allowance of others. For glory and welfare do as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow well doings, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shadow followeth the bodie: as the which are in all ages the necessarie rewards of vertue. I do not disprayse any mans trade of lyfe eyther of elder tyme, or of later yeares: but I doe preferre in all faculties some certaine before others. As in Cosmographie Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus: in Arithmeticke our Tonstale, and Tartalio the Italian: in Geometrie Euclides, in Astronomye Aratus, in Philosophie Aristotel and Plato, in Phisick Hippocrates &amp; Galenus, in law Iustinian y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, or rather Trebonianus &amp; others that gathered the lawes: in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories Titus Liuius and Cesar for the Latine, Thucidides and Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus as Quintilian sayth, wyth certayne others for the Greeke: in elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence Demosthenes and Cicero, the one for the Greeke, and the other for the Latine. And hee that in all these faculties doth chieflye and aboue all others, followe these aboue named: he taketh the best way that maye bee in my mynde to doe himselfe the most good. For what is he that ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into any facultie would not desire (if he myght) to excell all others? And who can euer come to any such excellencye that doth not acquaynte himselfe first wyth the best, yea and seeketh to followe the chiefest that haue traueyled in those thinges, the perfection whereof hee wysheth to gette? So did Plato traueyle from Greece into Aegypt: Aristotell from Stagira in Macedonie, to Athens in Greece, to heare his maister Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: and Cicero from Rome to Athens, and Anacharsis that barbarous Scithian to talke with Solon that wyse law maker of Athens, seeking euerye one of them the best abrode, when they coulde not haue them at home. Neither doe I repent me to haue traueylde in this wryter amongst others, who for excellencie passeth all others, and the more that he is stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed, the better he is lyked. For that there are hydde in him many secrete ornamentes, the which at the very first, doe not appeare, and are hardly to be vttered by me I confesse, in our Englysh tongue. Quintilian doth so set foorth this wryter, that he gyueth him the prayse aboue all others, specially for the graue and pithye handlyng of his matters much better than any man else. And therefore in comparing Cicero and Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes togither, hee sayth that it needeth not so to doe, for that they were both most excellent men. And yet he wylleth that Demosthenes shoulde chiefly be read, naye rather to be cunde without booke, worde by worde of euery body. And concluding after a certayne comparison made of them both, sayth that Demosthenes beyng the elder, hath made Tullie to bee for the most part such a one altogither as he was. Then what should let but that all those who desire to be eloquent men (the chiefest ornament that can be giuen to man vpon earth) shoulde chieflye studie Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and followe hym by all meanes possible, seeyng Cicero attayned to
<pb facs="tcp:10092:9"/>
such eloquence vp the onely imitation of so famous an Orator? Now they that wyll be such <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as he was, must doe as he did, that is, they must not spare any labor, but be alwayes occupied, and chiefly follow this mans profession, whose watchinges and paynes taking weare notable, as may appeare by the report made in his lyfe. Yea hee was so full set to atteine vnto the excellency of eloquence, that being vnapt &amp; vntoward by nature through many his great impediments: he warred as it should seeme with Nature, &amp; conquered Nature also, with very great paynes takyng, and continual wrastling for the victory. Neyther could any else that haue bene naturally apt, and had no let at all to be excellent Orators, euer be able to exceede Demosthenes, notwythstandyng all the barres and hinderances, that by Natures iniurie happened vnto him. Besides this, (as I haue sayde elsewhere) he was temperate of hys diet and kept his health, and encreased hys witte with sobrietie, and moderate vsage of him selfe at all tymes: a thing most requisite for any one that myndes to compasse great matters vpon earth. And where as all men of any vnderstanding seeke to follow some one, vnto whom they desire to be lyke, or if it may be, to passe him (the readiest way no doubt, for any one, to waxe most excellent) De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes did imitate and follow first Plato, and after Thucidides hys Countriemen both, the one a Philosopher, the other a Chronicler of the warres betwixt Athens &amp; Peloponnesus. And so well did he like Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides that manye times he did borrowe whole sentences of him, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by his very first sentence of the first Oration in fauour of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynthians, the which sentence and diuers other sentences hee tooke out of Thucidides first Oration made in fauour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Corcereans now Corfu, &amp; out of the next Oration made by the Corinthians against the said Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereans. Yea, it doth appeare that he did borow his chiefe arguments and best reasons that he vseth, out of this mans Orations: &amp; that he did as it should seeme, imitate wholy Thucidides inuention. Wherevnto agreeth Vlpianus, who affirmeth that Demosthenes chiefe desire was, to haue Thucidides veyne and gift of writyng in all thinges. And in deede such was Demosthenes diligence and painfulnesse about this Author that he did wryte out with his owne hande, the whole hystorie of Thucidides (being a booke fully so bigge as all the newe Testament is) no lesse than eyght seuerall tymes. A trauayle certes right painefull, and yet the paynes very well bestowed, when so good fruite did followe therevpon. For no doubt Demosthenes by suche imitation and paynefull labor, came to that heigth of perfection, whereof he beareth the name, that is, to bee the chiefe Orator of all Greecelande, yea of all the worlde besides, I may well say. For in three or fower poyntes vnited in him togither, without doubt he passed greatly all others, that euer weare. First he had a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar iudgement to deuyse good matter, and to dispose the same most aptly, as tyme and place required: Agayne, he had the stomacke of a Lion, to speake boldly although not to fight manfully, and did vtter his meaning with such myght and grauitie, that he appalled greatly the courages of all others whatsoeuer: Thirdly his vtterance was so good (beyng made so by Arte, euen agaynst Nature) that neuer anye hath had better, eyther
<pb facs="tcp:10092:10"/>
since or before. Lastly, he is to be praysed for that, which passeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gyftes, that is, he was a very honest man, a iust dealer, a true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect alwayes to his countrie. And therefore although in some one of these gyftes, he myght perhaps be matched: yet was there neuer anye compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him for them all togyther. And of these his doynges the world is so true a iudge, that I neede not much to spende anye farther talke, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some will saye, that Tullie is to bee compared with hym in all things. Of the which two men if I shoulde saye my mynde flatly, there be perhaps that would byte the lippe at it, and count mee fonde in myne enterprise. And yet thus much I may boldly say, that Demosthenes hath more matter couched in a small roume, than Tullie hath in a large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, &amp; that Demosthenes writing is more binding, more fast, firme, and more agreable to our common maner of speach, than Tullies Orations are. And who so speaketh now as Demosthenes doth, I doe thynke hee should be counted the wiser, the more temperate, and the more graue man a great deale, than if he wholy followed Tullie, and vsed his large veyne and vehement maner of eloquence. Besides this, Demosthenes vsed a playne familier maner of writing and speakyng in all his actions, applying hymselfe to the peoples nature and to their vnderstanding without vsing of Proheme, to wynne credite, or deuysing conclusion to moue affections and to purchase fauor after he had done hys matter: whereas Tullie with his flowing eloquence, sought to wrest the iudges to hys purpose both at the beginning, in the middle, &amp; at the end, not trusting as it shou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d seeme to the goodnesse of his cause, or to speake more modestly it was sufferable in Rome, to vse these practises of eloquence, both in the beginning &amp; ending of their orations to aduance their matters withall, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same being vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde in Greecelande, vpon paine of displeasure. And were it not better &amp; more wisedome to speake plainly &amp; nakedly after the common sort of men in few words, than to ouerflowe wyth vnnecessarie and superfluous elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as Cicero is thought sometimes to doe? But perhaps wheras I haue bene somewhat curious to followe Demosthenes naturall phrase, it may be thought that I doe speake ouer bare Englysh. Well I had rather follow his veyne, the whych was to speake simply and plainly to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peoples vnderstanding, than to ouerflouryshe wyth superfluous speach, although I might therby be counted equall with the best that euer wrate Englysh. For Demosthenes speaketh alwayes matter &amp; hath such force in hys maner of wryting, as no man hitherto hath euer bene able to expresse, and all men haue styll had hym in moste hygh admiration for the same. But why doe I compare these two noble vertues togyther? makyng the one better than the other, whereas they weare both most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Orators, and chiefe ornamentes of eyther their owne countries in their dayes: both of them a rare example of nature, and such as none in anye age, hath bene lyke for excellencie, to eyther of them. Then what needes such comparisons, when both are equally chiefe in their kynde? as Quintilian hath very well declared, in rehearsing their vertues seuerally, and in lapping vp his matter, sayth in thys wise, that vnto Tullie nothing can be added, and from Demosthenes nothyng can be taken away wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:10092:10"/>
harme doyng to eyther of them. And therefore to returne to Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes, I saye, he is to be read of yong and olde, of learned and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, of wyse, and vnwyse, for that he hath in hym to serue all mens turnes whatsoeuer. He that loues hys countrye, and desires to procure the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of it, let him reade Demosthenes, and he shall not want matter to doe hymselfe good. For him that seekes common quietnesse, Demosthenes can <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eache hym the lesson: he that woulde gladlye preuent euyll to come, Demosthenes is for his purpose: He that desires to serue hys Countrye abrode, let hym reade Demosthenes day and nyght, for this is he that is able to make hym fitte to doe any seruyce for his Countryes welfare. For neuer dyd glasse so truely represent a mans face, as Demosthenes doth shewe the worlde to vs, and as it was then, so it is now, and wyll be so still, tyll the consummation and ende of all things shall be. The Deuill neuer ceaseth from the beginning of the worlde to make diuision betwixt Countrie and Countrie, to stirre ciuill warre, to enboulden the commons agaynst their superiours, to put euill thoughts into Counsellers heades, to make people ambicious and couetous, and to corrupt the hartes euen of the very messengers and preachers of Gods word, continuing his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyse styll in all places wyth all men. And therefore seeyng Demosthenes is so good a Schoolemayster for man to decypher the Deuill and hys ministers for the aduauncement of vpryghtnesse in all thinges: I would wyshe that all men woulde become his Scholers, yea, if it might bee I would that all youth weare first taught Greke, (for so Quintilian would haue it) and that they after some rypenesse in the tongue, and of elder yeares, weare fully acquaynted wyth Demosthenes, to learne hym with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke, that they myght perfite their iudgementes by oft readyng so worthy a man. Alexander was angrye wyth a Schoolemayster of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, bicause he did not teache them Homer. I wyll not be angrye wyth Schoolemaysters, but I woulde wyshe that Schollers beyng of rype yeares, and otherwyse trayned before in other Authors: weare taught Demosthenes, and not Homere onelye. Once this is most true, that the wysest man lyuing may learne of Demosthenes, how to benefite hymselfe and to doe good to hys Countrye, and to mayntayne also the safety of it. And a thing I haue to report, the whych almost is scant credible, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a certayne ambassage made. And yet bicause I doe finde it written, I wyll make it knowne farther. Petrus Mosellanus a notable learned Germane, the restorer of good learning about fiftye yeares past, at what tyme he was famous in the Vniuersitie of Lipsia in hygh Almayne, dyd report vnto Christopherus Hegendorphinus a Germayne also, and a man of no lesse worthynesse, not onely for the Greeke, but also for the law whereof he made profession, that Bessario a Grecian borne and Cardinal in the tyme of Eugenius the fourth Pope of that name, and ouerlyuing hym tyll Xistus was Pope in the yeare of our Lorde God. 1484. desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of hys owne accorde to goe as Legate into Fraunce, to appease the great malyce that was then betwixt Lewys the .xj. of Fraunce, &amp; Charles of Burgondie, and to exhort the same Kyng to turne hys warres vppon the Turke. The which Ambassage, as Mosellanus sayth, when he tooke
<pb facs="tcp:10092:11"/>
vpon him, he vsed for hys speache to the Frenche King one of the Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Demosthenes in Greeke, made agaynst Philip of Macedonye as it laye worde for worde, alteryng verye fewe sentences or none in the discourse of hys whole matter, sauyng that hee applyed that agaynst the Turke, which Demosthenes vsed agaynst King Philip. Whereby it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that Bessario beyng a notable learned Grecian, did see, not onely a patterne for hymselfe to vse in those dayes, but also a meane to woorke some good reformation by, for thamendement of thinges amysse, and the aduauncement of Gods truth and iustyce. Then how much is this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to bee esteemed, that hauing wrytten almost two thousande yeares past, can haue fresh matter styll, for an Ambassador to doe hys Legacye to a forreyne king, so manye hundreth yeares after. And as thys most learned Ambassador did helpe hymselfe then, to aduaunce the goodnesse of hys matter: so may all others at thys tyme, and hereafter doe the like, and not onely Ambassadors but Counsellers also, may finde great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of matter to doe their country good withall. For as Thucidides sayth, <hi>Tempora adferunt similia exempla donec hic mundus &amp; haec rerum natura manet.</hi> That is to say: like time bringeth forth lyke examples, so long as the world lasteth, &amp; the course of nature continueth. But what doe I in seeking to commende this Orator? I had neede to haue the eloquence of the Orator himselfe, hauyng so large a fielde to walke in. Howbeit, his owne workes, are sufficient ynough to commend themselues, beyng read in his naturall tongue, seeming perhaps but bare as they are now brought into Englyshe. But this I haue done onely to giue occasion to others much better learned than I am, to take this matter vpon them, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing plainlye, that euen in these my small traueyles, both Cambridge and Oxforde men, haue gyuen me their learned aduise, and in some things haue set to their helpyng hande. Thys I speake, bicause I woulde not defraude any of their prayse. And touching Demosthenes worthynesse although I neede not saye anye more: yet wyll I set foorth after thys Prologue, the seuerall reports of diuers learned men, that haue spoken and written in all ages of his prayse, and so leaue the consideration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to others. I, for myne owne doynges must euer make this request, that hauing a good meaning with me, none may blame me for mine enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, although things doe not so fall out, as I woulde haue them, many may well desire. For Demosthenes is not so easie to bee englyshed, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he for all mens vnderstandings and capacities. Thys I thought good to aduertise the gentle Reader: that whereas in the printing of this booke, there is sometimes a sentence, or halfe a sentence in the small Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke letter, the same is not in the Greeke, but added onely, for the more playne vnderstanding of the matter, that such as bee not learned, may the rather go thorow with the reading of these Orations, without any stic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at all. Other things that are harde and straunge, for the matter and Countries whereof he speaketh: I haue done myne endeuour to make them easie and better to bee knowne, wyth deuising addicions in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, such as I was best able to frame. Besides this I haue set forth the towne of Athens seuerally, with a certayne declaration or rather limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:10092:11"/>
of Greeceland, and also haue giuen as occasion serued, the names that be vsed at thys tyme, to diuers of their auncient townes. They that like not my labour, may suffer me to abounde wyth mine owne humor, and to serue my fantasie, as I am well contented, that they shall vse their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and satisfie their appetite, as they thinke meete. For so that vertue be aduaunced, no man is to be mislyked, although hee doe but meanely. Neyther is it possible nor yet agreeing wyth nature, that euerye man can excell. But howsoeuer it bee with vs, better or worse, let euerye man haue thys before hys eyes in all his lyfe and doyngs: first to honour God as hee hath willed himselfe to bee honoured: next to loue the naturall Countrie where he is borne, aboue all worldly thyngs: thirdly to obeye the Magistrate that is in authoritie: and last of all, euery one to doe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as they woulde haue others, doe to them. And these lessons he that hath them not otherwise, may learne them of Demosthenes well ynough, whom if my Countrie men shall aswell like of, for his good councell, as I haue taken paynes in him for their onely sakes: then haue I the fruite of my traueyle, and wysh them good successe in all their doyngs. 1570.</p>

was come to talke of <hi>Lysias,</hi> thus he wrate and sayde. At that tyme was <hi>Lysias,</hi> a man not exercised in pleading causes at the barre, but a notable fine and excellent writer, whome a man might almost be bolde to call a perfite Orator. But as for a very perfite Orator in déede, and such a one as wanteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him at all: <hi>Demosthenes</hi> may easily be sayd to be the man. For in those causes that he wrate, there could be nothing wittily founde out, nothing as a man woulde saye artificially deuised, nothing to be cunningly handled that he did not espie, nothing finely to be sayde, nothing compactly knit togither, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing exactly to be done, that coulde be better pullished or trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer handled: of the other side, nothing could be great, nothing high, nothing adorned eyther with grauitie of wordes or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, that coulde be more high and loftie. Lykewise in his booke <hi>De Oratore,</hi> he sayth, that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> did not giue place to the Orator <hi>Lysias</hi> in finenesse of witte, nor to <hi>Hiperides</hi> in quickenesse or sharpenesse of vnderstanding, neyther yet to <hi>Aeschines</hi> in smoothnesse and gaynesse of wordes. Manye of his Orations are altogither pure and fine, as against <hi>Lepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> Many altogither graue, as certaine against <hi>Philip.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are partly fine &amp; partly graue, as against <hi>Aeschines de falsa legatione,</hi> &amp; against the sayd <hi>Aeschines</hi> in fauor of <hi>Ctesiphon.</hi> And when he listeth, he vseth the middle kind of eloquence, and leauing that most graue maner, descendeth chiefly to that low and familier kinde of speaking. And as touching exclamations, and crying out against abuses, them he vseth, and doth moste of all occupie in his speaking: when hée vttereth forth the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of grauitie. And a little before, he saith, that he remembreth he did preferre <hi>Demosthenes</hi> a great deale before all others. And in his seconde booke <hi>De Oratore,</hi> he willeth him that shoulde be an Orator to followe <hi>Demosthenes</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> who is graunted to be the chiefest Orator aboue all others. And again he sayth in an other place. None hath bene more graue, none more ware, none more temperate, than this man. Therefore they had néede to be warned by vs, whose vnlearned maner of

speach is much knowne abroade, such as eyther desire to bée counted fine Attickes, or else haue a minde to speake Attickly, (<hi>that is to speake purely as the Athenians did</hi>) that they estéeme and honor this man chiefly, than the which I doe thynke that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> it selfe was neuer more Atticke, <hi>that is more pure or more fine,</hi> for they may learne by him, what it is to be Atticke, <hi>that is, pure and fine,</hi> and let them iudge of eloquence, by his might and value, not by their owne weakenesse. For nowe euery bodye praiseth so much, as he thinketh himselfe able by his own force to compasse.

And to speake amongst others, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gaules, you shall vnderstande that when they were driuen from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, and lost their seate in the East, they came backe to Athens, and planted their seate there and in the countrie of <hi>Morea,</hi> tyll translating themselues from thense to Naples, the same Citie came to the handes of a Florentine of the house of <hi>Acciolai</hi> in the tyme of Quéene <hi>Ioan</hi> of Naples, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious lewde Ladie, for hir wickednesse and euill lyfe, known throughout the world to hir shame for euer. The which Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine séeking ayde of the Christians to kéepe it still, and not finding any helpe: he was driuen by fine force at the last, to giue ouer his right, interest, and tytle, to the great Turke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a hundreth yeares by past.

Such is the course of this worlde that nothing kéepeth any long continuance, but as our bodies are naturally subiect to alteration: so haue all states and common weales in this worlde, their naturall ages and chaunges, to teache vs the rather to fasten our mindes wholy vpon heauen, and to dedicate our selues to God alone. And as Gréece was the midst of the worlde, and the countrie <hi>Attica,</hi> the midst of all Gréece: so was Athens, the verye heart of all <hi>Attica,</hi> as well for the situation of the soyle, as for the myndes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the men.

And being praysed by others, they tooke pleasure in it: againe being rebuked, they were not greatly discontented. A people much feared euen of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest Princes, being notwithstanding very curteous and gentle to their greatest enimies. And touching the Countrie <hi>Attica,</hi> and the soyle thereof, <hi>Plato</hi> sayth in his dialogues <hi>Timeo</hi> and <hi>Menexemo,</hi> that the same was verye apt to bring forth most freshe and excellent wittes, the which riseth by reason of the temperature of the ayre, being of a verye moderate heate and moysture, the Countrie standing in .42. degrées from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall. This Citie was builded in the middest betwyxt the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> and the famous Church of <hi>Ceres</hi> in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>Eleusine,</hi> next vnto the which is that great mountaine cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Eron.</hi> Vpon the north side of Athens, runneth the riuer <hi>Asopus,</hi> and vpon the South side, the sea called <hi>Mare Aege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> now <hi>Arcipelagus</hi> by name. The verie situation declared the maiestie of this Citie, as the whiche was the common harborowe or safe receyte of all Gréeceland to flie vnto for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor in their greatest extremities and miseries of warre, lying Eastwarde in such sort that it séemed to offer receyte, by stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out hir arme. Yea their hauen or péere earst called <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeeus</hi> now <hi>Lion,</hi> did after a sort appeare to open hir lappe to harbowre succourlesse straungers, being a hauen both verye safe to enter to it, and a sure harbowre to ride in it, against all weather and daunger that might happen. They had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hauen set beyond the temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> &amp; somewhat out of the Citie, called the port <hi>Munichia,</hi> standing East fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Athens, where was a little pretie towne marueylous strongly fensed, the hauen thereof being an harbowre or receyte of foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth Gallies at the least, yea &amp; so many Gallies the Athenians many times vsed to set forth in their warres.

made for a certaine space of the Cities charge. These two ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens weare fortified with a notable wall of huge square frée stone, so strong and so thicke therewithall, that two Cartes might méete one another, and go and come from eyther of the hauens to the Citie. And it is further sayde that <hi>Munichia</hi> compassed within hir boundes both the hauen <hi>Pyraeeum,</hi> and also that notable Arsinall made by <hi>Philo</hi> that excellent Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect or Maister builder, the which was such a péece of worke for charges and beautie, as the lyke was not againe to be séene in all the worlde.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T seemes to me, O Romaines, you doe not know, that you are asked, not if you will haue warre or peace (for king Philip will not suffer you to haue free choyce in this behalfe, who warreth vppon you, both by sea and by lande) but whether you thinke it good to sende your armie into Macedonie, or else to receyue the enimie here in Italie. Now what difference there is betwixt the one and the other, if euer at any other time you haue had proofe: certes you haue had manifest experience thereof in these last warres against the Carthagineans. For who doubteth but that if wee had in lyke maner sent speedie ayde to the distressed Saguntines, when they desired succour of vs, as our forefathers did helpe the Mamertynes in lyke case, a people of Messana in Scicilia, wee had turned the whole warres vpon Spayne, the which through our lyngring and foreslowing our affayres, we haue brought vpon our owne backs into Italie, to our great losse and destruction. And there is no doubt of this at all, but that whereas this <note n="*" place="margin">King Philip he meaneth.</note>man is agreed with Anniball, by his ambassadors and letters sent, to come ouer into Italie we shall be able to holde him still in Macedonie by Leuinus meanes, whome we haue sent with a Nauie, to warre with him in his owne Countrie. And that which wee did in those dayes when we had Anniball our enimye in Italy, shall we stande in a mamerment nowe to doe, when Anniball is cleane banished, and the Carthagineans quyte ouorthrowne? Let vs tarye on Gods name, and suffer king Philip to make proofe of our lythernesse, whyle he destroyeth Athens: as we taried to suffer Anniball to doe, when he destroyed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntum. He will not be absent fiue monthes from you, as Anniball was, when he came from Sagunte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he will be with you within fiue dayes with his whole power in Italy after he hath taken shipping at Corinth. I know, you will not match Philip wyth Anniball, nor yet compare the Macedonians with the Carthagineans. And yet surely you will make him equall with Pyrrhus, so farre forth I say, as eyther one man is better than another, or one nation of more value than is another. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus (now called a peece of Albania) was euer a small porcion and of little force in comparison of the Macedonians, and is at this houre none other.
<pb facs="tcp:10092:20"/>
Whereas Philip hath all Morea at this present vnder his dominion, and the city of Argo, a towne no more famous by the auncient renowme ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, than by the death of Pyrrhus. Now let vs make a vewe of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. I pray you how much did Italie flourish more when Pyrrhus set vpon vs, than it doth at this present? what a full strength and force was the state in than? so many Captaynes being as yet safe, so many armies as yet whole &amp; sound, whom afterward those Africane warres consumed and made away. Yet for all that he shooke the state, and came conquering welnie to the very gates of Rome. And not only did the Tarentynes, and all that part of Italie the which is called mayne Greece, reuolt from vs, so that a man myght well thinke they had followed their language, and their auncient name: but also the Basilicates, the Calabrians, and the Abruzzians, seuerall people in the kingdome of Naples. And thinke you if Philip passe into Italie, that these people will be long at rest, or keepe themselues within their allegeance? In dede they were all quiet during y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time that we warred afterwards abrode with the Carthagineans. Nay, nay, this kinde of people will neuer leaue reuolting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, but when they shal haue no body to fal vnto. If it had bene so lothsom a matter to you at that time to make ouer into Africa: you had had Annibal, &amp; the Carthage enimies within Italie at this day. Let Macedonie rather abyde the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes of warre, than Italie: and the Countrie and towne rather of our enimies feele the force of fire and sworde, and be destroyed therewyth.

               <head>The Argument vpon the first Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Demosthenes in fauour of the Olynthians, a people in Thracia, now called Romania.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>HILIP King of Macedonie, sonne to Amyntas, and father of Alexander the great, did much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noye the lande of Greece, but especially the people of Athens, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom by force and other meanes, he tooke many goodly Cities, as Pydna, Potydaea, Amphipolis with others, vsurping in all places where violence might preuayle. Yea, he brought by extreeme hande whole Thessalia vnder his yoke, and being growne insolent through many victories and conquestes of priuate Countries and Cities, he determined at the last to denounce open warre against the whole Countrie of Athens, and yet before he would fall into so playne a quarrell with them, he drew into his league the Citie Olynthus, being in the Countrie of Thracia, now called Romania, standing somtimes betwixt Abdera and Heraclia, a warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like plat and a martiall soyle next adioyning to Attica, the people whereof were Grecians of Chalcis in Euboia, a colonie of the Athenians. Now these Olynthians had earst bene at warre aswel against the Athenians as also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lacedemonians, whose valiantnesse king Philip knowing, and desirous to haue them matche with him, hee sought by great giftes of Townes vnto them, which he had gotten from the Athenians and others, to make them assured to his part, bicause he might haue a more easie pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to Athens, a thing that he desired aboue al others. For hauing that, he thought it nothing to gette all the countrie of Grecia elsewhere whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, being his full minde to make a plaine conquest of all Grecia if it were possible. The Olynthians herevpon perceyuing his ambicious nature, and smelling thereby that he was sharpely sette to be Lorde ouer all: weying also how vnfaithfull a man he was otherwise in all his doings: toke their time in his absence, and dispatched an Ambassade to Athens, to be confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate with them, contrarie to their league made before with King Philip, with whome they had agreed to sette vpon Athens, and to haue ech with others like friendes, and like foes togither. Which thing when king Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip vnderstoode, he tooke herevpon iust aduauntage to fall out with them and so forthwith proclaimed open warre against them. Whervpon the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynthians sent to Athens for succour, whose cause Demosthenes fauouring as one that did full well perceyue the insaciable ambition of King Philips
<pb facs="tcp:10092:21"/>
nature, perswaded earnestly that ayde shoulde be sent vnto them, bicause the safetye of Olynthus was (as a man woulde saye) a bulwarke or forte to Athens against Macedonie: and that King Philip coulde neuer annoye them so long as Olynthus stoode safe and sure. Whereas on the other side the Athenians might at pleasure pierce into Macedonie, and handle him hardly in his owne countrie. But if King Philip once got O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynthus, he had then an open entrie and a very playne passage to Athens. And to encourage his Countrie men the better in this quarrell, hee sayth that King Philip is not so mightie, but he may easily be dealt withall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the common opinion.</p>
               <p>Further he willeth monye to bee leuied and taken out of the common treasurie, perswading, that where as it was wont to bee bestowed vppon Stage playes, Maygames, and publyke sightes, now the time serued that it might be better employed vpon Souldiers for their wages to defende the afflicted Olynthians, and to maintaine the safegarde of Athens. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the maner is vnknowne to many how the Athenians vsed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed their treasure at that time: it weare not amisse to touch it briefly. When the Athenians heretofore vsed no Theater or scaffolde for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to stande vpon, but such only as was made of boardes, into the which euery man made haste to get a place, to see those sightes that weare there to bee seene: many times when their scaffolde fayled, they did hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and sometimes they went togither by the eares, so that manslaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter followed for want of order, while euery man sought to place himselfe first, that first could get vp, wherevpon proclamation was made, that none hereafter shoulde haue any place there, except they first payde out of hand two halfe pence of that coyne, for their standing, being about two pence star<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing, and so they should be placed, of the which money, part was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for the building of the Theater of stone, where the playes and open shewes shoulde be made and set forth: and part was bestowed vpon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers appointed for these pastimes. And when the collection monye fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Chamber of Athens did beare the reast for maintenaunce of their costly feasts and seuerall games to the great and intollerable charge of the Citie. And least the poore should be thought hereby to be kept backe, and to lose those sights for want of mony: it was ordered that they shoulde haue two halfe pence deliuered vnto them out of the common reuenewes and treasurie, to paye for their standings. Nowe this custome grewe so great that all the reuenewes of Athens, weare altogither consumed and wasted vpon such vnnecessary vses, in spending this waye and that waye, so that men had the lesse minde to serue their Countrie, no money being left in the treasurie, nor rewarde remayning for seruice and traueyle to be done, eyther at home or abrode. For whereas Souldiers and men of warre
<pb facs="tcp:10092:21"/>
had their pensions and annuities giuen them before time out of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie for their good seruice done: those that taried at home did now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the same altogither vpon setting forth of those Pageants, royall ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, reuels, and other such toyes, for the peoples comfort, pastime and delite. And besides this, there was a lawe made by Eubulus that none vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon paine of death shoulde giue councell to employe the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure otherwise than vpon stage pastymes, common feastes and games, to the great discouragement of all souldiers and good meaning men, that hoped to haue rewarde for good seruice doing. And here wee must note by the waye that the custome among the Athenians was to hang vp a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nigh to the Pulpit or place where the Orator spake, conteyning the matters to be entreated of, and when that thing should be passed that the Orator perswaded, the maner was that the Orator shoulde subscribe to the Table, which made a very absolute maner of establishing anye decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and was called in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, to write. And when so euer the Orator did presume so to vnder write or set his hande to the Table in capitall causes wherevnto the people, when he had done, did not giue their consent and agreement (which was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of the which the whole thing being decreed was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a decree:) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shoulde that Orator be in great daunger, if his decree did any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to the lawes, or weare in any poynt contrarye to the order of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to bee made. For which cause Demosthenes being very warie in this behalfe, not to wade ouer deepely for feare of displeasure, vseth great cunning and sleight both to saue himselfe from harme, and to doe his Countrie good, for the better employing of this monye, perswading that the same Theater monye might better bee conuerted and made Souldiers fees, and the contribution to be rather for common profit and honor, than for common pleasure and vaine pastime, being neuer yet so hardie to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwrite the tables for the enacting of any new decree in the matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the perill that did depende therevpon, if the people did not like it, after it was vnderwritten, and enacted by the Orator, but giues them only to vnderstand, that in his opinion, the very auncient order was to employ it vpon Souldiers, and that this their maner of spending it, was but an abuse.</p>
               <p>Last of all, he willeth them to sende forth their owne Countrie people, and not to vse the onely seruice of Mercinarie foreiners, and hyred straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for that by those meanes they haue heretofore susteyned great losse and hinderance in the chiefe of their affayres. And to make this Oration more plaine, I will by a diuision somewhat enlarge and iterate my speach for the better vnderstanding of Demosthenes Arte and wisedome: Three causes hindred Demosthenes from getting the Athenians to helpe the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Olynthians,
<pb facs="tcp:10092:22"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first that the warre was not domesticall, nor proper to Athens, but forreyne, with the which kinde of warre the Athenians woulde not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> seeme to deale. Againe, that they had no monye ready to maintaine these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> warres. Thirdly, that King Philip was ouergreat, and therfore very daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for them to deale withall. All these things Demosthenes doth cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly handle, and first sayth that the warres doe appertaine to them, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is for their honor: vnto the which all men are caried by nature, for by this <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>anes, they shall make an entrance to aduaunce that principalitie, the which they seke ouer all Greeceland: Againe, he driueth them through necessitie to take this matter in hande, for else King Philip will pierce A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, if the Olynthians be not presently ayded.</p>
               <p>For monye he sayth they haue ynough, if they will turne the ydle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses of the Theater charges, to the necessarie paye of the warres.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he weakneth King Philips force, by rehearsall of diuers things and deedes in perticularitie. And the two especiall points of the whole O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are these, profite and habilitie. Proouing by the first, with manye reasons that their gaine and honor shall be great therein, if they take these warres vpon them: by the seconde hee sheweth, both what their owne proper force is, and what strength the enimy hath, whose power he weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by all the cunning meanes hee can, the rather to harten his Countrie men against him. The cunning that Demosthenes vseth in this Oration is very great, and not easie for all men to conceyue, except they be very attentiue to obserue and followe the order and skilfull handling of this matter. And thus I haue bene the longer to dilate this argument, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would make it the playner.</p>

And that there weare Ambassadors dispatched, both to aduertise them hereof, &amp; also to be present with them at their doings.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10092:25"/>
you oftentymes haue béene offended not with those that haue deserued blame, but with those whose chaunce was to speake last of matters:<note place="margin">Priuate losse must be sustey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe.</note> if any thing doe not fall out according to your minde. And yet I doe not thinke it méete for mine owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate safegarde, to suppresse or hinder any thing that I iudge is for your profite. Therefore, I say, touching these present affay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, you ought to prouide for them by two maner of wayes, both by kéeping to the <hi>Olynthians</hi> their townes in safetie, and sending them souldiours to doe thys: and also by annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Countrie with Galleys,<note place="margin">Negligence in Magistrates a thing moste daungerous to a state.</note> and an other bande of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors besides. But if you neglect to do any one of these things, I feare me least all your voyage besides will proue labour lost. For whether you doe but spoyle his Countrie, and he let you alone with that, till he shall haue subdued <hi>Olynthus</hi>: then shall he at his returne home, be auenged of you with ease: or whether you send but an ayde onely to <hi>Olynthus,</hi> then will he séeing thinges at home out of daunger, sit hard and fast by his matters: and in time will preuayle agaynst them, whom he besiegeth. Wherefore the ayde had néede to be great, and that in two places at once. And this is my opinion for ayde.</p>
            <p>Nowe for prouision of money. You haue (O Athenians) money, you haue so much as no men else haue more, to employ vpon the warres: but that doe you take at your pleasure, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if you would restore the same to Souldiors, you should néede no other leuie besides, otherwise you shall haue néede, yea, and that verie great néede to. Why howe nowe, sayth one, doe you <note n="*" place="margin">The custom in Athens was to haue a Table hung vp, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning the matter of their present assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Orators spake, and they that woulde haue any thing to passe did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe their mindes in the Table.</note>passe a decrée to make this money to serue for pay of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours? no verily, not I. But mine opinion is, that you must néedes prouide souldiours, and that this money is ordeyned for pay of Souldiours, and that there is one order which is euen this,<note place="margin">The common treasure was wont to be spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, in making of feastes and seting forth of shewes, games, &amp; stage playes, and paying for the standings that the poore<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remaynes (as I take it) that euery man must make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of money, if much néede, of much: if little néede, of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10092:25"/>
little: once money must néedes be had whatsoeuer we doe: and without <note n="*" place="margin">Money doth much, I will not say all.</note> money, nothing can be done at all, as it ought to be done. There be others that haue other deuises to get money, take that way you like best, and while occasion serues, goe in hande with your businesse.</p>
            <p>And here it weare verie néedefull for you to consider &amp; weigh the matters in what case they stande nowe with king Philip. Neyther ywisse, as it séemeth and may be sayde by one that looketh but lightly vpon his doyngs, goeth the worlde very gay with him: or yet in such sort, as weare best for him at this time. Neyther would he euer haue taken this warre in hande <hi>in trust of his owne strength:</hi>
               <note place="margin">King Philips force, made greater by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon brute, than it is in deede.</note> had he thought he should haue found a warre of it in déede. But his hope was to conquere all, euen at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie first pushe, without resistaunce: and is deceyued nowe he hath done. And therefore this thing first of all doth vexe him, and breake his heart not a little: bycause things haue fallen out quite contrarie to his expectation.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the ficklenesse of the <hi>Thessalians,</hi> doth much trouble his minde,<note place="margin">Thessalians vnfaythfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and full of treacherie.</note> who haue béene alwayes false and vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full agaynst all men of their owne nature: and euen as they are, and haue béene to others: so are they now to him. And they are fully decréed among themselues to demaund backe <hi>Pegase</hi> of him, and haue forbidden the walling of <hi>Magnesia.</hi> Yea, and I my selfe haue heard it sayde of some, that they would let him no longer receyue the profites of their Hauens, and theyr Martes. For say they, it weare good reason that the common charges of the <hi>Thessalians</hi> ought to be borne therewithall, and not that king Philip shoulde gleane it, and intercept it for his owne vse. So that if he be put besides this money: his hired Souldiours shall quickly be brought to a very narrow strayte for their vittayles.</p>
            <p>Moreouer it is most likely that the <hi>Peonians,</hi> and the <hi>Illirians,</hi> and generally all such other people, as dwell there aboutes: had rather still be frée, and liue vnder their owne lawes, than be in bondage of others.
For they are <hi>a people</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woont

to be subiect to any: and <note n="*" place="margin">King Philip he meaneth.</note> yonder man as they say, is a verie spitefull person, and before God he is none other like in déede to be. <q>For prosperitie excéeding a mans desert giues an occasion to them that be witlesse,<note place="margin">Immoderate welth causeth pryde: pryde bringeth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: hatred worketh rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: rebellion maketh an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration &amp; chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth kingdoms</note> to be euill disposed, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwéene of themselues.

            <p>Therefore you must (O Athenians) assuring your selues that his euill season is your good season, go cherefully in hande with these matters, both by sending forth Ambassadors to such places as shall be méete, and setting forth your selues on war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,<note place="margin">That which the enimy would doe to vs when he might, we should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him agayne, when we may.</note> and encouraging all others to do the same: considering with your selues, that if king Philippe had the lyke occasion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst vs, and that the warres weare nighe to his countrie, howe readily thinke you woulde he come vpon vs?

Demosthenes vsing great cunning to cracke this his credite and the common digested opinion of him and his magnificence: first and formost perswades them by this Argument, that all his puissaunce hath growne but by craft and subtiltie, and therefore is of no continuaunce, nor yet to be weyed.

Without the which all good counsels (bee they neuer so finely or cunningly deuised) are nothing worth at all. Wherein he doth not exclude counsell and wisedome, but he wisheth that God and good happe should be our guide in all our actions.

And why? Bicause al such talke shoulde turne to his honour, and to our shame. For the mo things that he hath done aboue the opinion &amp; dignitie he was of, the greater honour shall be thought to be his, and the greater shame yours, that being of such force and renowme, haue done little or nothing thereafter. And therefore I will let these matters alone. For he that will truely consider the substaunce (O Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) shall find, that king Philip is growne great by our meanes,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10092:28"/>
and not by his owne. Therefore the things for the which king Philips practicioners deserued thankes at his handes and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment at yours: those I sée now is no time to speake of. But such things as are without the counsell of those, and which be most for the profite of you all, to heare off, and such as shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be very foule reproches against him, to them that are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to trie them out aright: those things doe I mynde to deale withall. And yet if one doe call him a false man or a periured person, not declaring what he hath done perticularly: he might iustly be thought an euill tongued body, and a vayne rayling fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. But if a man weare disposed to rippe vp all that euer he did, and to charge him with euery poynt thereof,<note place="margin">King Philips force what it is.</note> as it falles out: it shoulde néede but a short talke. And for two causes I thinke it good to be tolde: whereof the one is, (and that is verie true too) that he maye appeare to all the worlde to be a naughtie wicked man: and the other is, that they who are in a feare of Philip, as though he weare inuincible, may sée that all his sleights and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie guyles, whereby he hath aduaunced himselfe to this great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, are nowe spent and gone: and that all is nowe euen at the verye last cast with him. For I my selfe (O Athenians) woulde take Philip to be a verie terrible and wonderfull man, if I sawe him thus come aloft,<note place="margin">Good kinges growne mighty are to be drad and feard.</note> by his good and iust dealing: But when I well weye, and consider with my selfe, I finde that our owne simplicitie, euen from the beginning (what tyme the <hi>Olynthians</hi> desirous to haue had conference with vs, were kept backe, by certaine that bare vs in hande, how he would giue vp <hi>Amphipolis</hi> vnto vs, and bring to passe for vs, that secrete and close matter that they bragged vpon amonge themselues) is the thing that brought him to this.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amphipolis.</hi> The secret and close matter was the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering vp of Potidia. <hi>Olynthians. Thessalians.</hi>
               </note> And after that, the friendshippe that he made with the <hi>Olynthians,</hi> by destroying <hi>Pydna,</hi> a towne of ours, and wronginge vs, that were his warre fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes before, of purpose to giue it to them. And now last of all he did winne the <hi>Thessalians</hi> to take part with him, promising vnto them, the country of <hi>Magnesia,</hi> and to take warre in hand for their sakes, against the <hi>Phoceyans,</hi> so that to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, he blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the eyes of as many as had to do with him, through his craft
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10092:28"/>
and subtiltie. And by these meanes he hath aduaunced his might and power, with abusing the simplicitie of others, and entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them that knowe him not. And therefore euen as he hath mounted the whéele by these sleightes, when euery one hoped that he should doe somewhat for their profite: euen so must he néedes by the selfe same meanes discend againe, when it shall be proued vppon him, that he hath done all thinges for his owne gaine and lucre. Lo, thus stands the case, and doings of king Philip. Or if it be not so, let some come foorth and shewe vnto me, or to you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that these thinges are false, that I haue sayde: or that those, who haue béene first deceyued by him, will trust him hereafter. Or that the <hi>Thessalians</hi> now brought into bondage (farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than they haue deserued) will not desire to be at libertie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. It may be that some thinkes all this to be true,<note place="margin">Libertie sweete and desired of all men.</note> and yet the same man is thus perswaded, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> king Philip is able by fine force to kéepe whatsoeuer he hath gotten, bicause he hath before hande got the Townes, Hauens, Portes, and Fortresses into his owne hands. But he that so sayth, is much deceyued in his opinion.
<q>For when things are grounded togither vpon good will, and that the same things are séene expedient, for all such as are partakers of the warres: then will men ioyne their labors togither, abide all smart, and tarie by it, till the ende. But when a man hath got power and authoritie, by sleight and guilefull meanes, as he hath done: euery small occasion and light offence turneth al things vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side downe, and layeth it flat in the ende.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For that authoritie or might which is gotten by wrong doing,<note place="margin">Things wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gotten haue none as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suraunce.</note> by periurie, and by falsehood: can neuer by any possible meanes continue and endure: tho I denie not but the same for a time may abyde and tarie, and shewe a faire flourishing face bicause many are with vaine hope caried away, but when tyme hath tryed the truth, such falsehoode fayleth sodainly, and falleth streight to the ground.</q>
               <q>For in mine opinion, euen as the foundation of houses,<note place="margin">A similitude declaring that falsehoode hath no continuance.</note> shippes, or any other buildings, must be very strong made and sure: so ought all doings to haue sounde beginnings and perfite foundations to be grounded vpon.</q>

that the same thing that lyketh well King Philip, is anye pleasure at all to his subiectes.

And neither are suffered to follow their owne businesse, and dwell vpon their owne, nor yet to dispose of those goods which they haue gotten by such trade, as they could occupie themselues in: for that, that all the Ports and Hauens in the Countrie are shutte vp by reason of the warres.

And ye be remembred (O Athenians) it was reported here about thrée or foure yeares past that king Philip in <hi>Thracia</hi> layde siege to a Fort, or péece, called the Castell of <hi>Iuno</hi>: and it was then iust the Moneth of October.

Marie nothing that I sée.<note place="margin">Besides disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, there is feare of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hereafter if ayde be not sent presently for that the Thebanes are very lyke to fall from them, and that the Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyans are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poore and needie.</note> For besides the shame that waytes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, if we foreslow any part of our businesse: I sée we haue no small occasion, to dread the falling out of things hereafter: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially now that the <hi>Thebanes</hi> beare vs the stomacke, that you sée they doe: and that the <hi>Phoceyans</hi> be vtterly out of monye: and that there is none to stoppe king Philip, (after he hath once ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne them, whom he is nowe in hand withall) to bende him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the affayres this way. But whosoeuer he be, that delayes to doe things till that time come: that fellow is disposed to sée sore matters hard at his nose,<note place="margin">Gentlemen es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewe euill for shame: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people for feare of harme.</note> when he might well ynough haue heard of them farther of: and then be faine to séeke helpe at other mens handes, whereas he himselfe, by this time, might haue béene an ayde to others. And surely that the ende will be, <hi>that, he will set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs</hi> (if we let slip this present occasion) almost euery man sées it by this tyme.</p>
            <p>But peraduenture some wil say, it is a nedeful thing to giue ayd, and we be all determined vpon it, &amp; minded to do it: but how we should do it, tell you vs that. And you shal not (O Athenians) mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile much at it, if I shal speake somthing contrary to the opinion of a great many. Appoynt lawmakers, but among these lawma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, sée you make no new lawes (for we haue inough of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy: but such as hinder our present estate, sée you do repeale.<note place="margin">Euill lawes are to be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</note> Yea those lawes I meane flatly, that are made for the maintenance of stage plaies &amp; some other of those also, that be made for men to go on warfare, some of which lawes, doe apportion that monie, that belongs to souldiors, to be deuided in shewes, and stage expenses, amongst them that tarie at home. Othersome again, prouide for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> indemnitie of those that forsake their array in the fielde, &amp; by that meanes doe the more discourage them, that otherwise would doe their endeuours. And then when you haue repealed these lawes, and haue made a safe way for all men to say their consciences: then a Gods name séeke ye out some one, to vnderwrite and enact
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10092:34"/>
all that,<note place="margin">Those that sought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians by decree written and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, suffered smart for their attempt, if they weare not able to proue theyr assertion to be for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries welfare.</note> which al ye know to be profitable. And before this be done, neuer looke that any man wil speake the best for you, and then pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish by your meanes for his labour: no, you shall neuer find him, especially when there shall be nothing got by that meanes, but that he that speaketh, and enacteth these thinges, shall be sure to haue some hurt himselfe, and yet further your businesse neuer a whit by it. And besides that, it shall make him much more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to vtter any good aduice hereafter, than he is at this present. And it weare requisite (O Athenians) that the verye selfe same men, that did make the lawes: shoulde also repeale them. For why,<note place="margin">The lawe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and none other should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate his own decree, and law established.</note> it weare no reason that thanks should be their reward, that made those lawes, whereby the whole common weale then was endammaged: and on the other side, that those who haue spoken thinges for the behoofe of our Citie, and the thing that might be for the profite of vs all: should be punished with your displeasure and hatred. And before these things be brought into better order: neuer looke for it (O Athenians) that there should be any such one among you so great, as should not be punished for his labor, if hée transgressed these lawes: nor yet so foolish, that will put his neck into the haulter,<note place="margin">Lawes not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, are of no value: and as good not made, as not practised.</note> when he may kéepe it out.
<q>And surely you must not be ignoraunt of this poynt (O Athenians) that a decrée is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing woorth, vnlesse you haue as good will to kepe it, as you were readie to make it. For weare decrées sufficient of themselues, to compell you eyther to doe your dutyes, or to performe the thinge that is set forth in them: then should neither you, who haue made so manye decrées, put so fewe, or rather none of them, in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: nor yet king Philip shoulde haue wronged vs so long, as he hath done.</q>
For there was no let in our lawes and decrées, but that he should haue smarted,<note place="margin">Execution of lawes a higher thing in nature than is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising, or bare reporting of them.</note> long ere this time. But the matter is cleane otherwise: for why, although doings by order and decrée, follow after speaking, and passing of their matters, by holding vp of handes: yet in power it goes before, and is a much more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie thing. And therfore this is it that we haue to do yet: the reast is done alreadie. For why, there are ynowe among you (O Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians) that can say, as is fit for men to saye, and you your selues are as quicke witted to iudge of things sayde, as any others. And
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10092:34"/>
euen very now may you put them in execution, if you doe well. For I pray you what time, or what occasion,<note place="margin">Occasion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red neuer bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be foreslowed.</note> can you find better than this present season? or when will ye euer do, that ye haue to do, if now ye will not? hath not <note n="*" place="margin">king Philip he meaneth.</note> the man got all your countries into his hand alreadie? but if he get the Lordship of this lande <hi>of Olynthus also:</hi> it will be the greatest shame that euer came vnto vs. Are not those nowe troubled by him with warre, whom we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to defende stoutely, if he did warre vpon them? is not he an enimie? holdes he not your countries and goodes? is not he a barbarous and outlandish Prince? is he not whatsoeuer a man list to call him? But Lorde God if we shall let all these things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked to, and rather be a helpe in a maner for him:<note place="margin">Better for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend one, and to doe his duty: than euery one to seeke faultes in others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mending his owne.</note> shall we then fall to séeke out who weare the authors of all these matters, <hi>so euill handled?</hi> And yet we will not accuse our selues I am well assured. No more will they that for feare runne away from the warres, accuse themselues: but rather will alwayes lay the fault in the Capitaine, and him that standes next them, yea, and vpon anye body than vpon himselfe. And yet for all that,<note place="margin">Euery one shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to excuse his own doings and rather pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth faults ouer to others, than takes them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to beare the blame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> was their running away the very cause, that they weare ouercome in the fielde. For he that accused others, might haue taryed the battayle himselfe. Which if euery one of them had done: they might haue got the victorie. And so nowe perhaps if some one doth not giue the best councell, let some other stand vp, and say his minde, and not find fault with him that spake before. Is there any man can tell you better? doe it a Gods name. But peraduenture this my speache is somewhat vnsauerie vnto you. Well, for all that, he doth you no wrong that telles it you, except peraduenture hée omittes prayer, if haply it néeded to Godwardes. For in déede (O Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians) to wishe and to pray vnto God is an easie matter,<note place="margin">Publike prayer and supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vsed to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes.</note> where a man may trusse vp in a small rowme, as much as he list. But when matters are brought in counsell to be debated vpon, then is not the choyse so plentifull, but the better is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more pleasant, where a man may haue both.</p>
            <p>But what if one coulde let you alone with the stage money, and yet find out other meanes, to get money for souldiors? weare not he a better fellow, would some man say? Yes marry weare
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10092:35"/>
he (O Athenians) if there were any such man to be found. But I wonder howe euer it was, or euer shall bée, that if one doe spend money which he hath vpon things vnnecessarie: howe he can get money, which he hath not: to bestowe and employ vpon things necessarie.
<q>But in these cases it is a great matter howe mens mindes are enclined, and it is the easiest matter in the worlde,<note place="margin">Not as men would, but as men may, and as the nature of things do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, so should they deale.</note> for a man to deceyue himselfe <hi>in his owne opinion.</hi> For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye one iudgeth as his owne fansie and affection carieth him, where as the nature of things is farre otherwise. And therfore I would wishe that yée considered these things, as the nature and condition of them requireth.</q>
So shall you be able to go to the warres, and receyue your wages. Neither is it the propertie of a wise man, nor yet of a Gentleman, to omit any thing that is to be done in time of warre, for want of mony: either to put vp lightly such foule rebukes as these be. And what a shame were it for you, in all the haste to warre with the <hi>Corynthians,</hi> and the <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyans, being all Grecians:</hi> and in the meane season to suffer King Philip <hi>being a straunger and a Barbarian</hi> to subdue the townes of <hi>Greece</hi> vnto himselfe for want of prouision for souldiours? ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I speake these thinges to get your euill will thereby. I am not so much without witte, and so voyde of grace, that I woulde willingly procure my selfe your displeasure, and then doe no good neyther.<note place="margin">A good subiect preferreth the welfare of his Countrie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other things.</note>
               <q>But I thinke it the part of a good Citizen when he shall say his minde, to regarde more the welfare of his countrie: than to currie fauell with the people. For so haue I heard say, and perhaps so haue you also, that your Councellors in the time of our Auncestors (whom all your Orators now doe much prayse and estéeme, and do yet but a little follow them) did vse themselues after this plaine maner and custome, when they had to deale in matters of the state:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aristides. Nicias. Demosthenes. Pericles.</hi>
                  </note> that is to say, <hi>Aristides</hi> that ioly felow, <hi>Nicias,</hi> and he that was called by my name <hi>Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and also <hi>Pericles.</hi>
               </q>
But since these good felowes came forth, that will be first asking, what will you haue with vs? what will you haue me enact?<note place="margin">Flatterers, people most daungerous to a common weale:</note> wherein may I speake to please you? <hi>for a desire that they haue to picke thankes,</hi> and for a transitorie pleasure and liking at your handes: they haue drenched the whole welfare of

the Citie. And this is euen come of it, they themselues spéede well by it, and are in very good case: but as for our country, it is in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie euill state. For I pray you waye with your selues (O Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians) what great and principall poyntes a man might speake of, and howe farre different the doynges of our Auncestors weare from those of this tyme? I will recite them to you in few words, and that which is notorious. For you may be a fortunate and a happy Nation, not by vsing of forrayne and straunge actes, but of domesticall and home examples. <note n="*" place="margin">A comparison betwixt those that weare, and those that are: and what od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the one and the other.</note> Those men therefore whom the Orators did not so flatter nor fawne vpon, as these men doe vpon you: had the chieftie and principalitie ouer all the Grecians, with their good liking and consent, by the space of .45. yeares, and they layde vp in the Treasure house more than .10000. talents. <note n="*" place="margin">One Milion eight hundred thousand poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des starling.

And they amongst all other people, did leaue such fame and honour behinde them: as ouercame all enuie of man. Thus did these men behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in defence of the Gréekes.</p>
            <p>But in matters of the Citie, I <note n="*" place="margin">Old Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours what they weare among the Greekes.</note> pray you marke how they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered things both in publike and priuate dealings? As to publike buildinges they left behinde them suche gorgious Temples, and so great store of reliques, and offeringes in the same: that none comming after them, could be able to excéede them, <note n="*" place="margin">Zerxes saddle dedicated to Minerua for his victorie had at Salamina.

               <hi>for their worthinesse signified by their insignes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In their priuate doings, they weare so temperate, and kept so well the good orders of the Citie, that if any of you knewe which was the house of <hi>Aristides</hi> and <hi>Miltiades,</hi> and of the famous mens houses of that time what they weare: you should sée them to be nothing more gorgious: than weare their poore neighbours houses aboute them. For why, they weare not officers in the common weale to enrich themselues by it: but to aduaunce the honor and state of their countrie.</q>
And thus, with <note n="*" place="margin">Old Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors in Grece 1. Faithfull to their countrie, 2. Deuout to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. 3.

euenly and vprightly with all men: they well deserued to make themselues happie and fortunate men. Thus flourishing was the state of the common weale as long as these men bare rule, whom I haue named before.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">When flatterers beares rule, all things comes to naught.</note>But now that these smooth &amp; meale mouthed felowes a Gods name, are come to beare rule, howe go your matters forwarde I pray you?

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorteth them to bee more diligent hereafter and earnestly to giue their mindes to the defence of their countries libertie and the daunting of king Philips force.</p>
               <p>In the seconde part he warneth them to addresse two armies, the one, and that the greater of Citizens that shall alwayes bee in a readinesse for the necessarie affayres of the Citie: the other somewhat lesse, to bee of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyners and hyred Souldiours, among whom the Citizens to be intermingled. And these mercinarie straungers hee woulde not haue to abyde in Athens, nor yet to goe foorth into other countries for succouring others agaynst king Philip: but he would that they went forth to spoyle and waste about the borders of Macedonie: and to keepe them still occupied there, with skirmishes and bickerings, for feare least king Philip should come vpon them in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tyme, and take the aduauntage when the winde lyeth in the North east, which bicause it was customable to come at a certaine season of the yeare, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was called of them Etesie, and as it should seeme, it laye so vpon the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens of the Athenians countries, that their nauie could not put out from land, to helpe those that weare distressed by him: and so in their absence he might make some great enterprise and attempt a conquest: where, as hauing theyr armie in a readinesse, they shall be alwayes able to bearde him, and withstande his force from tyme to time.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F any new thing had bene ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted and propounded to be talked vpon (O Athenians) I woulde haue forborne till moste of them that are woont to speake first,<note place="margin">The elders and most aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient weare wont to speake first.</note> had sayde theyr mindes: and then, if any thing had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me that they had sayde, I woulde haue holden my selfe fully contented therwith: whereas otherwise, I would haue endeuoured to haue giuen mine opinion also. But for as much as, it falleth out that those matters are nowe to be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon, that haue béene ofttymes heretofore ripped vp and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by them, I do thinke that I may iustly be holden excused, although I haue stoode vp before others <hi>to speake my mynde vnto you.</hi> For truely had they so spoken when time was, and giuen such counsayle as was fitte for them to doe, you shoulde not now haue néeded to sitte in counsaile againe, vpon these matters.<note place="margin">When things are in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it is good to be of good cheere, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lustily to amend that in amisse: than cowardly to faint, and be in dispayre of all.</note> And therefore to beginne withall: you néede not (O Athenians) to be greatly discouraged with the present state of things, thoughe they séeme to runne verie much amisse. For why, those which haue hurted vs most in our matters heretofore, the selfe same hereafter shall doe vs most good. And what is that?

To what ende speake I this vnto you? Marie that you
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10092:39"/>
(O Athenians) maye both sée and verie well perceiue thus much that neither as long as you list to be circumspect and take héede to thinges, you shall néede to feare any thing at all. Neither yet as long as you continue without regarde or care of things: that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you shall compasse any such matter as you looke for. And for example hereof, you haue aswell the might of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in those dayes, whom you vanquished well ynough through your watchfull and diligent looking about you: as now, you may learne by this, his present spightfulnesse towardes vs at this time, that bringes vs to all this adoe and trouble, and all through our owne negligence who haue not that regarde to thinges that we ought to haue.</p>
            <p>But, if any of you (O Athenians) doe thinke it an harde matter to vanquishe King Philip considering his present great force and strength, and the losse of all this that he hath taken from vs, that same man although he hath reason so to thinke: yet I would he weyed this also with himselfe, and remembred that we too (O Athenians) haue had in possession <hi>Pydna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pidna a Citie in Macedonie. Potidea a towne in Thracia.</note> 
               <hi>Potidea, Methona,</hi> and all the Countries and people rounde aboute in our owne handes: and that many other Countries, nowe vnder his obeysaunce, weare sometymes frée, and had rather a great deale confederate themselues with vs,<note place="margin">Methona, now called Modon a towne in Achaia.</note> than with him. And had king Philip béene of that minde to thinke it so harde a matter with himselfe and so daungerous, to warre with the Athenians hauing their countrie so well fortified, and he himselfe being then at league with no others about him: nowe surely than he would neyther haue enterprised any such thing as he hath done, neyther yet should he euer haue attayned to be so mightie <hi>as he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Countries and states are the rewardes of valiaunt and couragious personages.</note>But in déede (O Athenians) he knoweth it full well, that all such places as those, are booties of warre, and prayes layd open for him that can first catch them.
<q>For by nature it is so ordeyned that those who are alway following and plying their matters, shal seaze and get the possessions of them that leaue their businesse alwayes vndone:<note place="margin">God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do set all things to sale for labour.</note> and those that will traueile and take paynes, shall enioy the goods of the idle and slouthful.

into his handes and kéepes them still, some of them with such gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisons, as townes gotten vpon the enimie are woont to be kept: some others againe, he admittes into a league and friendshippe with him.</q>
For in déede euerye man will bée glad to ioyne in league, and leane, and take part willingly with them: whome they sée to be well prouided for the matter, and to haue a will to execute things as are fit to be done. Wherefore (O Athenians) if you in like sort will nowe plucke vp your hearts (<hi>which seeme to haue beene deade in you heretofore</hi>) and euery one bende himselfe to doe his dutie, in all thinges, that he is able to shewe his country any seruice in, without daliaunce and in good sadnesse: that is to say, those that haue mony, will contribute and giue of their goodes and substaunce franckly: those that are yong and lustie to make themselues readie for the warres, and to speake all at one worde, if you will all of you, be your owne men, and maysters of your owne, and leaue of this doing of nothing, in hope that others shall doe all things for you: you shall than by Gods grace both get all your possessions againe, and receyue such things into your han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, as haue béene lost heretofore through negligence, and also shall reuenge your selues of him well enough.</p>
            <p>Neyther woulde I haue you to thinke (O Athenians) that his present state and good hap is so firme and so immortall, as though hée weare a God,<note place="margin">King Philips state both fickle and weake.</note>

And that is the thing I say vnto you, that I woulde wishe you to shake off from you, <hi>and shewe your selues like men without more a doe.</hi> I pray you (O Athenians) marke well the matter, beholde what an insolencie and vnwoontnesse the man is growne vnto, that doth not so much as giue you choyse <hi>to aduice your selues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">King Philip he meaneth.</note> either to be at warre with him or to bée at rest: but manaceth you, and (as the

common voyce goeth) he threatens you with prowde and hie wordes, as one not contenting himselfe to kéepe that which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready he hath gotten, but as one alwaies incroching, and shooting at farther matter in his minde, and labouring to hemme you in, and barre you vp rounde about,<note place="margin">The ydle man is soone taken tardie.</note> that you shoulde neuer be able to stirre a foote out of doores, that lye thus lingring and clawing your elbowes after this sort doing nothing.</p>
            <p>But when I pray you (O Athenians) will you doe your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours? when will you take care of the common welth? what? then,<note place="margin">Neuer more neede to bee doing then nowe.</note> when any great néede shall bée? what? when I trust verie necessitie shal enforce you to it? why, what shall we thinke of that that is nowe presently done?
<q>In good sooth I doe thinke, that the dishonor which we sustaine for our euill and vnordered doinges: is the greatest necessitie that can be to any frée man.<note place="margin">Necessitie.</note> Shall this be the fashion of you?</q>
will you still continue walking vp and downe in the palace yarde,<note place="margin">Common as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of newes, are no better than common pratlers.</note> and common assemblies, asking of newes one of another?

            <p>Againe, you aske among your selues, is Philip deade or no? no forsooth,<note place="margin">Vnnecessarie questions asked of king Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips being.</note> sayth one, but he is very sicke. Why? what skilles that matter to you? Now surely, I suppose that if ought hapned to him, otherwise than well, you would make an other king Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip rise streight wayes in his place, especially plying your busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse none otherwise than I sée you do. For it is manifest he is not growne so great and mightie by his owne force and worthinesse, as he is throughe the slouth and ydlenesse of your selues. But though he weare deade in déede, and that fortune woulde bée so much our friend, and shewe vs that fauour, (as in déede hauing euer had more care of vs, then we haue had of our selues) &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning peraduenture to ende these matters hir selfe for vs, and to perfite hir owne goodnesse towardes vs: yet for all that assure you your selues to compasse all thinges as you woulde, so you would but haue your army alwayes at hand,<note place="margin">Good dealing with the enimy: when he is at the woorst.</note> and that you would set vpon him in this time, when you sée all thinges in this great

But as you stand nowe appoynted, you should not be able to recouer <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> no though,<note place="margin">Great was the desire of the Athenians to recouer their lost townes.</note> the tyme and occasion serued you neuer so well: and that, bicause I sée you are vnreadie and voyde of all preparation, and iudgement, howe to vse your selues.</p>
            <p>And here I nede not to tel you, that you ought to be alwais rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; well appoynted like couragious men for the welfare of your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, bicause you know that well ynough &amp; are therof well and sufficiently perswaded. But I will endeuor my selfe to shew vnto you how you may doe, to get such an armie togither, as shall be able to deliuer and dispatch you out of care and trouble: and what number of men, and what payes of mony, is méete for them: and also howe other thinges may be made in a readinesse, so, as they shall lie best and spéedeliest to be done. This will I do mine ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to say my minde in: onely I pray you graunt me this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest that you wil suspend your iudgements, and preuent me not, till you haue heard all. And although when I shall touch that point, it may séeme to some that I vtter a straunge kind of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, such as hath not béene heard of heretofore: yet let no man thinke therefore, that I doe minde the hinderaunce or delaye of thinges.</p>
            <p>Neyther yet is their talke most to purpose that would haue things to be done in all post haste: nor yet do I thinke it possible to repulse these euils that alreadie touch vs, with this small sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, that we now sende: but rather is he to be best allowed, that can shewe what, and how great an armie we should haue, when and howe the same might be mainteyned, and continued, till such time as we haue eyther made peace by equall treatie and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, or else had altogither got the vpper hande of our enimies. And so by that meanes you shal féele no more smart or annoiance hereafter. Thus much I thought I might say, and I am not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented if others vndertake to say somwhat also <hi>for their parts.</hi> Thus you sée I take great things vpon me: well, the experience shall trie all, and you shall be iudges thereof.<note place="margin">The maner how the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to the warres.</note>

            <p>Therefore first and formost I say (O Athenians) you must make readie fiftie Galleys, and prepare your selues to be of that

Neyther is this a matter to be lightly regarded, no though he minded no such thing at all, as in déede I dare say hée doth for all that: and it be but for this purpose, that either when he shal know it, he may for feare stay himselfe, &amp; set his heart at rest, as surely he will know our doings, specially seing there be here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, yea amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst our selfes I say, more than a good meany, that will tell him of al things: or else if he shall make none account of our readinesse &amp; prouision: than, that we may distresse him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares hauing no gard about him: for there is no let in your way to passe into his country: when occasion shal serue you. These are the things that I would haue you all perswaded vnto: &amp; withall, I thinke it also méete that you weare at all times in a readinesse.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, mine aduice is (O Athenians) that you make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die a power before hande agaynst king Philip,<note place="margin">Citizens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be readie for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying the enimie.</note> to kéepe him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually occupied, and to annoy him withall <hi>by all meanes possible.</hi> And here let no man braue vnto me, of ten thousand, or twentie thousand straungers, nor yet of these iolye armyes promised vs by Paper and written for: but let the Souldiours be our owne countrymen: so shall they obey and follow their Capitain, whom soeuer you shall chose or name: be he, one, or many, this man, or that man, or whatsoeuer he be: and that the sayd armie may haue vitailes, with all maner municion néedefull. And now what that army shall be, how great in number, where they shall haue their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10092:41"/>
vittailes, and how all these things shall be ordered: that will I tell you, and from poynt to poynt, will I lay before you euery thing seuerally.</p>
            <p>As concerning straungers, I like well of them: but here beware that you doe not (as you oftentimes haue done to your owne hurt) estéeming all thinges lesse than néedes, and so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine vpon great things with your decrées, and when it commeth to the poynt, put not in practise the verie least of them: nay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought ye, after determination of a small number once got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, and being in a readinesse, if afterwardes you thinke them to little, to agrée streight vpon more. So then I say, let there bée 2000. souldiours in all,<note place="margin">The number of Souldiors fit for the warres.</note> wherof I say there must be .500. our owne Countrymen, of such age as shall like you best: they shall serue out their appoynted tyme, and that not verie long neyther, but as shall séeme fitte to you, by course, one after another, that freshe men may supplie their places. And the reast of the armie let them be straungers: and with these two hundred horsemen, whereof fiftie at the least I would haue to be our owne Citizens to go to the warres in like maner, as the footemen shall do: and then must ye prouide ships for these horsemen to vse. Verie well, and what more else? Mary ten light Fusts or Pinnaces, for we haue great néede of light Botes, and Pinnaces, séeing there is a nauie of his vpon the Seas, to the intent that our power may sayle in more safetie.</p>
            <p>But where shall we haue vittayles for maintenaunce of this armie? I will tell you that also, as soone as I haue declared vnto you, why I thinke, that so small an armie (as I haue sayde) will suffice: and wherefore I would that your owne countrymen should go to the warres.</p>
            <p>So small an armie I thinke (O Athenians) will suffice, for that we can not gather such an armie togither,<note place="margin">The reason why he would so small an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie should be prouided.</note> as is able to beard king Philip, and encounter him in open fielde: but we shall be enforced to robbe and spoyle vpon him, and after this maner to begin our warres with him.

               <note place="margin">Why he would haue his owne countrymen to be ioyned soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours with the straungers.</note>And the cause why I woulde haue our owne Citizens go to the seas mixed with forreyne Souldiors, is for that I vnderstand this countrie heretofore hath had a certaine bande of straungers in wages at <hi>Corynthe,</hi> whereof weare Capitaynes <hi>Policrates, Iphicrates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Corynthus a Citie in Morea. <hi>Policrates, Iphicrates, Gabrias.</hi> Euill trusting straungers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to serue in the warres by themselues.</note>

And so they regarding but a little the warres of our countrie went their wayes sayling to <hi>Artabasus Lieutenant to the Persians,</hi> and about, to diuers other places: and the Capitaine after them, as reason was for him to doe. For vnlesse the Capitaine gaue them theyr payes before hande, it is not possible to rule them, or to make them tarie. And now what is mine aduice herein? Marrie, that you take away all the causes of excuses to be made as well by the Capitaynes,<note place="margin">Souldiours must haue their paye.</note> as by the Souldiors: paying them their wages, and making your owne Souldiours as watches and spyes enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled amongst them <hi>to know what their chiefe Capitaine doth.</hi> For as we now rule and gouerne: it is none other than a mockerie. For, and a man should aske you the question, haue you peace (O Athenians) with all men, or no? You woulde aunswere no, but we haue warre with king Philip.<note place="margin">Little was the authoritie that the Athenians had in their warres.</note> 
               <hi>And to prooue that it is so,</hi> haue not you made among you Ten men Citizens of your owne, to be your Capitaines, Coronels, and Marshalles, and two Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, or Lordes of horsemen? And I pray you, what doe all these men? (one man onely set aside) whom you haue sent forth to the warres: al the reast doth serue you for a shew and pompe to go in procession with the Priestes. For you vse those Coronels, &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalles, as Potters and Founders do vse their worke in clay: to set them forth in the market place, and not to be employed in the warres.

your army being all souldiours of your owne country: should also haue conductors of their owne countrimen to lead them.

            <p>And now, all your desire is to heare what money wée néede, and where it is to be gathered. Wel, I wil tell you that too.

            <p>The things that we (O Athenians) are able to finde out, are these. And when you haue made an ende of asking euery mans

voyce, you shal giue your hands to that that likes you best, so shal you make your warre with king Philip,<note place="margin">To say and doe are two things.</note> not with Paper worke, and decrées onely: but with effect and in good earnest. And in my minde you shall better conclude all things touching these warres and the preparations for the same: if you (O Athenians) first foresée and consider well before hande, the situation of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie where you minde to make your warres: and farther, if you thinke with your selues how king Philip compasseth most of his affayres by obseruing the tyme, and season of the yeare: who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aduauntage of the Northeast windes and stormes,<note place="margin">Etesie, certaine Northeast win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, so called bicause they came ordinarily at a certain sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the yeare.</note> settes vpon vs at such time, as we shall not be able to styrre from hence. And therefore considering these thinges, it were good that you warred not with aydes and supplies onely, for so we may lose all: but with an ordinary power, and such a preparation as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. And this your garnison may winter it selfe in <hi>Stalimene, Thasus,</hi>

               <q>That valiant Capitaynes must neuer follow after occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lost, but rather must preuent them, and be aforehande with them <hi>in tyme.</hi> And euen as it fitteth a generall of an armie to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sée <hi>and prouide for all things while season serues him:</hi>

And where as you (O Athenians) haue the greatest power aboue all others, aswell of Galleys and Souldiours both footemen, and horsemen, as also of reuenues of money:<note place="margin">Lingring is then noysome, when necessitie requires haste.</note> yet for all that, as you haue lacke of nothing, so haue you to this day, not employed anye one thing to anye good vse at all.

            </p>
            <p>Now surely (O Athenians) I thinke some God being asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on the Cities behalfe of our doinges,<note place="margin">God sendeth oft tymes wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked tormentors to securge and annoy others.</note> hath put this earnest loue of doing, and this painfulnesse into king Philips head: For, would he kéepe to himselfe all his conquestes and prises, and so be at rest, I doe thinke some of vs, as it séemeth to me, could be well ynough content with the matter, and deale no farther, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the world cryed out of vs for it, other shame, cowardlinesse, or any other villanie besides, <hi>for this our slacknesse in gouernment and slouthfull dealings.</hi> But forasmuch as he taketh vpon him still am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biciously to desire more and more, peraduenture his meaning is

to quicken you and egge you forwarde,<note place="margin">The careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ought to quicken the Godly to looke about them.</note> so you be not altogither in dispaire of your selues. But I marueyle much (O Athenians) that none of you doth consider, nor that any of you is an angred, when ye sée that the first intent and beginning of these warres agaynst king Philip, was onely to be reuenged of him, and to do him hurt, but the ende of it is to defende our selues that we take no hurt. And most certaine it is, that he will neuer rest <hi>and holde himselfe contented till some begin to bearde him,</hi> and to withstande his enterprises. And shall we than tary and do nothing till that time? What? do you thinke that all shall go well with you? bicause you haue made out a fewe emptie and euill appoynted Galleys? and haue an hope in one ioly fellow or other, that shall haue charge of affayres, when you set forth? shall we not embarke our selues? and we that coulde neuer be brought to it before, shall we not martche forwardes nowe at the length, with some companye of our owne countrimen? shall we not put ouer a nauye into his Countrie?</p>
            <p>But some peraduenture will aske the question, and where I pray you sir shall we put a lande?<note place="margin">All passages are open to the stowte and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant souldiour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> The verie warre it selfe (O Athenians) shall shew and discouer vs the crackes &amp; breaches of his state, so we would once go in hande with the matter. But and we do nothing but sit still at home, hearing our Orators scold one with another, and eche accusing &amp; blaming other: we shall neuer do, no neuer shall we do, any thing well as we ought &amp; are bound to do. And yet assure your selues of this, whether soeuer you listed to send forth any power of our men (though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole armie be not there altogither) there, will God himselfe, &amp; good fortune, fight in our quarel. Wheras if you should send but a Capitain forth with a single &amp; sleuelesse decrée, <hi>with great threates to your enimies, and a few comfortable words from this consistorie,</hi> to put men in hope withall: you shall be sure on the other side,<note place="margin">As good neuer a whit, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the better.</note> you shall neuer doe any good at all. For why, our enimies shal laugh vs to scorne, &amp; our friends shall be <hi>vtterly discouraged:</hi> &amp; thinke themselues vndone when they shall sée this <hi>masking and counterfeite</hi> preparations.
<q>For it is not possible, neither can it be, that any one man alone, shal be able to do al that for you, that you would haue done. Well may he promise, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch

any thing, and accuse this man, or that man: and that is euen it, that hath brought all to naught.</q>
For as long as things be thus handled, that a Lieuetenant of a sight of forreyne, wretched,<note place="margin">Daungerous to slaunder soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours that haue serued, and worst of all to condemne them vpon the false report of others.</note> and vnappoynted souldiours, if he chaunce to take the foyle in the fielde, by and of that which he shall doe there: you, haue one here at home shall forthwith be readie to bring a lying tale of him, and you as soone as you haue heard the matter, howsoeuer it be, will be as readie to make a decrée thereafter. What hope I pray you then is there left of such a gouernement? &amp; when or how, <hi>will you redeeme such a mischiefe?</hi> Marie euen then <hi>and not before, all things will be well,</hi> when you (O Athenians) shall be disposed to go on war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare your selues, and be liuely witnesses of all those thinges that the Capitaines doe, and at your returne home, make your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues iudges of all their accountes.

            <p>But now things be so shamefully handled, that there is neuer a Capitaine but hath béene arreigned vpon his life twise or thrise before you: where as not one of them hath béene so hardie as once to aduenture the same in fighting like a man, against the enimie, but had rather choose the Gallowes (as it séemeth) like an errant théefe and rouer: than like an honest man, to spill his blood <hi>in open fielde vpon his enimie.</hi> In déede it beséemeth well naughtie packes and wicked doers to die by order of iustice, but a valiaunt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour and couragious Capitaine, it becommeth to die in the field, vpon his enimie.</p>
            <p>In this meane while there be some of you, that doe nothing but go vp and downe, <hi>and prattle newes scant worth a straw,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:10092:46"/>I for my part (O Athenians) doe thus thinke of king Philip in good sooth, that he is dronken and assotted with the greatnesse of his owne dooings, and dreameth much in his fantasie of suche like thinges, both bicause he séeth suche a dezert, and wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of men to withstande him, and also bicause he is puffed vp with the <hi>pride and glorie of his owne prosperous doings.</hi> And yet let <hi>no man be so mad to thinke</hi> that he goeth so about his matters, <hi>and taketh such wayes,</hi> as euerie foole amongst vs shall perceyue what he doth or intendeth to doe.

For that king Philip hath most cruelly abused other cities and countries with such like craft and subtiltie. And here he giueth a lesson fit at all tymes for all men liuing, the which is this. That there can bee no greater strength and assurance to a man, than to be mistrustfull, for (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Libanius report) euen as money is the strength and sinewes of warre: so is mistrustfulnesse the maintenance and safegarde of wisedome.</p>
               <p>In the end he promiseth to giue king Philips Ambassadors their aunswere when they shall come, in case they themselues doubt what aunswere to make vnto them: but he sheweth not what he will say, but leaueth that matter and falleth to inueigh agaynst those Traytors that are king Philips hyrelings, and sheweth that their promises, and king Philips present doings, agree not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither: and therefore plainely doth discifer king Philip to be their mortall enimie, against whome he councelleth them to take armor in hande, and to proclaime open warre for the better safegarde and defence of their whole estate and Countrie.</p>

<q>For the worlde is come to this poynt with vs nowe, that the more plainelye and cléerelye a man sheweth king Philip to haue broken peace with vs, and to seke a conquest ouer al Grece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande: so much the more daungerous it is, to giue councell what weare best to be done.

And first of all, we our selues that take vpon vs this place, our woont is to forbeare councell and aduise, in those poyntes, for feare of your displeasure: and in stéede of them we fall a discoursing vnto you of his doings, howe daungerous, howe weightie, and how heynous they are, and such like things.

And if so be you thinke it a goodlyer matter, to speake more aptly to the purpose, <hi>than he doth</hi>: why, thats a thing easie ynough to do, and it néedes no great traueile. But if it stand

And why did he so? forsooth, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in bestowing his wittes howe to get and to bring all vnder his subiection without regarde of peace and quietnesse, right or wrong: he wisely doth consider and knowe right well that he is not able to winne our Citie, or vs eyther (as we haue hitherto li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) by any corruption of gift to betraye anye of the Gréekishe townes to him, for our owne profite: but rather he sées that wée haue regarde to iustice, to vpright doings, and to the eschewing of dishonour,<note place="margin">King Philip findeth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted, for corruption.</note> alwayes foreséeing things fit for vs with great wary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: by which he doth perceiue that we will consequently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande him (if he take any such matter in hande) as though wée

Wherein they so worthily acquited themselues, that all men since, haue longed much to talke of them, but no man yet could worthily set them forth: as they haue deserued. And therefore, I will stay my tongue, and good reason too. For why, their worthy exploites and renowme, haue bene greater, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man hath béene able to vtter by word of mouth: Whereas the Auncestours of the <hi>Thebanes</hi> and <hi>Argians</hi> haue some of them ioyned their power with the <hi>Barbarian</hi> and straunger,<note place="margin">In the warres against the Persians, the Argeyans would not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but the Thebanes toke part with the Persians.</note> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vnder his banner: and other some of them, would neuer set out foote agaynst him. And therefore, he knoweth that both they doe more estéeme their owne priuate estates: than they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde the common profite of all <hi>Grece</hi> besides. And well he saw, that if he shoulde haue sought your friendships, he must néedes haue chosen you for iustice sake, where hauing the others to bée
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10092:49"/>
of his side, he was assured to haue their maintenance in his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust and couetous desires. And that is the cause why he hath alwayes estéemed and still doth estéeme their friendship more than yours, not bicause he séeth they haue more Galleys than you, or bicause (hauing found good footing, or any great superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie within the maine lande) he neglecteth to be Lorde of the Seas and their marchant Townes. Neyther hath he yet forgotten these condicions and promises, by which he trayned them to be at peace with him. But (sayth one) it was none of all this that moued him to doe as he hath done, <hi>neyther yet his ambition nor coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An aunswere to an obiection, proouing that king Philip neyther for ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise sake, nor yet by enforcement, was friend to the Thebanes, with certaine mocking of those nations.</note> or any other thing wherof he is accused, that made him to encline more to the <hi>Thebanes</hi> than to vs: but the only cause was bicause he knew them to be more faithfull than we are. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son vnboubtedly (of all other reasons) he can not well alledge, for he that craftily forced the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to giue vp the towne of <hi>Messena,</hi> &amp; at the selfe same time, notwithstanding set the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi> in possession of <hi>Orchomene</hi> &amp; <hi>Choronea:</hi> how can he be sayd to haue delt iustly and vprightly. But some will say he was enforced (for else there is none excuse remayning for the defence of king Philip) to surrender &amp; giue vp those places much against his will, as being than enuironed and surprised, by the horsemen of the <hi>Thessalians,</hi> and the Souldiours of <hi>Thebes.</hi> A good tale, on foorth a Gods name. And therefore (saye they) hée hath the <hi>Thebanes</hi> in great ielousie, yea, and they go vp and downe deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing further tittle tattle, how he mindes to fortifie <hi>Elateia:</hi> but he will doe a Dog as soone. He will neuer deale that way at all, as I thinke: and forsooth he will neuer ioyne with the <hi>Messenians</hi> and the <hi>Argians</hi> as he doth, to set vpon the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and yet he hath sent a supply of straungers and money, and is looked for to be there in person himselfe with a mightie power: so that he séeketh the destruction of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> as enimies to the <hi>Thebanes.</hi> And those <hi>Phoceyans</hi> whom heretofore he did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and destroy, he mindeth now to succor and to defend: yea forsooth that he will. And I pray you what <hi>mad man would</hi> beleue these things. For surely, I can not think for any thing that I can sée, that king Philip will continue to be an enimie to the enimies

of the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> if eyther perforce or against his will, he graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heretofore those matters before named: or else if he now mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted their good will towardes him: but rather it is euident by his present doings, that he hath sought their fauours for a purpose <hi>and wrought this pollicie to serue his owne turne withall.</hi> And whosoeuer looketh narowly vpon this matter,<note place="margin">The lapping vp of all these matters.</note> he cannot but plainely sée that all these his practises are wholye bent against oure countrie to take an aduauntage when he séeth his time. And this hée doth in a maner for méere necessitie.

And therefore full well is he guyltie to himselfe: both that he lyeth in wayte for you, and that you also do vnderstand it. And bicause he hath found you a wise and a sage people, he gathereth by iust consequence,<note place="margin">Wise men being wronged, are to be feared of the wrong doers.</note> and good reason, that you are his enimies, &amp; that makes him so sharpe set, to preuent your doings, as one looking for a scouring at your hands, whensoeuer any occasions shall be offered. This is it that he watches for, this is the cause of his close lying in waite against the Citie. And why, he holdeth in, somuch with certaine of the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> and with some <hi>Peloponesians</hi> also that are of the same minde with them, whom he accountes to be so gréedie and couetous of lucre,<note place="margin">Euill men care for nothing but for the present time onely.</note> that the present estate pleaseth them well y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and so beastly and so foolishe, that they neyther regard nor foresée the time to come.

<q>And therfore amongst them, al such good opportunities, and occasions as happened vnto them, to doe theyr feates by (which by fortune oftentimes are poured into the carelesse mens lappes agaynst the watchfull, and to them that do nothing, against them that doe what they can) coulde not bée bought out or redéemed of the Counsellers and Capitaines:<note place="margin">Councellours vncorrupted.</note> neither the good will of men one to another, nor the mistrust that men had in <hi>Barbarians,</hi>

               <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> haue bene heretofore, who were Lordes of the sea, and of the land all about, and weare in league with the king of <hi>Persia,</hi> so that none could withstand them: and yet this Citie reuenged themselues of them, and lost nothing at their hands. And as al things in a maner be much encreased, and nothing like to that they weare in times past: so also I thinke nothing is more altered and aduaunced, than are the affayres of warre.</p>
            <p>For first of all, I hearesay that the maner of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> in those daies, &amp; al other Gréekes to, was to be forth foure or fiue moneths in warfare, when the season of the yere serued, &amp; in that space to inuade &amp; annoy their enimies cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, with a power of armed men and souldiors of their owne countrie,<note place="margin">The order of warfare, cleane altered, and in stede of plaine dealing deceyte vsed, and all sleyghts, that may be, both deuised, and practised.</note> and so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home againe when they had done. And so aunciently or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ciuilye they behaued themselues, that they would do nothing by corruption of money, but by loyaltie &amp; open warre. Whereas now adaies, you sée al things go to ruine by treason, and nothing done by fight and open battaile. You sée that king Philip not with squares of armed souldiers goeth whither he will: but with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue of light horsmen and hired archers. And then hauing such fellowes at hand, his maner is, where he sées men at sedition and trouble among themselues, that <hi>for priuate faction and</hi> mistrust one to another, no man dares issue oute, for his Countrie: there he rushes mée in vppon them,<note place="margin">King Philip most painfull, sparing for no weather to doe his indeuour.</note> and hauing his engines with him, layes streyght siege to their Townes. And I tell you not here, howe all is one to him, whether he warre in Winter or in Sommer, and howe he makes no choyse of the

But you must very circumspectly or ere things approch vpon vs, beware aswel by your doings, as by your preparation, and looke wel to him that he stirre not from home, and that wée be not fought withall by him, hand to hand. For why, to maintaine the warres,<note place="margin">Better to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin warres, than to abide warres.</note> we haue many wayes aduauntage of him (O Athenians) so we would but doe as we ought to doe: The verie nature of his countrie, a good part whereof we maye ransacke and annoye, and tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande aduauntages besides. But as for the fight, he is farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exercised in it, than we are.
<q>Neyther is it ynough to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande him abrode, with sworde and armour, but ye must doe it also by reason and vnderstandinge, persecuting all such as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest you speake on his side,<note place="margin">Home enimies the worst peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple liuing, and an euill cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing it is of a Serpent in a mans bosome.</note> assuring our selues that we shall neuer ouercome our enimie abrode, till we haue punished his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters here at home.</q>
And that thing, so farre as I can sée, before God and all his Saintes, you be neyther able nor willing to doe: but you are come to such foolishnesse, or rather madnesse, or I wot néere what to tearme it: (for oftentimes it commes in my minde to be adrad, least some spirite <hi>or fatall destinie</hi> doe chase and persecute our doinges) that eyther for rayling, or enuie, or scoffing, or some other trifling matter, you make a sight of hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to come vp and speake in this place: of whome there are some that cannot disavowe nor denie themselues to bée suche men: and then you make a sport of it, when they fall a rayling vpon men.

No, that is not my saying, but my meaning is, that you should sende money to the souldiours at <hi>Cherronesus,</hi> and do for them as they shal require you in al things besides.

So that such his hyrelinges as vsed to speake for the maintenaunce of peace, agaynst warre: weare verye well lyked of the people, not for anye speciall loue they had to peace, but for feare of taxes and paymentes, and other burthens hanging vpon warre, the which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly grieue the people most of all, and in tyme of warre must needes bee had. Wherefore it was daungerous to propounde matter concerning warre, or to exhort the people to bee at defiaunce with any bodye. For then those trayterous hyrelinges woulde put vp a Byll of complaint against them, as motioners and Aucthours of those decrees. And the people that coulde not abide to heare of charges and payments, and therefore hated warre: woulde with open mouth and full consent condemne him present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an offender, that once spake for warre, although the necessitie weare neuer so great. So that where as Demosthenes durst not subscribe to the enacting of warre to bee proclaymed, he vseth cunning by a figure called Translatio, and layeth it vpon an other, saying, that King Philip hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced warre agaynst them, so that they are in great hazard and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And therefore he doth exhort them to withstande the warres alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die commenced and taken in hande by king Philip, the which is a naturall request.

               <p>Lastly, he seeketh to set an attonement betwixt the rich men &amp; the poore, who weare at defiaunce amongst themselues. For the rich weare verie loth to yeeld to any subsidie, and would rather that the treasure money wherof the poore people had, a good part for their comfort, should bee conuerted wholy to beare all the charges of the warres: on the other side, the poores sort weare in an vprore agaynst the riche, and threatned that they woulde enter vpon their goodes, and spoyle them in their owne houses rather than they woulde lose their stage pence and the benifite of the publike treasure,

for setting foorth of their shewes and pastimes. Demosthenes herevpon rebuketh them both, and willeth the rich men to let the stage money alone for the poore, being so small a matter: and chargeth the sayde poore men on the other side, to forbeare violence and iniurie towardes the richer sort. And in the necke of this, he cryeth out agaynst Traytours that hinder good motions, and councelleth herevpon the Athenians to sende Ambassadors to the king of Persia, to haue him ioyne in league with them, and to helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with money, for that otherwise, the Citie had not wherewith to beare out their n<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Amongst a great number of faults, and gaules and those not of a small times growing, that cause vs to be in this euil fauoured pickle: there is none of them all (O Athenians) that doth vs more hurt at this time, than this, that you giue your mindes altogither from the dooing of your businesse.<note place="margin">Negligence lost Athens.</note> For so long and no longer lastes all the labour you take, as you may be sitting still, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring some newes told you: and then euery man gets him away neyther regarding nor so much as remembring the matter at all. And as for king Philippes dealings towarde all men, they be so full of outragiousnesse, and couetousnesse as you heare them reported to bée: and euery man knowes very well, that it is not possible to bridle him or restraine him of this,<note place="margin">Not wordes, but armor, must kepe king Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip vnder.</note> by anye treatie or perswasion that we can vse. Which thing he that can not perceyue by any other thing else, let him consider it hereby: whensoeuer it came to the talke of right &amp; iustice: we neuer had the worse, nor yet weare euer iudged to be wrong doers, but haue alwayes had the better hande, and haue preuayled in our talke: And yet I pray you what did his businesse procéede any whit the worsse, or ours any thing the better for al this? nothing at all surely.
<q>For where as his fashion is, as soone as he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken armour in hande, by and by to be readie to go and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture himselfe with all that he hath, and ours on the other side to sit still, some when we haue spoken that which right requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and other some, when we haue giuen the hearing, by good reason I thinke it falleth out, that déedes doe surpasse wordes,

and that all men do not so much marke and regarde, the right that we maintaine in wordes, and what we haue sayde or shall say for our selues: as the thing that we do and put in execution.</q>
And they be such, as are of no force to the preseruation and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of any that is oppressed. And here néedes no more talke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Wherefore, séeing it is so, that all States and Towneships, are deuided into these two factions, whereof the one sort, bée of those that neither desire themselues to haue the rule by force and strong hande, neyther yet to be in bondage to others, but séeke onely to maintaine their libertie, and to haue their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie gouerned by lawes in an euennesse: the other sort, is of them that desire to be Princes ouer their owne Countrie men, and yet can be contented to bée vnder the obedience of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by whose meanes they thinke they maye attayne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: So it is that such as are of his minde, that is, they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be Tiraunts and Lordes,<note place="margin">Ambicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons cherished by king Philip.</note> they haue got the rule and beare sway euery where alredie.

You sée <hi>Serrius,</hi> and <hi>Doriscus,</hi> (for these things weare first neglected after the peace concluded, which peraduenture to manye of you bée not knowne at all.) And yet in very déede, the letting go, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of them, was the losse of <hi>Thracia</hi> and <hi>Chersobleptes</hi> your allie and warrefellow. And when he sawe that you made no account of those neyther, nor yet sent them any succours: he digged downe the walles of <hi>Porthmus,</hi> &amp; made a fortification agaynst you in <hi>Euboia,</hi> right ouer against <hi>Attike</hi>: and séeing you cared not for this neyther, neuer so little more he had got <hi>Megara.</hi> And so slenderly did you regarde and weare mooued with all this: that you did not so much as shewe a countenance that you woulde not suffer him so to raunge. What more? When he had bought out <hi>Antrona</hi> for his money, he seysed to himselfe not long after the state of <hi>Oreo.</hi> Many other things I let passe, as <hi>Pherrhas,</hi> the passage &amp; high way to <hi>Ambracia,</hi> those slaughters made in <hi>Elis,</hi> and ten thousand things besides.<note place="margin">Elis now Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedere, in Morea.</note> Neyther haue I made this discourse, meaning thereby to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon vp vnto you such as king Philip hath subdued wyth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and iniuriously wronged: but to shewe you this poynt, that king Philip will neuer ceasse wronging, and getting all the worlde into his handes, vnlesse some bodie stop him of hys course. Now forsooth there are some men, that before they haue heard a mans tale to the ende, will by and by bée asking the question, what is to bée done? not bicause that when they haue heard good councell giuen them, they meane streight wayes to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10092:65"/>
followe the same and put it in execution,<note place="margin">He meaneth, for that they had peace, such questioning there was, as though it had beene nedelesse to speake when all things were well and quiet.</note> (for such men in déede if they did so, weare the best people in the worlde) but they aske it to the intent to be the quicklier rid of the speaker. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be it, for all that, I must néedes tell you what is to be done. And therefore first and formost (O Athenians) assure your selues of this one thing, that king Philip makes warre agaynst thys Citie, and he hath alreadie broken the peace, and is an euill willer, and a deadly enimie to this whole Citie, and to the very ground it stands vpon: yea I may say too, to the very Gods that be within this Citie,<note place="margin">King Philip hateth euen the verie religion of Athens.</note> whome I beséeche vtterly to confounde him. For there is nothing in all the worlde that he doth, more earnestly fight agaynst, than the verye forme or maner of our common weale, and how to vndoe the same, and at this time he is in a maner, as it shoulde séeme by fine force driuen so to doe. For make you this reckoning with your selues: his meaning is to rule all,<note place="margin">Such as liue in libertie, cannot brooke tiranny.</note> and therein he thinkes, there is no bodie to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande him, but you onely. For well hée wotteth as his owne conscience can witnesse with him, that he hath done you great wrong, nowe this long tyme: for with these things which bée yours of right, and the vse whereof, he hath agaynst right, hée hath gotten the safe possession of all the reast. For had he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> and <hi>Potidea:</hi> he would thinke he shoulde not sit sure in <hi>Macedonie.</hi> So that he vnderstandeth well eche of these things, both that he lyeth in wayt for you, and that you vnderstand the same very well. But bicause he taketh you to be men of good vnderstanding and iudgement: he percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himselfe to be worthilye hated of you. Besides all these things which be so many and of so great importance, he is well assured, that although he weare Lorde ouer all other countries, yet shall he neuer be able to kéepe them surely, so long as your popular &amp; people ruled estate doth continue. For should he haue any ouerthrow or trip (as he is a man may haue many an one) all those townes which he now kéepes by mayne force, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt streight from him to you:<note place="margin">Athenians apt by nature to helpe the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</note> for you be not men apt of your owne nature to séeke gréedily, and to get the principalitie ouer
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10092:65"/>
others: but rather to kéepe an other man from getting: and when he hath gotten any thing, to get y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same out of his handes againe: and wholy to empeach all such as aspire to principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; well able, and sufficient to restore all men to their libertie. And therefore it likes him not at any hande, that the libertye, that is amongst you, should be a trumpe in his way, when the tyme should serue him: neyther is his reason, in this behalfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse or out of the purpose. And euen for this cause first and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, must we iudge him to be such an enimie to the state of a common wealth, and populare fréedome of a Citie, as will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be reconciled. And next to that, be you right well assured,<note place="margin">King Philip myndeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than the destruction of Athens.</note> that all his practises, and deuises at this tyme, are altogither prepared agaynst your Citie: neyther is their any one, among you all, so simple as to think that king Philip hath any desire to those pelting things in <hi>Thracia</hi> (for by what other name should a man call them) as to <hi>Drongilus, Cabyle,</hi> and <hi>Masteira,</hi> and to those that he is now reported to haue, or that for the getting of those baggage things he would endure such trauaile, colde, and extréeme daunger, as he doth: &amp; that his longing is not rather to the hauens of <hi>Athens,</hi> their Arsenales, their Galleies, their workes of siluer mynes, their huge reuenewes, their territorie and honour, wherof God graunt that neither he nor any other may at any time be Lord &amp; Maister, after that he hath brought our Citie into subiection: or that he would suffer you to enioy all these things, and he himselfe be contented to winter in a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, for the getting of Tares, Fatches, and <note n="*" place="margin">Panyke a kind of pulses, not vnlike to Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, with a long stalke full of ioyntes, in the top whereof groweth an ear full of little yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low seedes as small as Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard seede, but not so rounde, being of little nourishment for man, &amp; yet verye good for small birdes to feede vpon, and to fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And thus much it is reason,<note place="margin">King Philips chiefe drift to get Athens.</note> euerye man should know, and be resolued of in himselfe, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him in good fayth that should giue you the best councell in all rightfull causes, to subscribe to the decrée for making of warre. For <note n="*" place="margin">High time for the Athenians to proclayme warre with one consent, and to go also to the warres them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in person</note> that weare the part of them that would faine find one, to whom they might picke a quarrell, and not of them that mynded the thing, that should bée for the wealth of this Citie.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10092:66"/>
For marke you well, whereas Philip hath broken the peace concluded, once, twise, thrise (for many a time one after another hath he so done) if for these so often breaches a man had decréed to make warre vpon him, and he had ayded the <hi>Cardians</hi> in lyke maner as he nowe doth, when none of the <hi>Athenians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créeth warre: thinke you that he which had made this decrée should not haue bene pulled out by the eares,<note place="margin">Daungerous for any one man to subscribe to the Table for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of warre: if the people did not allowe of it, and therefore euery one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare for feare of vndooing, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nact or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>write to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but woulde rather it should be the whole peoples decere and act.</note> and would not all men haue quarreled, that Philip had ayded the <hi>Cardians</hi> for this cause? Therefore séeke you not whome to hate for King Philips faultes, and to deliuer vp into the handes of his brybed hirelings to be pulled in péeces. Neyther is it méete, when you shall haue once agréed vpon warre, to call the matter againe in question: and to be at contention among your selues, whether it weare néedefull for you to haue done this thing or no. But in like maner as he doth make warre vpon you, so make you your defence, by giuing your money and other thinges necessarie to them that be nowe at warres with him, and your selues by contributing and preparing of an armie, swift Galleyes, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and vesselles for transporting of them, and all other thinges belonging to the warres. For as we nowe vse thinges, it is a plaine mockerie,<note place="margin">King Philip findeth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians to be as he woulde haue them for his purpose.</note> and I beléeue verily, so God helpe me, that king Philip himselfe would neuer wishe of God, that ye should doe otherwise than ye now doe: you come euer to short in your businesse, you spende money, you séeke out, whome to giue the charge of your businesse vnto, you brawle, you chafe, you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse one another. And whereof all these thinges doe ryse, you shall heare of me, and I will shew you againe, how to remedie all that is amisse.</p>
            <p>I must tell you plaine (O Athenians) you did neuer looke well to your dooings from the beginning, neyther did prouide any thing rightfully and orderly as you ought to doe, but are guided alwayes,<note place="margin">Athenians carelesse of their doings till daunger appeared.</note> by the euent and falling out of thinges: and when you sée your selues ouer taken, or come to late, than you take your rest. Againe, if any other thing doe happen, you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your selues and make a great styrre, whereas you should
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10092:66"/>
not so doe: For it can not be, that you shall euer doe any thing well, by sending of supplies and ayde. But when you haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared an armie and gotten sufficient prouision of vittayles for the same, and appointed common officers ouer your treasure,<note place="margin">The Treasure must be looked vnto and kept in safetie.</note> and as much as may be, séene that your money bée in safe kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: when I say you haue this done, then must you take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Treasurers, howe they haue bestowed their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and of your Generall for matters of warre, and leaue him no occasion or pretence, to sayle any other where, or to take any other matters in hande. And thus dooing, and shewing your selues willing: then shall you in déede compell king Philip to kéepe the peace vprightly, and tarie at his owne home: or else you shall be sure to deale with him vpon euen hande. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture it may so come to passe, that euen as you nowe are woont to aske, what doth king Philip? which way goeth he with his armie? euen so will he be carefull which way your armie is gone, &amp; where you will make your entrie, and discouer your selues. Now if any man thinke it very chargeable and painfull to bring these matters to passe: surely he thinketh right well and with good reason.
<q>But and he will consider what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of this Citie hereafter, if in case wée will not so doe:<note place="margin">Nothing well done, that is not willingly done.</note> he shall then finde and sée how profitable a thing it is when a man must néedes doe a thing, to doe it with a good will.</q>
For although God himselfe would be our suretie, <hi>and warrant vs,</hi> (as in déede it passeth mans power sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to assure vs in such a matter as this is) that though we would liue at rest, &amp; let all things alone, <hi>as men carelesse which way the worlde went:</hi> and that king Philip for all that, would not inuade vs himselfe: yet notwithstanding, it weare a fowle rebuke to vs before God, and a dishonourable dealing for this Citie, and a thing vnfit,<note place="margin">Our neighbours harme, should be our griefe, and carefull ought we to be ouer them.</note> for the renowne of the noble actes of our predecessors, that all other Grecians should through the lythernesse and negligence of vs, be brought into extréeme bondage and slauerie: and for my part I had rather die the death outright, then I would once say the worde,<note place="margin">God graunt England ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours.</note> or giue <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

you, and perswade you to it, be it for me: defende not your selues, let all things go to wracke and spoyle. But for as much as there is no bodie of that minde, and we all know the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alreadie:<note place="margin">The greater our enimy grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: the more we decay.</note> howe that we shall haue king Philip so much the harder and mightier enimie, the greater Prince that we suffer him to be: why be we so backwardes? wherevpon linger we? and when will we dispose our selues (O Athenians) to do that, which in reason we ought to doe? shall it bée (on Gods name) when very néede shall driue vs therevnto? well, and you meane such néede, as any frée borne man would terme to be néede: the same not onely is nowe present, but it is also gone and past, a great while since: But such as bonde men and slaues terme néede, I pray God blesse vs from that. And what difference is betwéene them I pray you? mary thus much:
<q>Shame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of euill dooings is the greatest necessitie that can be layde vppon those that be frée men, than the which I knowe none greater.</q>
But the greatest inforcement to a slaue that can bée, is stripes, and scotching, or mangling of his bodie, the which God kéepe vs from, and let vs not so much as once speake of it. And nowe (O Athenians) for you to shewe your selues so slowe in those things wherein euery man is bounde to serue both with his bodie and goodes: surely that is not well, no God knowes, it is farre wide. Howbeit, there may be some excuse made for it. Marie in that you be not willing to giue eare,<note place="margin">They that will not so muche as heare councell giuen them are persons inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, and nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est their last vndoing.</note> to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which might be told you, &amp; should be fitte for you to receyue councell in: sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is altogither worthie of blame in you. For it is your cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, neuer to heare of the matter till things be come euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon you, as it is now: Neyther will you take cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so long as you be in quietnesse: but when Philip maketh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration against you, than do you (neglecting to do the same, &amp; in like maner to prepare against him sit still ydlely. And who so euer telleth you of it: you thrust him out streight. Againe, when you heare of any place lost or besieged: then you begin to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and buckle to armor: where as your fittest tyme had béene to haue giuen eare eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then, &amp; to haue taken councel when you

            <p>So that by this your maner of dealing: you onely amongst all others doe things cleane contrary to all the worlde. For all other folkes vse to take councell before thinges be in doing: whereas you begin to deale when all is done.</p>

Whereof, albeit I am greatly adradde to speake: yet for all that, I will tell you my mind, and I hope I shal haue good matter to speake of, for the profite of the Citie, aswel on the behalfe of the poore to the rich, as for them that haue substaunce, to the néedie: so that we remooue those slaunderous reports, which certaine men do spreade abrode vpon no iust cause, touching the theater charges <hi>or stage money:</hi> and also if we woulde cast away this feare, that this thing will not be stayed without some great mischiefe:<note place="margin">Ciuill factions being betwixt the riche and poore are nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be cut of.</note> than which thing, I thinke there can be nothing more for our profit, nor generally more for the preseruation and establishment of this Citie.

good lucke, the common reuenew of the Citie encreased, and in stéed of one hundred, there came in <note n="*" place="margin">Three score twelue thousand poundes starling.</note> foure hundred talents, and yet was no man pinched in his goodes, or lost any thing, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther got by it.

Then what ayleth vs,<note place="margin">Riche men not to drawe backe from their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, bicause the poore are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing.</note> that we hit one another in the téeth, and vnder a cloke therof, resist to do our duties? Vnlesse it be so, that we doe enuie the offered ayde that fortune sendeth to the poore: whome neyther I my selfe doe blame, nor yet would haue others to finde fault with them. For euen in priuate families and housholdes, I cannot sée the yonger sort, to be of that disposition towardes their elders,<note place="margin">So should eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man liue in the common weale: as good folkes do in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate families.</note> nor any so out of order, or so foolish, that if any bodie doe not so much as himselfe, he will therefore say that he will doe nothing ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

For I think euery man is bound of right, to yéeld that dutie willingly &amp; of his owne accorde, towards his parents: which both nature and lawe haue ordeyned. And as euery one of vs particularly, hath a father: so ought we all to thinke that all the Citizens,<note place="margin">The common Countrie and naturall soyle, should be deare to euery man that is bred &amp; borne in it, and no Subiect ought to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cared for.</note> are commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> parents of the whole Citie. And that it is not fit or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to take that from them, which the Citie hath giuen to them, but rather if the Citie weare not able to giue them anye thing: we ought to prouide for them otherwise, and to sée that they shoulde not want.
<q>That if the riche men had this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate care with them, they would not onely deale (as I beléeue) vprightly, and iustly: but also be profitable and benificiall to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

Againe, on the other side, I would wish that the poorer sort, would cleare themselues, and leaue to deale in that matter, for which the riche men are iustly grieued, and haue good cause to be offended with them.</p>

And where as (O Athenians) all <hi>Grece</hi> stands in a very dreadfull case (as I take it) yet is there none in greater perill, than you are, not onely bicause king Philip doth chiefely minde confusion vnto you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all others,<note place="margin">Carelesse peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alwayes in most daunger.</note> but especially bicause you your selues are the most carelesse and ydlelest of all.

And this you may well perceyue, if you will consider with your selues by the time when Gréeceland was chiefly in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: (as no man can say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer it was at any time so much as at this present.)

And by good reason: for no man that eyther loueth vs, or crediteth, or feareth vs, commoneth with vs of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matters.

And what is the cause (O Athenians) that he dooing vs thys apparant wrong, and taking our townes from vs, yet there is no man will say, he doth vs wrong, or makes warre vpon vs: but rather will beare you in hand, that they which councell you not to suffer him, neither negligently to cast away these things, are they that make the warre?

will with one voyce lay the whole fault vpon them, that gaue you best councell, for your owne welfare. For they thinke veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that if you would all with one mind and consent defend your selues against king Philip, both you should haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better hand of him, and they also should no more haue the meanes to serue him for his bribes as they do.

And this is the hope of these bribe takers, and the fetch of all their accusations, in charging some men to be the authors of the warres, where as I my selfe knowe this very well, that when no man of all <hi>Athens</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée any warre at al, king Philip both kéepes many things that belongs to this Citie, and euen nowe hath sent in an ayde to <hi>Cardia.</hi> Nowe if we will not be acknowne that he warreth agaynst vs: surely he weare the veryest foole in the worlde, if he would finde out this fault himselfe.<note place="margin">It is good bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>And as farre as I can sée, the daunger that we are in, is farre different from other folkes. For king Philip meanes not to haue our Citie vnder his obeysance, no, <hi>that is not his meaning?</hi> but altogither to destroy it. For he knowes well ynough, you

But whatsoeuer he be, poore or riche, lowe or high, craftes man, or landed man, if he be vertuous and godly, hée is a Gentleman.

This man had to wife, one <hi>Cleobula,</hi> a straunger borne, and no Grecian as it was thought, who brought him forth a sonne, called <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> after hys owne name.

Wherefore he bequeathed him with those his goodes, to thrée executors men of trust, named <hi>Aphobus, Demophon,</hi> and <hi>Therippides,</hi> who like common executors, not only became carelesse of the childes bringing vp, but also employed his portion to their owne vse,<note place="margin">Executors carelesse of their charge.</note> yea they did not so much, as pay the teachers for his learning. And the Boy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in déede somewhat wéerish, and tender of bodie, his mother therfore was not willing that he should be ouertrauelled with to great paynes to séeke learning, for feare of hindering his health.

So that this childe might haue béene lost for want of carefull bringing vp, and good héede taking to him: if he had not béene better enclined of hys owne nature.

neshe or tender natured childe, and so verie a cockney there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, his playfellowes commonlye called him by waye of scorne and mockage <hi>Battalus,</hi> as much to say as wanton, nise, and effeminate, after the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one <hi>Battalus</hi> a Musitian,<note place="margin">Battalus a Musitian, so nise of behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could not well tell howe to treade vpon the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite he had to go in womans apparell, or at the least wyse as nisely, as women do.</note> that was a womanishe man, as tender a péece, God wote, as a Nunnes hen.

            <p>Nowe that this his father was thus deade, although it bée to others a great lacke for want of good bringing vp: his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being more tender than néeded, &amp; louing hir sonne against reason, as commonly mothers doe, hauing greater care to hys wanton cherishing, than to his good education, he hauing lettes also besides this, mo than a good many to do well: yet such was his naturall inclination and aptnesse to all goodnesse and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that he of himself, without guide, or directour in his doings, folowed the best and worthiest way, that was for man to go in vpon earth. For whereas <hi>Athens</hi> was a towne, that ministred great pleasures, and caryed some awaye, to great follie, that weare vnder the power and gouernment of their fathers,<note place="margin">Demosthenes aptnesse by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to follow the path of vertue.</note> and that all youth is commonly giuen to disorder, and many times through default of their gouernors, doe runne astray: yet was this childe being verie yong and tender of yeares, so wholy gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to good learning, that he forsooke all the vanities of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, to heare <hi>Aristotle, Theophrastus,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> thrée of the most famous learned men that euer weare. So that whereas there be two wayes of loue offered to euery one at his first entrie, to tread in, the one sauage, rude, and wicked, being the very path to hell, death, and damnation: the other, godly, plaine, right, and honest, being the high way to heauen, and al the ioyes that may be, the which way entiseth all good men to it, through the beautie thereof, &amp; draweth all them with an heauenly traunce or motion of minde, that are borne of Gods race: he tooke that

louing way of vertue, and through great paynes and trauaile, gotte the immortall rewarde, of his heauenly desire, béeing knowne and reputed to bée one of the most famous Orators that euer lyued. Nowe the cause that mooued him chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his naturall inclination, to be so gréedie and so studious of eloquence, was this. It happened that when <hi>Calistratus</hi> that famous Orator shoulde handle the <hi>Oropians</hi> cause,<note place="margin">Oropus a town of Attica bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering vppon Boeotia, for the iurisdiction of which place there was great holde.</note> béeing a matter of so great importaunce, as it touched the state of their towne: there was like to be a maruellous audience, not onely for the weightinesse thereof: but also for the worthinesse of the Orator. At which time it fortuned <hi>Demosthenes</hi> (being then of verie yong yeares as it should séeme) to heare certaine schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maysters saye to his Mayster, that they and he would go and heare the sayde Orator, which made that the Boye was not quiet till by much intreatie he had obtayned of his teacher, that he might also go with him. Wherewith his maister was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,<note place="margin">The cause that moued Demos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes first, to loue eloquence.</note> and for that hée had good acquaintaunce with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and kéepers of that place, he got an apt rowme for hys Boy, to sit close and secrete, where he might heare all that was to be sayde. At last, when <hi>Calistratus</hi> had excellently handled himselfe, and was wonderfully estéemed for his eloquent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Demosthenes</hi> thought it a great honour, to sée him so fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and attended vppon by the people, and to be reported so worthie a man, but most of all his woonder was, that his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous eloquence was such as thereby he did preuayle in all causes, and brought thinges to passe as he woulde haue them, which fired so his heart, that therevpon he gaue ouer all other kyndes of studie, and began to exercise himselfe with making Orations, as though y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he himself would by and by be an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.<note place="margin">Iseus an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Orator, and teacher of eloquence.

hauing no vse of his owne goodes as then: or else he did rather choose to followe <hi>Isaeus</hi> for that his kinde of wryting and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king was more pearcing, and more cunning to season causes withall, or (as it may be thought) more agréeable to his nature. Some say agayne that he was scholler to <hi>Plato,</hi>

                  <hi>Plato.</hi>
               </note> and by him did much aduaunce his skill for eloquence, after whose death, he became scholler to <hi>Aristotel,</hi> and was his hearer so diligently,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aristotel.</hi>
               </note> and so prospered vnder him, that he reported him afterwardes both to king Philip, and to Alexander, to be one of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest schollers, for diuers his giftes and vertues, that euer he had. It is also sayde, that he had and did secretely learne the bookes of <hi>Isocrates,</hi> and <hi>Alcidamantes,</hi> touching the precepts of Rhetorike, the which he had of one <hi>Callias</hi> a <hi>Siracusan,</hi> and others. And truth it is, so soone as he was of full yeares and crept out of his minoritie, he brought an action agaynst hys Tutors for their wasting of his Patrimonie committed to their charge, and began to tytle Orations agaynst them,<note place="margin">Demosthenes pleadeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst his Tutor.</note> the which are yet extant some of them, in aunswering of whome, they vsed great sleightes and delatorie plées, with protestations and exceptions agaynst the whole processe as full of Nullities, and therefore of no force. And onely this they did, bicause they would compell him to begin lawe againe, and so (in forme of lawe through continuall delayes) to wearie him altogither.</p>
            <p>Thus being with painefull trauaile and earnest studie well exercised, and following his cause without intermission: at length he preuayled agaynst them, although he neyther got a quarter of his owne, nor yet recouered that small portion, which was awarded him, without great perill and hazard.<note place="margin">Orchomenius Laomedon through exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of bodie cured himselfe of a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and made his bodie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by euer after more nimble, lustie &amp; strong.</note> And so by often dealing in his owne matters being well seasoned and made bolde through custome to speake, and séeing what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it was to be an excellent Orator: he gaue himself to pleade openly, and to be a Counsellor in other mens causes. And as it is reported like as <hi>Orchomenius Laomedon</hi> did vse by the aduise of the Phisition to run euery day a long race to amende the fault of his splene,<note place="margin">An apt simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> and so by such exercise got such an habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

and perfection in running, that at the common games hée got the garland from all others, and was counted the swiftest runner of all men liuing: so happened it with <hi>Demosthenes</hi> that whilst he entered the Courtes to pleade his owne cause, to recouer such losses and wronges as he had sustayned in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate goodes and possessions, he thereby got himselfe such expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in pleading, and such eloquence of speach therewithall, that he was counted in ciuill causes (as <hi>Orchomenius</hi> was in running for the garland) the chiefest pleader of all others,<note place="margin">Vse makes maysteries.</note> that came to the barre to speake in any matter.</p>
            <p>But yet at the first time of his speaking to the people, he was hissed at, and out countenaunced with knocking and trampling of féete, for his vnacquainted and straunge maner of speach, which béeing intricate and confused, caryed very long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sentences, powdered with bitter and odious reasons, alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and wrested in,<note place="margin">Demosthenes imperfections, in speach and want of skill to tell his tale.</note> to proue his matter good. Besides this, hys voyce as it séemed was childishe and small, his tongue vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and obscure, himselfe short breathed, hacking and parting his sentences in such sort, that he was altogither thought confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and superfluous.

               </note> he did sharpely rebuke him for his faint heart, and tolde him that he had cause ynough to be of good chéere, for that his maner of pleading was not inferior to <hi>Pericles</hi> dooings, who was a most excellent and vehement Orator:<note place="margin">Demosthenes bashfull of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before the people.</note> but he sayde that he marred himselfe with a certaine bashefulnesse, and faynt stomacke of his owne, for that he was fearefull, and coulde neyther abyde boldly the peoples presence, and their noyse: nor yet acquaint his bodie with exercise to endure paynes, vndooing himselfe wholy with ouermuch ease, and daintinesse, and hindering his good dooings with néedelesse feare. An other time being gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueld in open audience, he gat him home with an heauie heart,

thrusting his head in his bosome as one cleane out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. And as the tale goes, one <hi>Satyrus</hi> a Stage player,<note place="margin">Satyrus, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor to teach iesture and v<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And for helpe of his voyce,<note place="margin">Demosthenes maner to mend his voyce.</note> his maner was to get him vp vpon high places, as on the tops of stares or such like, and there woulde he make Orations by himselfe, and vtter certaine verses with one whole breath so long, as he was able by any possibilitie to continue.

noyse that the people made, when he should speake in open au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:<note place="margin">Demosthenes remedie to help his bashfulnes.</note> he haunted the sea side, where the surges most rored, imagining that vsing himselfe to speake where such a tempes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous hurling noyse was, he might the rather abyde the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples exclamations and vnquietnesse. And where as he had an vncomely vse to mooue one of his shoulders,<note place="margin">Demosthenes maner to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his iesture</note> somewhat higher sometimes than the other: he caused a swoorde to be hanged vpon a beame with the poynt downeward, almost to his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if by any meanes he should happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hit that iesture, or to shrug his shoulder otherwise than weare méete: the swordes poynt might streight wayes pricke him.

Besides this, he lost none occasion, by such speach and conference as he had with others: to occupie his heade and witte withall. For when he came home,<note place="margin">Demosthenes maner to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie his head &amp; witte withall.</note> he gat him streight to his secret corner, and there repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to himselfe the whole matter of the talke had abrode as it was, and what defence was made for it.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10092:79"/>
where to begin, when I consider his wonderfull absolute na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his maruellous fulnesse and vehemencie of speach: hys modest and sober lyfe, his piercing eloquence, his passing vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, his constant firmenesse in all his doynges,<note place="margin">Many passing vertues, in one seuerall man.</note> his innocent handes from corruption and bribes, his iust dealing, his curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and gentle behauiour, his faythfull mynde, his manly sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, his singuler wisedome, and last of all his seuerall order, and particuler dooings throughout the whole course of all hys lyfe. So that I say in such a plentifull fielde, where so manye rare and notable vertues weare planted, better it is sleightly to runne ouer the plot with admiration, and highly to honour God for such an odde vessell of his creation: than boldly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the large commending of so excellent an instrument and heauenly Orator as he was, not being able to touch him to the quicke, as he ought to be vsed and dealt withall. And therefore best it is to let his owne doings speake for themselues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a spectacle to the worlde of his wonderfull disposition. For I thinke if himselfe weare aliue, he coulde hardly with all the eloquence that euer he had, worthily and fully set forth all that was in him, and as he had iustly deserued, or at the least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, none could doe it but himselfe alone.

            <p>There was also a certaine théefe in <hi>Athens</hi> called <hi>Aereus,</hi> as much to say as brassie or made of brasse, who was much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with <hi>Demosthenes</hi> candle lightes in the deade night, and therfore iested &amp; scoffed much at his night watches: Sirha, quoth <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> I knowe well enough that my lightes are not good for thy profession, for weare not my lights thou wouldst doe greater matters than lightes come to.

            <p>On a time when <hi>Demosthenes</hi> voyce was thought to soft
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10092:80"/>
by reason of the noyse that the people made, which afterwards was cast in his téeth by some others: he aunswered that stage players are to be iudged by their lowd speach, when it is either good or bad, or when their voyce fayleth them: but Orators and Councellors to an estate, ought to be estéemed and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon, by their wisedome and knowledge only. For the part of him that playes on a stage, is to séeke to satisfie the peoples eares, but the part of an Orator and Councellor is, to séeke the welfare of the Subiectes: the one is for pleasure, the other is for profite, and therefore we may not stande vpon,<note place="margin">A pithie speach better than a Pilates voyce.</note> howe lowde a man be that speaketh to doe good: but how good the councell is, that he giueth. A reporter of tales, or a stage player in an open Theater, it becommeth very well to haue a good ringing voice, to ouersounde the noyse of the people: but he that is a Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, or an Orator to an estate, ought to be heard of the people with their owne accorde, very quietly and attentiuely, howe so euer his voyce serueth him.</p>
            <p>An other tyme when the people would néedes rumble him out of his seate where he made his Oration, by making an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely noyse with their handes and féete, (as they vse at thys houre to doe in all the Schooles of Italie most vnséemely, when eyther they like not the readers handling of his matter, or are not disposed to heare him any longer) he desired them to giue him pacience to tell them a merie tale. Where vpon when eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man was whisht and still, he sayde thus: a certaine yong man did hyre an Asse to serue for cariage in the whote sommer season, to go from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Megara,</hi> and his guyde with him,<note place="margin">Fonde tales sooner heard, than graue reasons.</note> and when the sunne was verie hote about noonetide, they both would go on the shadow side of the Asse to auoyde the heate, so that they were at strife for the matter: the guyde saying, that the Asse was hyred, but not the shadowe,<note place="margin">Contention for the shadow of an Asse.</note> the other saying that as he had right to the Asse by hyring of him, so had he right to the shadow of the Asse, as well as to the Asse it selfe.

And so he went his way, and would not speake any thing else to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demosthenes</hi> was one of the ten Orators whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Athens</hi> sent in ambassage to king Philip of <hi>Macedonie.</hi>

            <p>In his Targate that he vsed for the warres (although he was not the hardiest man in the world) he caused this sentence to be written, <hi>Good lucke.</hi> Afterwardes comming to the field where he shoulde shewe his manhoode: by and by he tooke his héeles, and threwe his Targate from him, which matter being layde to his charge, that he played the coward, he shooke off the same with this common prouerbe, and vsuall verse.

Meaning that it is more wisedome for a man, to runne his way when there is none other remedie, than to die in the fielde foolishly.

            <p>A certaine Damosell receyued certaine money to kéepe, for two straungers that went out of towne, with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that shée shoulde deliuer the same money to them both ioyntly.

            <p>
               <hi>Antipater</hi> lykewise sayde to <hi>Archias</hi> the Marshall, whome he sent to <hi>Calauria</hi> for the taking of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi>

And as for vs we could neuer attaine to the pith of his eloquence. But I doe account his eloquence in the second place in stéede of an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and meane for him to doe his feates: hauing alwayes passinglye reuerenced <hi>Demosthenes</hi> himselfe, for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his courage and witte,<note place="margin">Demosthenes neuer dismayde by any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>ormes of fortune, neyther coulde he be remooued from his purpose, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny terrour or vexation whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>And whereas some sayde to king Philip, that the people of <hi>Athens</hi> bare him great hatred, and was his mightie aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: Tushe (quoth he) it is <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and none other, that is my aduersarie. For he onely, maketh <hi>Athens</hi> to be so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as it is. Such is the force of vertue in a good man,<note place="margin">Great prayses giuen to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes by king Philip his enimie.</note> &amp; so great is the value of some one aboue thousandes. And further he said that whereas he did send Ambassadors to other places, if the Athenians did sende any of theirs thether, and suffered <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> to tary at home, he commonly preuayled in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde: but if <hi>Demosthenes</hi> weare in place, he defeated still all his purposes, and was euermore a trumpe in his way. Yea such a man is he (quoth king Philip) that there can not be any sufficient monument erected, to set forth fully hys great wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse.</p>
            <p>But to returne againe to king Philip, thus it is reported that he hearing <hi>Demosthenes</hi> at an other time euill spoken of by <hi>Parmenio,</hi> for that he had vsed verie vehement wordes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the king, in the Councell house at <hi>Athens,</hi> well (quoth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10092:87"/>
king Philip) we must allowe <hi>Demosthenes</hi> to vse his wordes, for amongst all others,<note place="margin">Demosthenes could neuer be corrupted by king Philip.</note> he neuer yet came within our bookes of expences, meaning he could neuer fasten pennie of him: whom he did so estéeme for his singular constancie, his assured fidelitie, and notable heart towardes his Countrie: that he thought him to be the oddest man for all giftes that euer was in <hi>Grecia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus worthily king Philip reported of his deadlie enimie, honouring vertue, where soeuer he found it. And therefore I would haue wished that the memory of such a king should haue béene kept vnspotted, after his death, or at leastwise not so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pited, as to haue triumphes made vpon his infortunate ende, séeing he was not so verie euill, as he is made to be. I doe like well that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> hated him deadly while he liued, for that he sought to get into his hands the whole estate of <hi>Athens,</hi> and all Greceland besides.<note place="margin">Loue and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred must be in euerie good Magistrate.</note> And surely I do thinke that no man can be a good Magistrate, that will not as deadlye hate, as hée déepely loueth: and as soone make an euill man afrayde of him, as a good man to loue him. For by that meanes, he shall both do his Countrie good seruice, and saue himselfe from great perill and daunger, that else might happen vnto him.

when yong Alexander had satled his Realme: hée marched with a great power to <hi>Boeotia.</hi> And then was the Athenians combe cut, and <hi>Demosthenes</hi> courage cooled.

And although <hi>Demosthenes</hi> went to perswade them by the tale of the woolfe and the shepe, as you heard before, with other reasons alleaged amongst his Apoththegmes, that they should not deliuer them: yet if <hi>Demades</hi> that great Orator and suttle Grecian had not béene, they had all béene sent away,<note place="margin">Nine hundred pound starling.</note> who requiring fiue talents for his charges of Ambassade, tooke vpon him to deale with the king, for appeasing of his wrath, hoping eyther vpon the kings friendship, and his fauour: or else that the king being glutted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie with so great an ouerthrow, woulde the rather be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.

The night Owle, or the scriche Owle (as some call hir) being thought the birde of death, was dedicated to <hi>Pallas,</hi> for a birde of hir chiefe delight: the Dragon also was set vpon hir crest: the people weare <hi>Pallas</hi> dearlings,<note place="margin">The people e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill rewarders of them, that haue done them good.</note> ouer whom she tooke great care, who are compared to a monstruous beast with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heades, euill fauoredly acquiting those that haue done them most good, as they did <hi>Socrates, Phocion, Scipio, Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Tullie,</hi> and diuers others.

            <p>And good cause he had to be greatly grieued with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that weare so vnkinde towardes him, who loued them so dearely, and did so much for them.

vp, and renuing the same milde wordes vnto him againe that he had spoken before, did promise him that <hi>Antipater</hi> ment clearely to forgiue him, and to be in perfite loue and charitie with him.

            <p>It weare not amisse to declare in some part the very wordes that <hi>Archias</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes</hi> had togither, and were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes reported to <hi>Antipater</hi> successour to Alexander the great, according as <hi>Lucian</hi> maketh mention after the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Athens</hi> by the sayde <hi>Antipater.</hi> For it should séeme <hi>Demosthenes</hi> made little account of death, after the losse of his countrie, but rather prepared himselfe to die with it, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

life vnfit for him, when his déere Countrie was once vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. And thus therfore he said to <hi>Archias,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to him into the Isle <hi>Calauria,</hi> whervnto he then was fled, to eschue present tyrannie: after long entreatie made by the sayde <hi>Archias,</hi> and promise therewithall that if he woulde come away, he shoulde not haue any harme at all:<note place="margin">A dialogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Demos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes &amp; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias, and the same rehearsed as it was, to king Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Archias vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his returne from the Isle Calauria, now Sidra.</note> (The which wordes <hi>Archias</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed afterwardes to king <hi>Antipater.</hi>)</p>
            <p>In good sooth I am not mooued, O <hi>Archias,</hi> through feare of tormentes or death, to make promise to come to <hi>Antipater</hi> in hope to haue lyfe. And though these thinges bée true that thou doest saye with all thy fayre promises: I ought yet much more to take héede, that I doe not take my life of <hi>Antipater</hi> by the waye of a gift or by corruption, least I shoulde séeme to forsake that standing and rowme wherein I was placed for the defence of <hi>Grece,</hi> and béeing counted as a runnagate, shoulde goe ouer to <hi>Macedonie.</hi> That if it be honest for me to liue, let the hauen <hi>Pyraeus</hi> giue me life, and that Galley,<note place="margin">A rehearsall made by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes, of his seuerall deedes atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

That if I woulde liue by the mercie and fauour of others, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the same be a dishonourable thing: yet weare it better for me to séeke mercie amongest them, whose kinsfolkes and friendes, I haue deliuered out of captiuitie, or to deale with the fathers of those maydes, that I holped to good mariages, or else to go to such as I haue ayded heretofore, to pay theyr subsidies and ordinarie tributes. But if neyther the state of an Islande, nor the Sea can deliuer me from death: I desire God <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> (in whose Temple I am) to saue my lyfe, and I desire it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10092:93"/>
of this his Aultare and of his holy lawes, that if God <hi>Neptune</hi> neyther cannot so much as withstande the prophaning of this his Church,<note place="margin">God Neptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes temple a sanctuarie.</note> and that he thinketh it no shame, to giue vp <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> to <hi>Archias</hi>: I will be contented to die, and yet shal not <hi>Antipater</hi> for that, be honoured of me, as a God. In déede I might haue had better friendes of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> than I had of the Athenians, and might haue béene a companion of thy happinesse and flourishing estate, if I would haue lincked my selfe with <hi>Callimedon,</hi>

               <hi>Pythias,</hi> and <hi>Demades.</hi> But I do not like any such lyfe, neyther will I chaunge my faith with the ficklenesse of fortune.
<q>That surely is a noble passage which a man maketh vpon his death, with a cleare conscience, and without guilt or feare, of any filthie act, or wicked offence done.</q>
And asmuch as lyeth in me, I will not dishonour <hi>Athens,</hi> but will rather embrace bondage, and renounce cleane my liberty, and so go streight to my graue with honour. And good it weare for thée <hi>Archias</hi> to call to thy remembraunce the Tragedies whererein thou hast béene a player. For is it not notably sayde there in one of them? The Ladie being readie to die, was verie carefull to fall downe comely,<note place="margin">Notable bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of a Mayden, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that no bare plat of hir body might vnseme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appere open.</note> that no bare part of hir bodye might appeare. And séeing a Mayde did this, shall <hi>Demos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes</hi> preferre a dishonourable lyfe before an honest death, forgetting the disputations of <hi>Zenocrates,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the immortalitie of the soule? These weare his sayings.
<q>And moreouer he enueyed bitterly agaynst those that doe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brade vnto others their calamitie,<note place="margin">Hee is worsse than mad, that chargeth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man with beggerie, for that fortune is euer vnstable, and no man as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of that he hath.</note> and dashe them in the téeth with their poore life and miserable estate. But to what end do I rehearse all these things, sayth <hi>Archias</hi> to <hi>Antipater</hi>?</q>
At the length when I had partly entreated, and partly threatned him, vsing both sharpt and swéete wordes togither: I would (quoth he) be styrred man with these thy wordes: if I weare <hi>Archias,</hi> but séeing I am <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> pardon me I pray thée, for that it is agaynst my woont to be a wauering or an inconstant man. And nowe when I went to plucke him out perforce, and that he perceyued it: he beganne to laugh at me, and looking vpon
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10092:93"/>
the God, sayde: <hi>Archias</hi> thinketh that armour onely and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes of men, are the strength, and bulwarkes of mans lyfe,<note place="margin">The courage of mans minde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all force and strength whatsoeuer.</note> contemning my furniture, the which neyther the <hi>Illirian</hi> soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, the <hi>Treballian</hi> garde, nor yet the <hi>Macedonian</hi> forces, shall euer be able to dash and ouerthrow: The same force being stronger than that woodden wall, (our shippes) was:<note place="margin">Their galleyes and ships, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Apollo their woodden walles.</note> the which <hi>Apollo</hi> did once report by his Oracle, to be inuincible. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as through foresight &amp; vnderstanding, I haue kept my selfe safe in gouernement of the common weale hitherto: so I trust by the same to defende my selfe clearely from the <hi>Macedonians</hi> daunger hereafter. I neuer cared a straw for <hi>Euctemon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euctemon, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristogiton, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theas, Callime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, foure tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to their Countrie, and flatterers to king Philip.</note> nor for <hi>Aristogiton,</hi> nor for <hi>Pytheas,</hi> nor for <hi>Callimedon,</hi> nor then for Philip, nor yet nowe for this <hi>Archias.</hi> And when he had sayde thus, and I began to plucke at him. How nowe man (quoth he) doe not lay violent hands vpon me, for this Temple shall not be prophaned through me, by so much as I am able to let it: so soone as I haue done my prayers to God, I will follow thée streight wayes without leading at all. And so I looked in déede y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would haue done, when he had put his hande to his mouth. Neyther had I any mistrust at all that he did any other thing, but only prayed to God. But what he did then we knew it afterwardes, by taking streight examination of his mayde, who confessed, that he bought poyson for himselfe a great while ago, to loose his soule from bondage of the bodie, to liue streight wayes in libertie. Neither could he scantly passe ouer the stares of the Church doore, when he looked vpon me and sayde,<note place="margin">The minde of euery man, is man himselfe.</note> thou mayest cary this carkasse man to <hi>Antipater,</hi> but as for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes,</hi> thou shalt not carie him, no, no, by.

then that we woulde haue caryed this man to the slaughter house,<note place="margin">Antipaters no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table prayses giuen of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes.</note> as men cary an Oxe or any other beast: or rather would we haue cherished him, and vsed his councell touching the whole state of Greceland, that we might haue heard the voyce of a frée minded man,<note place="margin">The free min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man, the best and surest friend.</note> where as nowe we haue none about vs but flatterers, and soothers to all things that we say and doe. But he was to good for vs. Nowe Lorde God what a passing man was this: O spirit inuincible, and most blessed creature: what a valiaunt stout heart had he. It is wisedome, I sée for man, euer to haue in his hande the possession of libertie. Nowe he is gone most like to liue in the Islandes of the blessed, in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice of the renowmed and worthie Champions: or rather he hath taken the streight way to heauen there to be an aungell, with <hi>Iupiter</hi> the Sauiour. As for his bodie we will sende it to <hi>Athens,</hi> the which is like to be a more precious monument to that Countrie, than all those that dyed at <hi>Marathona</hi> for saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of their Citie. Thus farre <hi>Lucian,</hi> in that Dialogue, betwixt King <hi>Antipater,</hi> and <hi>Archias</hi> the Marshall.</p>
            <p>He was .62. yeares of age, when he dyed, ending his course the .xvj. day of October vpon the feast of <hi>Ceres,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Demosthenes age, and how long it is since he was.</note> which feast was euer after hallowed with mourning and fasting for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of him, about ninetéene hundred and .93. yeres past. The Athenians vpon this day did him honour as he had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and erected a brasen monument of his shape and portra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and gaue to the eldest of his familie a liuing in the Court, grauing an honourable inscription vpon the foote of his monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in this wise.</p>
            <q>
               <l>If might had matcht the minde, of Demosthenes the worthie:</l>
               <l>Greecelande by the Macedones: had not bene brought to miserie.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus this noble Orator ended his dayes, being a man worthie to haue liued euer, whose name and glorie cannot but continue, so long as the Sunne giueth light vpon earth, or man hath tongue to speake. Neyther haue I in vsing this report of him, done as <hi>Zenophon</hi> did in setting forth the lyfe of <hi>Cirus</hi> king of <hi>Persia,</hi> who in déede did coulour him not as his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10092:94"/>
weare, but spake of a king in his person, as a king should bée: but I haue béene bolde with <hi>Demosthenes</hi> to shewe him fully and wholy in his colours as he was, not leauing in the middest of his vertues, to touch also the nature of his vices, bicause I woulde shewe plainely what he was in all poyntes, that the worlde may sée, God giueth not to anye one man all things in perfection without some blemish or default, although some men haue some seuerall and excellent giftes, farre pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing others as this man without doubt had.</p>
            <p>Nowe <hi>Demades</hi> the Orator his fellow (who for naturall witte farre passed <hi>Demosthenes</hi>) decréed and enacted a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death agaynst him, after he was fledde, the rather to flatter the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and to yéelde himselfe and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into their handes, which turned him to vtter destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Traytors ende their dayes as they deserue.</note> And hereof <hi>Demosthenes</hi> gaue him warning before hande, and willed him in anye wise not to make sale of hys naturall soyle, saying that traytours in making sale of theyr Countrie, doe first make sale of themselues. And so it fell out afterwards with him in déede, for <hi>Demades</hi> shortly after was apprehended, and had first his sonne slaine in his armes, and he himselfe next put to a most cruell &amp; miserable death. A worthie ende for all such whatsoeuer they be, that are wicked betrayers of their naturall soyle and Countrie, who after a sort plucke out their owne bowelles, in that they alienate from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to others (whatsoeuer the respect be) the proper inheritaunce and birth right of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the chiefest and greatest treasure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to man vpon earth, next to the true knowledge and reuerent feare of God.</p>
