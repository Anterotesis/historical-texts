            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Maid, young and beautifull, that often went with her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to the Meetings of the People of God, called <hi>Quakers;</hi> and had a love raiſed in her heart to the moſt precious Truth, and alſo to them who indeed held it in a pure Conſcience; yet did not give up to the obedience of faith, but ſtill lived in the Cuſtoms and Faſhions of this Evil World, to the wounding and ſtifling of the precious Life of Jeſus Chriſt in her, but the ſame Love of the Lord that had begotten a tenderneſs in her, and raiſed up a love to Truth, followed her, and would not ſuffer her to ſit down in the World without trouble; for although ſhe was much taken notice of by them who loved vanity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in beauty more then vertue, and ſhe by this became further off from faithfulneſs yet here ſhe muſt not take up her reſt, for the Lord viſited her with great weakneſs, and ſhe grew ill, and decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and fell into a conſumption, and lived in a conſuming ſtate about three years, outward means and medicines were uſed for her

Ah that my heart were open, but it is ſhut and hard; when ſhall I find mercy in this ſtate!</hi> She remained for ſome time, and grew weaker and weaker in body; and on the firſt day ſhe took her bed, ſhe was much under the righteous Judgments of the Lord, and felt his Word in her heart as a fire; but the Lord in Judgment remembred Mercy, and having brought her very low, he ſhewed her the childs ſtate, which ſhe with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light deſired; and indeed ſhe became as a little child, fit for the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Then did the Lord rend the vail, and ſhewed her his Glory, and the preciouſneſs of his pure everlaſting Truth, and the Light ſhined out of Darkneſs, and in it ſhe ſaw Light, and received the Knowledge of God (whom to know is Life Eternal) and her heart was filled with Joy, and her mouth with Praiſes, and ſhe lay for many hours without the ſence of pain or weakneſs, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

forth the Praiſes of the Lord, reſuſing to take any Cordials, or ought elſe to ſupport the natural ſpirits; ſaying, <hi>I am well, I feel no pain, I am full, my Cup runs over; I am filled us with marrow and fatneſs, I have ſeen his Glory, and taſted of his moſt precious Truth, and it is ſweet unto my taſte; Ah, how precious, how pure, is Gods everlaſting Truth, nothing ſo pure, and they who indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celve it, are made pure by it, praiſed be the Lord who hath made me partaker of it, and placed me amongſt his poople: Ah, Bleſſed God, who hath given me cauſe to ſing aloud of thy praiſe;</hi> then ſome about her, ſeeing her very week, thought it might wear her too much, told her, ſhe might praiſe the Lord in her heart, and bid her try if ſhe could ſleep; but ſhe ſaid, ſhe was well, and needed no ſleep, <hi>neither is my mouth dry,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>not I faint;</hi> but ſhe was perſwaded to take ſomething, and ſo lay ſtill; but after ſome time, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Surely, I ſhould not have been ſtopt, but I will now try if I can ſleep,</hi> which ſhe did ſweetly; and in the morning ſaid, <hi>Although I have ſlept, yet my heart hath been exerciſed in the praiſes of the Lord;</hi> and that day lay very preciouſly, ſpeaking to ſeveral perſons as came to viſit her, to their ſeveral conditions, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome, who lived in pleaſure, her hands, ſaying, <hi>See here, the Lord hath made theſe bones bare for my rebellion, becauſe I would not ſubmit to his moſt precious Truth; he hath brought me to the duſt, and I muſt lay down this body as a Sacrifice; Oh, do not you ſtand out, it will coſt you dear, it ever you find mercy,</hi> (and ſuch like) then would ſhe ſing praiſes to the Lord, and declare much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the purity of Truth, exhorting all, who were not made partakers of it, ſpeedily to embrace it; and much more ſhe ſaid which will be to much to relate.</p>
            <p>On the next day, being very weak, and it was thought ſhe might have departed, ſhe called for ſome young perſons that were related to her, and ſet before them their conditions, clearly, in the Light of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, warning and exhorting them, praying for them, bleſſed them in the Spirit of diſcerning, which the Lord gave her in the day of his Power; and when ſome Friends came to her that was in the faſhion of the World, ſhe would ſay, <hi>What, Friends who know Gods precious Truth, put on their Hoods ſo, that is like me in my other life; Friends, who have received Gods precious Truth need no other adorning;</hi> and having

ſpoken long in this wiſe, ſhe laid her ſelf in ſilence, waiting for her diſſolution, having ſaid, <hi>I ſhall ſhut mine eyes and ſleep;</hi> but ſhe lay ſeveral weeks in great weakneſs after this, having her heart exerciſed on this wiſe.</p>
            <p>And if ſhe had ſpoken an unadviſed word, then would ſhe cry to the Lord, to waſh her throughout, and ſay, <hi>Judge me, Lord, judge me, with thy great Judgments; let nothing remain in me, or be ſpoken by me, but what is pure; ſearch me throughly: Ah, curſed be that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that diſpoſition; this at firſt kept me from receiving Gods pure Truth, curſed be that diſpoſition;</hi> and lying longer then one would have thought one ſo weak could have layn, taking very little of any outward ſuſtenance; ſome would ſay to her, it may be thou mayſt recover; <hi>No, no,</hi> would ſhe ſay, <hi>I muſt lay down this body for my rebellion; in my other life, if any had ſaid, I ſhould recover, it would for a little time ſeem to refreſh me; and if they had ſaid, ſurely, I could not live long,</hi> (or ſo) <hi>it would caſt me down; but now I long for death, I muſt lay down this body; for,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>when I received Gods precious Truth, I received the ſentence of death;</hi> And this ſhe was very poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in all along, and when ſhe was perſwaded to be paſſive in this matter; ſhe ſaid, <hi>I have indeed cauſe enough to deſire life now, for the Lord hath made me partaker of his bleſſed Truth, and if I live I know I ſhall, bear a Teſtimony, a faithfull Teſtimony for the Lord, and he hath placed me amongſt his People; and I ſhall have their company, this is deſirable; but I muſt lay down this body:</hi> great was her love to the Lord and his People; and when the Servants of the Lord came to her, it was ſuch a reviving, that ſhe had not the ſence of her weakneſs, her heart being overcome with the Love of the Lord, in his Servants, ſhe lay a rejoycing. Often was ſhe aſſaulted by the Enemy, ſometimes to deſire life, ſometimes with worldly things, but ſhe would ſay (even in Gods Authority) <hi>Away, Satan, away, I defie thee in the Name of the Lord, touch not that which is pure:</hi> and one time, when ſhe was under this temptation, a precious Servant of the Lord coming to viſit her; <hi>Ah,</hi> (ſaid ſhe to him) <hi>now the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter flees, he cannot ſtand before thee;</hi> then after ſhe had been thus <gap reason="illegible: smudged" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

much patience, and comly behaviour ſhe lay; and in the morning before her departure, ſhe called for ſeveral things to drink, and gaſped for breath, but ſaid, <hi>I ſhall not go ſo.</hi> And afterwards did, as it were, lay her ſelf forth in ſilence, waiting for her diſſolution; but at the coming in of a good Friend ſhe revived, and lived till Evening, and about half an hour before her departure ſhe was taken with a very great trembling, and ſeemed to be ſomewhat troubled, It was ſaid by one near her; what's the matter, what aileſt thou? <hi>I fear,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>whether it be a true Spirit, or a Temptation;</hi> it was ſaid to her, what meaneſt thou? art thou in any doubt as concerning the Truth of which thou art made partaker? <hi>No, no,</hi> ſaid the, <hi>that's Gods pure and Everlaſting Truth, the Truth which the People of God, called</hi> Quakers, <hi>are made partakers of, and for which they ſuffer that is everlaſting, that is the true Spirit, and their God is my God; and although I ſee it not now as I have ſeen it, yet I bring in my teſtimony that's the Truth that ſhall abide for ever; that's pure, and nothing that is deſiled muſt be ſheltred under it; that's the Truth which enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens every man that cometh into the World: The little Seed in me is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come great, great, great; Bleſſed be God who hath placed me among his People, and I poſſeſs what they poſſeſs; and when the Faithfull lie as I lie, my Portion well be their Portion; and my Cup is full, it runs over, over, over:</hi> Then ſhe breathed a little thicker about the ſpace of one quarter of an hour, and without groan of ſigh, or the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe ſhut her eyes and ſlept.

            <p>But art thou now increaſed in Divine Subſtance, ſo that thou canſt ſay, now the eyes of my underſtanding is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and thoſe things which before were hard and dark as to me, are now become plain and eaſie, and now I ſee, (not men like Trees) but in the Light of the Lord I ſee light, not as in a glaſs darkly, but now I ſee face to face, the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are over and gone, and now I can ſay my Redeemer liveth, and the eye which the Lord hath opened ſeeth him; yea, and he ſtandeth laſt upon my Earth; the Lord my God having caſt out the ſtrong man that did keep the houſe, now he liveth and reigneth in me, and opens even the Flood-gates of

his everlaſting Loving-kindneſs in me; yea, he feedeth me with the Bread that cometh down from Heaven that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver periſh, and I drink and am refreſhed, yea, I drink aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly of the River of Pleaſure that is at the right hand of the Father; I drink of the wine that is well refined new in the Kingdom of Heaven; may I not now ſit down, being perfected in that Love which caſteth out fear? may I not now keep holy day in God, being in a ſtate above the fear, ſo much exhorted to? Ah, Friend, whoſoever thou art, that ſhall thus ſay in thy heart, be not high-minded, but fear, and remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day: Art thou at reſt in God, oh, ſanctifie the Sabbath day, and keep it holy, for this the Lord requires; and ſtand upon thy watch continually, and fear to the end, leſt after all this thou grow careleſs, and the exalted ſpirit get up, and thou fall from thy ſtedfaſtneſs, and ſo loſe thy Crown: Bleſſed is he who feareth alwayes.</p>
            <p>Further, art thou in a low eſtate as to things of the World, having many depending on thee, and knows not which way to turn thee, as to an outward livelihood? Ah, fear the Lord, and truſt him over all, and he that feeds the Ravens, and cloathes the Lillies, that can neither ſow nor ſpin, caſt thy care upon him, and aſſuredly thee and thine ſhall be fed, <hi>For the Earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof;</hi> its the Lions that ſhall want, and ſuffer hunger, <hi>But they who fear the Lord ſhall want nothing that is good;</hi> this have I ſeen and known, and this is writ for the encouragement, comfort and ſtrengthning of them who are of a fearfull heart; keep in Gods fear, be faithfull to his requirings, be not carefull, but do thy duty, and Heaven and Earth ſhall ſooner paſs away, then the Lord fail to ſupply thy neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yea, <hi>He ſhall bleſs thee in thy Basket, and thy Store; he ſhall be with thee in thy going out, and in thy coming in, he will

cauſe all to proſper thou ſetteſt thy hand unto:</hi> yea, he ſhall bleſs thy Children within thee, and he ſhall Crown thee with his peace, which paſſeth all underſtanding, even in thy daily labour, as thou art found waiting upon him; and he ſhall alſo repleniſh thy heart, and as thou keepeſt thy eye and heart to him, thou ſhalt be freſh and green, bringing forth truſt in thy old age, and thy laſt dayes ſhall be thy beſt dayes; and thus ſhall it be with them who fear the Lord, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wait upon him in a chearfull diligence, expecting each day their daily bread from the hand of the Lord, <hi>who giveth liberally, and upbraideth not:</hi> Oh, my Soul praiſe thou the Lord, (in the ſence of his Love, and enjoyment of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) and let all that is within praiſe his holy Name, for his Mercies are manifold, and his compaſſion never faileth; this day is the Scripture fulfilled, and God is known indeed to be the Father to the fatherleſs, and the Husband to the widow; yea, the Maſter of that Family which calleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Name hath provided all things needfull, ſo that it may well be ſaid, <hi>What lacked ye?</hi> and he hath, yea, God himſelf hath recompenced, into the Boſom, even an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold, whatſoever hath been given up, or loſt for his ſake and the Goſpels; ſurely, ſurely he hath given good meaſure preſſed down, and running over, of this I and mine are living witneſſes, and we have no cauſe to complain, but great cauſe to praiſe and magnifie his Name, and to live to him for ever and ever; Let all thy Works praiſe thee, O Lord; So, even ſo ſaith my Soul.</p>
