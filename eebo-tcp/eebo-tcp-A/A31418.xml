            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and always will have a Church on Earth, 'till the

Society in it ſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 4. 3. This Church muſt be

               <item>Thirdly, Hiſtory ſhews us by what evil ſteps the

2. By weakening the Power of Temporal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

            <head>THE
UNITY
OF THE
CATHOLICK CHURCH
Maintained in the
Church of ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hoſoever with an impartial eye, and a
truly religious concern for the Honour
of God, the Credit of the Goſpel, and
the Salvation of men, looks into
the eſtate of Chriſtendom; he will
ſcarce find any greater cauſe of ſorrowful Reflections
than from the many Diviſions, and Animoſities, which
have diſtracted, and ſeparated its parts.</p>
            <p>Theſe have opened the mouths, and whet the
tongues of profeſt enemies to reviling Invectives and
profane Scoffs againſt our Bleſſed Lord himſelf, and his
holy Religion, and ſtifled the firſt thoughts of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the moſt convincing Truths to a debate among
Jews, Turks, or Pagans, and ſtopt their ears againſt the
wiſeſt Charms.</p>
            <p>To no one cauſe can we more reaſonably impute the
ſmall progreſs which Chriſtianity hath made in the
World for a thouſand years paſt. The ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
have as pernicious influence at home upon the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64560:5"/>
Faith or manners of thoſe within the Pale of the
Church.</p>
            <p>Men are hereby too ſoon tempted into ſome degrees
of Scepticiſm about very material Points of Chriſtian
Doctrine, in which they obſerve ſo many to differ
among themſelves. Others are the more eaſily ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſeek and make much of all Arguments, whereby
to bafle or weaken the cleareſt evidences for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction:
and they ſeldom continue long in the ſame
perſuaſion with thoſe, with whom they will not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the ſame Communion. Thus Schiſms have general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ended in Hereſies.</p>
            <p>As miſchievous are the effects of theſe Diſtractions
upon the manners of Chriſtians. There are many viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and diſorderly paſſions; ſuch as Anger, Wrath,
Hatred, Revenge, Pride, Cenſoriouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
take Sanctuary therein, and under that ſhelter put in
their claim for the height of Chriſtian Graces, and the
moſt holy zeal for God and his Cauſe. Every where
they break, or looſen the Diſcipline of the Church,
which ſhould guard its children from doing amiſs, or
reſtore them after it, when the laſt and moſt capital
puniſhment of being thruſt out of its Communion is
like to be little dreaded, where many voluntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
it with the higheſt pretences of better advantage
elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Now though this matter of fact, confirmed by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
experience, be a ſubject too ſad for a long medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or paſſionate enlargement, yet is it no more than
what might have been foreſeen, without a Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
to follow from the corrupt nature, and depraved
eſtate of mankind not otherwiſe rectified. Wherefore
we muſt ſuppoſe that our ever bleſſed Saviour, in the
Foundations of his holy Inſtitution, made all needful
proviſion to prevent theſe fatal miſcariages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64560:5"/>
By the ſufficient Revelation of all Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Belief. By the as full Declaration of all the
neceſſary precepts of good life. By inculcating fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
and preſſing moſt emphatically thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
concerning Love, Peace, Unity, Good Order,
Humility, Meekneſs, Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> directly oppoſed to
thoſe contentions, in every Page of the New Teſtament:
Theſe it may ſuffice but to name.</p>
            <p>It will ſoon be granted, after the beſt proviſion of
Rules, and moſt convincing Arguments and Motives
to ſtrengthen them, that there will be need of ſome
Government to encourage all in their performance, to
reſtrain ſome from offering violence to them, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for many emergencies.</p>
            <p>Our Bleſſed Lord and Maſter, therefore, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſecurity of his Truth, and the ſafer conduct of
thoſe which adhere to it, eſtabliſh'd a Society or
Church in the World, which he purchaſed with the
moſt ineſtimable price, dignified with the higheſt Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
encouraged with the largeſt Promiſes, back'd
with the moſt ample Authority, and will always defend
with the ſtrongeſt Guard, againſt all Power, or Policy
on Earth or under the Earth; ſo that, as he hath told us,
<hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now where this Church is to be found, and
what are the meaſures of our Obligation to it, hath
been a long and great debate, eſpecially between <hi>us</hi> and
the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> In moſt of their late Controverſial
Books they have ſeemed ready to wave diſputes about
particular points, in hopes of greater advantage, which
they promiſe themſelves from this venerable name, and
that bold, though moſt falſe and preſumptuous claim
which they lay to the thing it ſelf, even excluſive to all
others; which will appear from the true, but ſhort and
plain ſtate of the caſe between us, the chief deſign of
this attempt.</p>
            <p>

Now that we may not charge them, nor they us

               <item>VI. To conſider the ſtrong obligations from hence
upon all ſorts of Diſſenters among us to embrace, and
continue in its Communion.</item>
               <item>I. The former will ſoon be diſpatcht, which I reduce
to the following particulars.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. That our Bleſſed Saviour always had, and always
will have a Church in the World, in which his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
hath been, and ſhall be ſo far profeſt, and his
Sacraments ſo effectually adminiſtred, that they who
rightly improve them may not want neceſſary ſupplies
for their preſent ſpiritual life, or future hopes of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
though the extent of the Church as to its boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries,
and the perfection of it in degrees may be vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
different at one time, and in one place from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This many <hi>Propheſies</hi> in the Old Teſtament,
and <hi>Promiſes</hi> from our Saviour in the New give abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
ground for our Faith to rely upon, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of all Ages hitherto hath confirmed.</p>
            <p>2. That this Chruch is a diſtinct Society within it
ſelf, furniſhed with ſufficient Authority in ſome to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
and Obligation in others to be Subject, neceſſary
to every Society; which the power of the Keys given
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64560:6"/>
by our Lord to receive in, or ſhut out, and the exer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciſe
of Diſcipline from Divine Precept, and Scripture
Examples evince beyond all exception. But then this
Eccleſiaſtical Power, in whomſoever placed, or ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to what height ſoever, can never extend to vacate,
or change the expreſs Inſtitutions of Chriſt, or take
away our Obligation to his revealed Truth, and direct
Commands. In caſe of any competition the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
may be ours, <hi>We muſt obey God rather than men.</hi>
And St. <hi>Pauls</hi> profeſſion, <hi>We can do nothing againſt the
Truth, but for the Truth.</hi> And again. <hi>If we or an Angel
from Heaven preach any other Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed,</hi>
Gal. 1. 8,</p>
            <p>3. This Church muſt be viſible, as every Society is
more or leſs, whoſe parts are ſo, and whoſe Profeſſion
muſt be ſo. Our entrance into it is in a viſible
manner by Baptiſmal Initiation. Our obliged Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with it is in diverſe outward ſenſible Acts,
which the repreſentation of it by a Body or Building
might prove. More clearly it is likened to a <hi>City on a
Hill, which cannot be hid,</hi> Mat. 5. 14. Set up as the
<hi>Light of the world,</hi> an Enſign to the Gentiles, which all
Nations ſhould flee unto, or elſe it would witneſs
againſt them; wherein its Followers ſhould take San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
and find a Refuge.</p>
            <p>4. Within theſe Boundaries we have the only hopes
of ſafety here and happineſs hereafter. What God may
do by his ſupereminent unaccountable power in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
caſe is preſumption for us but to inquire
into. Out of this Ark there is no proſpect given to us
of any eſcape from the Univerſal
Deluge.<note n="a" place="margin">S. Cyprian <hi>Ep. 60. p. 143. Ed.

            <p>5. This Church is but one. It is an Article of our

all; <hi>One Lord,</hi> and Head over all; <hi>One God</hi>
and Father of all; <hi>one Faith; one Baptiſm; one
Hope</hi> of our Calling in all, as the Apoſtle argues,
<hi>Eph. 4. 4, 5, 6, 7, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Now we are to enquire what are the chief Bands
of Unity in the Church which make, keep, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

within this Garden encloſed, this Spring ſhut up, this
Fountain ſealed, as the Ancients uſually apply that

            <p>1. This appears in the <hi>

but in the outward profeſſion of the ſame
Faith which was once delivered to the Saints, and
hath been generally preſerved, and continued down

whereof the moſt eminent Biſhops upon their firſt

whoſoever lies under any Cenſure in one Church, he

Now to prevent as much as may be all difficulties

there be ſome ſet Forms of publick Miniſtrations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it is hard for any to know before hand what

            <p>But then theſe Forms ſhould be as plain, and ſimple
as poſſible, with as little pretence as can be of any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the known Will, and Word of God. For no
Obligation whatſoever can tie me to communicate
with another in that which he forbids; and it will be
a great temptation to more than ſuſpect this danger,
when mens private opinions, or fanciful tranſports are
mingled with them, which have little ſhew of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
or the general practice of the Church in all Ages
to juſtifie them.</p>
            <p>The readieſt way I know of to prevent that hazard,
after all other care about the matters contained, is to
endeavour that theſe Offices be as near alike in all
places as can well be, yet every difference in Judgment,
when no violence is offered to the Foundation of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

not only invited the former to Communion with him,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64560:9"/>

as the words are generally interpreted; which St. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>

            <p>As to the Fourth of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Diſcipline,</hi> if Unity of
Government in all parts be not indiſpenſably neceſſary
to it, yet it will be ſo far, as not to abrogate, or invade
the poſitive Inſtitutions of our Saviour himſelf herein,
and be more than convenient, that it be as conformable,
as it is in our power to make it in one place, to what it
is in another. It ſeems horribly preſumptuous, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
to thruſt out of the Church that Government
under the influence of which Chriſtianity hath been
conveyed, and preſerved from the Age of the Apoſtles
in the moſt diſtant places, upon pretence of erecting a
new better Scheme or model of our own, or becauſe
of the intricate uſe of one or two terms in Scripture,
when the Church was in its firſt formation, though
againſt the plain current of it in other places, and the
uninterrupted tradition of the whole Church. A
Church indeed muſt be more or leſs perfect according
to its Government, for ſuitable will be the Exerciſe and
Authority of its Diſcipline. What allowance may be
made for thoſe, who deſire to come as near as they can
to the Primitive Pattern, though it be not in their
power to reach it in many conſiderable points, I am
not now to diſpute. But moſt inexcuſable, and highly
obnoxious are they, that by extreme violence, and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
endeavour to deſtroy what they found regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſtabliſhed to their hands.</p>
            <p>III. But we are here moſt concerned with the bold
claims of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> amidſt their moſt obvious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
who have made it the principal Band of Unity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64560:10"/>
in the Catholick Church to be ſubject to the See of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the pretended Vicar of Chriſt therein, as
the Univerſal Head, and Monarch of the Church:
this they have determined as <hi>de fide,</hi> and put into their
very Creed, and excluded all that do not expreſly own
it.</p>
            <p>But againſt this as a great breach of Chriſtian Unity
we have many juſt exceptions, and been always ready
to prove them ſo<note n="a" place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note>

any thing tending towards this, and

not diſowned, and condemned by the reſt of the
Church, unleſs from ſuch forged Writings, which they
themſelves will ſcarce now defend.</p>
            <p>3. In the following Ages we have as good Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from Hiſtory as almoſt in any other matter of fact,
by what ſteps, and in what manner this ſtill growing
power of the Church and Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> advanc'd it
ſelf to the height which it now claims.<note n="d" place="margin">See D. <hi>Caves</hi> diſſertation of ancient Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Dr. <hi>Parker</hi> of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church for the firſt 600 years.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. By Uſurpation upon the Rights of other Churches,
every degree of exaltation gained being the depreſſion
and diminution of them, till all power was in a manner
ſwallowed up by the Papal ambition, and none left to
any other, which was not dependant hereupon in its
original, and altogether precarious in its adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So that here alone it muſt be immediately derived
from Chriſt, but to all others by Commiſſion from him.
Thus in the choice of the chief Governours of the
Church all muſt await his conſent, and confirmation,
where he does not alone forcibly obtrude them, and
muſt pay for it a round ſum for an acknowledgment at
their entrance, and an after tributary Penſion out of
their income, and take a formal Oath of ſubjection at
their admittance, and own their own Authority from
his delegation, and be liable to have their Sentences
reverſed at his pleaſure, and flee as far as his Judicatory
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64560:11"/>
and ſtand to the trial of it, when he is pleaſed to call
any cauſe to himſelf. Nay, if a Controverſie ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and any Prince, or State, the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or Nation ſhalllie at once under his <hi>Interdict,</hi> the
Clergy be with-held from the exerciſe of their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the People from the benefit of Publick Divine
Worſhip and Sacraments. Of theſe and ſuch like
effects of the plenitude of Apoſtolick Power ſo much
talkt of lately, they would do well to ſhew us any
thing like a Plea from Scripture or Antiquity within
the bounds forementioned, or for ſome Ages after in
the greater part: certainly ſo great a change could not
be effected without ſome notice and complaints,
ſtruglings and contentions, of which Church Hiſtory
is full.</p>
            <p>Their early Faith ſpoken of throughout the world in
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time. The eminent Zeal of the firſt Biſhops
of that Church, moſt of whom, if we may credit the
account generally received of them, ſealed to the former
with their bloud. Their continued conſtancy in the
Orthodox Profeſſion thereof amidſt the corruptions or
defections of ſo many others, particularly in the time
of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Perſecution. The concurrent opinion
of the Foundation of their Church being laid by the
two chief Apoſtles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Imperial Seat wherein they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> gave them great repute, and advantagious
recommendation in thoſe firſt Ages. None will much
contend with them about priority of Order or Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
But when the preheminence of the firſt
Biſhop came to be improved into a <hi>Patriarchate,</hi> and
that ſwelled into the Title of the Univerſal Biſhop,
which<note n="a" place="margin">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64560:11"/>
Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that at laſt grew into the
ſtile of the <hi>ſole Vicar of Chriſt,</hi> and Soveraign Monarch
of the whole Church: when the interpoſition of a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Brotherly Arbitration, which all perſons in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
or under the apprehenſions of injury are apt to
flee unto, and amplifie, made way by degrees for the
challenge of an ordinary Juriſdiction, and that at firſt
from the pretence of <hi>Canonical priviledge</hi> to that <hi>Divine
Right</hi> and Sanction, and then to prevent all ſcruple
about its determinations theſe muſt be back'd with
the vindication of an infallible conduct: When inſtead
of that charitable ſupport they at firſt readily beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on other Churches in their diſtreſs, they now made
uſe of this power to rob them of what was left, taking
the advantage of the poverty, and oppreſſion of ſome
under the Common Enemy, or the confuſion of others
through Domeſtick diſtractions, to raiſe themſelves out
of their ſpoils; then no wonder if other Churches
complain, and ſtruggle under that yoke, which they
could not preſently, or eaſily throw off.</p>
            <p>Indeed, had not this claim of the Church and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> riſen to ſuch an extravagant height in the
arrogance of its pretended Title, and been ſtreined
to that exceſs in the exerciſe of its aſſumed Authority;
ſo as not to leave it in the power of other Churches to
take all due and neceſſary care of their own members,
or provide for them all needful ſupplies, theſe might
more eaſily have born their uſurpation of more power
than ever they could prove belonged to them. They
that have learnt the Humility of Chriſts School, and
who are more concern'd to perform their Duty than
vindicate their Privilege, and know how much ſafer it
is to obey than command, and eaſier to be Governed
than to Govern, will not be much moved at what
others fondly aſſume, knowing ſtill that the more
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64560:12"/>
difficult account awaits them. But then this Power
became moſt intolerable when it was made uſe of to
purpoſes ſo much worſe than it ſelf, which were beſide
the former;</p>
            <p>2. The weakning of the power of Temporal Princes,
and diſturbing the Civil Rights of men.<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cracanthorp's</hi> defence of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and againſt the Popès temporal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</note> Although
our bleſſed Saviour aſſured <hi>Pilate his Kingdom was not
of this world,</hi> yet his pretended Vicar here on earth can
hardly ſay ſo: for beſide the Temporal Dominions
unto which he hath entitled himſelf a Sovereign
Prince, there are few other Kingdoms, or States on
this ſide of the world in which he hath not, or had
not almoſt as great a ſhare of the Government, as their
immediate Princes; at leaſt ſo far as to preſcribe
bounds to their Adminiſtrations, and ſubject in great
meaſure all Laws, and perſons to his Foreign Courts,
Juriſdiction, and Decrees, yea, their Purſes to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions;
and upon the leaſt diſpute hath withdrawn
ſo great a number of his immediate dependants, who
ſcarce own any other Governours, and raiſed ſo many
diſturbances, that great Princes and States have been
forced at laſt to yield. Not to mention the Arrogance
it at length grew up unto in dethroning Princes, giving
their Kingdoms to others, authorizing their Subjects
to rebel againſt them, or all ways to oppoſe them, and
what oft follows, if not expreſſed, to murder them:
as in their late Sentence againſt ſome of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Princes.</p>
            <p>But before, much of this may be ſeen in the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
between ſome of the Weſtern Emperours,
particularly <hi>Henry the Third,</hi> and <hi>Fourth,</hi> and the
Popes, as we have them deſcribed in their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sigonius de regno Italiae,</hi> and all other Hiſtorians of that time.</note> Alſo to go no father, their various Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
with ſeveral of our Kings, eſpecially <hi>Henry the
Second</hi> and the almoſt continual complaints in all our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64560:12"/>
Parliaments before the Reformation of the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
made by them upon the Civil Rights of Prince
and Subject by vexatious and chargeable Suits and
Appeals as far as <hi>Rome;</hi> by Inſolencies and divers Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
committed under the ſhelter of their protection,
and defended from due puniſhment, and by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Extortions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> abundantly prove.</p>
            <p>Now though theſe Uſurpations grew by degrees,
and were practiſed in a different manner according to
the condition of thoſe they had to do with, or the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of him that managed them; yet they muſt needs
ſeem more or leſs grievous to all, when power ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
was not left to the greateſt Monarchs to defend
themſelves, or protect their Subjects, preſerve the
peace, or promote the welfare, and provide for the
ſecurity of their own Countries. Then no marvel if
ſome of them grow weary of ſo inſupportable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
and at laſt take courage to grapple with, and
extricate themſelves from ſuch manifeſt encroachments
upon their own, and the Peoples Civil Rights, as well
as the Eccleſiaſtical of the Church in their Dominions,
and be forced to ſome harſh and almoſt violent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
when the more gentle and benign could prevail
nothing.</p>
            <p>3. But beſide theſe more publick Invaſions upon
Church and State, that which made the Uſurpation
more odious and inſufferable was the farther abuſe of
the ſame extravagant power to bring in ſtrange and
dangerous Doctrines, corrupt, and unlawful practices
into the Church, and impoſe them upon all in their
Communion, exactly fitted to feed their Ambition, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
their Coffers, ſecure their Authority, and promote
their eaſe and Luxury. Such of the <hi>firſt ſort</hi> are their
Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and Purgatory, of
Merit, and Supererogation, the multiplicity of Vows,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64560:13"/>
and deluſions in the Principles of Repentance, and
miniſtration of Penance. Of the <hi>latter ſort</hi> are the
Invocation of Saints and Angels, Adoration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
and Images, their half Communion, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
lockt up, and Divine Service performed in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and divers like them have proved great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
abroad, and ſtumbling blocks at home, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
varniſh they may put upon them by the faireſt
pretences, or however they may caſt a miſt before the
eyes of their Diſciples by nice diſtinctions, yet they
have ſo disfigured the face of Chriſtianity, that he who
compares the late appearances of it in the world with
the model of it laid down in Scripture, or the Records
of the Primitive Church, can hardly believe it the ſame
thing.</p>
            <p>But the particulars are not here to be diſputed, they
have ſufficiently been confuted. and expoſed by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Writers, and were by ſeveral before excepted
againſt, and diſclaimed, though ſome ſuffered ſeverely
for ſo doing, and many more we may ſuppoſe waited
an opportunity to free themſelves from their preſſure.
That which I am now moſt to inſiſt upon is this, that
if the charge we draw up againſt theſe of falſhood in
judgment, groſs Superſtition or Idolatry in Worſhip,
and immorality in manners, be true and impartial, as
we have been ever ready to make good, and ſhall do
againſt all the Artifices of the Defendants; Then no
Authority whatever, however regularly founded, or
unexceptionably conveyed, can oblige us to theſe, againſt
the revealed Will, or Word of God, the Dictates of
our Conſciences, as we hope carefully, and rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
the ſenſe and reaſon of mankind, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and practice of the Church in the firſt and pureſt
Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64560:13"/>
Greater cauſe was there to endeavour by all lawful
means to throw off ſuch an uſurped Power, that made
ſo ill uſe of what it had unjuſtly gotten, and to reſtore
Religion to its primitive beauty in Doctrine, Worſhip,
and Precepts of Life.</p>
            <p>But alas many difficulties lay in the way of its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment,
and all poſſible ſtruglings, and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by force and policy were uſed by the adverſe Party
to prevent its beginning, or obſtruct it Progreſs. Great
was their Intereſt in overy place; Strong was the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
they had upon perſons in Authority; Numerous
were their Aſſiſtants and Dependants at home and
abroad; Weighty was their concern which lay at ſtake,
and many were the advantages which they had of any
that oppoſed them: So that no wonder if a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo long wiſht for, and much wanted were ſo ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
effected. It is rather more ſtrange that in ſo many
places it did maſter theſe and ſuch like encumbrances,
and in ſo ſhort a time made ſo conſiderable a progreſs.
If in ſome places it proceeded with leſs Order, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
and Calmneſs than could have been wiſht for
in a Religious Reformation, Neceſſity in part, with
many perplexed difficulties and encumbrances, may
in ſome meaſure excuſe what no Law before-hand fully
warrants.</p>
            <p>IV. But leaving others to anſwer for themſelves, in
my next particular I am to conſider how regularly, and
ſedately it proceeded in the Church of <hi>Engiand</hi> within
the bounds of Catholick Unity.</p>
            <p>1. With the concurrence, and encouragement all
along of the Supreme Power to free it from any but
ſuſpicion of Rebellion. So it began at firſt with the
breaking of the Papal yoke of Supremacy, the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bible, and ſome like preparatives to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
under <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> and the united
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64560:14"/>
Suffrages of his Parliaments, and the Biſhops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
therein. It proceeded ſuitably to a further em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
in moſt particulars under his Son <hi>Edward
the Sixth.</hi> And at laſt it came to its full ſettlement and
eſtabliſhment under <hi>Queen Elizabeth.</hi> The beginning
and carrying on of the Reformation here was by ſuch
loyalty of Principles, and Practices that we challenge
any Church in the World to a Compariſon therein.
Indeed this was ſo notorious, that her Roman Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
have turned her Glory into a Reproach by up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding
her, though moſt invidiouſly, with the name of
a <hi>Parliamentary Religion;</hi> becauſe it received all along
ſo much countenance and aſſiſtance from thoſe great
Aſſemblies of all the three Eſtates of the Kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Head and Sovereign.</p>
            <p>2. But farther to clear her of all juſt imputation from
hence, it muſt be added that the whole work was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with the advice, and mature deliberation
of the Clergy aſſembled in Convocation, repreſenting
the intire body of them, and therein a National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
That they from their Education, and preſumed
Knowledge, as well as from their Office, and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Anthority are ordinarily fitteſt to judge, debate,
and determine of Religious matters, will be ſoon
granted: But that the Civil Power may, and ought
ſometimes to remind them of their Duty, and reſtrain
them from groſs Defections from it, may be proved by
ſeveral Scripture Examples in the Old Teſtament, and
the Supereminence of their place. But happy is that
Order and Unity in which both Powers are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for the ſervice of God, the ſecurity of his
Church, and promotion of his true Religion, as it
was here: though it could not be expected but the
firſt attempts would meet with ſeveral difficulties, fierce
Debates, and Controverſies, yet ſtill the entire eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64560:14"/>
was ratified by the regular determination of
the Clergy ſo aſſembled as before, as well as was after
confirmed by the Royal Aſſent.</p>
            <p>3. Yet farther to juſtifie themſelves from any affected
innovation in ſuch a change, all was done with the
greateſt Reverence, Reſpect, and Deference to the
Ancient Church to clear their continued Unity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
            <p>1. In <hi>Doctrine.</hi> The ancient Creeds were taken for
the foundation of its Confeſſion, the four firſt General
Councils are received with great
Veneration, and a particular<note n="a" place="margin">In libro Canonum in Synodo Londi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſi, <hi>an.</hi> 1571. titulo de Concionatoribus. Imprimis videbunt ne quid unquam do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceant pro conciont, quod à populo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gioſè teneri, &amp; credi velint, niſi quod conſentaneum ſit doctrinae Veteris &amp; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi teſtamenti, quodque ex illa ipſa doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Catholici Patres, &amp; veteres Epiſcopi collegerint.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
was laid upon its Miniſters
to preſs upon none the neceſſary
belief of any Doctrine, but what
may be proved from Scripture, and
the general current of the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Fathers thereupon.
So careful it hath been in all points to keep within the
bounds of Catholick Principles, in thoſe firſt inſtilled
into its young Diſciples in the Catechiſm, and in
thoſe delivered in its Articles to be ſubſcribed by
ſuch to whom it entruſts any Office, that the <hi>poſitive
part</hi> of them will hardly be diſowned by our very Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
and can ſcarce appear otherwiſe to any, than
the common Faith of all Chriſtians of Orthodox repute
in all Ages. And for other determinations in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi>
ſhe only declares thereby how little concerned
ſhe is to receive or own the falſe or corrupt additions
to the firſt unalterable Rule. No Church hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
and evidenced a more awful and tender regard to
Antiquity next to the expreſs Word of God. Both
which ſhe oft appeals to, deſires to be ruled by; and
where their footſteps are not ſufficiently clear, chooſes
not to impoſe upon her own Children, nor cenſure her
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64560:15"/>
Neighbours; keeps within the moſt ſafe, and modeſt
boundaries; is not forward in determining nice and
intricate diſputes, which have perplexed and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many in their haſty and bold Poſitions, particularly
about the Divine Decrees, and ſuch like ſublime Points,
In which few underſtand where the main ſtreſs of the
Controverſie lies; It may be non can comprehend
the depth of the matters upon which the Deciſion
ought to be grounded. But alas how many have been
forward to lay down, and fiercely contend for, on each
ſide, their private opinions herein as the firſt Rudiments
of Theology, to be placed in their very Creeds or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſms,
and ſo a foundation muſt be laid for endleſs
Conteſts and Diviſions? But moſt cautious hath our
Church been in not laying ſuch occaſions to fall in
the way of any: So that both ſorts of Adverſaries
have made their complaints againſt her for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more poſitive, and particularly in ſuch Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though none can charge her juſtly with defect
in any point of Faith ſo own'd in the beſt Ages of the
Church.</p>
            <p>2. As clear, and unexceptionable hath been her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in <hi>Church Government,</hi> preſerving that form,
which from all Teſtimonies of Antiquity hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Church from the very Apoſtles, under the
conduct, and happy Influence of which Chriſtianity
hath been propagated, and continued throughout the
world, whatever different meaſures ſome other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches have taken, whether forced by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
or ſwayed by particular inclination, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.
The Church of <hi>England</hi> kept up the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
received diſtinct prime Orders of <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts,</hi>
and <hi>Deacons:</hi> not deſiring to cenſure others, who can
beſt anſwer for themſelves, but endeavouring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
her ſelf to what was moſt Canonical, and Regular,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64560:15"/>
and to ſhew how little affected ſhe was to alteration
from any eſtabliſhment, except in notorious corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and abuſes: And how neceſſary ſhe thought due
Order and Subordination in the Church to prevent
Schiſms and Hereſies, and to give the greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and advantage to her Miniſtrations; and finally
to free her ſelf from all ſuſpicion of irregularity in her
Succeſſion, derived down from Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
which ſhe, as much as any Church in the World, may
pretend unto. And though ſome intermediate Ages
have been blemiſhed with much degeneracy, yet ſhe
was concerned only to ſeparate this, but retain, and
convey down to others whatſoever good and wholſom
proviſion ſhe received from thoſe before.</p>
            <p>Farther, to evince this, particular care was taken by
expreſs Law <hi>(a)</hi> to confirm the Rules of Government,<note place="margin">* See the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 25 of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Eighth,</hi> cap. 19. Sect. 7. expreſly revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved 1 <hi>Eliz,</hi> c. 1. ſect. 6.</note>
or <hi>Canon Law</hi> before received in the Church till ſome
better proviſion could be made ſo far as it contradicts
not the Law of the Land, or the Word of God; making
as few changes in the outward face of the Church as
was poſſible, and ſenſibly proving it her deſign pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perly
not to deſtroy, but build, nor yet therein to erect
a new, but reform an old Church.</p>
            <p>3. Alike Canonical, and orderly hath been her
Conſtitution in matters of <hi>Worſhip.</hi> Her Forms of
Prayer and Praiſe with the whole order of her Liturgy
are compoſed with the greateſt temper, and expreſſed
in the moſt plain and comprehenſive terms to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
uniform Devotion, pious Affection, the moſt
Orthodox Profeſſion, and Catholick Communion. So
that I think it may be univerſally affirmed, that there is
not any thing required in her publick Service neceſſary
to thoſe who communicate with her, which any that
own the name of Chriſtians, or are own'd for ſuch by
the general body of them, can almoſt ſcruple: unleſs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64560:16"/>
becauſe it is a <hi>Form,</hi> by one ſort, and becauſe it
is <hi>ours</hi> by another ſort. But how unreaſonable herein
are both? So careful ſhe hath been to lay the ground
of moſt Catholick Unity, and to remove whatever
might obſtruct it.</p>
            <p>This our Adverſaries the Romaniſts confirmed by
their own practice, when for ſeveral years, as we have
been told<note n="a" place="margin">Camdeni Eliz. <hi>an.</hi> 1570.</note> in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
Reign, they frequented our Churches, joyn'd in our
Prayers and Praiſes, attended on our Sermons and
other Inſtructions, and received (as ſome add) our

            <p>Our Reformers who compoſed our <hi>Liturgy</hi> carefully
collected the remainders of true Primitive Devotion
then in uſe, and ſeparated from them all thoſe corrupt
additions, which ignorance, ſuperſtition, and crafty
policy had mixed therewith. Therefore it is ſo far
from being an objection, that any part of our Liturgy
was tranſlated from the Roman Offices, that while no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is retained contrary to wholſom Doctrine, and
ſound Piety, it is a convincing argument of her impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Sincerity, and deſire to preſerve Uniformity, as
much as poſſible, with all Chriſtians abroad, as well as
at home in her own Members: ſecuring all the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials

            <p>Thus abundantly hath the Church of <hi>England</hi> vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated

            <p>But if after the confuſions, and diſorders of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Centuries, amidſt ſuch a depraved ſtate by corrupt
manners, diverſities of opinion, and perplext In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
ſo great a happineſs be not to be hoped for

clear themſelves before God, and all good men, that
do what is in their power towards it, and pray to
Him to amend what they cannot change, and in the
mean time make the beſt uſe of what means they
enjoy.</p>
            <p>Upon which Premiſes an eaſie Solution is given to
the old cavilling queſtion, Where was your Church
before the Reformation, or that time?</p>
            <p>We anſwer, Juſt where it is: Thereby no new Church
was ſet up; no new Articles of Faith brought in; no
new Sacraments; no new order of Prieſthood to miniſter
in holy things: all which would have indeed required
new Miracles, and a new immediate Authority from
Heaven ſo atteſted: only the old were purged from
impurities in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Practice, which,
in paſſing through ſo many degenerate Ages, they had
contracted, and that an ordinary Power might ſuffice
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64560:17"/>
to do. If we were in the Catholick Church before,
we are ſo ſtill, and hope, to better purpoſe. We are
not therefore out of it, becauſe their raſh Cenſures
have excluded us and then they unreaſonably take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to argue againſt us from their own act: We
never formally ſhut them out what ever they have
done to us.</p>
            <p>What degrees of corruption in Faith or Manners
may be conſiſtent with the bare being of a Church, or
the poſſibility of ſalvation therein, is needleſs and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
for us nicely to enquire: it may be impoſſible
for us to know. I am ſure it is moſt ſafe for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what we know to be amiſs, and to leave thoſe
who do not, to ſtand or fall by their own Maſter. It
is a very ill requital of our Charity if it be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a weapon of offence to wound, or ſlay us, by that by
which we ſhewed our deſire of their Cure. But they and
we muſt ſtand another trial, and await a final infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sentence, which ours here cannot change. The
beſt ſecurity that we know to meet it with comfort will
be to uſe the moſt ſtrict impartiality with our ſelves,
and the greateſt Charity to others.</p>
            <p>Yet our Adverſaries glory in nothing more than in
the name of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and boaſt in no Title
ſo much as that of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which hath had deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo great veneration in all Antiquity.</p>
            <p>But their claim here truly examined will prove as
fallacious and arrogant as in any other inſtance. For
the term <hi>Catholick</hi> if we reſpect the notation of the
word, or the moſt conſtant uſe of it, is the ſame as

oppoſed to them who went about
to ſhut it up within their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

therein too cloſely imitated by our
Adverſaries, who, in ſpite of name

about the Catholick as about the
Roman Church, and are as free in
their ſevereſt cenſures of all others,
and as haughty in what they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume

were, though not proceeding

that holy Father every where preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
upon them reacheth as nearly
our Antagoniſts; the indiſpenſable
neceſſity of Charity, that great bond of Unity in the
Church, and principal evidence of the Divine Spirit,
which animates the whole, without which the higheſt
gifts, and moſt Sacred Miniſtrations are rendred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.
This is one of the prime Characteriſtick
notes of the true Catholick Church, and every living
Member thereof, and nothing is more oppoſite to their
Principles and Practices, who have formally excluded
all other Chriſtians and Churches from any ſhare
therein, not only thoſe in the Weſt, that have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly

God himſelf hath made, not aſſuming any Authority
to command, yea, or to paſs haſty judgment upon any,
but only to provide for her own the beſt ſhe can, and
with ſuch tender regard to common Chriſtianity, and
the Rights of all other Churches, that ſhe ſeems de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly

in Scripture, and received in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Ages for more than five hundred years. No
Principles having been ſo formally declared then, and
for ſome time after, as the Catholick Faith of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and as ſuch neceſſary to be own'd, which ſhe
rejects: whatever private opinions there might be then
among ſome eminent Doctors of the Church in which
they oft differed one from the other, or although there
might be ſome obſervances then generally received
which ſhe thinks her ſelf not bound to retain.</p>
            <p>But ill will this Character agree to the Romaniſts,
who have added ſo many new dangerous Articles to
the common Faith of Chriſtians, not only beſide the
original Rule, which they cannot but own with us, but
too often againſt it, and the profeſſed belief of the firſt,
and beſt Ages of the Church. Wherefore we reject
not theſe innovations meerly from negative arguments,
becauſe not ſufficiently proved; (and yet that way of
arguing hath been always allowed in the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of Faith, which muſt be grounded upon expreſs
Divine Authority and Teſtimony.) But we lay the
greateſt ſtreſs of our averſations to them upon that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
oppoſition, which we undertake to prove moſt of
them have to the common Faith, and revealed Will of
God which they and we both own. And ſurely that
Church in this acceptaion is moſt <hi>Catholick,</hi> that relies
on ſuch Catholick Principles, and refers all others to be

way fit to be anſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. They urge againſt us that we reject ſeveral
Doctrines ſince formally determined in the Church by
the known and received Authority thereof in Councils
more general, or particular, which they pretend were
believed through all Ages, but then eſtabliſhed when
they came firſt to be called in queſtion.</p>

            <p>2. We appeal alſo to the Primitive, and beſt Ages of
Chriſtianity which either knew nothing of theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
that we can find, or ſometimes give as expreſs
declarations againſt them, as could be expected at this
diſtance. But to take off much of the ſtrangeneſs of ſo
harſh an imputation at firſt ſight, wherewith we charge
a great part of the Church for a conſiderable time, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64560:20"/>
that they and we may be leſs ſcandaliz'd at the firſt
mention of theſe defections,</p>
            <p>3. We may conſider the various Cautions in the New
Teſtament againſt corrupt Doctrines, and Manners,
which at the leaſt in general are foretold would creep
into the Church, if ſome of them we now charge be
not particularly deſcribed therein.</p>
            <p>4. We may compare matter of fact with the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the like degeneracy of the Jewiſh Church in
various inſtances ſo nearly reſembling theſe as nothing
more, and from the ſame plea of Oral Tradition, yet
againſt as clear evidence, and as emphatical promiſes to
preſerve them from Apoſtacy as any particular Church
at leaſt can now pretend to.</p>
            <p>5. We may conſult the tendency of lapſt mankind,
In the beſt how weak it is, and apt to be impoſed on;
In others how prone to corrupt, and diſtort the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
caſt a miſt before the cleare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t diſcoveries,
and offer violence unto the ſtrongeſt convictions to
ſhelter their vices, and promote their unwarrantable
intereſts, eſpecially in times of eaſe, plenty, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
proſperity. In which we may compare common
experience in leſſer Societies, which however wiſely
directed at firſt, regularly founded, and ſtrongly
guarded on all ſides, without a very careful Inſpection,
and ſometimes vigorus oppoſition, ſo many corruptions
will creep in as to need frequent reformations to reduce
them back to their primitive Conſtitution. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
an eſpecial providence be concerned for the
guard and conduct of Gods Church, yet neither Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
or experience warrant us to expect its happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
by miracles now, for the effecting of that
which may be accompliſhed by the uſe of ordinary and
regular means of his own appointment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64560:20"/>
6. We may reflect upon the particular Ages of the
Church, which we charge eſpecially with theſe deſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
from about the eighth Century to the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein if all or moſt of them did not come in,
yet they grew to that extravagant heighth, as to gain
eſtabliſhment for Principles of Chriſtianity. Theſe
Ages are charged by their own Authors, as well as
ours, and ſtand moſt ſenſibly convict of the groſſeſt
Barbariſm, Stupidity, Ignorance, depraved Manners,
and all ſuch corrupt Inclinations in all Orders and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
eſpecially the ruling part, as were moſt likely to
make way for ſuch Changes, and Innovations.</p>
            <p>7. We have ſome farther ſenſible proof of a deſign
in many within that time to impoſe upon the credulity
of others, and bring in ſtrange Doctrines, and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
Practices, by the many Fabulous Stories,
feigned Apparitions, and Revelations, ſeveral of which
they themſelves will hardly now defend, then brought
into the Church to confirm theſe points in difference,
and which almoſt only the people then received for
their Inſtructions, to entice them firſt into an awful
opinion of, and then a confident reliance upon theſe
things.</p>
            <p>Nay farther, among the many ſpurious Writings
which then crept into the world under the moſt vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
names of the renowned Fathers of the Church,
now moſtly diſcarded by themſelves, when their
ſhameleſs Impudence hath been ſo fully expoſed, yet
few of them there are in which this contrivance is not
legible throughout to advance theſe Opinions, and
Practices. So that we are indebted to the Reformation,
thoſe great men which laboured in it, and ſome of the
moſt moderate and learned of their own ſide, with the
Art of Printing then but newly found out, that almoſt

Authority, which would have been much endangered
among ſuch groſs depravers of Antiquity, whoſe conſtant
buſineſs it was to mar good Authors by their Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
Additions, or Subſtractions: or vent new ones
under counterfeit old names to ſerve their corrupt ends.
But we are ſomewhat beholden to their ignorance,
and ſtupidity, for doing it ſo groſly that there was need
of little skill or obſervation to diſcover their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures.</p>
            <p>8. To which may be added in the laſt place againſt
the ſuppoſed preſumption in private perſons, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches to judge of publick Eſtabliſhments by
a ſeeming Superiour Authority: that without ſome
judgment of diſcretion in the former there is no room
for a proper Moral Act, much leſs are they capable of
a truly Religious Obligation, which an abſolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
faith perfectly deſtroys. But whilſt every man
is bound to prove his own work, and muſt bear his
own burden, he muſt examine the grounds of his
aſſent according to his capacity, and determine himſelf
by the beſt motives he can procure, and is concerned
at his utmoſt peril to do it with all due reſpect to the
Authority and Judgment of his Superiours, as well
as the evidence of the things themſelves, which
are no where in any Government beſide thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations duly weighed may obviate
thoſe firſt prejudices which uſually lie in the way to
intercept all thoughts of farther trial, and examination
of particular Points in controverſie, and may ſilence
or ſhame the late idle vaunts of ſuch who pretend to
reaſon us out of our ſenſes, and undertake to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
it <hi>à priori</hi> impoſſible that ever any falſe opinion
ſhould get into the Church, or prevail therein. I wiſh
theſe men would try their pains, and ſubtilty to prove
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64560:21"/>
it impoſſible there could be any ſuch thing as wilful ſin
in the world. I preſume they might have as good To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks
to pretend to it from all convictions of Reaſon or
Intereſt. But after the moſt artificial compoſures here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they would hardly believe themſelves, or be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by others againſt their experience. It were well
if they might prevail to make that leſs frequent which
all muſt own ſo unreaſonable in it ſelf, and deſtructive
to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But our Adverſaries will yet urge upon us,
that ſuppoſing, not granting ſuch a degeneracy in the
Church, and need of Reformation: yet this ſhould
have been done in order to preſerve <hi>Catholick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> by
common conſent in a general Council, and with moſt
mature deliberation, and conſultation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This was moſt earneſtly deſired, and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
on by the firſt Reformers, witneſs the great
Importunities of <hi>Charles the Fifth</hi> with the Pope upon
their inſtance.</p>
            <p>2. When this ſeemingly prevailed, and a pretended
Council was called, it was far from being free or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
The Italian, and meer titular Biſhops out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbred
all the reſt, and both one and the other were
overawed by the Popes immediate Dependants or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates,
and all things carried by ſuch ſtratagems of
Policy, or partiality of Intereſt that the only care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
was to fix the diſeaſe, and not provide for the cure
by the beſt account we have of thoſe tranſactions: So
that ſome Princes of their own Communion entred
their Proteſtations againſt its proceedings, diſowning
any Obligation to be tied up to their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>3. As the divided ſtate of Chriſtendom now ſtands,
it is rather to be wiſh'd for, than ſuppoſed almoſt
poſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64560:22"/>
From the different Intereſts and inclinations of
Princes, who will hardly agree together in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
place, or time of meeting, or about the perſons
who are to reſort to it from their ſeveral Dominions.
While the Roman Empire was intire, the Emperours
Edict alone was Summons ſufficient to almoſt the
whole Chriſtian Church. But now who ſhall take
upon him to call or invite ſo many from ſo diſtant
places no way under his Authority? And that the
Pope ever pretended to this power till of late can ſcarce
be pleaded againſt ſuch clear Evidences, and Examples;
and where he is ſo much concerned, it will be judged
more unreaſonable for him to demand it. If this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
were overcome by any conſent, or condeſcenſion:
yet ſo many jealouſies, and croſs intereſts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
that will be, and have been laid in the way of
their firſt meeting together with a requiſite peaceable
diſpoſition, as are not eaſily foreſeen, and leſs readily

            <p>No Chriſtian, or Church is chargeable with the lack
of that which it is not in their power to procure. Men
may pleaſe themſelves with remote Speculations, and

way accountable; if what they did in the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as ſuch, were good, and they had ſufficient Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for doing it, which we are ready to maintain, that
is all ſhe is reſponſible for, were other imputations
really true, which they oft are not: However it will
be an endleſs diſpute, and if determined would add
little to the cauſe. I may add, few great and publick
Changes are brought about, where ſo many intereſts
are concerned either way to promote, or hinder them
in which all things are carried with that clearneſs and
evenneſs that were to be deſired. Private Perſons are
not chargeable, with the ſuppoſed defects of publick
Adminiſtrations, of which they have not the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
if nothing be required of them againſt their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Duty, and they be provided of all neceſſary
means of their Salvation, though they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to wiſh ſome things had been ordered other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Our Enemies on both ſides are apt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to us the want of due Diſcipline, if not abſolutely
neceſſary to the being of the Church, yet ſo far uſeful
to the well being, and perfection of it, that it ought
to have great weight in determining our choice to
one Communion before another, and is one of the moſt
ſenſible bands of Unity in the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The reſtauration of the Primitive Vigour
of this hath been always wiſh'd for by our Church, as
in the Preface to the Commination, but the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
is very difficult.</p>
            <p>From the degeneracy of the Age, which would
hardly bear it. He that Governs in a leſs Sphere will
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64560:24"/>
find how oft he muſt bear with things, which he
does not approve: and much eaſier it is to find fault
with, than to amend what ſometimes we know to be
amiſs.</p>
            <p>From the multiplicity of Diviſions, which weaken
all endeavours towards it, and then froward men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
charge the Church with what they themſelves
make almoſt unavoidable: whereas, if executed, it
would reach themſelves as nearly as any who are now
ſo clamorous againſt the moſt tender, and charitable
endeavours towards it as cruel and inhumane.</p>
            <p>2. The Pretences, to it in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to general practice, ſo far as it can appear to
us; and we can judge by nothing elſe, are more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than any of theſe Omiſſions, when turn'd into a
conſtant circle of ſinning, private Confeſſion, and
Prieſtly Abſolution upon the impoſition of very inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
Penance, and ſo over again. For hereby men
have the Authority of their Church to confirm in
them the dangerous preſumption that they have thus
readily cleared themſelves before God, and ſo ſoon
perfected their Repentance for ſuch Sins, which we
find them not ſo watchful againſt afterward, as that
ought to ſuppoſe, or make them.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Church of <hi>England</hi> commends private
Confeſſion for our clearer ſatisfaction, and direction
in difficult caſes as moſt needful: but cannot truly ſay
that it is an indiſpenſable condition of our pardon,
which was never ſo believed, or practiſed in the Church
for many Centuries. If people will not be perſuaded
to their Priviledge, unleſs they be forced to it by falſe
denunciations, they muſt look to that; if they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
it lies at their own door, while they have no
hopes here given them of pardon, but upon ſuch an
intire Repentance as deſtroys the habit of ſin, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64560:24"/>
plants the contrary Grace; and what need they may
have of the Aſſiſtance of a Spiritual Guide, and other
helps in many Caſes in order to this effect, they may
beſt conſider.</p>
            <p>3. However the due adminiſtration of Diſcipline is
to be placed among conveniencies, and advantages to
be wiſh'd for, rather than neceſſaries we cannot be
without; and it hath been, and will be in all Ages of
the Church more or leſs perfect according to a great
many contingencies not to be ſtated before hand. The
Church hath ever judg'd it the beſt meaſure of uſing it
ſo as may moſt ſerve the ends of Religion, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
benefit of the Community, and not that ſhe is bound
always up to the ſtrict merit of the perſons falling
under it; and yet after all the ſtricteſt care, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
there will be room for the final Separation, when
our Lord ſhall ſend his Angels to gather out of his own
Kingdom all offences, and them which do iniquity. If
we will ſhun all communication with theſe, though
only in what is good, we muſt flee out of any Church
that ever yet was, or will be, ſo far as we know, in
this World, and ſo from any hopes in that to come:
yet ſcarce any conſiderable Schiſm hath appeared in
the Church, which did not ſhelter it ſelf under this
pretence.</p>
            <p>4. Farther it may be alledged that ſeveral reſtraints
may be upon the Church from the Civil Power. When
this had ſuffered ſo much by former Encroachments,
and Uſurpations no wonder if it ſtill retain ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
of that Yoke which with ſo much difficulty it
caſt off, and provide as ſecurely as it can for its future
preſervation, though by ſuſpending ſome of that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
aſſiſtance very conduceable to the due effect of
Church Cenſures, and ſometimes by putting a ſtop to
their ſenſible progreſs, in ſome caſes where no ſuch
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64560:25"/>
danger or neceſſity required it. Men by miſtakes, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
may ſtrein each power too far. Better experience
of the Regular management of the Eccleſiaſtical, may in
due time encourage the Secular farther to enlarge their
Liberty, and encourage their orderly proceedings ſo as
may be moſt ſubſervient to the ends of true Religion,
and the advancement of the common ſecurity of Church
and State. All the power which the Church pretends to
as ſuch is ſpiritual, and that can make no alteration in
the Civil Rights of men.</p>
            <p>5. Yet after all, the Church amongſt us hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſufficient Authority committed to her by Chriſt;
but reſerved, and countenanced by the Laws of the
Land to teſtifie her Abhorrence of all notorious Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
to the ſhame, and confuſion of groſs Offenders,
and as a direful earneſt of a worſe doom that awaits
them hereafter, not here prevented by a ſatisfactory
Repentance. I need not refer to particular inſtances
when we have frequent examples thereof. If this be
not always exerciſed by thoſe with whom it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with all due vigour, and ſincerity, after juſt
abatement for neceſſity, and a favourable allowance
for ſuch perplext difficulties, of which ſcarce any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſon can make a fair and competent judgment,
the fault will lie only at their doors whoſe is the
neglect, and private Chriſtians ſhall not fare the worſe
in the performance of their duty, nor fail of the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
effects of the ordinary means of Grace by Gods
own appointment, becauſe every publick miniſtration
is not performed with that Religious care which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
ſuch concerns.</p>
            <p>6. Little pretence can they have from this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that deſert the Eſtabliſht National Church, and that
moſt advantagious outward Bond of Unity therein, in
purſuit of private Aſſemblies, and ſelect Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64560:25"/>
where all Acts of Diſcipline muſt needs be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Arbitrary on one ſide, and precarious on the
other. When he or they who inflict them own no
power over them to aw, or direct their proceedings,
or upon juſt occaſion to reverſe their Sentence; nor
he who falls under them has any other engagement
to ſubmiſſion than his own free Act, nor can ſuffer
any farther prejudice without it, than to be forced
it may be to change his Company, or place of meeting.
What ever grave, and ſolemn appearance this may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at the firſt ſetting up of ſuch a new Government,
it will ſoon degenerate into Mockery, or Confuſion.
Whatſoever deſtroys the Unity of the Church over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
the main ſtrength, and Foundation of all Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
the defects hereof we may hope to ſee repaired
with the preſervation of that, but without that no
proſpect appears of any overtures towards it.</p>
            <p>7. To which may be added in the laſt place, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
want of Diſcipline any may lay to the charge of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> none can complain of her
breach of that Unity therein, which all Chriſtian
Churches ought to maintain. She neither invades the
Rights, nor pretends to reverſe the juſt and regular
Cenſures, nor countenances the Schiſmaticks, nor
diſallows the miniſtrations of any other Church ſo far
as conſiſtent with the expreſs Inſtitutions of our bleſſed
Saviour, and the univerſally received practice of his
Church, though otherwiſe mix'd with ſeveral corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which ſhe wiſhes removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. Laſtly, our Roman Adverſaries object to
us the many obſtinate Schiſms, and groſs Hereſies,
which have ſprung up ſince the Reformation, and as
they pretend out of it, from the forſaking of that bond
of Unity in the Catholick Church, only to be hoped
for in their Communion, where alone they ſay theſe are
prevented, or ſoon cured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64560:26"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt part of matter of fact is too notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to be denied, and too ſcandalous to be defended:
but againſt the latter part of the original of theſe
Schiſms, and Hereſies many juſt exceptions may be
interpoſed.</p>
            <p>1. The Reformation gives no countenance to them,
but ſeverely condemns them, and provides ſufficient
means to prevent or remove them; if notwithſtanding
wicked men of corrupt Principles, and depraved man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
flee hither for ſhelter to hide their enormities, and
abuſe or pervert the moſt wholſom Inſtitutions, and
advantagious opportunities for their ſpiritual proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the moſt contrary purpoſes; The guilt and ill
conſequence will lie only at their own doors. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
muſt not be debarred of the ordinary means of
Grace, becauſe ſome turn this Grace into wantonneſs.
St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us of ſome who wreſt the Scriptures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their own deſtruction; but neither he nor any other
then, or for many Ages after thought this motive ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to deprive the People of the uſe of them, made it
rather an argument of conſulting them with greater
caution and diligence, leſt being led away with the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of the wicked they fall from their own ſtedfaſtneſs.</p>
            <p>2. There were many Schiſms and Hereſies
ſprung up in the firſt and beſt Ages of the Church,
even in the times of the Apoſtles themſelves, as
appears by ſeveral intimations in their Writings,
and in the immediatly ſucceeding, while many
Apoſtolical men were living, and if we compare the
account we have of them in the moſt ancient Authors,
particularly in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> they were as wild, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
as any of the later date: yet the Apologiſts for
true Chriſtianity thought themſelves very injuriouſly
charged with thoſe blaſphemous Principles, or flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Practices which they wholly renounced, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64560:26"/>
The evil one is always moſt buſie to ſow his
Tares amongſt the beſt Wheat. But that which is moſt
to our purpoſe here to obſerve, is that the ſame method
which the Orthodox Chriſtians then made uſe of for
the Confutation, and Conviction of Hereticks and
Schiſmaticks, we ſtill appeal to, by bringing them to
the touchſtone of Scripture, and next to that the moſt
Orthodox, and Catholick Tradition. Whereas how
ſhort and eaſie a deciſion to all debates might have
been fetcht hence, had they had the ſame apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Authority and Eſficacy thereof by referring
all Controverſies depending to the determination of
the Roman Church, the Mother, and Miſtris of all,
and to that infallible conduct ſetled therein: but not
one word of that, only when they make their appeals
to her after the expreſs Word of God, it is in common
with many other Churches, eſpecially thoſe of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical

3. The pretence of the moſt abſolute Authority in
the one part, and the extortion of the moſt implicite
Belief, and blind Obedience in the other among them
have not been able to ſecure themſelves from conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
diſſentions, and Diviſions in opinion, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
If theſe have not broke out ordinarily into the
moſt open Schiſms, and Hereſies, the ſtop is more due
to the craft and policy whereby they oft compromiſe
the matter between both parties, or to that outward
force and violence which reſtrains them, rather than to
any opinion which they themſelves have of this ready
means of ending all diſputes. We find in the fierceſt
debates among them how little heed is given to this
infallible cure farther than intereſt or neceſſity inclines
them. There may be a way of preventing controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
which deſtroys all Religion, and makes way for
Atheiſm; in ſuch a caſe I need not enquire where the
advantage lies.</p>
            <p>4. We may anſwer, moſt of thoſe miſchiefs had their
riſe from the ruines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when
that was violently aſſaulted and broken, its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
deſpiſed, its Conſtitutions vilified, its Order defaced,
its faithful Adherents perſecuted, then Faction, and
Diſorder, ſtrange Doctrines, Phrenſical Opinions, and
all manner of looſeneſs in Principles, and Practices
came in like a torrent, and overſpread the Land, which
before skulkt in corners, and were little taken notice
of. The Reſtitution of the Church hath in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
put a ſtop to their progreſs; I knwo not of any
Sect, which hath ſtarted up ſince that time: But almoſt
every year before brought forth ſeveral. If her pains
and care have not yet been ſo ſucceſsfully prevalent as
to recover, and reſtore all that have gone aſtray, ſhe
hath not been wanting in her endeavours towards it,
which have reduced many; and it is no little time, nor
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64560:27"/>
eaſie task to repair the Ruines of ſuch long Confuſions,
and Deſolations.</p>
            <p>5. We owe a great part of theſe Calamities to the
ſame perſons, who now charge them upon us; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
the influence which their Agents, Principles, and
Examples had in contriving and promoting thoſe unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Commotions, and Rebellions in the State which
I am not now concerned to examine; let matter of
fact determine that as it hath been found more or leſs
plain: Thus far we have abundant evidence that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of their Emiſſaries have herded with the chief of
our Diſſenters, and if ſome of the groſſeſt Sects were
not framed among them firſt, as ſeems very probable,
yet moſt of them have been much fomented, and
ſtrengthened by them, and they have been oft found
acting their parts under that diſguiſe, and have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
on all occaſions their intereſt to ſhelter, and
protect them, according to the known maxime of their
Policy, that the readieſt way of effecting our ruine
was by increaſing, and fomenting our Diviſions; here
they have found their greateſt harveſt. For when
mens minds are unſetled, and they grown giddy with
being long turned about by every new wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and are weary of tumbling and toſſing from one
Party to another, they will eaſily catch hold of any
fancied ſupport, and be ſooner betrayed to yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Captives to the deluſory hopes of reſt and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
amongſt them.</p>
            <p>6. To all which may be added, much of that irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
and contempt of Perſons, and things Sacred,
which have made way for the forementioned ſad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
amongſt us are moſtly due to their Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Inſolencies, or Deluſions. When the People had
ſo long groaned under their tyrannical yoke, and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
burdens, and found themſelves ſo oft cheated
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64560:28"/>
by their manifeſt impoſtures, no marvel if they be
over-fearful of what they had ſuffered ſo much from,
and afterwards too ſuſpicious of being deluded again,
and be ſoon tempted to tranſgreſs due meaſure in the
uſe of their liberty, being juſt recovered from extreme
ſlavery, though ſo many years have paſſed ſince, as
will hardly admit of a tolerable excuſe: Yet better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and longer conſideration we hope in time may
teach them to diſtinguiſh between the certain Intereſts
of true Religion, and the hypocritical wiles of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Craſt and Policy, and ſo to think a due reſpect, and
Obſequiouſneſs to thoſe who ſincerely manage the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
neceſſary to preſerve them from being impoſed on
by the latter, and prevent their falling into the like
miſcarriages which they obſerve in others; And that
Apoſtolical Government, good Order, wholſom Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
ſound Doctrine, and Uniform Devotion may no
longer ſuffer under the falſe, but moſt odious charge of
Popery, and that they who have under God been moſt
inſtrumental in reforming, and defending the Church
from the real, and groſs Corruptions thereof, may not
ſtill be oppreſſed with the unreaſonable clamour of a
meer invidious name, which they that uſe moſt know
very little what they mean by it, only that it denotes
ſomewhat favoured by them of whom they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
an ill opinion. The caſe hath been too like
exemplified in another Inſtance, eſpecially of late years,
in which many Hypocrites have ſo ſcandalouſly abuſed
the moſt ſolemn pretences to Sanctity and Devotion
for a covering or continuance to the moſt horrid Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
Schiſms, and Rebellions, that they have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened
profane men to ſcorn, and ſend out open De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiances
againſt the very appearance of Religion, and
poſſibly tempted others ſerious, and hearty lovers of

               </gap>s cauſe to be too modeſt, and ſhamefaced in its defence:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64560:28"/>
yet we hope unfeigned Piety will be always juſtified of
its Children. Sutably truly Catholick Principles, and
Obſervances may vindicate themſelves, though groſs
Errors, and Impoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ures have long paſſed under that
diſguiſe: Notwithſtanding ordinary People, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the beſt diſtinguiſhers, and who are often hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from one extreme to another, do not redily diſcern
one from the other, but having found themſelves once
cheated; be a long time over-jealous of a like deſign
upon them.</p>
            <p>VI. From the Premiſes duly conſidered will, I hope,
in the cloſe be inferred the ſtrongeſt motive, and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
upon all among us heartily to embrace, and
ſteadily to perſevere in the Communion of our Church:
to ſhare in thoſe happy Advantages and Bleſſings,
which all who rightly improve it may promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
therein. She deſires by all means poſſible to
convince their Conſciences, and incline their Affections
to a willing compliance with their indiſpenſable Duty,
and higheſt Priviledge, rather than over aw their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
by ſevere Cenſures, or the following condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.
Nay, if neceſſity force upon any the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the laſt, when they will not hearken to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
ſhe pleads the ſame Charity for the Principle
of both, not only to prevent others from being ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the ſame Errors: But alſo thus to deter them
from more diſmal Ruine here, and hereafter, which
hangs over them perſiſting ſtill in
the ſame obſtinacy.<note n="a" place="margin">S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> adv. Epiſt. Petiliani, <hi>l. 2. T. 7. p.</hi> 101. Non vos occidimus, ſed ipſi voſmet verâ morte occiditis, cùm vos ab unitatis vivâ radice praeciditis.</note> Of all ſhe

Men may make a noiſe with the odious name of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution;
yet our Adverſaries of both extremes have
little reaſon to object that, of which they themſelves
ſtand ſo deeply chargeable when in their power. But we
relie not on that Plea, which however it offend them,
would not clear us. No ſetled Government, Civil, or
Sacred, was ever, or is more gentle, and compaſſionate
in its inflictions than ours: If when this Tenderneſs
was requited with new and greater Inſolence, and more
obſtinate Contempt, Authority begin to put on a more
harſh, and ſevere Countenance, and make uſe of the
rod of its power to correct the peeviſhneſs of ſome, or
reſtrain the extravagancies of others, it is to be hoped
they will in the end find it for their edification, and not
for their deſtruction, and may ſee cauſe to bleſs God,
and thank their Governours for thoſe benign Penalties,
which almoſt forceably opened their eyes to diſcern
that evidence which pertinacious obſtinacy had ſhut
them againſt in all other Perſuaſives, as<note n="b" place="margin">

declares ſeveral of the Donatiſts had profeſſed to him,
and therefore ſaw great reaſon to recal, and recant the
many clamours they had raiſed on this occaſion. I hope
we are not without many ſenſible Inſtances of the good
effect hereof among our ſelves, though it be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in ſome from what it is in others; but the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of it is certainly to what is good in all.</p>
            <p>Experience, and farther conſideration may have
made all prudent and ſober Friends to true Piety, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and good Order aſhamed of the popular Plea of
Liberty, or that men ought to be left free from any
reſtraint, or Impoſitions in matters of Religion, and
Conſcience; which muſt needs confound all peace, and
overturn all Government in every Society, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the being of the Church as ſuch, and expoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſons to all manner of ſtrange deluſions, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64560:29"/>
extravagant enterpriſes without the leaſt guard or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
beſide the ill aſpect it hath on the Civil Peace;
I may add, It never was, and I doubt never will be
practiſed by any Party of men, when they can do
otherwiſe, who flee to it only for Sanctuary when they
can find ſhelter no where beſide. Would men but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
look abroad, or conſult former times, or but
really conſider what were like to be their ſtate under
any other ſetled Conſtitution by whatever favourable
Character it may have been repreſented, they might
find little temptation to querulous uneaſineſs in their
preſent condition, and ſmall encouragement to ſeek,
and improve every occaſion to quarrel at thoſe few, and
mild reſtraints laid on them, eſpecially if withal they
would faithfully reflect upon the ill uſe which hath been
made of more remiſsneſs.</p>
            <p>Indeed Chriſtianity, which is the Goſpel of Love,
and Peace, and is almoſt wholly made up of Charity,
inclines us firſt, and moſt, to the mildeſt methods, as
moſt grateful, moſt likely to win upon other mens
good affections, and to teſtifie our own. But then
this mildneſs may be turned into the greateſt cruelty to
the guilty as well as to the innocent, yea, to the whole
Community. Our great wiſdom will be ſo to purſue
the former as we may avoid the latter, and I know not
where it is done more cautiouſly than here.</p>
            <p>If we were to examine the ſtrange and ſtiff Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
in many to the Communion of our Church, we
ſhall find them moſtly owing to blind Prejudice, and
groſs Ignorance of what is required of them, more than
to any other Principles. They have been brought up
in a very ill opinion of our Service meerly by odious
names, ſly and invidious Characters given to it from
perſons whoſe ſincerity and judgment they relie on,
and ſo are before reſolved againſt any farther enquiry,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64560:30"/>
and induſtriouſly ſhun all opportunities of better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
either by perſonal Conference, or reading
our Books. They think themſelves ſufficiently ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and go on to hate and revile, but they often know
not what, nor why. If we could bring them to make
their own trial, who are always jealous of any attempts
from us, matter of fact would be their beſt confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and their own Eyes and Ears prove their moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
conviction, ſo as to wonder at their former obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
which ſome of them have confeſſed upon this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
I believe were ſome fierce Diſſenters ask'd,
they can ſcarce ſay, that they ever ſeriouſly read, or
attentively heard the Liturgy, and know very little
what it is therein which offends them; I am ſure they
will hardly tell us. Sometimes meer novelty ſtartles
them, and they are afraid only for not being uſed
to it.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many ſuch little Objections, that we can
ſcarce gueſs at would ſoon be removed by this ſenſible
proof reach'd down to all capacities; and a ſober, ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
temper of mind, with a firm, and well-grounded
belief in moſt of the material Points of Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
variouſly inculcated in the ſeveral Offices of
our Liturgy, would grow up more and more in them;
for want of this we find in ſeveral Zealots very little
knowledge of the firſt Principles of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and indeed very little to be learnt from thoſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of diſcourſes and Phraſes to which they have been
hitherto uſed. But more particularly may theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
be applied to invite the Romaniſts amongſt
us unto the free, ſincere, and cordial Communion with
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which once, though only to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance, they generally obſerved, and have
almoſt nothing to object againſt it but the raſh, and
Schiſmatical Interdict of a forein uſurped Power. That
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64560:30"/>
the terms of our Communion are moſt truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
hath been the chief deſign of this ſmall Tract to
prove, and thereby to prevent the common prejudice
from the name of the Catholick, and Apoſtolick
Church, in which, whatever they aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
we have as good a title to our ſhare as any
Church in the world. And no ſenſible evidence have
we of our Communion with that Catholick Church,
but by communicating with the more particular.
Church in which Divine Providence hath placed us,
where nothing is required of us repugnant to the Bond
of Unity in the whole.</p>
            <p>Many of our Church, yea, our Conſtitution it ſelf
have been often charged, and reviled, though moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly,
with too favourable an inclination to them of
<hi>Rome:</hi> becauſe whatever of good Order, and decent
Solemnity, as well as ſound Doctrine, and wholſom
Inſtruction was found among them, is ſtill retained and
cheriſhed by us. And that we are not ſo haſty and
peremptory in unchurching them all together, or damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſently all that have been, or are ſtill of their
Communion, as ſome would have us: which is in effect
for being more tender in preſerving the Principles of
true Catholick Unity than in pleaſing ſome private
humours or prejudices.</p>
            <p>Still we muſt be aware that no pretended Charity
to them, nor yet compliance with thoſe who pretend
the greateſt oppoſition to them muſt tempt us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
the Truth of God, or violate our Obligation to his
Commands on either ſide; and within thoſe bounds to
conſult, as much as poſſible, the Peace and Unity of
his Church, and continue therein. If the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
our kindneſs upon us in new Oppoſitions: If the
latter load our religions care and modeſt caution with
all thoſe dreadful imputations due to others: If we
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64560:31"/>
ſuffer from both ſides, whilſt it is only for ſpeaking the
Truth, and doing our Duty, which we have no power
to alter; we may juſtifie our ſelves before God, and
our own Conſciences, and in due time with all good
reaſonable, and conſiderative men, and then it is no,
matter what the clamours, and captious cavils of others
lay upon us.</p>
            <p>But yet our Adverſaries of the Roman Perſuaſion
muſt take notice, that while we are ſo wary, and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in our Cenſures of them, we are not the leſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
of the extreme danger which attends thoſe
groſs Errors and Superſtitions, where with we charge
them, which have a direct tendency to their ruine, and
very much undermine the foundations of Faith, and
good Life, which they own in common with us. What
may be their influence upon any particular perſons is
more than we dare determine, and think always more
ſafe to incline to the favourable ſide, where it may be
without prejudice to what is certainly true and good.
Notwithſtanding whatever our opinion be, that will
not alter the caſe at laſt, and thus far we are moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
that the corruptions among them are ſuch
which every Church is bound to reform, and every
true Chriſtian to keep at a diſtance from, as much as
is in his power.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever were the condition of thoſe who lived
in that Communion before the Reformation, many of
them groaned under thoſe Oppreſſions from which we
are happily freed; nay, whatever charitable allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
may ſtill be made for them, who now live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thoſe Boundaries where they have little opportunity
of knowing better, and are under vaſt prejudices by
contrary Education, and the ſevereſt aw over them:
How far, I ſay, theſe caſes may be pleadable, muſt be
left to God and their own Conſciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:64560:31"/>
As for thoſe born, and bred among us, who have
been treacherouſly deluded into Apoſtacy from us, or
will perſiſt in their hereditary obſtinate averſeneſs
to us againſt the cleareſt conviction, which they may
receive, and in oppoſition to the expreſs Laws of God,
and of the Land, to the perpetual diſturbance of the
State, and confuſion of the Church; there appears
no room for any excuſe to leſſen their Crime, or alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
their doom, which will be mightily increaſed,
when all manner of hidden and crafty Artifices, or
open violences againſt the common Rights of Humane
Society, and moral Honeſty, as well as the Faith,
and Charity of Chriſts Church are employed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
into a religious but blind Zeal for the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of both.</p>
            <p>No marvel if the Nation awakened with the effects
hereof, which it hath ſometimes felt, and oftener had
reaſon to fear, have provided ſome ſervere Laws for an
aw over them, and to ſtop the firſt beginnings of ſuch
exorbitant attempts, ready to break through all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
incloſures, and which will hardly be reſtrained
by the uſual methods of Government. No temper is
more difficultly maſtered, or more miſchievous, if let
looſe, than ſuch a falſe firery zeal, which neglected burns
all before it.</p>
            <p>But whatever may have been their Treatment of us
formerly, or we may juſtly apprehend would be ſtill,
had they any opportunity, which God prevent: we
ought not, and hope ſhall not ever deſiſt from wiſhing,
and endeavouring, as much as is in our power, their
real welfare, and ſo of all our implacable Enemies, and
therein their hearty Union with us in the holy Offices
of Religion. and Fellowſhip of Gods Church where
they live, with the ſincere renunciation of thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Errors, and Practices that hitherto keep them
at a diſtance from us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:64560:32"/>
In Concluſion, inſtead of querulous expoſtulations'
or catching occaſions to find fault, we have great reaſon
to admire and adore that gracious Providence, which
amidſt ſo many Confuſions, Diſorders, and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that prevail too much in moſt places round about,
hath placed our Lot in ſo happy a ſoil, and provided
for us ſo goodly a Heritage, and ſafe Retreat in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
of that Church, whoſe Charity is as eminent as
its Faith, and its Order as ſignal as its Purity; whoſe
Arms are always open to receive its returning Enemies
with the moſt tender Compaſſions, as well as to cheriſh
its faithful Friends with the moſt wholſom and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
proviſions; where nothing is wanting to enſure
our ſafety, and encourage our proficiency in every
thing that is good and excellent: which upon former
trial of both the oppoſite extremes, the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
hath ſeen neceſſary to flee back into, to repair the
Confuſions and Devaſtations they had brought: and
in its moſt dangerous Convulſions here hath found the
readieſt Cure, and under whoſe name her very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
deſire to ſhelter themſelves: which finally ingages
us to expreſs our gratitude for ſo peculiar Priviledges
by a ready and impartial Obedience to the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
we are taught, and a fruitful improvement of all
thoſe happy Advantages which we enjoy therein. That
our Lives may be anſwerable to our Profeſſion, and
our pious, virtuous, peaceable, and charitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
may be in ſome proportion as defenſible, and
remarkable as the Principles we proceed upon, or the
benefits we lay claim to.</p>
            <p>This would moſt effectually ſilence the captious
Cavils of our Enemies on every ſide, and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
invite them to our Communion than all other the
moſt demonſtrative Arguments: when their very

I hope we are not deſtitute of ſome ſuch eminent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of unfeigned Piety, true Holineſs, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Probity. God Almighty increaſe their number
more, and more: Yet whatſoever may be the effect
thereof upon other men, this method would moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
enſure our own firmeſt Peace here, and
everlaſting Salvation hereafter. Here we keep certainly
within our own bounds, and may moſt ſafely, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
ſpend all our Zeal, while other men pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in diverting it abroad to what they have no
power over. It ſeems horribly nauſeous to hear men
quarrel fiercely about the beſt Church, who live in the
moſt open defiance to all Religion, and I doubt there
are too many of all denominations chargeable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
Yet whatever the caſe of others prove, it will be
moſt ſafe, and pious to bring it home, and cloſe to our
ſelves. Be our Church, or our Profeſſion never ſo much
better than any other, if we be not alſo ſuitably better
than other men, they will riſe up in judgment againſt us
at the laſt.</p>
            <p>But by a careful and diligent obſervance of its ſacred
Preſcriptions we ſhall juſtifie our Reformation
throughout, put a ſtop to the Reproaches, and ſhame
the Calumnies of our Adverſaries, and which is the
Summary of all good intentions, and endeavours, bring
honour to our great Lord and Maſter, the Author and
Finiſher of our Faith.</p>
