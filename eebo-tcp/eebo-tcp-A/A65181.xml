            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The Impartial
Character
OF A
Rambler.</head>
                  <byline>By the Author of the <hi>BOOK.</hi>
                  </byline>
                  <p>HE's a thing wholly consisting of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams—</hi> A
Head, Fingers and
Toes; for what his industrious Toes do
tread, his ready Fingers do write, his <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
Head dictating. But to describe him
more exactly, He is is made up of a large
Head and Ears, <hi>some Brains,</hi> and most
immoderate Tongue, Toes and Fingers;
a very <hi>Carrier</hi> or Foot-post will draw him
from any Company that has not been
abroad, (excepting always his <hi>dear Iris,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62151:23"/>
for she is ever new) meerly because he's
a <hi>sort of a Traveller:</hi> But a <hi>Dutch</hi> Post
<hi>ravishes</hi> him, and the meer Superscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Letter (thô there's ne're a Bill
in't) from <hi>Boston, Italy,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> sets
him up like a Top, <hi>Colen</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi> makes
him spin—(and without Whipping too,
there's the wonder) and at seeing the
word <hi>Vniverse, America, Flanders,</hi> or the
<hi>Holy Land,</hi> thô but on the <hi>Title</hi> of a
Book, he's ready to break Doublet, let
fall Breeches, <hi>(in a civil way)</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
the room with all those <hi>Wonderments</hi>
have surpriz'd him in these <hi>flourishing</hi>
Countreys. If he has no <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> he
makes it up with abundant scraps of <hi>Italian,
Spanish, French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and thô he has
little more knowledge in any of 'em than
<hi>Comestato? Parlez vous?</hi> or <hi>How
vare ye Min-heer?</hi> and can hardly buy
a <hi>Sallat</hi> in one Language, or a <hi>Herring</hi>
in t'other; yet when he comes home, he
passes with himself and other like him,
for a <hi>monstrous</hi> learned Creature, <hi>a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of every Countrey</hi> under Heaven,
whereas indeed he's a meer <hi>Babylonian,</hi>
he confounds all Languages, but speaks
none, and is so careful to jumble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Gibberish of other Countreys,
that he almost forgets his own <hi>Mother
Tongue,</hi> as the Roman Orator did his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62151:23"/>
                     <hi>Name,</hi> only the Writing the <hi>History of
his Travels</hi> makes him remember it agen.
All his <hi>Discourse</hi> is shap'd into a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling
Garb,</hi> and is the same with his
Manners and Haviour, looking as if 'twas
contriv'd to make Mourners merry. <hi>He's
all the strange shapes round the Maps</hi> put
together—one Legg a <hi>Hungarian,</hi> t'other
a <hi>Pole;</hi> one piece of him a <hi>Turk,</hi> and the
next a <hi>Tartar</hi> or <hi>Moscov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

look<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on his Face, you'd swear he's a <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander—</hi> so
much has Travelling, <hi>Wind,
Sun and Rain</hi> discoulour'd it and alter'd it:
However <hi>chast</hi> his Body may be, his Mind is
extreamly <hi>prolifick;</hi> his thoughts are a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> and he, like <hi>a great Turk,</hi>
begets thousands of little Infants—<hi>Remarks,
Fancys, Fantasticks, Crochets and
Whirligigs,</hi> on his wandring Intellect, and
when once <hi>begot,</hi> they must be <hi>bred—</hi>
so out he turns 'em into the wide World
to shift for themselves, after he has put
a few <hi>black and white Raggs</hi> about
'em to cover their <hi>Nakedness:</hi> But to look
upon 'em when they once get abroad—to
see how hugely they <hi>favour their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
Do but view 'em all over, and—Here's
that will cure your <hi>Corns, Gout,

News; how is't; if you have Travelled;</hi>
and above all, (when Publish'd) How
you like his <hi>Rambles;</hi> han't they a
fine <hi>Frontispiece—</hi> Ay, a very fine
one; there's <hi>Art—</hi> there's <hi>Thought—</hi>
well—and then for the <hi>Uerses</hi> before
it, I say <hi>Coriat</hi>'s Book was but a <hi>Horn-book</hi>
to't—they no more deserve to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
together than <hi>Pilgrims Progress</hi> and
<hi>Burton's Wonderments;</hi> and so he would
<hi>Ramble</hi> on to the End of the Chapter,
did not you out of Civility give him a
gentle tweak by the Nose, or <hi>kick on
the Shins,</hi> and ask him whether he
knew what he was talking of? Yet as
good let him alone, for if you get him
out of this <hi>Impertinency,</hi> he'll ramble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a thousand more, rather than want
the <hi>Humanity</hi> of vexing you—but
then such courteous ones they'll be (for
he's the very <hi>Pink of Courtesie</hi>) that ye
can't for your Teeth find in your Heart
to be angry with him. If he chances to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62151:24"/>
be <hi>Shipwrackt,</hi> he can't be angry with
the Sea or Winds; Nay, is rather pleas'd
with 'em, for giving him opportunity to
describe a <hi>Storm</hi> more lively, and tell
the World what direful Dangers he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
when he swum ashore like a <hi>Caesar,</hi>
with his Sword in one hand, and his
<hi>Commentaries</hi> in t'other. He's averse to
nothing that has <hi>Motion</hi> in't, and for a
Lowse, he dearly loves such a painful
<hi>Fellow-Traveller,</hi> who Rambles over
his <hi>Microcosm,</hi> or lesser World, as he the
<hi>greater—</hi> nibling and sucking here and
there, whenever he finds any thing <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his Palate.</hi> He's generally for <hi>Foot-</hi> service,
and thinks that much more brave
than the <hi>Horse,</hi> scorning to ride upon
four Hoofs, when <hi>Nature</hi> has given him
ten Toes to support him. But if he
should be forc'd into such Circumstances,
by the surbating his Feet, he envies those
<hi>happier Criminals</hi> who have their <hi>Leggs
ty'd</hi> under their Horses belly, and thinks
the most commodious way of riding is
with his <hi>Face toward the Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l,</hi> for then
he can't see any danger 'till he's past it.
Other People are for walking with a
Horse in their Hands, he's o' the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
for riding with his Staff in his
Hand, or rather <hi>Walking with a Horse
between his Leggs,</hi> for his Feet still
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62151:25"/>
move at the same rate as if they touch'd
the ground, and were imployed in their
own <hi>natural motion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What's other Mens Recreation is his
<hi>business,</hi> and yet he makes rather a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of a Toyl, than a Toyl of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
for tho' he <hi>Ramble</hi> with all his
might, <hi>(as when he rides every part of him
works)</hi> yet the more pain, the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
and the Fatigues he meets with in
all, give such an odd sort of a pleasure,
as a Boar has when scrubbing his <hi>brawny
Back</hi> against a Tree, or an <hi>Irish</hi> man
scratching where it itches. I told you he
<hi>Rambles</hi> with all his might, and 'tis
true enough, for he sets his Heart upon't,
and there's not one <hi>particle</hi> of his Body,
nor immaterial <hi>Snip</hi> of his Soul, but
Rambles as fast as his Legs, nay, some
much faster.</p>
                  <p>To begin with his <hi>Brains, (for he
has Brains)</hi> some think they rambled from
him in his <hi>Infancy,</hi> and dropping
then out of his Nose, his Nurse, good
Woman, being feeding him with Pap,
opportunely caught 'em in the Spoon,
and because the little <hi>Bantling</hi> shou'd n't
be upbraided for want of 'em, when he
came to age, put 'em in agen, with the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62151:25"/>
addition of a little of the <hi>gravy of her
old gums,</hi> tho' in the wrong place; which
he, poor <hi>Innocent</hi> being ignorant of, as
how shou'd he be otherwise, swallowed
down amongst the Pap, and ever since
has worn his <hi>Brains in his Guts,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Gutts in his Brains:—But this
is but the effect of Envy, that speaks
well of no Body—any more than another
foul Calumny of the same Batch, that
they <hi>Rambled</hi> to t'other End of the World
upon <hi>new Discoveries,</hi> where being
surprized by the Cannibals, they got 'em
out of his <hi>Ears</hi> with a Skewer, as folks
pick Marrow-bones, and eat 'em as a rare
Dainty with Pepper and Vinegar—others
that being close pursued, and conscious
they were the most precious things he
had about him; he 'ene <hi>sneez'd 'em out</hi>
of his Nose, (as the Bever bites off his
more valuable Moveables when in the
same circumstances) and left 'em for a Bait
to catch the Gudgeons with, upon a fair
Cabbidge-leaf, just in the High<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> way—But
'tis certain from his own Mouth, 'twas
another sort of substance, tho' much of
the same consistence, which fell from him
in his flight from these Obstreperous
and Carnivorous Anthropophagi; and
the Truth is, the only <hi>Ramble</hi> his Brains
ever made, were into his <hi>Pen,</hi> as he was
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62151:26"/>
nibling it to get out these excellent
works.</p>
                  <p>For his <hi>Eyes,</hi> if they they did not <hi>ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in his Mothers Belly,</hi> because there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the modest Fool might keep 'em
shut, 'tis certain they fell a <hi>gadding</hi> as
soon as 'ere they came abroad, and will
never lie still more till many a fair Year
after he's buried, if they do then. Let
those who have no further to <hi>Ramble</hi> than
the Play-house, admire the fair <hi>full Eye,
the tip, the twinkle, the ogle,</hi> or what you
please to call it, but he gives you his
Honour upon't, (which will pass for a
Pot of Ale at any blind Ale-house in
<hi>Christendom</hi>) that of all the Eyes in the
World he envies those that <hi>squint, because</hi>
they can look nine ways at once, and
he heartily wishes his Eyes were <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically
retrograde</hi> to each other, for he had
much rather look all round about than
just before him: The truth is, his own
Eyes, as they are, do him no inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Service, of which you'll know more
when I tell you what <hi>Rambles they and
their Fellow-Travellers</hi> his Fingers have had
together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Nose Rambles—</hi> not to an Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
but a Kitchen, which <hi>smoaks in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62151:26"/>
Country,</hi> and his Table is cover'd in
every Hamlet from hence to the <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des;</hi>
so generous is his <hi>Stomach</hi> that he
scorns the queasie morose temper of those
who never eat unless they are sure they are
<hi>Welcome,</hi> and the Meat clean dress'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he'd not refuse a Dinner, thô with an
old Usurer, who gave him as many Curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
for every bit he eat, as there have been
drops of Water in the <hi>Thames</hi> running by
<hi>Greenwich</hi> this 700 Years; nor stand out
at an Invitation, thô made by the <hi>Hottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots</hi>
on the <hi>Cape of Good-Hope</hi> to one of
their T—d-Puddings, and no other Claret
to make it go down, but the <hi>Indians</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
the gravy of half a dozen <hi>fat Toads,</hi>
mellowing in a Jar for half a Year before
the Feast.</p>
                  <p>To let alone therefore the <hi>Rambling of
his Tongue,</hi> (which all the World knows
has such a way with it) his <hi>Teeth and
Pallat</hi> are of all Nations and Religions as
well as that. He can Feast very <hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably</hi>
on a good decent Mince Pye, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Pot of Plumb-Porridge; he can
<hi>edifie</hi> on a brotherly Capon, and think Sack-posset
a very comfortable and enlarging
Dispensation; he can <hi>Fast and Mortifie</hi> on
Sturgeon, Turbet, Mullet, or Shell-fish with
e're a portly Fryer of 'em all; ay, and munch
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62151:27"/>
Locusts with the poor <hi>Maronites</hi> in Mount
<hi>Libanus;</hi> rather than let his <hi>Gutts cling</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether—while
he eats Pudding and
Sallat with the <hi>Bramin</hi> when he can get
no better Food: He is not such a <hi>Hog</hi> as
not to eat Flesh of a <hi>Iews</hi> dressing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'twas cut with its Throat towards
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> nor is not such a <hi>Iew</hi> as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
a good sliver of a Hog, if he meets
it handsomly upon <hi>Governours-Island;</hi>
or any other place on this or t'other side
on't.</p>
                  <p>I promis'd to tell you what <hi>Rambling
Hands</hi> he has—O they are a pair of
little Wanderers as ever went where they
had no business—not that they ever dived
into any Pockets besides his own, which
they seldom take any Money from, much
less from another,—he scorns it.—Sir,—you
don't know him—or else—he
has a Sword and Pistol—at your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
for be it known t'ye, he'll ne're
make use on't, unless to present at the
Bushes, and furiously throw 'em over the
Hedge—But they strole in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with his Eyes, over all the <hi>Learned
World,</hi> as his Feet over the <hi>natural one,</hi>
cropping here and there, nay, one may
venture to say, <hi>every where,</hi> such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
choice Flowers as present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62151:27"/>
to his <hi>Inquisitive Peepers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Feet</hi> are of the same Humour with
all the rest of his Body, and they so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
his Leggs, that he has much ado to
keep up the Confederacy between 'em,
they have such a huge mind to be running
away from one another, (so that 'tis
fear'd he'll in time grow splay-footed)
and from their Body too, as sweet a one
as 'tis, as Dr. <hi>Faustus</hi>'s did from him,
when the Countrey-man pull'd to wake
him.</p>
                  <p>What shou'd I tell you of his <hi>Soul,</hi>
since his Body is the very Picture on't,
and if you know one, you can't miss o'
t'other among a thousand: 'Tis like
<hi>Gresham-Colledge,</hi> or the Anatomy-School
at <hi>Leyden,</hi> hung round with a thousand
<hi>Knick-knacks</hi> that rambled thither, some
of 'em half the World over—But
what pains he takes to show 'em all,
and does it with as much Decorum and
gravity as the <hi>old Fellow</hi> used to show
the <hi>Tombs at Westminster;</hi> so that
in his own words, his ill Luck lies
not so much in being a Fool, as in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put to such Pain to express it to
the World—But shou'd the Frollick
go round, and all the World write <hi>a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62151:28"/>
Book of their Lives and Rambles,</hi> as he
has done, he'll ask one civil Question—Who
wou'd be Fool then? To summe

as pure Ivory—though both may
want brushing. He speaks somewhat thick
when his Mouth is full, or he is angry—but
writes much better—when he draws

often—when he sleeps, and stumbles a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

                        <p>Of my Rambles before I came into my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

                        <hi>AFter his first Ramble</hi>—] First, and not
first—for even before this, <hi>I Rambled
from the Beginning of the World,</hi> if not a great
deal sooner. The <hi>Essences</hi> of things are eternal,
as the Learned say, and my <hi>first Ramble</hi> was
indeed out of Essence into Existence, from a
Being in my Causes, into <hi>actual Being.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But not to mount the Argument above my
Readers Head, lest I should crack both that and
my own—Let it suffice, that my <hi>Soul</hi> for
ought I know, has been <hi>Rambling</hi> the best part
of this 6000 <hi>Years,</hi> if those are in the right
on't who hold the <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> and that all
Souls were made at once.</p>
                     <p>However—for my <hi>Body,</hi> I can make Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit
on't—that 't has been <hi>Rambling</hi> so long
and so far before my Soul stumbled upon't,
that I <hi>lose the Track,</hi> and can go no further.
All matter is in motion, and therefore perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
chang'd and alter'd—now in how many
shapes that <hi>little handful</hi> which makes up my Souls
Luggage, has been formerly <hi>dress'd,</hi> I'll promise
you, I'll not undertake to tell ye.</p>
                     <p>As great a <hi>Coward</hi> as I am, there may have gone
I know n't how many <hi>perticles of a Lyon</hi> into my
Composition, and as <hi>small as my Body</hi> is, my <hi>great</hi>
Grandfather might be made out of a Whale or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62151:32"/>
an Elephant. You remember the Story of the
<hi>Dog that kill'd the Cat, that eat the Rat,—</hi> for I
love to Illustrate <hi>Philosophical Problems,</hi> with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Instances for the use of the less knowing
part of the World,—why just so here. To
prove, I may have a piece of a Roaring Lyon
rambled into me,—How can any man alive prove
but as long ago as the <hi>Holy War,</hi> some or other
of my Ancestors waited on K. <hi>Richard into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine,</hi>
and was there with him when he killed
the Lyon. This Gentleman might have a Dog,—this
Dog being hungry, might fall a tearing
the Guts of this Lyon, some of whose Body must
pass into the Dogs, as well as other only thro'
it. This <hi>Dog</hi> might come home with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
agen, and at length coming to some untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
end, his Noble Carcass lye rotting in the
Fields—which very place being fatned with his
corrupted Carcass, might produce some <hi>Tuffs of
larger Grass</hi> than ordinary, wherein undoubtedly
wou'd be included some Particles of the poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Creature,—which Particles might very
easily be devour'd by some <hi>fat Ox, or Weather</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
there, allured by the length and beauty of
the grass, and so become part of this Sheep or
Oxe,—and <hi>they agen,</hi> being brought to the
Spacious Table of some of my <hi>Worthy Ancestors,</hi>
might Communicate the same Subtile parts of
the <hi>Grass, the Sheep, the Oxe, the Dog, the Lyon</hi> to
their Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Blood,—and <hi>in two removes more,</hi> to their
Son and Heir, <hi>so from Generation, to Generation,</hi>
till at last, all center'd in the <hi>Lyon—like Evander.—</hi>
This I say may be, and Graver folks than he
have made a huge splutter with such a kind of
business;—but I am apt to think (<hi>between
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62151:32"/>
Friends</hi>) if there be any thing in't, that most of
the Lyoness Particles rambled <hi>somewhere else,</hi> to
another <hi>Branch</hi> of the Family; and that more of
the <hi>Sheep,</hi> the gentle Lamb, or such harmless in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Creatures <hi>Rambled</hi> into my Composition;
for though I find enough of the <hi>Lyon in my Soul,</hi>
yet this <hi>Treacherous</hi> Body will quake and tremble
at the approach of Danger: And I find a strong
Inclination to <hi>bleat</hi> for Succour,—tho' still all
that know me, know the very Character I give
my self, is, (and I shou'd be best acquainted sure
with my own self,) <hi>That I ne're saw fear, but<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Face of an Enemy.</hi> I cou'd as easily prove one
Leg of me may have <hi>Rambled</hi> out of a Whale, and
a piece of my left Hip from the Shoulder-blade
of an Elephant,—for might not some of my
<hi>Grandfathers</hi> be left in <hi>Greenland (we have been
Travellers of old)</hi> and there forc'd to eat Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sritters,
or not to go so far; who knows but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Elephant was burnt in the Booth (I tell
no lyes, every body knows this is true) the Dirt
and Rubbish might be thrown out in the Fields,
where <hi>Pease</hi> might be afterwards Sown, and so a
piece of the Elephant brought home to <hi>Evanders
Table,</hi> in a Dish of Green-Pease. Now all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
here will be, whether or no I use to eat
<hi>Green-Pease;—</hi> but for the Truth of this, I
Appeal to <hi>Stocks-Market, and all the Neighbours.</hi>

                     <p>And so I'm got <hi>home agen,—</hi> but must immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
take a Journey to <hi>Graffham,</hi> my well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Town of <hi>Graffham,</hi> and find my self <hi>in my
Mothers Belly,—</hi> just Rambled <hi>out of nothing,</hi> or
next to't, nôthing like what I am now, into a
little live thing, hardly as big as a Nit. Should
I tell you, as the <hi>virtuosi</hi> do, that I was shaped

well, when my Tail <hi>Rambled off,</hi> and a pair of

have once left them, at least I can assure ye, I
find it necessary to expatiate, for as the Fellow
said in <hi>Quixot,</hi> who blew up a Dog like a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>d'ye think 'tis nothing to write a Book?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I might probably have told you the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
my Nurse and I made one another, before
I left her <hi>Tuition,</hi> in the last Chapter—but <hi>O!
my Mother, O! my dearest Muz!</hi> why did you
leave me? Why did you go so soon, so very
soon away,—<hi>Nurses</hi> are careless, sad careless
Creatures; and alas the young <hi>Evander</hi> may get
a knock in his Cradle if you dye and leave him
to shift for himself: Your Death leads me to
the <hi>House of weeping;—</hi> it spoils all my <hi>Pastimes,</hi>
dissipates all my <hi>Remains,</hi> kills all my <hi>Maggots—</hi>
persecutes me, destroys me, makes a <hi>Martyr</hi> of
me, and sets my very Brains a <hi>Rambling</hi> agen, as
much as my Feet have been:—But what does
all this avail,—could I get all the <hi>Irish Howlers</hi>
between <hi>Carickfergus,</hi> and t'other side of <hi>Dublin</hi>
to hoot and hollow over her Grave, they'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bring her to <hi>Life agen,—</hi> for she was dead.—I
forgot all this while to tell you that, forgive
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62151:38"/>
Reader the <hi>Extravagance of my Grief;</hi> which
leads my <hi>Fancy,</hi> and that my <hi>Memory</hi> along with
it, and then <hi>Iudgment</hi> we know has such a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon both, that in plain English, I wish. I
don't turn <hi>a meer Natural:—</hi> I tell you agen she's
<hi>Dead—</hi> what wou'd you have, <hi>my Mother is
Dead,</hi> and worse can't happen unless <hi>Iris dye,—</hi>
but alas—she was then but an Egg—or my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,—and
he too is since departed. Did the
<hi>Roman Orator</hi> with so many Tears bemoan the
Death of his <hi>Virtuous Dear Mother,</hi> and shall
not I, though no <hi>Roman,</hi> make as long an Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on a Mother, <hi>full as Dear, and full as Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</hi>
But alas! <hi>Grief</hi> is tedious to any besides
those who feel it, who take a pleasure even
in thus tormenting themselves. Not therefore
to acquaint the Reader with her <hi>Trances, Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
and wondrous Visions</hi> in the other World,
where she took <hi>Lodgings</hi> for three days, and then
out of tenderness, <hi>Rambled back again</hi> to see
me her <hi>Dear Evander.</hi> (The very thought of
which—does yet—well,—but I'm a Man)
which is sufficiently known to be true by all
those that knew her:</p>
                     <p>Not, I say to force any thing on a Mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
which he himself has n't an inclination to
Swallow, I'll only tell you in brief, that <hi>my Dear
Mother Sicken'd and dy'd, and came to Life agen,</hi>
just as they were putting her into the Coffin to
bury her; and <hi>Lives a fortnight,</hi> and then
sicken and <hi>dy'd agen,</hi> and was bury'd in good
earnest, and almost broke my Heart, and my
Fathers, tho' <hi>little wretch</hi> as I was, I hardly
then knew my loss, <hi>nor does the World yet know
it;</hi> but it shall if I can, do it.—She was born,—I
won't tell you where, for I'm <hi>ill-natured</hi> with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62151:39"/>
my Sorrows: The <hi>Daughter</hi> of,—I won't tell
you who;—for if I prove otherwise than well,
there will be <hi>a good Family Disgraced:—</hi> If you
ask what she was, that I'll tell you,—she was
a <hi>Woman, yet no Woman,</hi> but an <hi>Angel.</hi> I say an
<hi>arrant</hi> Angel, as ever appeared upon this unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Earth, only she assumed a <hi>real lasting</hi> Body;
and continued in it some thirty or forty years to
<hi>teach the World Virtue,</hi> while other <hi>Angels</hi> use to
make but little stay among us, and then like
<hi>Astrea,</hi> flew home agen, because she <hi>found the
World</hi> Incorrigible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>She was the paragon of Perfection, and Loadstar of
all Eyes and Hearts; and well might my Dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Travel seven years after her Death,</hi> before he
Marryed agen, for had he don't, not seven, nor
seventeen, nor seventy, but seven hundred, he'd
ne're have lit upon such another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>She was the pattern of Wives, Queen of Mothers,
best of Friends, and indeed,</hi> as my Father used to
say truly of her, had all the <hi>Virtues of her Sex in
her little Finger;—</hi> what had she then think ye
all her <hi>Body over?</hi> To say more than all, she was
a <hi>very Iris,</hi> only a few years older, and well
worthy to be the <hi>Mother of Evander,</hi> were he but
as worthy to be <hi>her Son.—</hi> Nay—but she shan't
think to scape without some Poetry on her Death,—No,
<hi>all my Relations</hi> shall know what 'tis to have
a Poet kin to 'em.</p>
                     <l>—She did—she did—I saw her mount the Skye,</l>
                     <l>And with new Whiteness paint the Galaxy;</l>
                     <l>Heaven her methought with all its Eyes did view,</l>
                     <l>And yet acknow'edg'd all its Eyes too few.</l>
                     <l>Methought I saw in crouds bless'd Spirits meet,</l>

                        <hi>In the last Chapter,</hi> I had clean forgot to give
you the <hi>History of the second Globe,</hi> which having
such a direct aspect on the Body of all the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Relation, and the <hi>Epitome</hi> of <hi>my Life,</hi>
ought by no means to be omitted.</p>
                     <p>—There you may see, if you'll take the pains
but to turn over to the <hi>Frontispiece,</hi> my <hi>old Crone</hi>
of a Nurse, ay and such a Nurse as I'd not envy
<hi>Iupiter his she-goat</hi> who suckled him, in a kind of
Rapture and Prophecy, presenting the <hi>Furniture
of my future Life—</hi> the Tools I was to set up with
in the <hi>universal Trade of Rambling;</hi> a Hobby-<hi>Horse,</hi>
which you'll see will one of these days cast his
Tail, and have four Leggs start out in the room
on't: A pair of <hi>little Boots—</hi> yet a great deal
too big for my little Leggs—<hi>A Staff—</hi> for
sometimes I paid it on Ten-toes—tho' that
has a stronger twang of <hi>Sancho</hi> than his Master,
and is directly against the most sacred Rules of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62151:40"/>
                        <hi>Knight Errantry,</hi> and never to be done, unless

you may read at large in <hi>Don Bellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
of Greece,</hi> or the seven Champions.</p>
                     <p>—But I don't well understand what comes
after—there seems a little malicious sting i' the
Tail on't—<hi>A Sword too it may be—</hi> Why does
he think I'll Ramble without a Sword—or does
he make a <hi>may be</hi> on't, whether I shall ever
have one of my own?</p>
                     <p>Now dare I venture a shoulder of Mutton to
a <hi>penny Commons,</hi> that 'twas some Shcollard or other
writ these Verses, who finding at the University
they had but <hi>one Sword belonging to one Colledge,</hi> and
a pair of <hi>Boots between three more,</hi> which they ride
out with <hi>by turns,</hi> while the other stay at home in
their own defence, concluded strait that things
went at the same rate <hi>all the World over;—</hi> No,

a Sword of my own, and that those may know
too who know me—or you either Sir, I'll as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

ye I have Wit enough to keep all close, and not

let you know what 'twas; this however I care
not if I tell you—that the very hopes of <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi>
the Prospect of seeing a <hi>new Part of the
World,</hi> or indeed a <hi>New World</hi> to me, striking
upon the strings of my Soul, before wound to
the same pitch, made most <hi>charming Musick,</hi> and
had you seen then the <hi>young Evander—</hi> who
now he sets up for <hi>Rambling</hi> indeed, does a <hi>new
thing,</hi> and gets a Horse-back, is resolv'd to have
a <hi>New Name</hi> too, and henceforth when he thinks

what a <hi>brisk Air</hi> he then put on, how <hi>lively and

you and Posterity some account of it, as my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

The least I can say in its Praise is this—</p>

                        <l>If wholsome Air, Earth, Woods, and pleasant Springs,</l>
                        <l>Are Elements whereby a Town is grac'd,</l>
                        <l>If strong and stately Bowers Contentment brings,</l>
                        <l>Such is the Town of <hi>Graffham,</hi> and so plac'd:</l>
                        <l>There Nature Art, Art Nature hath embrac'd,</l>
                        <l>Without, within, below, aloft, compleat;</l>
                        <l>Delight and State are there both interlac'd,</l>
                        <l>And Forrune smiles to make all fair and great.</l>
                        <l>There Houses are with Histories repleat,</l>
                        <l>Divine, Humane, all mutual Pleasures giving,</l>
                        <l>With work so lively,—exquisite and neat,</l>
                        <l>As if Mans Art made Mortal Creatures living.</l>
                        <l>Pleasure it self doth here in triumph ride,</l>
                        <l>To make the Place the ground of all her Pride.</l>
                        <l>When Brass did on the Golden Age intrude,</l>
                        <l>A happy Fate sure did this place seclude;</l>
                        <l>Where every Look doth feast the curious Eye,</l>
                        <l>And bids the Soul gaze on eternally.</l>
                        <l>The naked Rocks are not unfruitful here,</l>
                        <l>But at some certain seasons every year,</l>
                        <l>Their barren tops with lushious Food abound,</l>
                        <l>And with the Eggs of various Fowls are crown'd.</l>
                        <l>So sweet the Air, so moderate the Clime,</l>
                        <l>None sickly live, or dye before their time.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>Several <hi>Excellencies</hi> there are from whence any
Place uses to be commended by Authors, few or
none of which but exactly agree to that of my
<hi>Nativity</hi>—and the first of them is—<hi>Air</hi>—that
Dish we feed on <hi>every Minute,</hi> and that
without surfeiting, unless it gets into the Head
or Belly; and this Nature has so oblig'd the
Town of <hi>Graffham</hi> with, that she has no need to
send for Bottled Air home, nor send her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62151:42"/>
abroad to a healthier place than her own,
when out of order.</p>
                     <p>The second thing that doth even <hi>nobilitate</hi> our
little Parish, is their <hi>Wooll</hi>—Now you know
what a splutter formerly there was about this
Subject: An honest Fellow had got him a couple
of <hi>fat Weathers,</hi> and to keep 'em safe, secur'd
'em in a Garden, just o' the outside of 's House—but
all wou'd n't do, for the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Sheep-stealers as they were, having
smelt out where they graz'd, seiz'd upon 'em
all, and for what Reason or Cause but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the <hi>Wooll,</hi> as well as the sweetness
of the <hi>Mutton</hi>—on both which Accounts they
were call'd—<hi>The Golden-Fleece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You have heard of <hi>Miletus</hi> I'm sure, you I
mean my Learned Readers, tho' you can't tell
where to find it now,—one of the most <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Cities of Greece,</hi> Mother that she was of
Eighty Colonies; not was it less renowned for
the fineness of her <hi>Wooll</hi> than for the Stateliness
of her Buildings.</p>
                     <p>They may talk of the <hi>Royal Purple,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Scarlet, and <hi>Tyrtan</hi> Dy, and I know n't
what Fiddle-faddles—but what colour amongst
'em all can compare with <hi>native Innocence?</hi> and for
that—<hi>trust Graffham,</hi> show for show, against
all the world:—Here's that shall challenge
<hi>Lemster, Cotswold,</hi> and all the <hi>Wolds</hi> and <hi>Downs</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>white as Honour, Chastity and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and as pure as the Body and Soul of the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Iris.</p>
                     <p>The third is, the tallness, altitude, or <hi>Maypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losity</hi>
of our <hi>Church and Steeple,</hi> erected so lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(as how can it chuse? being at the top of a
Hill,) as that it appears the very <hi>Metropolitan</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62151:42"/>
of all the little Villages which like Handmaids
wait at awfull distance about us. What care I
for their <hi>Steeple-</hi> crown'd <hi>Pharos,</hi> that lookt a
hundred mile round—or the Monumental <hi>Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass</hi>—that
pretty <hi>Stripling</hi> of 24 Years growth,
which, as the <hi>Fellow</hi> said of the Ship, If it grows
at this rate till 'tis a hundred year old, what a
Monster will 't be! Let <hi>Bow-steeple,</hi> and <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
Steeple, and <hi>Grantham</hi> Steeple run to Seed
as far as they will, and give the very Clouds a
Glyster, or rather Suppositor,—I say <hi>Graffham
Steeple is Graffham Steeple</hi> still—and there's an
end on't.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth is,—The <hi>Excellency of the Soil,</hi>
which is so fat and lushious that it doth even
<hi>flow with Milk and Honey,</hi> not to mention <hi>Curds
and Butter-milk,</hi> You may think this is a <hi>Poetical
rant,</hi> but 'tis as true as I ever was in <hi>Boston;</hi>
for I remember very well, my Father kept <hi>seven</hi>
Cows in <hi>Glebe-field,</hi> besides a <hi>Red-Cow</hi> in the
Close behind the <hi>Parsonage-house,</hi> and a <hi>Bull</hi> in
the Common, and 'tis hard luck if out of all
them we had not <hi>milk</hi> enough without <hi>scoring
up behind the Door.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for <hi>Honey,</hi> we had a <hi>whole street</hi> of little
Thatcht Houses by the side of our Orchard-wall,
where, if the Reader won't believe there's
<hi>Honey,</hi> let him go thrust his Head in and taste
it, where he 'll find a company of <hi>little angry
Gentlemen</hi> within will abundantly satisfie him of

                     <p>Next for the <hi>variety of our sweet and wholsom
Springs,</hi> distributed by the <hi>prudent Artifice</hi> of old
Dame Nature into sundry convenient places of
our Palaces: Some issuing out of an <hi>opake Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave,</hi>
as if once the <hi>Nymphs kept Court i' th' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side:</hi>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62151:43"/>
Others <hi>dribling down daintily</hi> from the worn
face of an old Rock, whose blubber'd Cheeks
were always troubled with a <hi>Rheumatism.</hi> Some
agen just peeping out of ground thro' a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Pebbles, you'd think 'em only the <hi>sweat
of the Earth,</hi> and growing still stronger and
stronger, at last increase to that Bulk, that by
intercepting its <hi>chrystal waves,</hi> and circumobject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Clods of Earth and Hurdles, the <hi>Countrey
Swains,</hi> made thereof a Mathematical Engin cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>Sheep-pond,</hi> which none has better reason to
remember than <hi>Kainophilus,</hi> who at a certain
Sheep-Sheering getting hold of a Sturdy-Ram,
was hurried away by the obstreperous Creature,
and both together sous'd over head and ears in
the imprison'd Waters,—I have good reason
too to remember that,—for when I came
Home dripping all the way,—my Father gave
me a Remembrance which sufficiently warmed
my inside though it did not dry that without.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Sixth thing</hi> for which our Town of
<hi>Graffham</hi> is remarkably recommentlable, is their
famous <hi>Breed of Horses.</hi> O with what inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
content and satisfaction have I seen those
<hi>Cicurable</hi> Animals, hearken to the sweet Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his <hi>Rustical Curator?</hi> Shall <hi>I</hi> ever forget
those ravishing Accents,—<hi>Ree—Gee—hoe</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—and
the rest of 'em. Well—these
<hi>Horses</hi> are certainly very docible Creatures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
our <hi>Graffhamites,</hi> and deserve for ought <hi>I</hi>
know to be placed in the Skies, as well as either
<hi>Pegasus or Pacolets.</hi>—But now we talk of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
what think you of that famous Grecian
Horse, called <hi>Bucephalus</hi> the Great, a true Pad
to the scarce greater <hi>Alexander,</hi>—and yet
these <hi>brave Creatures</hi> ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62151:43"/>
for that silly Animal was frighted at his own sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and flung, and flounc'd about like a mad
thing,—whereas to my knowledg 'tis not a small
matter will fright our more generous <hi>Graffham</hi>-Horses,
which are so far from Inclinations to
scampering, that I have seen 'em stand as <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
and careless under Whip, Spur,</hi> Staff and
Wand, as if they were above the <hi>brutall methods</hi>
of Force and Violence, and I'd fain know what
<hi>Horse</hi> is fit for a War-Horse, if not such a one
as won't stir an inch though he feels a <hi>Lump of
Steel in the very Guts of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But more than <hi>Horses, Wells, Springs, Rivers,
Churches, Steeples</hi> and all, is that most amiable <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
Peace, Amity and Love,</hi> which time out of

us,—Do but see how infectious these foul great

wou'd live like the Old man of <hi>Verona?</hi>—Come
I'll tell you the Story, because 'tis a <hi>pretty one,</hi>
and every body don't know it. Once upon a time
there was an <hi>Old-man,</hi> a very Old-man Sir, that
liv'd at <hi>Verona</hi> (or <hi>Millan</hi> 'twas, I can't tell
which,) and there this <hi>Old-man Sir,</hi> had never
bin out of this City all the days of his Life,—was
n't that a very <hi>strange thing?</hi> but 'twill be stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
yet. So Sir it fell out that once upon a time,
O! but I shou'd ha' told ye before, that he
was three score,—I think 'twas <hi>threescore,—ay
three-score years old.</hi> Now this <hi>Old-man</hi> Sir, as
I was saying, of three-score years old, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bin without the Gates of the City in all his
Life:—Did you ever hear the like? So Sir upon
this the <hi>Duke of Millain, if 'twas Millain,</hi> hearing
of this strange <hi>Old-man</hi> Sir, was resolv'd to try
Experiments, and therefore forbid him as he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to live, not to stir <hi>one foot</hi> out of the City
upon pain of Death. Now what does this <hi>Old-Fool</hi>
Sir do, but because he cou'd not <hi>Ramble</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
tho' he'ed n'ere any mind to't before, but
now 'twas forbidden Sir, <hi>only because 'twas forbidden,</hi>
had a months mind to go out o' Town, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he cou'd n't do't, took pet upon't, and
broke's heart Sir, and dy'd;—so there is an end
of one that like <hi>a Snail wou'd keep at home</hi> while he
might have <hi>Rambled,</hi> and cou'd not do't when he
wou'd have don't. And a fair warning 'tis to all
such as are <hi>Enemies to Rambling:</hi>—now what

                     <p>Alas that's not the way to deal with <hi>humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
there requires a great deal of art to form such

why we speak no more <hi>Latin,</hi> nor more flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
in <hi>England,</hi> is because these Intendants of
School-Masters <hi>Dragoon us thus out of our Mother
Tongue,</hi>—they use us not like <hi>rational Creatures.</hi>—A
Dog that is taught to fetch and carry, has
more <hi>sweet words,</hi> and sewer sowre knocks and
blows, than we <hi>poor Curs</hi> generally meet withall,
which before we can come to tast the <hi>sweets of
Learning</hi> and good Authors, sets us against even
what ever <hi>looks like a Book,</hi>—(so that indeed I
wonder how I came so much as to <hi>trade</hi> in 'em.)</p>
                     <p>Not but that I iustly <hi>honour and respect</hi> those
ingenious men, who little other than devote
themselves for their <hi>Countreys sake</hi> to <hi>beat Greek
and Latin,</hi> as <hi>Oldham</hi> wittily calls it, and drive
Learning, if possible, into such <hi>Block-heads</hi> as I
was—not. Who by <hi>mild Arts,</hi> and attempring
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62151:48"/>
their Methods to the disposition of the Lads
they have to deal with, can do more in <hi>four
years</hi> with 'em, than others in seven, ten, or
ten hundred. The <hi>Happiness</hi> of those Youth
who fall into such hands, is more than they
are sensible of; and 'tis confess'd the Reason
why so many <hi>Tyrants, Fools and Dunces,</hi> who
usurp that honourable Employment is because
the World has seldom wit enough to give such
as are otherwise their <hi>due respect</hi> and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
                     <p>However 'tis, happy was I when my Father
took me home out of their <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and taught
me himself—But first I must tell you what
were my <hi>chiefest Rambles</hi> while in their Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                     <p>Two or three I had which were like to be

taken a <hi>kind Farewell,</hi> which had like to have
been our last: As I was <hi>Rambling home</hi> by a

with such odd Accidents—this I'm sure you'll

been dead to this day,—and there had been an

(not <hi>Iames Rex,</hi> but another whose Name begins
with the same Letters) methinks I have him still
before my Eyes,—how he startled when I
<hi>flounc'd</hi> into the Water, thinking belike t'had
been some <hi>Spaniel Dog</hi> or other,—how after I
was under Water, he got upon his Breech, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
his Eyes, and lookt about him to see what
was the matter, <hi>(for he has told me all the story
since)</hi> and lastly how he saw my Heels <hi>capering</hi>

both in my Cloaths and Belly, and held me up
by the <hi>Heels</hi> so long till I thought my Guts
wou'd have dropt out at my <hi>Mouth,</hi> or at least
I should have gone to <hi>Stool at the wrong end.</hi> Nor
yet cou'd I find 'i' my heart to be angry with
him, <hi>so grateful is my Nature,</hi> for thus saving my
Life, when I was within six <hi>Gasps</hi> precisely of
feeding the Fishes:—I say precisely, for sure I
shou'd best know the measure of my own Belly, for
that must unavoidably have burst with <hi>six go-downs</hi>
more of that uncomfortable Element:—<hi>So there's

<hi>whether,</hi> I out of a <hi>Childish</hi> wantonness gathered
a <hi>bearded Ear</hi> of Grass or Corn, and put it into

never lov'd <hi>constraint from my Infancy:</hi> That
which I can otherwise naturally and easily do,

whereof,</hi> over which a Man has a particular

when I injoyn the most necessary, most pleasing

He had oftentimes it seems in his young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

one of the Company to me? <hi>No I answered,</hi> how
should I, ne'er having seen him before?—Why,
says he agen, 'Tis the Prodigal <hi>Son of Mr.</hi>—of—who
as young as he is, has already spent <hi>Five
hundred a year in drink:</hi>—which was not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
so low but the <hi>forlorn Pilgrim</hi> overheard him,
and turning back, briskly replyed agen, <hi>Yes, that

sharp Repartee so pleas'd us, that we
took him into a kind of a <hi>Crab-Tavern,</hi> and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him share in half a dozen Bottles of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
left him as great as <hi>a King,</hi> and as happy for
a few hours, as if he had his Five hundred a year
agen:—Well thought I in my little head,

this shall be a fair Warning to me, if ever I
get <hi>five hundred a year, or a thousand either,</hi> never
to spend it so foolishly as this Fellow has done,

when Duty or good manners require it, <hi>but I
am as stiff as a Stake, and my Hamms as obdurate
as a</hi> Spaniards, <hi>where I meet with a proud Fellow,
whom I have no Obligation to flatter or Honour.</hi> I
did as much to my new Mother, and almost
half a hundred Grand-fathers, and great Grand-mothers,
saluting likewise in the most compt,
and yet ample manner, all those, not a few <hi>Well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds,</hi>
whom I found there met to congratulate my
arrival—<hi>but what's this to you, perhaps you may ask me?</hi>
Ay, but tis a great deal to me, and a very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>part of my Life,</hi> for as you'll find the <hi>Plot
thickens apace,</hi> and the hinge of all my future For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
is just upon turning—For here my <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
himself taking me to task, and instructing
me with a <hi>mildness and gravity peculiar to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
both inthe Languages and Arts, had if possible
made me a Scholar:</hi> For which he had all along
designed me, hoping as much from my <hi>blooming</hi>

He found me soon, if without a <hi>Solaecism,</hi> in
modesty of my self I may say it, as extremely
industrious: so not altogether indocil. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>intirely submissive</hi> to his Inclinations, I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
had he pleased, to have been a <hi>Scholar in
spite of nature,</hi> and accordingly advance I did,
but at a very uncomfortable rate, much as fast
as a Cart with half a wheel broke off. For the
truth is, the <hi>sprightfulness</hi> and vigour of my
Soul, being by the severity of my <hi>former</hi> Master,
either damm'd up, and quite extinguish'd, or
else turn'd another way from Learning, towards
some more <hi>Rambling Entertainment,</hi> it could not
be expected I should do any great wonders. He
try'd me then at the <hi>Arts and Sciences,</hi> giving
me a <hi>little smack</hi> of all to see whether that
would make me more in love with <hi>Learning;</hi>
but alas! all was the same. I only could <hi>beat</hi>
enough of 'em into my head to laugh or rail
at 'em a little; which way you'l find by and
by I shall exercise (either my <hi>Memory,</hi> or) my
<hi>Invention.</hi>

                     <p>My Father at last finding all his <hi>Drudgery</hi> and
<hi>mine</hi> was in vain, and being rather willing to
make a <hi>Golden Trades-man</hi> than a <hi>Woodden Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>

a long seven-years Apprenticeship to grief

and by the perswasion of his dearest Friends, or

studied <hi>Physick</hi> to divert his Melancholy, and

her name here in words at length.</p>
                     <p>I'll not attempt to number all the <hi>great and

<hi>hardly can I pronounce which is most so.</hi> However,
all the Interest in the World shall never make
me say, a <hi>false</hi> or a <hi>base</hi> thing of him; and what
I shall write shall be enough to let the World
know it never had, nor never will find his <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi>
For tho' I don't remember he had the
<hi>gift of Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62151:64"/>
yet I can aver he had a quality much
more profitable, he was <hi>thrifty, and frugal, and
careful for his Family,</hi> gave his Sisters portions,
and left a good Estate, and plentiful Fortunes
among his own <hi>hopeful Children,</hi> which inmy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is commendation enough for <hi>one Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And tho' I might add a thousand more, this
in a manner would include, as it excels all the
rest; and shall I ever be able while I breathe
to reflect on such a <hi>Father</hi> without <hi>hugging his
memory,</hi> and almost idolatrously adoring his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Ashes? And indeed I don't much wonder
Idolatry first crept into the World by the <hi>fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Children</hi> to their deceased Parent, for I
could hardly ever behold the <hi>dear Picture</hi> of my
dead Father (by the same token it used to hang
up behind door in the great Parlour) without
almost kneeling to't, <hi>washing it with my Tears,</hi>
and then licking 'em off again.</p>
                     <p>—But here being a very convenient <hi>Loophole,</hi>
I can't forbear a little <hi>Ramble</hi> into the fertil
common place of <hi>Children's Duty and Love to
their Parents,</hi> both dead and living, and shall
present the Reader with several pat, pert, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
stories to that purpose.</p>
                     <p>How much we are obliged to our <hi>Parents</hi> can
never be enough accounted; that we are so
both for our <hi>Education and Being</hi> is equally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
<hi>Being</hi> is no doubt, in it self consider'd,
without the appendages of any other good, a
great happiness: From our Parents, even the
worst of men let 'em be, this we at least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
But more—they bring us into such a
state where every man may have a <hi>tolerable degree
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62151:64"/>
of happiness</hi> if it been't his own fault. <hi>Quisque
suae fortunae faber—</hi> every Man is the <hi>Brick-layer</hi>
of his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ood Fortune—(<hi>or Smith, or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter,
which you please.</hi>) If therefore any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that Being their <hi>Parents</hi> gave 'em makes 'em
only miserable, and therefore they been't ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to thank 'em for't, they argue very ill,
and besides very disingenuously, blaming others
for what they brought on themselves, and full
as justly may <hi>Mankind</hi> blame him that made 'em
for all the miseries they could not have felt had
they not had a <hi>Being,</hi> whereas all of 'em were
<hi>chosen and brought</hi> on themselves by their own
Folly.</p>
                     <p>If they'll yet object, 'tis n't in a Mans choice
to be <hi>poor</hi> or not, for then none wou'd chuse it;
'tis easily answer'd, that 'tis perhaps much more
so than is generally concluded, most persons by
<hi>carelesness</hi> reducing themselves to these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and then falling foul both on <hi>Heaven</hi>
and <hi>Earth</hi> for making 'em so—<hi>Has thy Parent
given thee Being, and can he do no more?—</hi> why
he has done very fairly for thee already—he
has made thee a <hi>Freeman of the World, and thou
hast a range of one and twenty thousand Miles to
seek thy Fortune in;</hi> and how many are there who
raise themselves and Families on no larger a
stock, nay, <hi>at first all did so.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Dost thou say thou art not obliged to Parents
for thy Being, because they gave it thee for
their own <hi>pleasure,</hi> or out of Instinct, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<hi>necessity of Nature—</hi> that's a very false, as
well as a most unmannerly way of arguing, for
it indeed destroys the <hi>nature of all Benefits,</hi> and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62151:65"/>
makes no such thing as obligation in the World.
The Argument is fairly thus—we are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to any Man for any good turn, he does us
in which he takes pleasure, or which mounts
to the very same thing, which he does for his
own <hi>pleasure,</hi> or which he can't avoid—which
he has a necessity for, that is indeed which he
cannot without some pain or inconvenience to
himself forbear doing. For to be fair it can rise
no higher. Now lay this rule to any benefit in
the World, and see, by Mr. <hi>Seneca</hi>'s <hi>leave,</hi>
what work 'twill make with it.</p>
                     <p>I do the most virtuous action, the <hi>bravest</hi>
thing in the World, undoubtedly for my own
<hi>pleasure</hi> or happiness, and that is and ought to
be the chief end for which I perform it, for
why I'd fain know, do I relieve any that's mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but for the pleasure I my self <hi>feel in doing
it?</hi> if not yet lower, as some ill-natur'd Persons
interpret, for the pain of not doing it, the
weakness and kind of <hi>Incontinence</hi> in my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that I can't see a Person unhappy, but I
must feel his sore Leg, thin Jaws, or hungry
Belly.</p>
                     <p>Yet more will they own they are obliged to
Parents for a <hi>good Education,</hi> if not for what in
the World, and yet what's this but a <hi>piece of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—</hi>
as great a necessity and pleasure as the
giving 'em being. <hi>Pleasure is Interest—Honour
is the same—</hi> both are engaged in handsomly
breeding up those whom we brought into the
World. What is the Nature of a Benefit or
Obligation? If 'tis possible to be known we
may fix its Notion to a Being given us. A
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62151:65"/>
Persons being obliged to perform a <hi>good turn</hi>
cannot alter the property—if 'tis fair arguing
from contraries, and none ever yet deny'd it;
why then if the not doing what I'm oblig'd, to
deserves disgrace and dispraise, and is an injury,
then doing what I ought and am bound to do
merits Honour, Praise, and Acknowledgment.
'Tis in vain, as those old towring <hi>Philosophers</hi>
did very often, to sit <hi>twisting fine Notions</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that were too high either for <hi>Truth</hi> or
<hi>Practice;</hi> and when brought down, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to the <hi>Scene of Life,</hi> will never
square, nor serve for any living thing. The
<hi>freest</hi> thing in the World I may be obliged to
by the most <hi>indispensible tyes,</hi> which yet if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
deserves the <hi>clearest</hi> and loudest acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
the Nature of Man can give. <hi>What
is freer than a generous Mans raising a brave Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate?</hi>
What's he more obliged to do?
What can he take more pleasure in? What
can be a greater obligation to the Person so
rais'd?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>—Well—this 'tis to read</hi> Seneca—one No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
begets another, and so to the end o' the
Chapter, while my <hi>poor Father's forgot</hi> all this
while as much as if he never Begot me—so
did not <hi>Boleslaus—</hi> that excellent King of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi>
who never enter'd upon any Important
Action, but out he pulls the <hi>Picture of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and after gazing on't, as if't had been his
Mistresses—and serving it as I did mine, he
used solemnly to desire he might never do any
thing <hi>unworthy of so great a Progenitor.</hi> Was not
he an ugly Rogue of a Fellow? And did he not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62151:66"/>
well deserve such a horrid <hi>Death</hi> as got hold of
him, who when his poor <hi>old Father</hi> came to his
House for a Meals Meat, he having a <hi>fat Capon
for Dinner,</hi> and seeing the old Man about to
come in (a greedy-gut Bastard as he was for
his pains,) claps me up the <hi>Capon Dish, and all
under the Table,</hi> and persuades his Father they
had nothing for Dinner but <hi>Rack-staves—</hi> on
which he shabbing off again to seek a Dinner
where he cou'd catch it, or else Dine with <hi>Duke
Humphrey,</hi> this Rascally Son of his pulls out
the Dish again, and thought to be at it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
up to the <hi>knuckles</hi> and fetch up all the time
he had lost—when—<hi>O! Lo! Behold wonder!</hi>
this fat Capon was turn'd, metamorphos'd or
transmogriphy'd into a huge over-grown <hi>fat
Toad—</hi> fough upon't! And in half a twinkling
shot up like an Arrow, and caught this <hi>unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Wretch</hi> by the Throat, pinching him like a
<hi>Crab</hi> till it made him yell again, then crawling
up to his Mouth and Nose, there it sate <hi>pissing
and spewing,</hi> and spitting Venom at him till he
dropt down dead, and never spoke word
more.</p>
                     <p>And lest I shou'd have the same <hi>ill Fortune</hi>
(though I confess I did not see the Man after he
was dead) I'm resolv'd to make much of my
Father, when he is not only <hi>old, but dead,</hi> and
not only <hi>dead, but rotten;</hi> though his Name
smells sweeter than Balsom, sweet as the Breath
of my fragrant Aromatical Iris.</p>
                     <p>Ay and <hi>Dead</hi> he is sure enough, after he had
carefully bound me <hi>Prentice,</hi> as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and you shall hear hereafter—he's as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62151:66"/>
dead as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar—</hi> tho' his Fame shall
never die, while either his Son, or his Son's
Son shall remain alive.
<hi>(This Ramble is my Son.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>when and how did he die?</hi> and where?
and wherefore? and for what Reason—<hi>Quis?
quid? ubi? quibus?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>when,</hi> I answer, <hi>Nov. 4. 1676. An.
Aetat.</hi> 48. and that's as much as many an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Man <hi>gets for his Epitaph—but every honest
Man is not my Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And being dead 'twill be very convenient to
give him <hi>speedy Burial,</hi> tho' not very speedy nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—one
may be too hasty in that matter.
<hi>Duns Scotus,</hi> as subtle a Head as my <hi>Father</hi> for
his Life, was fool'd out of this World at that
rate, and bury'd alive <hi>poor wretch,</hi> where he all
mawl'd his Face and Hands at such a rate against
the <hi>Cossin,</hi> that 'twou'd have griev'd ones Heart
to have seen him. To prevent which inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
his <hi>Relations</hi> wisely fearing my Father
might have <hi>three Lives,</hi> because my <hi>Mother had
two,</hi> who was so much weaker than him, <hi>kept
him above ground five days after</hi> his Death, to see
whether he intended to <hi>come back again;</hi> but
finding him in <hi>earnest,</hi> and still remaining in the
same <hi>sullen Humour,</hi> they then wou'd wait no
longer, but e'ne heav'd him into his last Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the <hi>Chancel—</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And there let him lye till I come to him—and
how sweetly shou'd he and I and <hi>Iris</hi> lye there toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one anothers Arms—Lye further Father;
you have got all the Bed to your self, and thrust us
out upon the very Bedsted, but tho' you had possession

first, yet two to one's odds.—However I'll be a
dutiful Son dead and living, and rather lye upon the
Boards than hurt your Ribs, which by this time may
be a little tender.</p>
                     <p>But well remember'd! I should have told
you <hi>how</hi> he dy'd before how he was <hi>Bury'd.</hi>—He
did it like an honest and <hi>brave Man,</hi> as he
had liv'd, and having lived so well almost fifty
years, certainly he cou'd ne're be to learn to die
well for one <hi>quarter of an hour.</hi> He lookt as if
he wou'd put Death out of Countenance, as if
he rather wish'd it than fear'd it—but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was <hi>frowardly</hi> weary of this life, but
<hi>rationally</hi> assured of a better Not like that Fool
of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> who after some three or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
years <hi>huffing God and Man,</hi> and pretending
to teach 'em both more than they knew before,
had not learn'd wit enough all that while to
know whither <hi>he was going,</hi> and cou'd leave no
wiser saying behind him than that of the poor
Heathen—<hi>Quae nunc abibis in Loca?</hi> He had found
a hole to creep out of the World at, and was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to take <hi>a long leap in the dark he cou'd not tell
whither.</hi> He dy'd then if we may properly use that
word of one who undoubtedly lives more now
than before, he has much the better by this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and <hi>Deaths Exchange</hi> was to him far from
being any Robbery.</p>

                     </p>

art thou sure of this, <hi>Evander?—</hi> then indeed 'twou'd be
worth the while.—<hi>Look over a little</hi> what thy warm <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi>
has thrown in faster than <hi>Reason</hi> cou'd weigh it.—If
a Man gives the Power of his Life away when he submits
to any Government, there's a great deal of difference between
Power and Act. He only submits to a <hi>higher Power</hi> than his
own, for the Preservation and Protection of his Life, as well
as of the whole Community, not the <hi>Destruction</hi> of it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he is born under a <hi>Government</hi> already (as all the World
now are) He does not here chuse Submission, nor so much
make as find it. The very Essence of a Man loses nothing
by the loss of a sick part, but his very <hi>Frame</hi> is dissolved
when the <hi>Essential Vnion</hi> of Soul and Body is once ruin'd.
The <hi>Body</hi> is rather fancied incurable in many cases than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
so.—'Tis impossible in the deepest pain or misery
to pronounce positively we shall ne'r be at Ease, or never
be Happy. We often make great Matters of what others
do, and we ought to laugh at and despise, and fancy a
<hi>scratch of a Pin</hi> is a Mortal Wound. We are not so tyed to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Object, but we may whenwe please mount to those that
are <hi>rational</hi> and Divine—not that even those are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd
or disused, the <hi>Body</hi> being an Essential part of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62151:78"/>
Man, and has therefore suitable Objects provided to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, and must always have some way or other, while 'tis
not a <hi>Carcase.</hi> Those who leave a <hi>real certain good</hi> for one
that's uncertain are never reckon'd very wise.—Nay, he
that <hi>quits</hi> his post, when order'd upon pain of Death to

one, will hardly come off well with his <hi>General.—</hi> How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
is't to expect the End without the Means, or the
<hi>close of a long Iourney</hi> without stepping one foot forwards.
<hi>This Life well spent</hi> is so much the way to a better, that there's
no other to't, and if any by-way is found, 'twill only after
<hi>long Wandrings</hi> bring you back agen faint and weary where
you <hi>first set out,</hi> or worse, lead you where you lose both that

                     <p>Towards so great and excellent a work that Prince of

and Orders,—<hi>The Poor</hi> by Impotency, Casualty and
Wickedness. For the <hi>first</hi> sort they provided (besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other particular <hi>Alms-houses</hi> of particular Persons and
Companies) <hi>Christ-Church</hi> Hospital, where so vast a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Fatherless Children</hi> of both Sexes are so handsomely
provided for.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>second—</hi> The Hospitals of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in

                           <p>The Explanation of the First Book of these
Rambles, and the Design of the whole.
Some foolish Objections Answer'd.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THough the World has been pretty just
to the <hi>First Volume</hi> of <hi>Evander</hi>'s <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
the Sale thereof not coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
his Expectations, or its own
Deserts, all such as have a <hi>true taste</hi> of Wit
and Humour justly hugging and admiring it;
<pb facs="tcp:62151:100"/>
yet some Objections there are and have been
made against it, either by the Envy or Folly
of some Persons in the World, the most of 'em,
'tis true, below our notice; which therefore we
shall answer as great Persons use to do, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ne're a word, nor so much as vouchsafing
'em mention in these <hi>Immortal Writings.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One only thing there is, which more for the sake
of peace and Quietness, for Decency, Profit,
and such prudential Considerations, lest it should
obstruct the <hi>rolling</hi> forward of the other <hi>Two and
twenty Globes</hi> yet behind in the Frontispiece, and
spoil the Sale of this, and what comes after,
thereby cheating the World of a most inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
Treasure now just ready to pop into their
<hi>Libraries:</hi> I say, for such like Causes as these,
rather than any Necessity in the nature of the
thing, <hi>Evander, Kainophilus</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Heads together, have resolved to give
a sound and formal Answer, that all the little
snarful <hi>Criticks</hi> may for ever after hold their
peace, or have their Dogs Teeth broke out by
the dint of ponderous Argument.</p>
                        <p>The main Objection then against this <hi>First
Book</hi> last past, as well as the whole Design, is
thus proposed by some wise ones; namely,
<hi>That they don't know what to make on't?</hi> They
can neither find beginning nor ending, head nor
tail, nor can't for their Lives tell what the
Author wou'd be at, what he drives at or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
in <hi>part</hi> or <hi>whole.</hi> What use, what profit,
what account it turns to, what 'tis good for;
how it answers the Name; how to reconcile
<hi>Book</hi> and <hi>Title,</hi> and make 'em kin to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                           <hi>A Pocket-Library;</hi> a Trap-stick 'tis; why
'tis'n't so much as a <hi>Catalogue,</hi> and my Pocket is
already sufficiently furnish't (quoth one Spark)
with a Manuscript-Library of my own or Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or Letters from <hi>Kainophil,</hi> eternally to supply
some certain Uses which only this new <hi>Library</hi>
is like to be employed in. However Paper is'n't yet
so dear, a Man must give Eighteen pence for a
Weeks wiping.—(Out you filthy Fellow, you
offend the nice <hi>Evander,</hi> and deserve to remain
as long imprison'd in the nasty place you prate
of, as the <hi>Iew</hi> who wou'd not come out on

Umph! but what Page shall we find it
in? The Author has quite forgot it, shatter'd
the business out of his thin Skull, and as the
<hi>Panegyrist</hi> before him, bin graciously pleas'd to
<hi>ramble to somewhat else.</hi> Here's indeed a parcel
of odd nonsensical Tales of <hi>Graffham</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove,</hi>
and a Country Bumkin coming to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and flying in the Air, and I know not
what; but what's all this all this while to a
<hi>Voyage about the World?</hi> Why this is ten times
worse than a Battel in <hi>Stylo recitativo.—</hi> The
Man writes Short-hand (quoth another witty
Rogue) and abbreviates <hi>Books</hi> into <hi>Pages,</hi> them
into Sentences, and them into Words, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Doggrel-Philosophy, Prose and Poetry
has shovel'd up such a Hodg-potch of stuff here,
as wou'd make a Hermit tear his Beard to
hear it.</p>
                        <p>Very well—when ye are out of breath, 'tis
hop'd a Man may get room to speak for himself.</p>

The first grave Complaint against this useful,
profitable, ingenious, admirable Book (with
modesty be it spoken) is, <hi>That People don't
know what to make on't.—</hi> And what if
they don't, <hi>Evander</hi> supposes 'twould puzzle a
good Logician to Analogyze all the famous Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the renowned Knight of the <hi>Mancha,</hi>
especially now <hi>P—s</hi> has made nonscence on't
by shifting the Scene, (one Page in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
the next in <hi>England.</hi>) Perhaps I had never any
mind you should know that I mean, nor what
to make on't—there lies all the Jest some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
and why might not I intend my Book
after the Tune of, <hi>I lent my Mony to my Friend?</hi>
Or, <hi>Riddle me, Riddle me?</hi> If <hi>Evander</hi> had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the World with the Second Edition of
the <hi>Horn-book,</hi> a <hi>Primmer</hi> in Folio, or a new
<hi>Protestant Tutor</hi> in Twenty four Volumes, then
't had been enough to let the World have
known what to make on't. Who knows not
<hi>that those things are most admired, which are least
understood?</hi> Unless the Infallible Church her self
be foully out, <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion;</hi>
nay it may be as much policy for me to have my
Book unintelligible, as for them to have their
Prayers, and all the rest of their Religion.—(Not
that I'm a <hi>Papist</hi> for all that,—No,—I
abominate both Flogging and Fasting as against
the Light of Nature, and as bad as Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,—one
of 'em as great an enemy to my
Back, as 'tother to my Belly;—but for Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
or so now and then, 'tis lawful to
pick a Flower, if one can find it, from e're a
Dunghil in Christendom.)</p>

                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62151:101"/>
This, supposing they could not understand
it, as another great Person said in a like case some
years past, I am't bound to find Sence both for
my Book and my Readers. 'Twould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
if I my self understood it, whether others
do so or no. And that I do, I am my self the
properest Judge.</p>
                        <p>But that the World mayn't think me morose
or envious, and to evidence the <hi>goodness of my
Nature</hi> by its being so communicative, I'll e'ne
for once make others as happy as my self.—<hi>Kainophilus</hi>
will tweak the World's great Nose,
open its Basin-Eyes, lug its stubborn Ears, and
lead it into the most intimate meaning of all
those <hi>precious things</hi> laid up in the sacred Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieves

                        <p>He undertakes so clearly to demonstrate the
pleasure, profit, and excellent advantage of the
Premisses, as to perswade any thing but an <hi>Vsurer</hi>
to purchase 'em, and lay 'em under the Pillow
every night, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did <hi>Homer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He'll prove as much, beyond contradiction,
That 'tis a true <hi>actual Voyage round the World,</hi>
ev'ry Word and Paragraph therein as Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
as the renowned <hi>Mandevil,</hi> and as Moral
as the famous History of <hi>Reynard the Fox;</hi> or
the last Edition of the same Book disguised under
the Title of the <hi>Hind and Panther.</hi> And that in
all these Heads, the Design is carried on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
the Method not confused, though
somewhat Cryptical, and requiring a little stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to crack the Shell, and get out the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Frontispiece,</hi> the <hi>Explanation,</hi> the <hi>Title-page</hi>
and <hi>Introduction</hi> make all this appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62151:102"/>
any trouble of telling it. The intent of the
<hi>whole,</hi> as therein appears, being to give a <hi>Iournal
of Life,</hi> and a <hi>Description of the wide World, and
some Memoirs relating to the Actions of one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Person from his Cradle to his Grave,</hi> into
which all the rest is most subtilly woven. But
who that Person is, let none be so hasty to
affirm. Those who dare be so presumptuous,
we shall meet with 'em in the next Chapter, and
perhaps <hi>more severely</hi> in other places, if they don't
mend their Manners, and mind their own Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                        <p>Now this <hi>single Life,</hi> whose soever 'tis, is
Hieroglyphically delineated in the Twenty four
<hi>Globes</hi> of the <hi>Frontispiece,</hi> none but his own
<hi>actual Rambles</hi> having the honour to be insculpt
thereon; wherein you see he is carried through
all the <hi>Scenes of Life,</hi> from his coming <hi>bare-b—'d
into the World,</hi> to his going in like manner out
on't, (which you may see most pleasantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
in the Twenty fourth and last <hi>Globe.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>Through all which and every part of it,
you'l find Directions for management of
your self in any state of Life, <hi>School-boy, Prentice,
Traveller, Soldier</hi> (not too much tho' of that)
<hi>Lover, Tradesman,</hi> and what not; with many
pleasant and useful Digressions with or without
Occasion, some of which will cure the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
if not as deep as any in <hi>Bedlam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That ever any Man in his Senses (but all are
not <hi>Evanders</hi>) should question the Usefulness of
this Design, and the past or following Volumes!
That in the first place 'twas highly <hi>useful to
Me,</hi> which none need doubt I think the <hi>principal
Verb,</hi> I can assure 'em by my own Experience,
t'has <hi>turn'd a penny</hi> these hard times; and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62151:102"/>
Thing, Design and Method being all new and
diverting, has taken so well, I have no reason
to be sorry of having obliged the World, since
that has done as much by me agen; an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of which, as well as of my Gratitude for
it, is this <hi>Second Volume.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor let any be so unjust to think the Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of this Work is confined to the Author
alone (though <hi>Charity begins at home</hi>) his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
being more generous and communicative,
and tending to the profit of others as well as
himself, upon more accounts than two or
three.</p>
                        <p>The first is, because <hi>'tis so pleasant,</hi> so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting,
so tickling, and all that to those who
do but understand the <hi>whim</hi> on't. To see a
Man describ'd and not describ'd, playing <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peep</hi>
with the World, and hiding himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
his Fingers; like <hi>Merry Andrew,</hi> clapping
his Conjuring-Cap on, and then crying, <hi>Who
sees me now?—</hi> thrusting his Head into a Bush,
and like a cunning sort of a Bird that comes
from the Moon (whither he is to take a <hi>Voyage</hi>
in one of these odd Books) and then defying
all the World (as <hi>Pembrook</hi> did) to know him
by his t'other end. I say, to see this ingenious
Author as close under the name of <hi>Kainophilus,</hi>
as <hi>Achates</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> in the Cloak of <hi>Venus,</hi>
seeing every Body, and hearing what Folks say
and censure of him, and none seeing or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him. What in the World can be a more
pleasant Spectacle, or better deserving the Motto
over the door where this monstrous sight
is to be seen,<hi>—Spectatum admissi risum teneatis
amici?</hi>

But alas, <hi>Evander'</hi>s Person, though diverting
enough, is far from being all the pleasant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of this Book. Here are not only wise

and <hi>Bumkin Fools, Prodigal Fools</hi> and <hi>Flint-fisted
Fools,</hi> Old, Young, and Middle-aged, <hi>Quarto's,
Folio's,</hi> and <hi>Decimo-Sexto's,</hi> enough to furnish all
the Shops from <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> to the <hi>Poultrey-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>How many Comical Remarks, and Merry
Fancies are stuck all over the Book, like an
<hi>Orange</hi> with <hi>Cloves,</hi> a Lover with Flowers, or
a Mad-man with Straws or Feathers,—not to
add a <hi>Traveller with Rambling Tales and Romances?</hi>
What think ye else of <hi>Evander'</hi>s <hi>Character</hi>
written by himself, at the beginning of the
Book, an inimitable Piece, and a Design hardly
ever before attempted, and that with as much
Justice to himself, as Diversion to the <hi>Reader?</hi>
What say ye, Mr. Critick, to all the <hi>Poetry</hi>
which shines through every part of it as thick
as the <hi>Stars in the milky way,</hi> or the Vertues
and Graces of the incomparable <hi>Iris?</hi> Of the
admirable and surprizing Novelty of both Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Method; representing <hi>a Book made, as it
were, out of nothing,</hi> and yet containing <hi>every
thing;</hi> the sweetness of the Groves, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness
of the Country, the purling of Streams,
and harmony of the Birds, and whistling of the
Winds, and singing of the Cuckoes, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of <hi>Evander.</hi> Then o' t'other side,
the Grandeur of the City described in a
method wholly new (of which more anon)
and all the Rarities therein described; the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62151:104"/>
Stateliness of its Palaces, the Magnificence of its
Churches, and the <hi>Honesty of its Booksellers,</hi> which
singular Subject richly merits a Volume as big
as all <hi>Tostatus</hi> together: But alas! is here for
want of room, wedg'd up into one or two
single Chapters, though neither the last Book,
nor this, nor their own, nor all the Shops nor
Walls in <hi>London</hi> or the World <hi>(that's a bold
word)</hi> are either strong enough, or large enough
or weighty enough to contain it.</p>
                        <p>But all this while, how will I make <hi>profit</hi>
of what's only <hi>pleasant?</hi> Why as easily as I
make this Book, and that before it. If <hi>Pleasure be
the chief Good,</hi> as some Philosophers perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensively
and innocently enough, if rightly taken,
have asserted, then whatever is <hi>pleasant,</hi> must
undoubtedly contain all other <hi>goods</hi> under them,
and among them the <hi>profitable ones.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But not to mount the Argument above the
vulgar Readers heads, and perhaps my own
too, 'tis plain enough that what's so pleasant
as this, must needs be profitable too another
way to the <hi>Body,</hi> by chearing the Spirits,
sweetning the Blood, dispelling black melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Fumes, and making it as <hi>brisk as a Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
just out of his Time,</hi> a Crack't Tradesman
newly Set-up again, a jolly young Bridegroom
on the Wedding-night, or a fair Bride the next
morning.</p>
                        <p>Then to the <hi>Mind,</hi> what more innocently
diverting, keeping from a hundred worse Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
at once delighting and profiting,
and mingling <hi>utile dulci</hi> so exactly, that there
sha'nt be a scruple over or under on either side,
though weighed in <hi>Apollo'</hi>s own Ballance.</p>

Thus ye see how <hi>profitable</hi> the Book had been,
though t'had been only <hi>pleasant.—</hi> But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the <hi>grum sort</hi> of Readers will find fault
with't for that very cause; they must have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
sowerer and stiffer to humour their <hi>Iack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boot-Iudgments;—</hi>
something that will bear read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a hundred times over without ever grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thread-bare;—that may exalt the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
improve the Mind, and all that.—This
they only call <hi>profit,</hi> and without this
its beneath their <hi>supercilious Worships</hi> leisure so
much as to cast a glance upon't.—Well, all
this they shall have to please the <hi>grave Sirs,</hi>
whom by the leave of their <hi>Beards</hi> we must
quarrel with for not acting like themselves,
condemning what they have never read, or
not sufficiently reflected on. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<hi>Kainophilus</hi> must be again forced to do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
on his modesty, and point to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
choice Jewels enshrined in this rich Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;
by which may be easily guess'd how
gravely and sagely he could have discours'd
from one end to t'other, wou'd the World
have born it, as easily as all <hi>Hercules</hi> is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
by his Foot, or the former Fruitfulness
of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> by some precious snips here
and there to be found at this day.</p>
                        <p>I won't pretend to enumerate here all the
sound pieces of <hi>good Philosophy,</hi> Sence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as strong as Love or Mustard, which are
scatter'd here and there all throughout the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
Work; though some such places I'll
direct you to for my own Credit, as well
as your Edification.</p>
                        <p>What an <hi>abstruse piece of Philosophy</hi> have ye

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62151:105"/>
of Matter, and the different almost
infinite Forms it passes through (which some of
bigger Names have made so much work with)
and with what strength of Argument and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness
of Invention is it there prov'd at least
probable, that <hi>Vander</hi> is made of a <hi>roaring
Lion,</hi> or <hi>mighty Elephant?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Turn over to <hi>chap.</hi> 2. and see but what a
sound and useful Discourse of <hi>Life</hi> presents it
self to your Observation. Nay, so well incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
is <hi>Kainophilus,</hi> that he lugs in this grave
Meditation <hi>nolens volens,</hi> and talks of <hi>Life</hi> though
he came <hi>dead-born</hi> into the World.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Chap. 3. pag.</hi> 42. How dutifully and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
does he speak of his dear Vertuous <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
in those just Praises he gives that <hi>Paragon
of Perfection,</hi> both proposing a Pattern for the
rest of Women to imitate in her, and Children
in him, whose Respect and tender <hi>natural Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
both to her and his Father will never be
forgoten till Vertue and Gratitude perish from
the Earth.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>next Chapter</hi> is as famous for his Love to
his <hi>Country,</hi> for which he'd do any think but
<hi>fight,</hi> as that before to his Mother. Clinking
in the close with a Prophetical touch of the
<hi>Reduction of Ireland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I begin now to fear I have a small touch
of the <hi>Conjurer,</hi> though I have so often dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
it in the former Book. For those Verses
being writ before His Majesty Landed in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
contain in a few lines as exact an Account of
all the Expedition, as if t'had been taken out of
the <hi>Gazet</hi> after 'twas over. Let the Reader be
Witness else—</p>

Their Fate draws near, and now he lands, and now</l>
                        <l>Kneels on the shore, and pays his second Vow.</l>
                        <l>There there he charg'd, and shook the trembling ground,</l>
                        <l>With Sweat, and Dust, and Blood encompast round.</l>
                        <l>See <hi>Courcy!</hi> See! to well-known Bogs they run,</l>
                        <l>As Birds obscene before the Rising-Sun.</l>
                        <p>So far <hi>Kainophilus</hi> has prov'd an errand <hi>Prophet,</hi>
and does not much doubt but a few Globes hence
will bring the Completion of the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lines:</p>
                        <l>See <hi>Talbot!</hi> See! thy Countrymen advance</l>
                        <l>Their Conqu'ring Standards on the shores of <hi>France.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <p>I can't imagin what the World wou'd have, if
all this don't take; nor know any reason why
<hi>Evander'</hi>s Prophecies should not sell as well as
<hi>Grebner'</hi>s <hi>Emblems,</hi> or <hi>Catastrophe Mundi.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Chap. 5. pag.</hi> 60. has an equally pleasant and
profitable Discourse of <hi>School-Masters,</hi> with
some well deserv'd Strictures on that severity
and cruelty practis'd by some of 'em, and just
acknowledgment to those of more temper and
goodness.</p>
                        <p>Towards the end of which Chapter <hi>Evander</hi>
confesses his Wit has a little run away with
him; so ungovernable a thing is <hi>towring Fancy,</hi>
when not hand-cufft by <hi>powerful Reason,</hi> flying
out against Learning, beloved Learning, at so
Satyrical a rate as almost makes his heart bleed
to read it, when he thinks he has been so unkind
to that which has been so kind to him.—But
after he has thus broken its Head, he gives so
clever and kind a Plaister, that any one
wou'd be glad to be so wittily abused, to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62151:106"/>
have so good amends made him.—See
<hi>pag.</hi> 107.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Sixth Chapter</hi> there's such clear Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for <hi>Childrens Duty to their Parents,</hi> so
deeply laid, and strongly urged, that they are
able to Convert a <hi>Tartarian,</hi> and make him
as dutiful a Bantling as any thing but <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> describes the glorious Town of
<hi>London</hi> twice as big as <hi>Graffham,</hi> with all the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and Remarkables the <hi>Bumkin</hi> stares his
Eyes and Teeth out upon; and some of the
most common Tricks put upon those poor Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers;
which makes the Book useful for all
<hi>Meridians,</hi> and may indifferently serve either
for <hi>Taunton-Dean</hi> or <hi>London.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Where after an ingenious and remarkable
Story or two about <hi>Androcles</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> the
next we present you with is a <hi>noble Paradox</hi>
so much agitated concerning <hi>Self-Murther;</hi> the
rise of which is very suprizing; for who but
an <hi>Evander</hi> wou'd have entertaind such a sage
discourse with himself at the top of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,</hi>
whether he should throw himself down
in the out-side and break his neck, or civilly
walk down Stairs as he came; which last he
wisely chuses for a great many Reasons, though
one of the weightiest unluckily forgotten,—Lest
the <hi>Iury</hi> finding him <hi>Felo-de-se,</hi> his Estate shou'd
be lost, and not descend to his Posterity; or
in plain terms, not to be longer Enigmatical,
lest <hi>these Rambles,</hi> which as ye have often heard,
he esteems the <hi>very Sons and Heirs of his Brains
and Body,</hi> should perish with him, or only creep
out like a helpless Abortive into the cold uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
World.</p>

some where,</hi> namely, just where I do, at
his own Birth-place, <hi>Odcomb,</hi> in the County of
<hi>Somerset,</hi> whence that sounding Title of <hi>Odcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian
Tom,</hi> though I think <hi>Graffambian Iohn</hi> comes
not an Ace behind it. And what do me I but
precisely follow so good and laudable Authority
and Example, taking my rise at <hi>Graffam,</hi>
in order to this <hi>Hop-stride-and-Iump round the
World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Description of all the World I begin
early, and intend to prosecute farther than
ever any did before me.</p>
                        <p>I Begin my <hi>Rambles</hi> at <hi>nothing,</hi> which I
soon make <hi>something</hi> of, and by that time I
have done, poor <hi>Vander</hi> will be <hi>nothing</hi>
agen.</p>
                        <p>And yet that <hi>nothing, something</hi> too; for I'm
no Atheist, but yet such a <hi>something</hi> as is between
<hi>something</hi> and <hi>nothing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What if I observe some minute passages in
the prosecution of my <hi>Rambles,</hi> the more
exact still and perfect will the <hi>Iournal</hi> be;
and why mayn't I make as great a splutter
with my <hi>Dialogue</hi> with Owls and Cuckoes, as
grave Authors do of <hi>Apollonius'</hi>s Confabulation
with the Sparrows and Oxen, since I dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62151:108"/>
one of these Books to a Brass-Farthing
one is as true as another?</p>
                        <p>Then for the <hi>gravity</hi> of some passages, I
wou'd make the same Excuse <hi>Osborn</hi> does, and
Cabbage his very words ('tis n't the first time
perhaps, nor wou'd either he or you be ever the
wiser) in a case of like nature, but not having
the Book by me at present, you must be content
with the Quintessence on't.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Some People</hi> (quoth he) <hi>may very gravely blame
me for inserting some such slight Circumstances as
these in my History</hi> (I think that he then men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
was the colour of Queen <hi>Ann's Hair)
Ay, but let 'em consider,—</hi> He goes on—so
far—till he's out of sight; and were <hi>Kainophilus</hi>
to be made a <hi>Viscount,</hi> he can't remember
what's next. But will tell you what's more to
the purpose, as he was saying before, this
Work is a fair and lawful Description of
<hi>A Ramble round the World.</hi> 'Tis true, here's
yet but a small part on't describ'd, nor I'll assure
ye have ye any more yet than a small part of
this <hi>Ramble;</hi> and yet that small one <hi>great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi>
too, if consider'd in it self, though but
little in regard of the <hi>whole World,</hi> nay all the
Universe; which, as appears from the Frontis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
and Verses before the <hi>First Book,</hi> he
threatens to <hi>ramble all round</hi> every nook and
crook on't before he has done with't.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Once more, Mr.</hi> Kainophilus! How comes this
to be a <hi>Voyage</hi> round the World, when we never
yet met ye so much as in a Sculler crossing the
Water. You have bin indeed, as ye told us before,
sailing, and rowing and tugging by Land, when ye
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ot a Horse-back, where ye make <hi>tempestuous
work</hi> on't, and your Vessel <hi>Reels</hi> t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rribly.—
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62151:108"/>
But all this is nothing to Sea-service, and we never
heard of a <hi>Voyage</hi> by <hi>Land</hi> since we were Christen'd,
till ye were pleas'd to bring the word into the World.</p>
                        <p>How,<hi>—Evander</hi> not understand <hi>true English,</hi>
who has been an Author these <hi>three and twenty
years,</hi> and cou'd almost read his <hi>Criss cross-row in
his Mother's Belly!</hi> Who has so many <hi>English
Dictionaries</hi> in his Study, and another in his
Head <hi>bigger</hi> than all together (and yet there's
still room to spare both for <hi>Brains</hi> and <hi>Projects</hi>)
Does not he?—nay—now you ruffle his <hi>smooth
Soul,</hi> alter his <hi>fair Body,</hi> and discompose him
all over.—If ye go on at this rate, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Objections, a Man does not know how to
answer (for their <hi>number,</hi> I mean not their
<hi>weight</hi>) ye shall e'ne write your self, and let
the World laugh at ye, for <hi>Evander</hi> will be
your Fool no longer.—But not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
this Plea, we'll for once joyn issue, and
giv't a fair Answer.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Voyage round the World</hi> was made in the
<hi>Ship</hi> of <hi>Fancy,</hi> which every one knows, like the
<hi>Cossaks</hi> Boats, sails as well by <hi>Land</hi> as <hi>Water.—</hi>
And now I hope you are satisfied.</p>
                        <p>One Objection more I ingeniously raise my
self, not to put others to the trouble. I have
pretty frequently mention'd the Famous <hi>Bunyan</hi>
in the past, and may perhaps in this present and
future <hi>Rambles;</hi> but can assure the World, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
a <hi>flurt of Fancy</hi> now and then, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it with all the Reverence he deserves.
But if o't'other side, any malicious Person should
be displeased with me for quoting such a
<hi>Tinker</hi> of an Author, let 'em know I have
a topping Example for the same, which to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62151:109"/>
vindicate both my self and him, shall be
here inserted, and therewith I intend to close
this <hi>Chapter.</hi> [See <hi>New Observator,</hi> Vol. 2.

                        <argument>
                           <p>A word of Reproof to all such as pretend they
know the Author of these Rambles.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>SO great a <hi>Glory</hi> do I esteem it to be the
<hi>Author</hi> of these <hi>Works,</hi> that I cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great injury to my self and Justice, endure
that any shou'd own 'em who have nothing to
do with 'em, like the Fellow at <hi>Rome,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to <hi>Virgil'</hi>s Verses. But I need take no
other way to confute these <hi>Plagiaries</hi> than
<hi>Virgil</hi> himself did, requiring the Tally to his
<hi>Vos non vobis.—</hi> Let any Man write on at the
rate this is already written, and I'll grant he is the
<hi>Author</hi> of this Book, that before, and all the
rest to the end of the <hi>Chapter.—</hi> No, there
is such a sort of a <hi>whim in the style,</hi> something
so like my self, so Incomprehensible (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis Non-sense) that whoever throws but
half an Eye on that and me together, will swear
'twas spit out of the moth of <hi>Kainophilus.—</hi> This
by the bye.</p>
                        <p>But 'tis not the main business of this <hi>Chapter</hi>
to assert what few will be so impudent to deny,
and what I could give Demonstration of by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
'em see me write these very words which
they read here, and subscribing under it,—<hi>Yours,
Yours, Yours,—in ten thousand Obligations of
Love and Service,</hi> Kainophilus Vander.</p>

                           <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62151:110"/>
The main work in hand is, what the <hi>Contents</hi>
explains in Short-hand. To rebuke those, at
least over-bold Persons, who pretend to know
who this <hi>Kainophilus</hi> is, and that better than I
my self do, which seems a very hard case in my
simple Judgment.</p>
                        <p>Comes ye one grave and good Man to me,—I
beg your Pardon,—'twas but a slip to a Friend
of mine, and thus accosts him—</p>
                        <p>Are n't you asham'd Mr.—thus to expose
your self and your Friends to all the World?—Why
have you no <hi>sense of Honour</hi> in ye, to write
such a confounded silly Book as this of <hi>your self—ay—of
your self,—</hi> there's the Jest on't, I protest
I've hardly patience to think on't,—to make
your self the perfect <hi>Maygame of the Town?—</hi>
Why at this rate you'll be shortly pointed and
laughed at as you pass the streets, and the very
<hi>little Boys</hi> will cry,<hi>—There goes the Black-Swan,</hi>
or <hi>White-Raven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Will they so, quo' I (quo' he I mean still)
I protest I'm heartily glad on't, and think it
extream <hi>good News.</hi> Why have the little Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
so great an esteem for me?—Well,
they honour me very much, and if a Pocket
full of Sugar-plumbs as long as the Monument
will gratifie 'em, they shan't want it. Does
the World take <hi>notice of me,</hi> point at me, smile
for Complaisance and Joy when I pass by,—'tis
the very thing I'd be at, and I'm a made
Man,—I shall get Money by't, besides Fame, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
and Honour in abundance into the bargain.</p>

and Eyes, and Hands, and cry out in Extasies,
<hi>There goes the Immortal Evander!</hi> For so they
will call me, so they will be apt, grave Sir,
to think me, alas only out of their goodness;
whereas I'm no more he, I protest Sir, than I
am <hi>Kainophilus;</hi> nor are they able to prove a
word of what they say, any more than that I
am the <hi>Man in the Moon.—</hi> People, Sir, you
know will say their pleasure, and many things
may by chance be <hi>extremely likely,</hi> which yet for
all that are as far from true, as Chalk's
from Cheese. I have been, I must confess, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
more than once for that <hi>worthy Author,</hi>
whom some have flatter'd me that I a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble:
But alas, strong fancy often <hi>makes Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
where it never finds any;</hi> and I believe, on my
<hi>honesty,</hi> I'm no more really like him, than <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net's
Beard</hi> in the Barley-Straw is like a Man.</p>
                        <p>Nay now, cries he, ye make me ten times
madder at ye than before. Why are not all
these passages here that could <hi>belong to none but
you;</hi> and that I know as well as you, and scarce
any beside us,<hi>—perswade me I can't feel my own
Nose.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whether you can or no, Sir, is no business of
mine, Sir, any more, Sir, than this of yours!
That ever <hi>appearances</hi> should thus deceive a Man
of Sence and Years as you are, and make him so
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62151:111"/>
positive too,—ay—that's the vexation on't,
else the humour would pass well enough.
Sir, you have often been upon a <hi>City-Iury,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
a Man is never <hi>hang'd for Circumstances.</hi>—What
are all these Suspicions, and a hundred
more, without <hi>positive Evidence?</hi>—Ay—there's
the clinch of the Cause, the very top point and
pinch of the Argument.—Grant I am so like
<hi>Evander</hi> (though that's an argument I can't be he,
because <hi>no like is the same</hi>) that I shou'd have all
the marks of him about me, <hi>a very fair, proper,
well made Person, in the Flower of my Age, Discreet
and Prudent, Magnificent and Generous, and Valiant
to a Miracle, well drest: And</hi>—(hold, if I go
a little farther, I shall let every body know me
indeed) I say, <hi>supposing</hi> I had all these shrew'd Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
about me, it might I confess be enough to
have me stopt by a <hi>Hue-and-cry</hi> if met by 'em, and
they order'd to apprehend him. But yet no
Judge in <hi>England,</hi> not a <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Iefferys,</hi>
whose <hi>Life</hi> you may have at Mr. <hi>Dunton'</hi>s in the
<hi>Poultrey,</hi> would be such a <hi>cruel bloody Dog</hi> to hang
me by the Neck till I were dead, without any
other Proofs than this <hi>seeming Similitude.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Just thus did these two judicious Persons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
on that <hi>weighty Subject,</hi> which the graver
of the two pressed on with further and heavier
Arguments. Whose Objections to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
with several other on the same Head,
I <hi>Kainophilus,</hi> the very and real Author of these
<hi>Rambles,</hi> now take upon me to Answer for my
own <hi>Honour,</hi> and the Satisfaction of the World,
and prove notwithstanding all the fruitless Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to the contrary, and some seeming ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
that neither <hi>Iohn-a-nokes,</hi> nor <hi>Iack-a-styles,</hi>
                           <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62151:111"/>
nor <hi>Will-wi-the-wisp,</hi> nor any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
yet named or suspected, are the <hi>real Authors</hi>
of this Book, or the <hi>real Evander,</hi> but that I,
and I only am he; and who I am, is yet, and
ever shall be a <hi>Secret</hi> as long as I please, since
the World neither does, nor for all its <hi>fleering</hi>
perhaps ever shall or can know me.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whoop</hi> (comes in an old Hawker-woman) what—don't
I know <hi>Vander?</hi>—I that have serv'd
him with <hi>Gazets</hi> and <hi>Pamphlets</hi> almost these ten
years—I'll take my swear upon an <hi>Observator</hi>
this is he,—the very <hi>errand he,</hi> or else may I
be <hi>Spay'd</hi> by the next Sow-gelder. Why let's see—he
has the <hi>very leer</hi> of him,—walk him—there's
his perfect <hi>shuffle,</hi>—look—he <hi>winks</hi>
too,—and is twirling a <hi>Pen</hi> between his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
Never tell me,—I know him as well as
my own <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Dick Baldwin</hi>'s <hi>Printing-house.</hi>
If 'twas <hi>Evander</hi> writ this Book, I'm
sure I know him, for there's ne're another of
the name in the World, he's a Phoenix, and this
certainly must be he.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Go cry your Votes, ye old Bawd,</hi>—sure this is
a fine World,—and they'll perswade me anon
they know me better than I do my self.—You
know one <hi>Evander,</hi>—so did I too,—but
he must needs be the same in the Book, because
there's but one of the <hi>Name forsooth;</hi>—and
are you sure of that <hi>Goody Strong-Lungs!</hi> See
what 'tis to want reading, at least to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with none but the <hi>Moderns.</hi> What
has been, may be; and if there have been more
<hi>Evanders</hi> than one, why mayn't there be so still?
and if two, as well for ought I see <hi>two hundred,</hi>
(though two will do my business as well as
half a thousand.) Now all the World that ever
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62151:112"/>
read <hi>Virgil</hi> so much as in the incomparable <hi>Ogylby'</hi>s
splendid Version, knows there was a very grave
<hi>old Gentleman</hi> of his acquaintance called <hi>Evander,</hi>
who had a <hi>Beard down to his Girdle-stead</hi> before
ever I was begotten; from the resemblance to
his whole humour, not his Person, the unwon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Gravity of my Temper, and Wisdom of
my Actions, even in my <hi>younger years,</hi> together
with my delight in a sedentary Life, and
dwelling a long time up in a Garret (as this
fine old Man did at his <hi>Country Farm a top of a
Hill</hi>) some were pleas'd many years since to
give me the Title of <hi>Evander:</hi> But alas no more
the same <hi>Evander</hi> this silly Woman talks of, than
a Man is the same with a little Boy.—I knew
that same <hi>Evander</hi> as well as she for her days
earnings;—alas—I'm a staid Man, now
turn'd of .... score, and he was a little nimble
Fellow, always <hi>Rambling</hi> and capering about
like <hi>Quick-silver in a hot Pudding-Pye.</hi>—But here
are the same Looks,—a meer Chance, and Gate
and Shuffle, because I'm a Man of business, and
go for the most part in haste, as he did when he
was Courting his Mistresses.</p>
                        <p>(<hi>An old Iade,—she made me sweat, I'm glad
I'm got clear on her.—</hi>) But next for <hi>Kainophilus,</hi>
the same wise Argument with that before.</p>
                        <p>There was once a silly Fellow who pretended
a Design a little like this we are about, to <hi>Ramble
round the World;</hi> he began I think with <hi>Kent,</hi> and
so intended to run through all Christendom, and
the rest of the World; but the pitiful <hi>abortive
Project,</hi> which could never pretend to that
heighth of Thought, and profundity of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with ours, for that cause never liv'd above
two or three days, and then was justly condemn'd

to the stinking darkness of some <hi>ignoble Bog-house.</hi>
'Tis not deny'd but that hence we may have
taken the Name, the only thing worth liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it, and have Examples enough for our
practice. Did not the ingenious <hi>Ariosto</hi> borrow
several of his Names, particularly his <hi>beautiful
Angelica,</hi> from some dull forgotten <hi>Rhimer</hi> that
went before him? Nay, did not <hi>Virgil</hi> rake in
<hi>Ennius</hi> his Dung, like a Gold-finder as he was,
for that very reason, that he might deserve the
Name? And why mayn't we as lawfully pull this
single Name out of its nasty Oblivion, <hi>powder it,
and dry it, and sweeten it, and wash it,</hi> and make
use of it for our own proper <hi>Cognomen,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as we see occasion.</p>
                        <p>Besides, I question whether he understood
<hi>Greek,</hi> or could construe <gap reason="foreign">

which till he does, all the World must
grant he and the learned <hi>Kainophilus</hi> here so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
named, are two quite different Persons, and
no more the same than I and the Queen of
<hi>Sheba.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You may rave and fret all this while, and cry
all this is <hi>Banter,</hi> which I confess is the readiest
way of answering it; but I appeal to all sober
Judges, whether it been't almost as bad as <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napping</hi>
a Man away, to go about to perswade
him <hi>he is what he is not;</hi> to make <hi>Trincalo</hi> a Duke;
or as a good modest Gentleman was some time
since served by the <hi>Barbarian Africans,</hi> beat him
into Nobility, and make him stand in bodily
fear of being at last thrasht into the <hi>Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To avoid which unsufferable Inconveniencies,
and others of the like pernicious nature, I take
all these pains with those who don't know what
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62151:113"/>
to make of me, to shew both what I am, and
what I am not.</p>
                        <p>The third and last Name from which this
peeping, peering, <hi>Eves-dropping</hi> World pretends
to know me, is I confess the least Heroical of all
the three, namely <hi>Iohn,</hi> which they most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly
deduce from that line in the Explanation,—<hi>Hold
up phy Head</hi> John!</p>
                        <p>Ay, and so I can for all I have heard yet, or am
like to hear. 'Tis true, the Author of those Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
has been a little bold now and then, speaking
something too diminitively, not to add fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly,
of the Subject and Person he handles.—This
fault I could wish he had here especially
avoided: Had he used but the mighty Hebrew
word <hi>Iehochanam,</hi> instead of that pitiful sneaking
<hi>Iohn-English,</hi> I should e'ne have glory'd in the
Name, and defy'd the World to say its worst
upon't of that or me.</p>
                        <p>See but how they reason: The Author's Name
was <hi>IOHN;</hi> They know one whose Name is
<hi>Iohn;</hi>—nay that they are sure of, they'll prove
it by the <hi>Register,</hi> by his Bills and Bonds, and
own Hand-writing scrawl'd at the bottom of at
least (in a modest computation) <hi>One million and
five hundred thousand Epistles and familiar Letters.</hi>—Well,
pray go on, and don't waste him thus,
why therefore he must be the Author. In answer,—we
don't deny there's a certain Person in the
World known by the Name of <hi>Iohn,</hi> nay two or
theee hundred; but if the Argument be good
enough, all the rest must be the Authors on't,
as well as <hi>Iohn-a-nokes</hi> or <hi>Iohn-a-styles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this <hi>Iohn</hi> is a <hi>Bookseller.</hi>—Come prove
that if ye can.—I do it from the foresaid Verses,—<hi>Who
e're heard of a</hi> King <hi>or a</hi> Bookseller <hi>drowned?</hi>
                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62151:113"/>
Worshipful reasoning.—Well, how all this
World is over-run with Fallacies!—How few
can discourse clearly and handsomly?—And
how few are <hi>Evanders?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Granting he must be one of these two, does it
follow he's the other, or both together? He's
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>huse which he'll be, a <hi>King</hi> or a <hi>Bookseller,</hi> and
assures ye he has Wit enough to chuse the best?
To be short, Does not every body know there
have been <hi>King Iohns,</hi> as well as <hi>Bookseller Iohns
(Iohn King of Naples, King of Ierusalem, King of
England,</hi> besides a hundred and fifty little <hi>Iohnny-Kings</hi>
not worth taking notice of.) This the
World knows, but I know something more,
and could name 'em a <hi>King Iohn</hi> of my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
nay, and perhaps a <hi>Bookseller</hi> too,
as well as the Party suspected; and then where's
all their arguing?</p>
                        <p>But this <hi>Iohn Bookseller</hi> went to <hi>New-England;</hi>—Ay,
there's the home-stroke;—now they
think they have me as fast as the sage Gentlemen
Aldermen had their worshipful <hi>Brother</hi> the <hi>Cuckoe,</hi>
when the Hedge was finished to keep in the noble
Bird for their own use; or the poor <hi>Bumkin</hi> when
he pricks in a Leather.—But trust <hi>Vander</hi> for
<hi>wrigling</hi> out agen in spite of all their craftiness.
Grant the <hi>Frontispiece</hi> has <hi>New-England, Boston,</hi>
the <hi>Wigwams,</hi> and all that; nay, and a <hi>Bookseller</hi>
too for once, ay, and a <hi>Iohn Bookseller,</hi> yet all
this won't nor shan't do to prove the Author of
these Works is known to the World. For if
there were more <hi>Iohns</hi> and more <hi>Booksellers</hi> that
went to <hi>New-England,</hi> then the case is clear, that
from all has been said they can never prove who
'tis, since it may be one as well as t'other.
But the Premisses I assert upon my Honour, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62151:114"/>
am sure that my honest Fellow-Traveller <hi>Iohn
(how d'ye like it Sir?)</hi> will never deny it.—Therefore
the Conclusion stands as firm as a
Rock of Adamant, that ye don't know me, nor
shan't know me, or (as I have it in my <hi>Memorial-Book</hi>
word for word) it is not at all prov'd that
the Author of this Work should be the Person
whom the World believes it to be.</p>
                        <p>Once more whispering.—Speak all at once,
for I'll hear no more.—Why, quo' Mr. <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
though these Evidences taken singly by
themselves, mayn't be able to conclude against
the Person accused, yet all together they may;
for we often see, as in the <hi>Fable,</hi> one Stick
Broken, when twenty such together, though of
equal force, separately would require a <hi>Hercules</hi>
to snap 'em asunder.</p>
                        <p>Come—never talk,—is't not impossible that
all these Characters should meet in one Man,
agreeing to the Author of these Works, and yet
that Person not be the Author. The Names
<hi>Kainophilus, Evander, Iohn.</hi> The Occupation a
<hi>Booksellr.</hi> Lastly, the <hi>Vbi,</hi> or <hi>wheresomness</hi> (as
well as the <hi>Quis</hi> or <hi>Quid,</hi>—the <hi>Whoiety</hi> or
the <hi>Whatchicallity</hi>) namely <hi>New-England.</hi>—Look
upon the Evidence now 'tis <hi>summ'd</hi> up
together, and if he ben't the Man, he's no Man
at all, but as perfect a Sprite as <hi>Posture-Clark</hi> in
the t'other Book.</p>
                        <p>Thus is a <hi>modest Man</hi> opprest with <hi>noise,</hi>
and endeavours used to press him to Death
with Weights, when Strength can't do't.

of his Counter, like a <hi>Creeper</hi> against the
side of an House,—with all the <hi>mortal Tokens of a
Prentice</hi> appearing in his very Phisnomy.—<hi>Behold
but the vastness of his Ears</hi> (if like their Picture)
not only large enough, as <hi>Oldham'</hi>s Country
Parson's, to make Night-caps for himself, and
roll up over his Head every night to keep him
from the injury of the Weather; but like an
<hi>excellent Instrument</hi> serving at once for several
uses:—<hi>spatious</hi> enough for Towels wherein
the Cook-Maid (beshrew all her Kitchin-stuff
for't) would too often for his repose wipe her
<hi>greasie Golls,</hi> and cleanse her colly'd Fingers,—nay
had they been Leather, and of the same
length they are here describ'd, ten to one but
the Jade would have made use of 'em instead of
<hi>Straps</hi> to whet her Knives upon. But alas all
this is meerly as pleases the Painter (or Graver,
'tis no great difference) for <hi>Evander'</hi>s Ears, as
well as all his other parts, were very propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable,
and as the Verses before the Book,
<q>—Thus in Man the parts agree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

However leaving his Ears at present, which
are at his Countreys <hi>Service</hi> as well as all the rest
of his Body, <hi>I, he, and we,</hi> Kind, Courteous,
and Gentle <hi>Reader!</hi> are now to <hi>settle in our Geers,
mind our Business, learn our Trade,</hi> and do what
an honest <hi>Prentice</hi> knows to be his Duty. What
I have with a great deal of tugging formerly
prov'd, is just now to be rendred past all doubt,
namely the excellent profit and use, as well as
<hi>Rarity, Novelty</hi> and <hi>Diversion of this Book.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For here am I <hi>Kainophilus</hi> resolved to leave all
<hi>Apprentices,</hi> both present and future, such a
Copy, as I doubt few of 'em will write after,
none I am certain ever excel.</p>
                        <p>Evander <hi>himself is that Copy,</hi> and if they'll
but take care to imitate him, and follow such a
high Example as he has set 'em, they'll all in
time stand as fair for <hi>Aldermen</hi> as he himself
does. Nor is what he writes confined to his
own single Experience, and more <hi>narrow Sphere,</hi>
he having with the greatest pains and accuracy,
as his Custom is, <hi>cropt and cull'd</hi> the very choicest
Flowers to be found in other Writings, giving
them the same liberty in his own, if they think
fit to make use on't.</p>
                        <p>The first and choicest care of <hi>young Evander,</hi>
as to this World, was how to please his Master,
whom he was now marry'd to, <hi>for better for worse,</hi>
for seven long years together, a great part of
his life, and upon which all the rest depended.
And so acceptable was this care, so tender a
regard had he to this his industrious, though
<hi>unworthy Servant,</hi> that he shall ever retain grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
resentments of the same till he's all <hi>Dust and
Worms-meat,</hi> And how deeply his Character
is imprinted in my heart, shall be seen by this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62151:116"/>
Impression wrought off from it, shewing what he
was, is, and none else ever shall be.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="margQuotes">My <hi>Master</hi> was a grave good Man,—a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
honest Citizen of <hi>London.</hi> Devout
and Religious, without making a Trade on't,
or as some of his Neighbours in a too literal
sence, making a <hi>Gain of Godliness.</hi> Nor thought
this enough, without being Just and Honest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Neighbour. Willing to do any Man
a good turn if he might without injury
to himself; <hi>and as Charitable as Iust,</hi> whatever
his own Opinions were of smaller Matters,
thinking well of all whom he knew not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the contrary, though they differ'd from
him; and well of none for being of his Party,
unless they had other Merits to recommend 'em.
He was never over-fond of publick Honours
and Employments, neither unwilling to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
'em, if plac'd on him by the suffrages of
Fellow-Citizens, or Laws of the Land, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing too mean or heavy for him to stoop
to, or stand up under. He was so far from
glorying in betraying his Country, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Fortues on its ruin, that he thought
nothing but his Soul either of more value, or
more meriting his utmost care and concern.
Accordingly he ever gave his Hand, and as
freely his Heart for such Persons as his Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives
in Parliament, who were properly
such really like him, and therefore fit to be so;
Gentlemen of honest Integrity, Prudence and
Courage, vers'd in the Interests both of City and
Nation. His Religion was not confined to the
Church any more than the Shop; His behaviour
in his Family being grave and exemplary, his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62151:116"/>
Devotion constant, his Care over his Houshold
tender and impartial. To his Servants he
seem'd indeed a Father rather than a Master,
but like a wise Father avoided the two dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
extreams of Severity and Fondness, that
<hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> one of which, by their
endeavouring to avoid the other, either sucks
in or dashes in pieces the most of Mankind. He
indeed, if ever any Master, kept this golden
mean, steering exactly betwixt the Rock of
one side, and Gulph on t'other. A sweeter
Severity, or better temper'd Gravity I never
saw; he, like a true wise Man, ordering his
carriage towards his Servants as occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
If sweet temper'd and ingenious
(like <hi>Evander</hi>) he us'd the softest and gentlest
methods with 'em; if rough and haggard, or
abusing his goodness, he as well knew how to
be severe, and use that Authority he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
with, though not over-strain it, and so
render 'em desperate.</hi>

Accordingly, though he would hardly strain
his Authority so far as to command things
unreasonable, having much rather the equity
of whatever he required should of themselves at
the first notice of his pleasure, oblige them to
a ready compliance, yet in any thing not irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
he would hold the Reins steddy, not

remembred the good <hi>Saxon Law</hi> of <hi>old King Ina.</hi>—If
a Villain works on a <hi>Sunday</hi> by his Lord's
Command, <hi>Let him be free:</hi> Never observing
that Working on <hi>Sundays</hi> made People better
Artists, whatever Playing then may do. He
never wou'd threaten his Servant, but rather
immediately correct him, that is, not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
threaten, but <hi>conditionally</hi> only, with
promise of Pardon upon amendment:—which
was never wanting in me where there was real
occasion, being at least <hi>very sorry</hi> when I had
offended <hi>so kind a Master.</hi> He knew that a
sour, harsh, unplacable humour was as unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
as unpleasant and unprofitable to <hi>both
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62151:118"/>
sides of the Relation,</hi> tormeting instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming,
and only tending to make Servants
<hi>keep their Faults,</hi> and <hi>leave their Masters.</hi>—Wherefore
in case of Threatning, and on any
necessity of just Punishment, he seldom or
never <hi>pass'd his word,</hi> but made <hi>present pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
lest the <hi>Creditor</hi> should run away from
the <hi>Debtor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In correcting a Servant, he never us'd to be
a <hi>Slave to his own Passions,</hi> common Justice,
Reason, Pity and Humanity, as well as the
<hi>Chamberlain,</hi> hindring him from making <hi>new
Indentures</hi> on the Flesh of his Apprentice, though
he might happen in some light instances to
break the <hi>old.</hi> And indeed how many <hi>good Servants</hi>
are that way <hi>eternally ruin'd,</hi> and for ever unfitted
to serve their Countrey <hi>after</hi> they get out of their
time, or their Master <hi>before,</hi> as certainly <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
himself had been, had his Master gone to
work with him as <hi>some wicked Wretches</hi> in this City
have done with their Prentices, ripping up their
Guts, beating out their Brains, or whipping
'em to Death, and so undoing 'em for ever.
For this reason my <hi>good Master</hi> wou'd never
strike me in the heighth of his Passion, lest my
<hi>Brains should fly about my Ears, and the stroke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
upon himself.</hi> But when he did find any
Servant unlike me, and altogether incorrigible,
so that he found it impossible to <hi>wash the Blacka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
white,</hi> and whom he could never induce by
Confession or Amendment to <hi>scowr out the Spots of
his Soul,</hi> he'd e'ne fairly wash his hands of him,
and turn him a grazing among his Fellow-Cattle.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tender he was to a miracle</hi> of his poor Servant
in Sickness, or any other such ill accident, making
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62151:119"/>
his <hi>House</hi> his <hi>Hospital.</hi> This by a good token
<hi>Kainophilus</hi> remembers, who had been <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground</hi>
ten years agon, had he been otherwise.
So like was his temper to that great Man
Judge <hi>Hales,</hi> who would not let his <hi>sick Dogs,</hi>
or <hi>old Horses</hi> be hang'd or knock't on the head, but
gave 'em <hi>clean Straw,</hi> and <hi>good Lodging;</hi> and for
what they had done when well and lusty, kept
'em like <hi>Gentlemen all their lives,</hi> as Prince <hi>Henry</hi>
did the sick and old <hi>English Mastiff</hi> who had made
a Lyon run away.—Not that my <hi>Master,</hi>
being neither a <hi>Prince</hi> nor <hi>a Lord Chief Iustice,</hi> I
mean in his Estate or Birth, for he was both
in his <hi>Soul and Family,</hi> did use to keep his Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
like Gally-Slaves, chain'd to the Oar for
Life; only I would be understood he had both
a Fatherly care of us, <hi>in our short state of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
both in Sickness and in Health,</hi> and all our
Lives after a <hi>distinguishing Aspect</hi> on those whom
he had <hi>brought into the World,</hi> manifesting all the
<hi>Care,</hi> though none of the Severity of a Master
towards 'em <hi>as long as e're they liv'd.</hi>—And
how much good, sage and kind Advice has he
given <hi>Kainophilus</hi> since he came abroad into the
World; which had he but made use of, wou'd
have made him, if possible, greater and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
than he is already!</p>
                        <l>—Keep your Shop, and your Shop will keep you.</l>
                        <l>—Even Reckonings make long Friends.</l>
                        <l>—A Penny sav'd is a Penny got.</l>
                        <p>And a whole <hi>sack full</hi> of Proverbs as long as
<hi>Sancho'</hi>s, to the same purpose, which I still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
and are as it were the <hi>Beams and Rafters
of my Discretion</hi> and Reputation to this day.</p>
                        <p>Nor after he had <hi>turn'd us out</hi> into the wide
World, did he leave us there to <hi>bawl and cry,</hi>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:62151:119"/>
and kick our hearts out without any more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
what became of us, as those <hi>ill or mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Women</hi> who expose their Children in the
Street or High-way, and then run away from
'em. No,—he'd always listen and hearken what
became of us. No man ever went farther to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>making an Apprentice than he did, as if his
care was not over at seven years end,</hi> but was to
last all life long. So great, so good a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
wou'd he be sure to give of us, where
any thing of moment depended, that for my
part <hi>I blush abominably</hi> I no better deserve it,
and if I reflect on what he has said of me, and
what my modesty tells me I really am, I profess
I don't know my self, but sometimes fear he is
talking of some other. <hi rend="margQuotes">My Man <hi>Evander</hi> (quo'

who has been quarrelling and fighting all round,
till the Liquor (and some of his Fellow-Drunkards

those that still make shift to keep upon their Legs

On which account you well enough give

or other met with. 'Tis that the <hi>old Iewish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers</hi>
used to make use of a Bottle (call'd in their

which is much the same, to receive or give
Oracles out on't, which were mutter'd in a
deep hollow Voice. Nor has the <hi>Devil</hi> yet left
that way of enchanting the World.</p>
                        <p>There's a strange odd passage in that well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
Relation of the <hi>Demon of Mascon:</hi> One of

room, and the <hi>Devil</hi> fell a laughing very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
and speaking to the Person who took up
the <hi>Bottle,</hi> askt him if he thought him such a
Fool to stay there, since if he had but clapt
his Finger in, and stopt the mouth on't, he'd
have held him imprison'd there, and he could by
no means have got out agen. Whether the <hi>old

which sometimes won't let you believe what you
fain wou'd, and that <hi>excellent order and harmony</hi>

you'd be as ready to dive into your

you do well to think there's nothing after this
Life, at the same time you think there's no

For we had no farther off than <hi>next door</hi> a sad
and remarkable Instance of this nature, which I
believe I shall never forget while my Name is
<hi>Vander.</hi> 'Twas at the <hi>Cane-shop</hi> he liv'd, at the
Sign of the—over against the famous—Tavern.
His Father an <hi>honest Country Minister,</hi> who strain'd
hard to put his Son to so comfortable a Trade,
<hi>being his eldest,</hi> and the hope of his Family, and
expected to have been a Comfort to all the rest,
tho he unhappily prov'd quite contrary; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
first with small <hi>puny Thefts</hi> now and then
from his unsuspecting Master, but carrying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
all the while like an <hi>Angel,</hi> as he verily
thought him. From <hi>selling</hi> now and then, or
<hi>embezelling</hi> his Masters Goods to his own use, he
came to <hi>mount higher,</hi> and by the Advice of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Company, and Instigation of the Devil, grew
at last acquainted with <hi>his Till,</hi> and getting a
false Key made by the Impression of the other
taken in Wax, prov'd such a <hi>Cash-keeper</hi> for him,
as he neither suspected, nor desir'd.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>One great Incentive</hi> to his thus purloyning
from his Master, were some <hi>ill Women,</hi> with
whom he was acquainted; and who living at
t'other end o'th' Town, tho' <hi>as common as the Road</hi>
thither, pretended to be Persons of Quality,
and must be treated, forsooth, and caress'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accordingly.
This Trade held so long, till by
his continual finding Moneys in the Till mistold,
his Master at length suspected him, and to try
him one day, left there a parcel of Money, every
piece of which he had both told and markt, to
prevent any mistake in the discovery; and the
<hi>Bait laid,</hi> bids his Man be careful of <hi>the Shop,</hi>
and went out as about business; nor did he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
his Commands, not only looking narrowly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62151:131"/>
to the Shop, but <hi>to the Till it self,</hi> taking out four
or five pieces of the Money left on purpose for
him, resolving to have t'other pull at it the next
Morning, tho' he fear'd to take a greater Summ
at one time, lest it shou'd be miss'd and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In short,</hi> home comes the Master late in the
Evening, to bed they all went, and when he was
asleep, <hi>his Breeches on Examination confess'd the
fault,</hi> and discover'd all the Thievery by the
markt Pieces which he had taken. Nothing was
said that Night, but the next Morning his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
having also discover'd his lewd Company;
and ill Haunts, fairly took him to taks, prov'd
against him the <hi>Thievery</hi> and other Villany, and
not willing to expose his <hi>Father,</hi> for whom he
had a <hi>just respect,</hi> writ an Account of all to him,
desiring him to fetch his Son home, or take
some other care of him, else he must be oblig'd
to make him serve the rest of his time in <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>

                           <hi>This sudden Thunder-clap</hi> threw the young
Spark into such a Consternation, that like the
man <hi>who hang'd himself in the Prison, lest he shou'd
be found guilty of Felony; or the old Woman who
cut her Hogs Throat to save his life;</hi> away he run
for fear of being turn'd away—and hyes him to
t'other end of Town among his great Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
who finding the sheep fleec'd, kept'on the
Mask no longer, but own'd themselves <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Iilts, Thieves,</hi> and <hi>Pick-pockets,</hi> as alas! <hi>a
Whore's but a starving Trade of it self, unless they
have some other such way to eak out an honest Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood.
And indeed their Hands are generally as

made a fatal pass and ran <hi>poor Pick-pocket</hi> thro the
Back, that he fell down dead with an Oath in his

careful, industrious, studious, sober, honest
Man, who makes it his business to keep his Shop,
oblige his Customers; nay, rather than be idle
or gad abroad, turning his Books, and dusting
his Shelves; then there might have been some
reason for his <hi>Apprehension.</hi> But alas! all the

Person, never out of temper or humour,
discreet to a Miracle, uncapable of being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted,
or scandaliz'd, <hi>so fair is his Name, and

                        <p>That ever a beautiful <hi>Angel (with a delicate
gilt Turkey-leather Bible into the bargain)</hi> should
in a few years be thus chang'd, translated, and
transmogriphy'd into a thing as black as a <hi>Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,</hi>
an ill-boding, <hi>ill-sounding, ill-looking Raven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have often wonder'd why the Party aforesaid,
shou'd chuse this <hi>Sign</hi> above all the rest, and
can imagine none but this following, which lies
somewhat out of the way of common Reading
and Observation: The Banner of the <hi>Danes,</hi> or
rather their <hi>Standard Royal,</hi> had a <hi>Raven</hi> curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrought in't (as the <hi>Romans</hi> an <hi>Eagle.</hi>) The
reason, probably, by the jetty <hi>Blackness</hi> thereof,
as a sort of a Foil to set off the natural whiteness
of their own Skins; the <hi>Danes</hi> being generally,
as all men know, very fair-hair'd, Fair-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion'd
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62151:135"/>
Men? And who knows but this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
having some where or other met with this
Story, hung up the <hi>Raven for his Sign</hi> upon the
same reason.</p>
                        <p>But to come from the <hi>Sign</hi> to the <hi>Shop,—</hi>
What difference?—There was formerly a
very Spark liv'd in't,—<hi>the young, the wild, the
witty, the gay, and all that,</hi> who was forc'd to
march off for the famous Sham-Riot at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi>
being actually concern'd in looking down
from a Balcony, and bewitching the poor Loyal
Party at such a rate, that hundreds of 'em cou'd n't
speak a word for a week after.—See but what
a <hi>Rambling Fate</hi> some Men have;—then he
turn'd a Man of War, so did not his <hi>peaceable
Successor,</hi> nor the as <hi>peaceful Evander,</hi> both of
which I am confident had rather have their <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
quietly eaten</hi> by Worms, than torn to pieces
in Foreign Nations by howling Wolves, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious
Vultures.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Well, now my hands in,</hi> I'll on a little further,
and would fain call a little o' <hi>t'other side o' the
way,</hi> at one, whose <hi>Conscience is streighter</hi> than
his Sign, but he's so up to the Ears among <hi>great
Persons</hi> and Business <hi>(perhaps engaging for a 3d. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume)</hi>
that I'll not venture on him, only your
humble Servant Mr.—(a curious Shop
this, well built, lightsom, high, well furnisht,—well
if ever he quits it, <hi>I'll step in after him,</hi>—as—has
been done by others a hundred

Among other <hi>April-</hi> Errands, the wise Author
of the <hi>Poem</hi> sent me a <hi>Play-catching,</hi> instancing
in the <hi>Empress of Morocco,</hi> and the <hi>Conquest of
Granada.</hi> A most abominable work,—that ever
he should offer to desile my Fingers with meddling
with a <hi>Play.—</hi>'Tis a <hi>Monkey-trick,</hi> let me tell
him, to make use of poor Puss's Paw to scratch
out the Chessnuts which he himself eats. He
never heard I warn't ye of the Devil that
carry'd away a whole shoulder of a Play-house on
his Back, as easily as a <hi>Fox trusses a Goose.</hi> The
sage <hi>Evander</hi> in vain rebuk'd him, and ask'd the
meaning on't.—All I could get out of him
was his Judgment of Plays in general, which
word for word I'll insert as follows.</p>
                        <p>Moral Representations in themselves can never be
unlawful, may be very useful. To see Vice repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
like it self, deform'd and odious, though high
and prosperous, and at last thrown down and trampled
by those who envy'd and admir'd it. To see Vertue,
in its own <hi>Face,</hi> all charming and lovely, brave tho'
unfortunate, prest all round, and wading through all,
and at last enthron'd, prosperous and triumphant,—What
can more tend to the advancement of one, and
depression of the other, with those especially who are
led by Sence more than Reason, though this admits
both?</p>
                        <p>The many of the present Plays, 'tis acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
generally, take the quite contrary course;
especially the <hi>Comedies,</hi> the best of which that I
have seen, take more care to express the <hi>Humours
of</hi> the <hi>Countrey,</hi> Vices and all, than to amend 'em;
and these they dress in the <hi>loveliest colours of Wit
and Fancy,</hi> for not only <hi>Priests,</hi> but as far as
I see,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laureats</hi> of all Religions are the same.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="73" facs="tcp:62151:136"/>
And thus for One that's mended by Plays,
such as they are now, Ten thousand may be
injur'd or ruin'd. For the truth of which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to any <hi>ingenious Debauchee,</hi> if any such be
to be found. Nor are yet the <hi>Plays</hi> so much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hads
chargeable herewith (though bad enough)
as the Company which come there. 'Tis as
common a receptacle for W—and R—as
<hi>Bridewel</hi> it self (though that the more proper
of the two.) There are perhaps almost as many
Jilts as Women, so much more dangerous than
<hi>Pick-pockets,</hi> as they search deeper, and pilfer
what's more precious than that they aim at, <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
and <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet all this is clearly accidental to <hi>Plays;</hi> these
inconveniences may be remov'd, and only Vertue
and Vice shown as they ought to be; or if Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
such as are diverting, and yet innocent;
and it argues want of depth, if not <hi>plain dulness,</hi>
not to be able to fill up a <hi>Comedy</hi> without the help
of a <hi>Bawd</hi> or a <hi>Whore.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the whole, my Judgment is <hi>(if any body
valu'd it)</hi> that in this case as well as many
others, the contending Parties share the Truth
betwixt 'em. One side, and that I believe the
honester, knowing the notorious Debauchery
and Lewdness of those Sinks of Sin, out of a
<hi>little over-boyling Zeal,</hi> over-shoot the Mark, and
call all Plays and Dramatick Poetry the <hi>Devil's
Books,</hi> as much as Cards themselves are (in
which they may be much in the right,) for
the evil, but separable Appendages thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the thing in it self, though not only
innocent, but useful and profitable in its own
nature.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="74" facs="tcp:62151:138"/>
The other defend Plays in general, and so
far are in the right, but strain the point too
far on one side, as the first on the other; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the <hi>modern Plays</hi> from the Notion of
Plays in general, and thus easily overlooking,
if not taking in, all those cursed, little less
than Incentives to Lewdness and Villany, which
from the Company, the Subject represented,
and the <hi>softness of the Musick,</hi> are suckt in by the
<hi>Eye and Ears of the Spectators.</hi>—So much
for his Judgment, <hi>for further he saith not,</hi> nor
wou'd I for all the World add mine, for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that I'll keep to my self.—</p>
                        <p>But though he has done with <hi>Plays,</hi> I han't,
but must step into <hi>George-yard,</hi> and ask at a
Gentleman's Shop, call'd <hi>Infortunatus,</hi> for a Play
he lately printed, which 'tis thought will make
him an Alderman <hi>(by that time all the Impression
is sold off.)</hi> Some of the Flowers on't I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

<hi>Antichronismes,</hi> and tel me I clap present, past

                        <p>I cou'd blow away this Objection with only in
one word owning my self a <hi>Prophet,</hi> some hints

his <hi>Heroes;</hi> for after the poor King of <hi>Poland</hi>
was rais'd from the dead to tell his Tale, he
loo's the young Heroe at him, as if he were

makes him very civil, and drinks to the Sprite
with as much complaisance as <hi>Don-Iohn himself</hi>
in the <hi>Temple;</hi> but the mischief is, he makes all
his Heroes (like himself I suppose) very quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsom
in their Drink, for without any affront
in the world he falls a hussing him, draws his
Whiniard, and tells him not in Prose, but down-right

Love—ay, if there be an Angel upon

Mr. Critick don't be trouble som—</hi>
I know you'll tell me <hi>Love is blind;</hi> and how
shou'd he see what other People can't, when he
does not so much as see what they can—I'll
answer this by an easy Experiment: Don't Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
see a hundred fine, gawdy things in the
dark, which they cou'd never discover, unless
they were without Light: And do but try a trick
I'll tell ye, and then you'll trouble me no more
with such frivolous Objections, <hi>wink as hard as
you can,</hi> and let me take you a good swinging
close tweak by the Nose, and if I don't make
you see as <hi>many Stars in nothing</hi> at all, as we Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
do in our Mistresses, why then I'll throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
my Pen, and never write <hi>Ramble more.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>—Just at the same rate does that <hi>arch Wag
Cupid</hi> lead us poor silly Captives as we are, lead
us by the patient Nose, from Post to Pillar, and
from Pillar to Post agen, hither and thither,
and no body knows where; after no body knows
who, and when the Show is over, we our selves
<hi>can't tell for what.</hi> Thus did he once lead me
like a loving Ass as I was for my pains, <hi>seven
long Miles</hi> to see the happy place, <hi>(an old Stump
<pb facs="tcp:62151:143"/>
of a Tree,</hi> where my <hi>Mistress</hi> had sate seven years
before, and afterwards got upon my Shoulders,
like the <hi>black Cat,</hi> when Men are going to hang
themselves, weigh'd me down whether I wou'd or
no, and made me most ingloriously kiss the very
place which had been beautify'd with the closer
<hi>Appropinquation to her amiable Posterioristica;</hi> like
those whom the <hi>Lancashire Witches</hi> made kiss
the Mare's back-side who drew 'em to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                        <p>I know the grave <hi>Philosophers</hi> with long Beards,
won't fail to bestow a <hi>Sardonick</hi> Smile upon me
for these, as they'll call 'em, youthful Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies,
and perhaps too, they may justly enough
blame me; but yet I can as justly appeal from
their Sentence, as not capable Judges: They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knew what 'twas to love, or if they might
possibly in days of yore have been enamour'd on
the <hi>beautiful Perfections,</hi> and <hi>perfect Beauties</hi> of
one of <hi>Queen Bess</hi>'s Maids of Honour, 'twas
yet so long since, they may easily have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it.</p>
                        <p>I must therefore tell 'em <hi>what Love</hi> is, before
they can be competent Deciders in this business,
or know whether I am more blameable or praise-worthy
in admitting it a Guest into my tender
Heart. <hi>Love is a natural Distemper, a kind of small
Pox most have either had it, or is to expect it,
and the sooner the better; surely I was never well
cur'd on't in my Prenticeship, or I had never faln in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Relapse when I was out of my Time; but want</hi>
of Knowledge misguided me then, and so I fell
into a Quagmire. But in my last Amour (as
you'll find in <hi>my Rambles a wiving,</hi> which are to
make a distinct Volume, containing <hi>New Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
concerning Love and Women, with my own
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62151:143"/>
experimental Reflections,) I was so discreet as
not to advance <hi>a step without a Demonstration.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Love is all Mystery and Maze—</hi> says one that
had reason to know; but what's that to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
'Tis no better nor worse than one of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle's
occult Qualities,</hi> a Cover-slut for Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and only confessing in other words, that I
can't tell what 'tis.</p>
                        <p>However, I'm confident I know what 'tis not,
tho perhaps I can't so well tell what 'tis. Love
<hi>is not Desire</hi> any more than the <hi>Hangman is the
Lord Chief-Iustice:</hi> What Desire is there (in that
Sense wherein 'tis here taken) when distance and
absence part the Lover from his Object—<hi>Nay,
to venture nearer,</hi> how easie and common is it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the presence of what is most passionately
and dearly loved, to abstract really as well as
mentally, from any thing of that Nature. Even
the <hi>Spark</hi> himself may be appeal'd to, whether
he always <hi>desires</hi> his Mistress, and yet he'll swear
heartily that he always loves her. <hi>Desire</hi> is the
Flame of Love, and there is to be sure Fire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Flame, tho hardly Flame without Fire; a
little of one, and a little o' t'other does very
well.</p>
                        <p>After all, for the <hi>Platonick-tale</hi> is either a Whim,
or a Cover, or Friendship, or nothing at all.
It's true enough, nor can it modestly be deny'd,
that the same sort of Love I have for a man,
I may have for a Woman; but then for the most
<hi>part the Sex will steal in, and quickly make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That Wag <hi>Boccaline</hi> has a pleasant Story enough
(among a great many others) in his Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from <hi>Parnassus</hi> to this purpose—The
<hi>Virtuosi</hi> there having faln into the Acquaintance
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62151:144"/>
of some famous <hi>She-wits</hi> and <hi>Poetesses,</hi> and thought
themselves for a long time extreamly happy in
a Platonick Conversation with 'em—But 'twas
not long before <hi>Apollo</hi> discover'd some such <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Familiarities</hi> and Intimacies betwixt his <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosi</hi>
and the Ladies, that being afraid <hi>Parnassus</hi>
wou'd be over-stockt if they continu'd there
much longer, he immediately expell'd all those
dangerous Creatures, and ordain'd by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Edict they shou'd never be admitted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>I cou'd give a nearer and truer Instance to the
same purpose—'Twas not many years since,
that there liv'd in <hi>Loudon</hi> a Sect of <hi>persons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to perfection—and perpetual Virginity—</hi>
all their Love being <hi>Angelick,</hi> without the least
mixture of Matter, tho betwixt different Sexes
every one having their <hi>particular Friend.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus things continu'd for some Months, they
admiring their own Purity and Sanctity above all
Mankind—when behold—unluckily several of
the Virgins began to <hi>burnish</hi> and thrive amain,
and at the usual time, to the amazement of all
the Society, this their <hi>pure Friendsh,</hi> sent seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>living Babes</hi> into the World—After which
they were forc'd to drop their <hi>Principles,</hi> and be
content with <hi>matrimonial</hi> Purity instead of that
<hi>virginal</hi> one to which they at first pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>Love is the Greensickness in men—it makes 'em
stark mad for Toys and Trifles, as Women are for
Playster and Oatmeal.</p>
                        <p>Now you know what Love is, I'll tell you
<hi>what 'twas I lov'd—</hi>
                        </p>

                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:62151:147"/>
                        <p>Either to have kill'd my Rival or hang'd my self.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>hanging</hi> brings to my mind a pretty
Story, which though not much to the purpose,
I'll tell the World, because but few of 'em have
ever heard it; and after that let me alone to
tack it to the present Story.</p>
                        <p>A cunning Spark there was towards the end
of our unhappy Civil Wars, during <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s
Usurpation, who had by practice arriv'd to an
admirable <hi>dexterity in throtling Men,</hi> and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
'em whether they wou'd or no, without the
Formality of a <hi>Sheriff,</hi> a <hi>Psalm</hi> and a <hi>Ladder.</hi>
He having admittance into <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Embassador's
Lodgings in <hi>Holland,</hi> pretends to present him
a Petition, and while he was eagerly talking,
out comes the <hi>Noose, ana whip—over Mr. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador's
Head,</hi> and had certainly dismist him
before his time, had not one of the Retinue ran
in to his assistance, while in the tumult made
about it, the <hi>Hangman</hi> as well as <hi>Embassador,</hi>
slipt his Neck out of Collar, and got away in
the Crowd.</p>
                        <p>—A neat way 'twas,—well—at that rate
dared I have fought with e're a <hi>Rival in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom:</hi>
For whatever happens, there's no
Blood in this case, and till that comes, <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s
<hi>as Valiant a Lyon.</hi> Besides, Antipathy and
Honesty wou'd have secur'd me from letting the
<hi>Rope</hi> ever touch my Shoulders; and I had no
more fear'd they cou'd have done me any hurt
by making a <hi>Hempen Pass</hi> at me, than hang
up a wet Eel by the Tail with a four penny
Halter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="94" facs="tcp:62151:148"/>
However, loose I am from the <hi>Gallow-Tree
of Love,</hi> but know no more how I got clear,
than a Dog does when the Halter breaks and
he runs away,—though methinks I look back
upon't much at the same unpleasant rate, that
<hi>the poor Cur leers over his Shoulder at the unlucky
Branch which he has just escaped.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as the dying Wretches use to fay in
those Circumstances (as you may see in <hi>Dunton</hi>'s
new Book)—<hi>I hope good People you'll all take
warning by my sad Example, who alas as little
thought once of coming to this place, as any of you here
present to behold and bewail my unfortunate end.</hi>
But just at the end of the <hi>Speech</hi> comes a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Reprieve, and instead of plain hanging,
I am only to be <hi>transported—</hi> with <hi>Ioy</hi> I mean
(that's a fancy) at my unexpected deliverance.
But if e're I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>grave way of Matrimony,</hi> or so, (for what's past
was only <hi>Platonick)</hi> let me be <hi>turn'd over</hi> in
good earnest, or what's worse—let me <hi>Love on</hi>
till my Ears grow as long as <hi>Midas</hi>'s. In the
mean while, to carry on the Metaphor, as some
Robbers when pardon'd have discovered all the
methods of the Road, and done their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
excellent Service, even so will I <hi>clear my
Gizzard</hi> immediately, and declare all I know,
that the incautelous <hi>Apprentice</hi> may avoid the
danger I had been so near split upon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fly Love as a Viper,</hi> and you'll easily out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
him.—You are invulnerable behind,
(as <hi>Achilles</hi> in his Heel) but if you look but
over your Shoulder, you'r a dead Man. He's
a double <hi>Basilisk,</hi> and whoever sees first, kills
the Spectator as dead as a Log.</p>
                        <p>

as he found he lik'd it. I am n't willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat

do. Hang all these <hi>Prognosticating Wizzards,</hi>

And then was't not a very shrew'd

There's something very <hi>Masterly</hi> in all he writes,

an inveterate <hi>Press-mauler</hi> for above this twenty

                        <p>I was reading one of 'em with a great deal of

frighted out of my sober Thoughts with <hi>a whole

where this Author and I were confabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating,—and
at length the thing appeared that
made all the noise. I at first cou'd not imagin

red in the middle, and covered with white Ashes</hi> o' both

don't expell him from among 'em.</p>
                        <p>'Twas <hi>about Change-time</hi> I remember when we

never did poor Wretch pay more dearly for
his <hi>Debauchery</hi> than he does. No sooner gets he

and <hi>Rambled</hi> himself to <hi>Bartholomew-Fair</hi> with
Mrs. <hi>Isabella—</hi> Let 'em alone unless they were
better, and make Room for some of a fairer Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter—and
room must be made, for here comes
<hi>Brother K—</hi> mounted upon some <hi>Apocalyptical

<hi>Zion</hi> behind him, and a <hi>hundred thousand Bulls,</hi>
and Bears, and furious Beasts of Prey, roaring,

that unless some kind Angel drop from the
Clouds and hacks and hews very plentifully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
'em, he must certainly be torn as <hi>small as

worse than all, perhaps turn'd out agen a

                        <p>Then will he make such <hi>lamentable Dittys,</hi>
that 'twou'd be almost worth the while to try
the Experiment upon him to hear 'em. Yea,
he wou'd be <hi>wounded</hi> as much as his own <hi>Zion,</hi>
and take some of the <hi>Doggrel</hi> out of her Mouth,
to make his sad and doleful Complaint.</p>
                        <p>To the best of <hi>Vander's Memory,</hi> he has dress'd

for himself, shou'd it ever change its Humour,

                        <p>In spite of his present Quarrel with the World,
<hi>he loves the brave, and never envies Vertue when he
sees it fortunate,</hi> but rather feels such a pleasure,
as nothing else here gives him. If he's angry

His Honoured Friend, IOHN KING, <abbr>Esq</abbr>
(my late Fellow-Traveller through part of
America, Germany, Holland, and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,)
and now going again to Ramble.</head>
                  <p>GReat Travel (saith the Holy Text) is ordained for
the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and none of his Posterity has been
found without his share, since our <hi>Life</hi> is but a <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,</hi>
and all of us in a way-faring condition on this side
Eternity. No sooner do we leave the <hi>little Closers</hi> where we were
framed, than we begin our <hi>Ramble</hi> to those more <hi>spacious Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
in the bowels of the Earth. Every breath we draw, is a
<hi>step</hi> towards it; and whilst you are reading this, you pass one
of the <hi>Stages</hi> on the <hi>Road.</hi> And therefore, <hi>most dear Sir,</hi> I do
not at all discommend your present design, that is laid upon so just
and ancient Foundations; but seeing you are going agen to launch
your self into an Ocean in which lye many Rocks, whereon some
for want of skill, or inadvertency, have suffer'd <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> it
will not be amiss to take a <hi>Map</hi> along with you; wherein you
may discover those <hi>Gulfs</hi> on which many before you have bin ruin'd,
and so avoid those Misfortunes which their Destruction has render'd
more signal.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Travel</hi> a Man may be said to reduce into <hi>Practice</hi> that
which before he only had the <hi>Theory</hi> of, without being deluded by
the often erroneous Assertions of others; and how fatal unto Truth
the dependance upon the Tradition and Authority of Men has been,
<hi>Truth</hi> it self can best discover. Not that by this I would seem to impose
<hi>a necessity of Travelling upon all Mankind,</hi> for I know all are
not equally qualified for it; nor is it absolutely necessary to our well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being.
But seeing <hi>Novelty</hi> is a thing so agreeable to our nature,
besides the delight which the <hi>mighty Variety</hi> will afford you, you
will be thereby rendred more amiable unto all your Acquaintance,
when it shall please God to return you unto them again.</p>
                  <p>Every body will find something in you that will be pleasing to
himself; one will be ravisht with the Spices of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and another
with the gaudy Plumes of the <hi>Indians,</hi> whilst you your self shall be
able to make more advantagious Collections <hi>(out of the great
Book of Nature,)</hi> and observe how the Image of the <hi>Creator,</hi> as in
several sorts of shapes, is represented in every Nation, as well as in
<hi>every Man.</hi>

the <hi>French;</hi> the revengeful Subtilty of the <hi>Italian,</hi> and the
stable Fidelity of the <hi>English,</hi> will be no unpleasing Diversion;
when in the enjoyment of the latter, you may recollect the dangers
and inconveniences of the others: The <hi>Barbarity of the Heathen,</hi>
will make you bless the Fate which has placed you in another Society;
and some good Men which you may find among them, <hi>(for Pearls are

you cannot be without a prospect of them, by which you are
chiefly induced to undertake it. And I question not but those which
you will make, will give you a view of more to be acquired; of which
when you are Master, they will represent others unto you, and so by
a long <hi>Concatenation</hi> of what at once doth <hi>profit and delight,</hi>

                        <p>And to confess the truth, I have got such a

There is something in <hi>Travelling,</hi> I fancy, that
makes a Man's Thoughts reel, and that leads his
Pen to wander as much about as his Person does.</p>
                        <p>I have strangely faggotted up diverse Pieces,
or made an odd Composition; but let them go
<hi>ramble</hi> if they will into the World as they rise,
for I have a mind to represent the <hi>Progress of my
Humour,</hi> that every one may see every Piece as
it came from the Forge.</p>
                        <p>My <hi>Rambling Fancies</hi> follow one another, but
sometimes at a great distance, and look toward
one another, but 'tis with an <hi>oblique</hi> glance. I
have read a Dialogue in <hi>Plato</hi> of such a motly
and fantastick Composition, as had the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>of Love,</hi> and all the rest <hi>of Rhetorick.</hi> I
love a Poetical march by leaps and skips: There
are pieces in <hi>Plutarch</hi> where he forgets his Theme;
yet how beautiful are his <hi>Variations</hi> and <hi>Digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions!</hi>
and then most of all when they seem to
be fortuitous, and <hi>introduc'd for want of heed.</hi>

to all, that we dare not own to any. 'Tis a
pitiful Cowardise that strikes a Man in the dark,
and like a Serpent bites him by the heel, and then
creeps into his hole for want of Courage to abet
his Actions. To invenome any Man's Name by
Aspersions, that freely tells us his Crime (and
with the <hi>Pelican</hi> dissects himself before us, that so
by ripping up his own Bowels, we might see

stripes with an <hi>Iron Rod</hi> to him who before hath
fley'd himself with his own whipping; and is
always by a <hi>Noble Mind</hi> lookt upon with
great disdain. <hi>'Tis below the gallantry of Man to
tyrannize over the weak: The brave Soul scorns Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.
Is it noble in Arms to fight against the

                        <p>But alas there is no Man that blames another,

And the purest Gold of upright Men that ever
we read extant, had yet something of an Allay.
No Man living is so circumspect, so considerate,
or so fearful of offending, but he has much to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for: The difference is, that we do not all
transgress in the same way: He only may tax o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by priviledge, that hath not in himself what
others may tax. He that cleanses a Blot with
blotted Fingers, makes a greater Blurr. And
therefore it is that a good Man sets a guard upon
his Lips, and examins all his Language e're it
passes. The Scripture says, <hi>Speak evil of no man;</hi>
then sure their hands cannot be clean, that throw
so much dirt in other Mens faces. A <hi>good Name</hi>
is like the Apple of our Eye, of which we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>tender;</hi> and the reason may be, because it
is of great use in serving <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Generation;</hi>
therefore whosoever it be that goes to lessen our
<hi>Credit,</hi> labours in what he can to prevent the good
we might do to the end of our Lives. To cut
the throat of a fair Reputation with Hums—and

                        <p>I now expect to be snarl'd at by the <hi>sower Fops</hi>
of the Town for this free way of writing, but
surely (as Friend <hi>Seneca</hi> has it) <hi>our Philosophy
might carry us up to the bravery of a generous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiff,
that can hear the barking of a thousand Curs,
without taking any notice of them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was well answer'd of an <hi>old Courtier,</hi> that
was askt how he kept so long in favour, <hi>Why</hi>
(says he) <hi>by receiving Injuries, and crying, Your
humble Servant for them.</hi> Will any but a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
quarrel with a Cur for barking, when he
may pacifie him with a Crust? What have we
to do but to get further off and laugh at him?
'Tis true, <hi>Fidus Cornelius</hi> fell down right a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <hi>Senate-house</hi> at <hi>Corbulos,</hi> saying, <hi>That
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62151:179"/>
he look'd like an Estridge.</hi> But now ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this, no Man was ever ridiculous to others,
that laught at himself first. It prevents mischief,
and 'tis a spiteful disappointment of those that
take pleasure in such Abuses. There are none
more <hi>abusive</hi> to others, than they that lye most
open to it themselves; but the humour goes
round, and he that laughs at my <hi>Rambles</hi> to
day, will have some Person or other fleering
at his <hi>Maggots</hi> to morrow, and revenge my
quarrel.</p>
                        <p>He that is listening after private discourse,
and what People say of him, shall never be at
peace. How many things that are innocent in
themselves, are made injurious yet by <hi>mis-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;</hi>
wherefore some things we are to pause
upon, others to laugh at, and others again to
pardon. 'Tis the part of a Christian not to
believe any thing till he is very certain of it; for
many probable things prove false; we are prone
to believe many things which we are unwilling
to <hi>hear,</hi> and so we conclude and take up a <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi>
before we can judge.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I never condemn any Man unheard, or without
letting him know his Accuser or his Crime.</hi> 'Tis a
common thing for your Pick-thanks to say, <hi>Do
not you tell that you had it from me; for if you do, I'll
deny it, and never tell you any thing again.</hi> By
which means Friends are set together by the <hi>Ears,</hi>
and the <hi>Informer slips his Neck out of the Collar.</hi>
Admit no Stories upon these terms; for 'tis an
unjust thing to <hi>believe</hi> in private, and to be <hi>angry</hi>
openly; for without the making the best of every
thing, there is no living in society with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Let us never be too <hi>credulous;</hi> some make

                        <p>If it be a small matter <hi>(says</hi> Seneca) I would have
Witnesses; but if it be a greater, I would have it upon
Oath, and allow time to the Accused, and Council too,
and hear it over and over.</p>
                        <p>I know not which is worse, the Bearer of
Tales, or the Receiver; for the one makes the
other. The generous Man, where he cannot
stop others Mouths, he will stop his own Ears:
<hi>The Receiver is as bad as the Thief.</hi>

                           <hi>Reader,</hi> while I speak this to you, I prescribe to
my self, what I write I read, and desire to reduce all
my Meditations to the ordering of my own Manners.</p>
                        <p>Well, but some one will say, this design of
making a Man's self the Subject of his Writing,
were indeed excusable in <hi>Rare-and-Famous-Men,</hi>
who by their Reputation had given others a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
to be fully informed of them; who have
Qualities worthy of Imitation; whose Life and
Opinions may serve for Example.</p>
                        <p>To which I answer, If the World find fault
that I <hi>speak</hi> of my self, I find fault that they
do not so much as think of themselves. <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
that taught, <hi>Nosce Teipsum;</hi> learnt likewise to
know himself; and by that study was arriv'd to
the Perfection of setting himself at naught. And
the old Philosopher<note n="*" place="bottom">Heraclitus.</note> never wanted occasion for
his Tears, whilst he considered himself.</p>

                           <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62151:180"/>
I have this to say (as an Apology for treating
of my self) that never any Man treated of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
he better understood and knew, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this Subject I am the most understanding
Man alive.</p>
                        <p>Sir <hi>William Cornwallis</hi> saith of <hi>Montaigne</hi>'s Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says,
That it was the likeliest Book to advance
Wisdom; because the Author's <hi>own Experience</hi>
is the chiefest Argument in it. And indeed,
shou'd every Man write an exact <hi>Narrative</hi>
of the various Experiences and Circumstances
of his Life, comprehending as well his <hi>Vices</hi> as
<hi>Vertues,</hi> and have them with simplicity rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
how useful would this prove to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick!
But this so impartial Account may rather
be wish'd for than expected, since Men have ever
preferred their own private Reputation before
the real Good of themselves or others. <hi>Alas,
every Man is not an</hi> Evander!</p>
                        <p>But now if contrary to the mode of such
<hi>Travellers</hi> as lose their Thoughts in the open
Air where they were conceived, I have
with more diligence registred mine: It was
out of no Opinion they deserve a <hi>longer</hi> life,
but to prevent <hi>Idleness.</hi> 'Twas my leisure
hours at <hi>Sea</hi> that first put into my Head this
fancy of Writing; wherein when I found my
self totally unprovided of other Matter, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
my self to my self for Argument and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
All I seek, is by my Pen to find Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for a Spirit that would <hi>break the Vessel,</hi> had
it nothing to work upon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62151:180"/>
Alas, <hi>Reader,</hi> Writing is as
natural to me as Eating; I was
born Studying, as you find by
my early <hi>Rambles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And indeed no Man cometh into the World to
be <hi>idle. Adam in the state of Innocency</hi> (when Emperor
of the World) must dress the <hi>Garden;</hi> and after
it was denounc'd against him, <hi>In the sweat of thy
brows shalt thou eat thy bread. Solomon</hi>'s Princess
eats not the bread of idleness. St. <hi>Paul</hi> laboured.
The High-Priests among the <hi>Iews</hi> had, and the
Great <hi>Mogul</hi> at this time hath a Trade, at which
(as I heard in <hi>Leiden</hi>) he is to labour every day.
And you may take notice, that she is set out to
us as skill'd in <hi>Cookery,</hi> whose Brother was <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in all his glory.</hi> Shall we eat, and not work?
Shall we yawn away our precious hours? Shall
we think with the <hi>Lillies</hi> (which neither spin nor
labour) <hi>our cloaths will grow upon us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alas, <hi>Idleness</hi> is the Mother of all Mischief.
St. <hi>Austin</hi> says, That he that is employed, is
tempted with one Devil; but he that is <hi>Idle,</hi>
with a thousand.</p>
                        <p>I heard, whilst I was in <hi>Holland</hi> of so great a
Sluggard, that (as 'twas said) he never saw the
<hi>Sun rising or setting</hi> in his whole life, but would
usually tell it for News at Noon, that the Sun
was up.</p>
                        <p>I remember I have read in an <hi>Italian</hi> History
of one <hi>so Idle,</hi> that he was fain to have one to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62151:181"/>
help him to stir his Chaps when he should eat
his Meat.</p>
                        <p>Such is the vileness of the Age we live in, that
<hi>Idleness</hi> is counted an Ornament, and the greatest
<hi>gentility,</hi> is to do nothing; whereas 'tis <hi>Action</hi>
only that is <hi>noble;</hi> and not only the Celestial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are in <hi>continual motion,</hi> but he that is most
high, is <hi>Purissimus actus;</hi> and besides the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of his own Goodness, is ever at work
in Acts of Providence, and government of his
Creatures.</p>
                        <p>'Tis Action that does keep the Soul both
sweet and sound. There is a kind of good Angel
waiting upon diligence, that ever carries a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
in his Hand to Crown her. The bosom'd Fist
beckons the approach of Poverty; but the lifted
Arm does frighten Want. How unworthy was
that Man to live in the World, of whom it was
said, He ne're did ought, but only liv'd and
dy'd.</p>
                        <p>Diligence and Moderation doubtless are the

                           <note n="*" place="bottom">Think no Labour Slavery, That brings in Penny savourly. <hi>says old</hi> Tusser. <hi>And there's a great deal of gravy in those musty old Proverbs.</hi>
                           </note> A Man
is neither good, nor wise, nor rich <hi>at once;</hi> yet
softly creeping up those hills, he shall every day

him what he could do with it? He answers,

little) I lay it up at home till the years end, and
with all together I every <hi>New-years-day</hi> add a
Dish to my <hi>Cup-board.</hi> He that has the Patience
to attend small Profits, usually grows a great
Man. <hi>Polemon</hi> ready to die, would needs be

<hi>Mahomet</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> (he that Conquer'd <hi>Greece</hi>)

(having no <hi>Rambles</hi> to write) spent his time in
killing Flies with a Bodkin. <hi>Nicias</hi> the Painter
was often so intent on his Trade, as to forget
Food, and omit the reception of Nature's sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
<hi>Alexander</hi> never slept save with his Arm

that lest he slept too securely, the falling of

But why should I multiply <hi>Examples</hi> of this
kind, seeing here are enough to convince the
<hi>Lazy</hi> how <hi>glorious a Vertue Diligence</hi> is; and to
authorize my Practice in writing my <hi>own Life

some of the Philosophers. And I am the more
willing to expose my <hi>Whimsies</hi> to the Publick,

and without any Pattern I know they will be

will not stick to say, <hi>See whence he took it!</hi> 'Tis
true, I cannot deny but in this Book there are
many things that may perhaps one day have bin
made known to me by other Writers; but if
they have, I have utterly forgot by whom. But
say, they were all Collections: Is the Honey
the worse because the Bee sucks it out of
many Flowers? Or is the Spider's Web the
more to be prais'd, because it is extracted out of
her own Bowels? <hi>Wilt thou say, the Taylor did not
make the Garment, because the Cloth it was made of
was weav'd by the Weaver?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore let no body insist upon the <hi>Matter</hi>
I write, but my <hi>Method</hi> in writing. If I have
borrowed any thing, let them observe in what
I borrow; if I have known how to chuse what is
proper to raise or relieve the <hi>Invention,</hi> which is
always my own,; for if I steal from others, 'tis
that they may say for me, <hi>what</hi> either for want
of Language or want of Sence I cannot my self
express.</p>

'Tis true, I have always an <hi>Idea</hi> in my Soul
which presents me a <hi>better form</hi> than what I have

The best Story in the World would be spoyl'd
by my handling. If therefore I transplant any of
others Notions into my own soil, and confound
them among my own, I purposely conceal the
Author, to awe the temerity of those precipitous
Censures that fall upon all sorts of Writings:
<hi>I will have my Reader wound</hi> Plutarch <hi>through my

rail at me; I must shelter my own weakness under these

sitting under a large Beech-tree listning
to the pretty Musick which the Birds made in the

whistling himself to bear them company in their

thus sweetly entertain himself, and at last he
pull'd out of his Breeches (or <hi>Leathern-Cupboard</hi>)
a piece of Bread and Cheese, which with Eyes

that he has not yet enough; but he that has
enough, is at rest. The richest Man that ever
liv'd is poor in my opinion, but he that keeps
himself to the stint of Nature, nor does <hi>neither
feel Poverty nor fear it.</hi> Nay, even in Poverty
it self there are some things superfluous: Those
which the World calls Happy, that felicity is
a small splendor that <hi>dazles</hi> the Eyes of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62151:195"/>
but our rich Man is glorious and happy.
Within there's no Ambition in Hunger or Thirst.
Let there be Food, and no matter for the Table,
the Dish, and the Servants. 'Tis not for us to
say, <hi>this is not handsom, that's common, t'other offends
my Eye.</hi> Nature provides for health, not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.
When the Trumpet sounds a Charge,
the poor Man knows that he's not aim'd at;
when they cry out, <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> his Body is all he
has to look after: If he be to take a Journey,
there's no <hi>blocking up of Streets,</hi> and thronging
of Passages for a <hi>parting Complement.</hi> No Man
finds Poverty a trouble to him, but he that thinks
it so; and he that thinks it so, makes it so.
He that is not content in Poverty, would not be
so neither in Plenty; for the fault is not in the
Thing, but the Mind; if that be sickly, remove
him from a Kennel to a Palace, he's at the same
pass. If there were nothing else in Poverty
but the certain knowledge of our Friends, it
were yet a most desirable Blessing when every
Man leaves us but those that love us.</p>
                        <p>In a word, Let the Mind be great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and all other things are despicable in
comparison; the future is uncertain, and I had
rather beg of my self not to desire any thing,
than of Fortune to bestow it.</p>
                        <p>As soon as she had ended her <hi>pretty Chat,</hi> she
drops me two or three Curtsies (as low as the
ground) as a Token of Farewell; which I
soon repay'd with as many Bows as I thought
<hi>so vertuous a Mind had a right in any Habit to
exact.</hi>

began a showr of Tears to fall from my Eyes,</hi> considering how I
had left my Master, lamenting my Loss, and fearing what fatal
courses I might take. It was no less trouble to me to think
that I had nothing still but <hi>Hazel</hi> and <hi>Brambles</hi> to address my

knockt with a courage, that loudly declared there was one
at the door that was not afraid of being heard.</p>
                        <p>My Father by a wonderful accident hearing the noise,

surely had I been a Messenger from the <hi>Man in the Moon</hi> (or,
which is more frightful, the pale Ghost of some merciless

(<hi>Yes,</hi> adds my Father, <hi>and a short one too,</hi>) its former lustre
vanishes, and I see it a quite different thing from what it was
represented to me. But Sir, if my returning home has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
your anger against me, I humbly beg <hi>Pardon</hi> from
Heaven, and <hi>Forgiveness</hi> from you. Be pleased therefore to
mitigate my offence, by revolving in your mind the fewness of
my years, which makes me <hi>(as it doth many others)</hi> prone to
Rambling Fancies. And for once (I intreat you Sir) look
on this youthful, and my first Elapse, but as a thing which
maturity of years may rectifie; and if you can forgive my
Follies, I will study to forget them, and daily endeavour
by a dutiful Carriage to declare to the World how much I will

                                       <p>6. I do likewise counsel you to have a <hi>convenient Shop,</hi> in
a convenient place, at your own charge, (which will very

negligent to put you in remembrance of these things, though
you know them, and are established in the present truth.
That which the Lord expects at our hands, is, that we should
<hi>walk worthy of him</hi> who hath called us unto a Kingdom; that
we should live unto the praise of his <hi>rich Grace,</hi> who hath so
freely poured out his Soul unto death for us. <hi>Dying Love</hi>
justly merits an humble, lowly, thankful and fruitful Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
Truly we live in a crooked and perverse Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Satan hath his Seat in every place; great is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of Sin, the deceitfulness of our own Hearts, the power
and malice of our spiritual Adversary: It nearly concerns
us therefore to <hi>give all diligence to make our calling and election

of my Garments,</hi> or that my Cloaths were some where in
<hi>Trouble,</hi> that I might still keep up the port of <hi>Travelling by

one my Hat, another my Cloak, a third my Cane, a fourth
my Belt, but not my Sword (for to speak truth I had none)
and a fifth my Wig, (and 'twas a favour, believe it, my Head

again for <hi>London;</hi> and getting into the Road, I applied my
self (Citizen like) to the out-side of my Beast, a meagre and
idolatrous Animal, that did homage almost to every Stone he
met with.</p>

me for one inconsiderate Act, and yet have been highly just;

when, and ever since I was born, you
have heard already by <hi>another Hand;</hi> 'tis my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

then that Spectacle which <hi>Vander</hi> dares not look

Ramble</hi> through the <hi>Zodiack.</hi> 'Twas now

<hi>Globe</hi> in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> where meeting with a <hi>knot of
loving Neighbours,</hi> in the height of our caressing
Endearments, one was for making a visit to
the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and another to the <hi>West; If
you'l go, I'll go,</hi> says one; and I'll go if you'll
go, says another, till at last they concluded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it to go all together.</p>

March, and after a long Debate, they were all
for <hi>France</hi> excepting my self.</p>

Bussing</hi> the Hand we parted—But by that time
I had <hi>Rambled</hi> a Mile or two from <hi>London,</hi> who
should I meet but <hi>Philaret,</hi> (an Old Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,)
and thus I began to salute him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Kainophilus.</hi> Well met Dear Friend! What say
you to a <hi>Ramble</hi> now, as far as Earth, and
Seas, and <hi>Love</hi> can carry us?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Philaret.—Agreed!</hi> I never was out at a Mad
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:62151:214"/>
Frollick, tho this is the Maddest I ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook:
<hi>Sir,</hi> I take you at your Word, and if
you are for a Merry Jaunt, I'll try for once who
can foot it farthest; there are <hi>Hedges in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
and <hi>Barns</hi> in <hi>Winter</hi> to be found: I with
my <hi>Knap-sack,</hi> and you with your <hi>Bottle</hi> at
your Back. Wee'll leave <hi>Honour</hi> to Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and <hi>Riches</hi> to Knaves and Fools, and
Travel 'till we come to the ridge of the
World, and then drop together into the next.—Hang
Pinching!—Wee'll <hi>Ramble</hi> till we
can see both Poles knock; 'till we leave the
<hi>Moon and Stars,</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> behind us; 'till we
find <hi>Mountains of Gold</hi> without a Fiction, (and
seeing <hi>Novelty</hi> is a thing so agreeable to our
Natures) wee'll <hi>wander still on,</hi> till we view
the Cradle of the Infant-Morn, observe the
<hi>Chambers</hi> of the Rising Sun—<hi>see him take
Coach,</hi> Man! and be able to distinguish the
Colour of his Horses, and their several Kinds:
<hi>—Nor rest yet,</hi> 'till by our own Hazard we
have discover'd <hi>New Worlds,</hi> and brought
one Hemisphere to some Acquaintance with
another; nay, <hi>Ramble</hi> till—But here's
enough in Conscience for a taste of a Frollick,
I'll therefore now (with your Worships
Leave) sit down and rest me, for I am at the
<hi>End of the World already.—</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Philaret</hi> and I being thus agreed on a <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Project,</hi> you shall now seldom see us two
asunder: We dwell together like <hi>Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi>
Had one been a Boy and the other a Girl,
sure enough we had been <hi>Man and Wife.</hi> If one
of us had been <hi>Castor,</hi> and the other <hi>Pollux,</hi> it
had been well for Mariners, for we should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:62151:215"/>
have appear'd together. Why had we not
both one <hi>Mother?</hi> Why were we not <hi>Twins?</hi>
for never were two better pleas'd with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Company; part us and ye kill us, for
when <hi>Soul and Body part 'tis Death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that now pursuing my first Resolutions of
viewing my <hi>Native Countrey,</hi> my Fellow Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
and I like two Sons of <hi>Priam, Per varios

Guinea's in our Pockets to fortifie our selves
against the Attacks of Hunger, Thirst, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Enemies of Men upon a <hi>Ramble;</hi> and much

invited by a Consort of <hi>Birds,</hi> which sung
very sweetly in a Neighbouring Hedge, we by
mutual Consent, sat down on a Bank, partly
to observe the Harmony these pretty wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Choristers made, and partly to feed our
Eyes with the variety of Detectable Objects,

which should most engage the Beholders Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

and just as I was about to Reply, there fell a
sudden Showr of Rain mixt with large Hail,
which occasion'd us to rise in hast from our Seats,
and <hi>Ramble</hi> to seek for some shelter. After a
little scampering in the Shower, we came at last
to an old <hi>holl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had eaten a <hi>Door;</hi> so that finding open House
kept there, we entred the Tenement, judging
it to be Rent-free. Its Hollow was very capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and large, sufficient to contain four Men
together, standing upright. It was closely Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the top by part of the solid <hi>Trunk,</hi> so that
not the least drop of Rain or any other Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
could find a Cranny to distil through.
We were both extreamly pleased at our <hi>New
Mansion,</hi> and took it as a good Omen of our
<hi>Ramble, since Nature has in every Corner such
a Sanctuary for the distressed Pilgrim.</hi> But the

                        <p>ACcording to my promise in the last <hi>Chapter,</hi>
I am obliged to give some Account of the
most observable Occurrencs in our <hi>Survey of
Cholsbury.</hi> After my Companion and I had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
paid our Stomachs their usual <hi>Bill of Fare,</hi>
and brib'd our Noses with a Pipe or two of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi>
we call'd for our Landlord, and told him
we had a great Inclination to see the Town. He
being a <hi>brisk jolly Fellow,</hi> presently offered us his
Company and Service; so we <hi>hoisted up our Bums,</hi>
and made to the <hi>Streetward.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But we had not got clear of the <hi>Sands</hi> that were
strewed on the Floor of the Room where we
were at Anchor, when there was an <hi>Embargo</hi> sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
laid on our Ears by a strange confused noise
in our Chamber over our heads, which mightily
surpriz'd us.</p>
                        <p>Our <hi>Host</hi> hastned up Stairs, and desired us to
follow him; which we readily did, being greedy
of the <hi>Novelty.</hi> The Chamber-door was open,
and gave us an opportunity of beholding a very
pleasant Spectacle.</p>

                           <hi>Some young Sea-faring Sparks</hi> were got together
a fudling in this Chamber, and having drank
themselves into <hi>Land Calentures,</hi> fancy'd the
Room to be a <hi>Pinnace,</hi> floating on the Sea in a
Storm (for the Wind indeed was high, and made
the Windows clatter) attributing their Reeling
to the rocking of the <hi>Vessel,</hi> and being strongly
possess'd with this conceit, and the danger they
were in, every one begins to act his part, and
consult the <hi>common safety;</hi> there was a noise of
<hi>Haul Cat, Starboard,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Marine
Cant, Fly</hi> (saith one) <hi>up to the Mair-Top, and

towards, and wills them, if they'l save their
<hi>Ship</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> to cast their Lading <hi>Over-board.</hi>
At this, all to work, and hoist into the Street,
<hi>as to the Sea,</hi> what next comes to their hands,
<hi>Stools, Tables, Tressels, Trenchers, Bedsteds, Cups,
Pots, Plate and Glasses.</hi> Here a Fellow swagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they take him for the <hi>Boatswain;</hi> one lies
strugling upon the floor, as if he swom for Life;
a third takes the Bass-Viol for the <hi>Cock-Boat,</hi>
sits in the Belly on't, labours, sweats, and
rows, his Oar the Stick with which the Fidler
play'd: A fourth bestrides his Fellows, thinking
to 'scape that way: In the Chimney lies one
whistling, another gaping, another swearing
and cursing, and all of them in such a <hi>Tempest of
Imagination,</hi> that had not the Master of the House
interpos'd his Authority, and seasonably assum'd
the Office of Master of the supposed <hi>Pinnace,</hi>
commanding all hands down in the Hold; they
were upon the point of casting all the <hi>Lading
Over-board,</hi> and hoysting all his Goods out of the
Window into the Street. But at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:62151:221"/>
they all ran down Stairs helter skelter,
with a hideous out-cry of, <hi>All hands to the
Pump,</hi> imagining a <hi>Leak</hi> was sprung in the
<hi>Hold.</hi> When they were come down into the
Entry, the Air began to work upon their
floating Stomachs, and there was a mighty
<hi>wambling</hi> within them; one springs a <hi>Leak</hi> in
his <hi>Fore-Castle</hi> and <hi>Cook-Room,</hi> another in the
<hi>Stern,</hi> till having <hi>unladed</hi> their drunken Carkas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
they began to awake out of their Dreams,
and shaking their Ears, tumbled out of doors
as fast as they could. What became of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
I know not, for <hi>I hilaret</hi> and I taking our
Landlord along with us, entred now upon view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Town, and the <hi>Rarities</hi> in it: Which
when we beheld, we were so far from being
over-ravish'd with joy at the Sight, that we
took it for some inchanted Castle, in regard we
could not see so much as one Stone of all that
<hi>magnificent Pile,</hi> which our Landlord had been
building in our fancy; rather we were more
than usually surprized at the humility of the
Structures, and the lowliness of the Owners.</p>
                        <p>Rambling into the middle of the Town, we
entred a House, the Master of which, had he
not been a <hi>Scot,</hi> you would have sworn him a
<hi>Turk,</hi> regardless of his Habitation in this World,
in expectation of <hi>Fools-Paradise</hi> in the next.</p>

Copper, after the <hi>Sweedish</hi> manner, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Scotch</hi> custom, very meanly thatcht
with Oaten Reeds; not such as the <hi>Arcadian</hi>
Shepherds pip'd withal, but plain downright
illiterate Straw. The Fire was made near the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:62151:221"/>
Bed-side, at one end, which for want of a
Chimney, wrapt the whole Family, Guests and
all, like so many <hi>Ixions</hi> in a continual Cloud of
Eye-tormenting Smoak: Near to the Bed-side
lay the Corn and Hay, which you may be sure
was not worth its weight in Gold; and at the
other end, without the distinction of Partitions,
stood two Sheep, a Cow, and an old Horse. So
that it may may be verily believed, that Vertue
her self, in all her Exiles and Persection, never
liv'd in such a homely Hermitage; and <hi>Marius,</hi>
when he lay hid among the Bulrushes in the Fens
of <hi>Minturnus,</hi> might be thought to have lodged
in a Palace to this ill-favour'd resemblance of
<hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Ark.</hi>

                        <p>But indeed the Tenements all o're the Town,
are suitable to the Guests that possess them; for
as these seem to be <hi>Dirt</hi> moulded into <hi>Men,</hi> so
those are the same matter kneaded into <hi>Houses;</hi>
they are all very <hi>humble Cottages,</hi> and low in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so that a Man may ride upon the Ridge,
and yet have his Legs hang in the Dirt; those
that are so magnificent as to be <hi>crested</hi> with a
Chimney, are mightily valu'd, as most <hi>Cocking
Fabricks.</hi>

and such cleansing Implements, are very proper
to correct the filthiness of their Mansions; we
found no Apartments in these their Habitations,
every Edifice where ere we came being a <hi>Noah</hi>'s
<hi>Ark,</hi> where a <hi>Promiscuous</hi> Family, a <hi>Miscellaneous</hi>

in one Room; the Pigs and the Pullen, and

other Brutes either truckling under, or lying at
the Beds-feet of the little more <hi>refin'd,</hi> yet their
Brother <hi>Animals.</hi> They are much addicted to
the Sin of <hi>Nastiness,</hi> wallowing in filthiness like
so many Swine; so that the whole Town seems
to be but a general <hi>Stye.</hi>

                        <p>A Man skill'd in <hi>Orthography</hi> is admir'd as a

To the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Philosophy</hi> of this <hi>Sophy,</hi>
his little Boy <hi>Bardus</hi> added <hi>Poetry;</hi> a Lad (it

                        <p>The Disciples of this <hi>Laureat</hi> were termed
<hi>Bards,</hi> the great <hi>Embalmers</hi> of Heroick Actions;
who (I warrant you) will wrap up an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement
so securely in a <hi>Monument</hi> of single
Verse, that all the niblings in the World shall
never be able to devour the Immortality of a

                        <p>The most Famous of these <hi>Meter-mongers</hi> were

                        <p>As for the <hi>Loves</hi> of these Villagers, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegues
of their Amours are not a little remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable,
they being very pretty <hi>Animals</hi> when
disguis'd with that Passion: They are <hi>Tinder</hi> to
such Flames, being quickly set on fire, even by
the least spark, which when it hath catch'd
the <hi>Match</hi> of their Souls <hi>(for they have</hi> Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
<hi>in them as well as in their Bodies)</hi> they are
presently kindled into <hi>Transport</hi> and <hi>Extasie;</hi>
and these model them into the shapes of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Anticks,</hi> and make them shew more tricks
than <hi>Banks</hi> his Horse.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes they are shaking the <hi>Globules</hi> of
their Noddles, and sometimes dancing some
<hi>Geometry</hi> with the <hi>Figures</hi> of their <hi>Feet;</hi> now they
smite with <hi>clapper</hi> of Fist their troubled Breasts,

                        <p>He commonly <hi>ore-flows</hi> in his prattle about

lucky at <hi>Similitude,</hi> and is happy in his <hi>Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
about her Person. One in this Town (as
our Landlord told us) having a glympse through
the Key-hole of her <hi>Saffron</hi> Body, burst out into
a Panegyrick of the <hi>Bees-waxness</hi> (as he phras'd

                        <p>He seldom troubles his Madam with the Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a Letter, but usually accosts her with
the <hi>Missive</hi> (as I may say) of his nown Person,

                        <p>We heard of one that went a wooing with a

                           </note>.</p>
                        <p>These are some of the choicest <hi>Observations
Philaret</hi> and I made during our stay at <hi>Cholsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
we might easily have added more, (the
whole Town indeed being but one <hi>grand Remark,</hi>)
but being pretty well satisfied with what we
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:62151:225"/>
had seen already, we both resolved to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
our <hi>Ramble:</hi> But if it should be our chance
to have our Lot to set our Feet on that Soil a
second time, we shall venture to present another
Show of it, for 'tis pity such a rare Sight as
<hi>Cholsbury</hi> should want a Trumpet; nay, and a
Fool too to proclaim and expose it to the
World.</p>
                        <p>After we had cramm'd our Budget with these
few Notices, longing now for change of Air,
we bid aduieu to our Host, and fairly troop'd
out of the Town next way our <hi>Fancy</hi> led us,
and soon came in the Fields; in one of which
there were three different <hi>Paths,</hi> and we having
as yet form'd no <hi>Design,</hi> but only pure <hi>Ramble,</hi>
took the old Adage for our Guide, <hi>Medio tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimus
ibis:</hi> The middle Path, brought us into a
fair Meadow, which we had no sooner entered,
but our Ears were arrested by a Voice far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
the utmost flight <hi>of Panegyrick:</hi> For tho
it was not governed with Skill, yet it did so
repay the Defect of it with its <hi>native Sweetness,</hi>
that Art was absent without being miss'd, and
I could not but have some Curiosity to see who
was the <hi>Possessor of so much power to please.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
therefore our Rambling Steps toward
that part of the Field whence the Voice
came, my Eyes quickly ceased to envy my ears,
for they discover'd kneeling by a Cow, and
singing to her (whilst she Milk'd her,) a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who in the habit of a <hi>Milkmaid,</hi> seem'd to
disguise, and yet make good the Character of
one of those <hi>Nymphs</hi> the Poets are wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe:
I need not tell you this fair Creature
had the <hi>Blushes of the Morning in her Cheeke, the
Splendor of the Sun in her Eyes, the grateful freshenss
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:62151:226"/>
of the Fields in her Looks,</hi> the whitenss of the
Milk (she had before her) in her Skin; least
you should think I spent too much time in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
on her: But I may perhaps without much
<hi>Hyperbole,</hi> give you this Account of her, that
though her Cloaths were suited to her Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet they were very ill suited to her <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
which as if <hi>Nature intended a Triumph over
Fortune,</hi> did without any assistance of Ornament,
more distress my Liberty than others have been
able to do with all their most curious <hi>Dresses.</hi>
In a word, she looked at once so Innocent and
Pretty, that she seem'd like to do Mischief,
without at all intending it. Whilst my Eyes
were fixed on her as attentively as dazled ones
could be, the lovely <hi>Milkmaid</hi> took up her
Pail to carry it homewards. As she passed by
me, upon the last glimpse, she vouchsafed me
a Smile; which I then thought would have made
me very happy, if it had proceeded from <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
not bare Civility. And she went away
with a look so Serene as well as taking, that
she seemed to carry home with her far more qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
then she left me possessed of. And to confess
the Truth,</p>
                        <l>Of all the loveliest things, and noblest too,</l>
                        <l>That <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> have produc'd to view,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Woman</hi> alone doth most affect my Mind,</l>
                        <l>When from her <hi>Sexes</hi> foul defects refin'd;</l>
                        <l>Who if she be with these few Vertues stor'd,</l>
                        <l>Hath all that the <hi>Creation</hi> can afford:</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Beauty</hi> enough to raise a frozen Love,</l>
                        <l>Yet not so great as should our wonder move.</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Fair</hi> without Scorn, and <hi>Witty</hi> without Pride,</l>
                        <l>A Bliss too often to that Sex deny'd;</l>

                           <pb n="377" facs="tcp:62151:226"/>
Chaste as <hi>Diana</hi> when her Rape's designd,</l>
                        <l>And where she loves as billing Turtles kind:</l>
                        <l>Constant to one, and only so far coy,</l>
                        <l>As may'nt create his pain, but raise his Ioy;</l>

                        <l>

                        <l>Yet not for want of words, but want of will:</l>
                        <l>And when she doth her kind Affections place,</l>
                        <l>Makes <hi>Love,</hi> not <hi>Money</hi> Vmpire in the Case.</l>
                        <l>If such a one, yea, Gods on Earth there be,</l>
                        <l>I'll dye if this <hi>Fair Milkmaid</hi> was not she.</l>
                        <p>Which made me as I rambled along so to doat
upon her, that at length I <hi>forgot my self.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And indeed this Fair Milkmads Eyes, Mouth,

When she open'd her Mouth, methoughts I saw
the three Graces sporting in her Countenance,
<hi>when she Smiles there needs no day!</hi> And her Body
was so exactly proportion'd in all its parts, that
had she lived in the Time of <hi>Phideas,</hi> he had
certainly taken her for the Model of his <hi>Venus,</hi>
which was the Admiration of all the World:
And my Respect to her was (for a while) equal
to her Charms.</p>
                        <p>But being now engaged in a <hi>Rambling Frollick,</hi>
with my Dearer <hi>Philaret,</hi> who by Travelling
thus far together with me, was become more
precious to me than Eye-sight, Space, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
beyond what can be valued <hi>rich or rare!</hi>
I was constrain'd to have recourse to <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
which could supply me with no other <hi>Remedies
but Patience.</hi>
                        </p>

Nay, I find the Philosophers themselves have
been vanquisht by Female Charms; <hi>Diogenes</hi> and
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> became they not Fools hereby? And
<hi>Seneca,</hi> whose Morals are the Rules of the
Wisest, was not he driven out of <hi>Rome</hi> for his
Amorous Practices?</p>
                        <p>Nay, <hi>Reader,</hi> I tell thee plainly, the Precepts
of <hi>Philosophy</hi> influenc'd me not a whit; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided
them, though I was now but in my

'tis that they keep a silent intercourse with their

their significant Gestures, composed (as it

a various and myste ous Dialect. Sometimes
their ranging Aspects are earnestly fixed on one
another as on Strangers, and while they seem
to disown all acquaintance, grow familiar by

                           <hi>Bride-Kisses</hi> at a distance, and bring home their

greatest boast and pleasure to remain undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.
Their wandring and <hi>Extatick</hi> Souls freely
pass too and fro (as 'twere) within the same

                        <p>Observe again, how greedily their Souls,

I must confess I had the least Compassion for

seeming to discover much good Manners to

themselves by us on each side; and to make us

and that the punctilio's of Birth were not worth
a Duel; I therefore recommended the Safety of

within the hollow Crown that rouuds the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

grinning at his Pomp, allowing him a breath,
a little Scene to <hi>Monarchize,</hi> be fear'd, and kill

                        <l>Comes Death at last, and with a little Pin</l>

Now he that seeks satisfaction in the highest

<hi>Grandeur</hi> of Condition, how soon does his
mind nauseate the Pleasures of it, and how
quickly does he feel the <hi>thinness of a popular

while they pursue it, how little do they taste
it when they have it; like <hi>Lightning it flashes</hi>
on the Face, and is quickly gone, and 'tis a
wonder if it leaves not a blast behind it.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, it is fit and necessary that some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the World should be in love with a <hi>splendid
Servitude;</hi> yet certainly they must be much
beholding to their own fancy, that they can
be pleased at it. For he that rises up early,
and goes to Bed late, only to receive Addresses,
to read and answer Petitions, is really as much
tied and abridged in his freedom, as he that
waits all that time to present one.</p>
                        <p>In a word, if it is a pleasure to be envy'd
and shot at, to be malign'd standing, and to be
despised falling, and to endeavour that which is
impossible, <hi>which is to please all,</hi> and to suffer for
not doing it, then is it a pleasure to be Great.
These are Truths verified by the best of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
which is the woful Experience of
the highest Favourites of Fortune in all Ages.
Let <hi>Seneca</hi> speak for all in his incomparable <hi>Ode</hi>
on this Subject: <hi rend="margQuotes">In truth, (says he) to see our

in exercising the Trade of a Gardiner in <hi>Salona,</hi>

Herculeus</hi> writ to him to resume the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
(which he had with much felicity govern'd
for twenty years) he returned this Answer, <hi>That
if he would come unto</hi> Salona, <hi>and observe the rare
Productions of Nature, and see how the Coleworts,
which he had planted with his own hands, did thrive
and prosper, he would never trouble his Head with
Crowns, nor his Hands with Scepters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This made <hi>Scipio,</hi> after he had raised <hi>Rome</hi> to
be the Metropolis of almost the whole World,
by a voluntary Exile to retire himself from it,
and at a private House in the middle of a Wood,
near <hi>Linternum,</hi> to pass the remainder of his
glorious Life no less gloriously.</p>
                        <p>There is no Safety, no Security, no Comfort,
no Content in Greatness: This made a Great
Man say, <hi>Requiem quaesivi &amp; non inveni, nisi in

quiet, but could not find it but in a little corner

O the Sweetness and Pleasure of those blessed
Hours that I spend apart from the Noise and

not so much as a Cloud or breath of Wind
to disturb the Serenity of my Mind! <hi>The

                           <hi>Philaret</hi> and I being indifferently refresht by
vertue of this shelter, we went forward very
couragiously, and after a little time, we saluted
a good handsome Town, called <hi>Ailesbury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>Ailesbury</hi> is a fair Market Town, compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
about with many most pleasant green Meadows
and Pastures, of which the whole Vale is termed the
Vale of <hi>Ailesbury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>How many <hi>Alehouses</hi> there were in this
Town, <hi>Philaret</hi> and I had not time to number,
only we saw the signs of some horned Beasts,
as the <hi>Bull,</hi> the <hi>Ram,</hi> &amp;c. But what the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are that dwelt therein we know not, but
guess you may have good Liquor there for your
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:62151:242"/>
mony. As for the <hi>Cage and Stocks</hi> there, let those
that have been in them, give you a description
of them.</p>
                        <p>During our stay in <hi>Ailesbury</hi> was solemnized
a <hi>Westminster-Wedding,</hi> (as the Learned have
it) a Couple so fit for one another and no
body else, that <hi>Bridewel</hi> in conjunction with <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>
could not have afforded so suitable a match,
they were pleased, honourably attended with
a Regiment of Broom-men, Kitchinstuff Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and Pickpockets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to repair to <hi>Ailes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury-</hi> Church,
where having tyed the unslipping
knot in their return home-wards, the wind
began to rise between <hi>Mr. Bridegroom</hi> and <hi>Mrs.
Bride,</hi> which in short time increased to so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a storm, that their Vessels fell foul on each
other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr: Bridegroom</hi> in this extremity took his
dearest Spouse into his Arms with such a passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Embrace, that she almost resign'd her last
breath in those Endearments; but having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
her self from the amorous <hi>Trance,</hi> she
in requital gave him a <hi>Kiss</hi> so close, that it
fetcht off above half of one of his Ears; he
still prosecuting his <hi>Fondness</hi> gave her a back
salute with his Foot, which she answered by
stroaking his lovely Eyes so long with her dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Fists, till he could hardly see: And by
these pleasant Love-Toys, endeavouring to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
each other in affectionate Expressions, they
were so transported in the open fields for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
half an hour, till the Company fearing a
surfeit of delight from such excess of dalliance,
interrupted their <hi>intwined Arms:</hi> so that Mr.
Bridegroom gathering up the ruins of his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruke,
and she decently resitting her Tresses, and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:62151:242"/>
so much as she could find of her Head-geer,
at a <hi>famous fountain</hi> hard by, repair'd the
Beauty of her battered Physiognomy; and so
both lovingly retired hand in hand to their
poor Habitations, and are like to live as kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and as happily as most Couples now adays
about Town.</p>
                        <p>These were the most <hi>Remarkable Passages</hi> I
could learn concerning <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> though <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laret</hi>
and I discours'd of divers other Matters;
but amongst all the Subjects of our <hi>Chat,</hi> we
handled none so often, and so feelingly, as the
<hi>Bottle</hi> and the <hi>Glass,</hi> which were of <hi>Momentous</hi>
Importance to us, because we could not for
ever enjoy them. <hi>Strange Infatuation! Preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Greediness!</hi> To monopolize that which
every Tavern can surfeit us with, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
of that which once elapsed, can never
be obtained again. <hi>Nature is bountiful in every
thing but Time;</hi> of that she is a Niggard, and gives
it us drop by drop, <hi>Minute by Minute,</hi> so that
we can never possess two Minutes at once, nor
regain one of them when it is lost: And yet we
spend our Time by <hi>wholesale,</hi> and in the <hi>Lump,</hi>
as if the <hi>Retail</hi> Care of Hours and Minutes were
below us. 'Tis said that in the <hi>Globe</hi> there is
no certain stated <hi>first Miridian</hi> from whence
to derive <hi>Longitude.</hi> I am sure in the <hi>Extent
of Time,</hi> there is no <hi>Aequator</hi> to be found from
whence to begin a <hi>Latitude. Time runs in
a direct Line forward: It is a rectilinear Series
of Moments, and allows no Digression.</hi> He that
can discover the least Step toward a <hi>Latitude</hi> in
Time, may claim <hi>Letters Patents</hi> from Nature
to serve the whole World with <hi>new-fashioned</hi>
Dials, Watches and Clocks, and to live by this

                           <hi>Sideway</hi> of duration till Time be stretched <hi>as
broad as 'twill be long.</hi> But yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this narrow <hi>Minuteness</hi> of Time, we squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it away at random, as if we had an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible
Treasure of <hi>Ages</hi> to dispose of.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Such Thoughts as these,</hi> I remember, season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our more <hi>Insipid Chat;</hi> and how crude and
raw soever our <hi>Evenings</hi> Conversation had been,
these Reflections like a desert of <hi>Condited</hi>
Fruits, gave a good Farewel, and at length
closed up our <hi>Banquet.</hi> So <hi>Philaret</hi> and I, after
this short view of the Town, betook our selves
to Bed, where I desire you to let us rest an
hour or two; and then I shall awake in a
Humour more <hi>diverting</hi> than hitherto.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Phaebus</hi> had no sooner cryed <hi>Gee hoe</hi> unto his
Team, but <hi>Philaret</hi> and I were both booted
and spur'd for a <hi>New Ramble.</hi>

                        <p>After nine hours riding, we arriv'd at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>

<hi>Island,</hi> which composed a <hi>Garden,</hi> wherein
<hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> had equally contributed to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
the Sences. But soon after our Arrival
here, that our pleasures might be the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed,
we all withdrew to a <hi>shady Grotto</hi>
wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>n the most retir'd part of the Garden.
Where after feasting our selves with Cherries
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

But after three days <hi>Rambling</hi> about the City and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs,
and after as long <hi>feasting my Eyes</hi> with Novelties, I
began at last to be even tir'd with Pleasures, and glutted
with City Charms. So that here by a <hi>dear-bought</hi> Experience,
I found, that the wandering Fancy of Man (nay, that even
Life it self) is a it were but a <hi>meer Ramble or Fegary after
the drag of something that doth itchifie our Senses, which
when we have hunted home, we find nothing but a meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the Nature and common Condition of even the most
pleasing, sensible Objects: They first tempt, then please a little,
then disappoint, and lastly vex. The Eye that beholds them
blasts them quickly, riffles and destroys their Glory, and views
them with no more delight at first; than disdain afterwards.
Hence, there must be frequent diversions; other Pleasures
must be sought out; and are chosen, not because they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but because they are new. So that like Bees in a
Garden we hum and rove about from Flower to Flower, and
as soon as we have tasted one and exhausted 'its sweetness,
we lave it and fly away to another, seeking in vain to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
our Pleasures by a continued circle of Varieties.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, Reader, if tempted by an <hi>impatient Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
to any thing not without danger or difficulty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
catechise your self with this Question, What <hi>Wish,
Fortune or Labour</hi> ever presented you with, that after a <hi>full
fruition</hi> did not soon grow tedious; or at best came not
far short of what creaking Expectatlon, had undertaken
it should perform?</p>

that I have ever had in all my Life the same thoughts
of any good <hi>(my Nuptial Tye excepted)</hi> in the very time
of the enjoying it as I had before. I have known when
I have promist my self <hi>vast satisfactions;</hi> and indeed
where could I expect more than in <hi>London,</hi> where in every

feet, becoming almost vile through their abundant plenty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and my Imagination has presented me at a distance with
<hi>a fair Landskip</hi> of Delights, yet when I drew nigh to grasp
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:62151:248"/>
the alluring Happyness like the<note n="†" place="bottom">In Sion Garden.</note>
                           <hi>Sensitive-Plant,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted

yet should a <hi>Platonical Revolution</hi> make the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
recur, I should not think so. I found 'twas ever
with me as with the <hi>Traveller,</hi> to whom the ground which
is before him, and that which he has left behind, seems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
more <hi>curiously embroydered</hi> and delightsome than that
which he stands upon; so that my Happiness (like the time
wherein I thought to enjoy it) was always either past or
to come, never <hi>present.</hi> Methought, I could often say upon
a recollection, <hi>how happy was I at such a Time?</hi> or when I
was in expectation, how happy shall I be if I compass such
a design? but scarce ever I am so, I was highly well pleased,
Methoughts whilst I expected, whilst I hoped for a <hi>new
sight of London,</hi> till fruition jogg'd me out of my pleasing
Slumber, and I knew it was but a <hi>Dream.</hi> And this single
observation has often made me even in the very pursuit
after Happyness, and full <hi>Career of my Passions,</hi> to stop
short on this side Fruition, and to chuse rather with <hi>Moses</hi>
upon Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> to entertain my Fancy with a remote
<hi>Prospect</hi> of the happy Land, than to go in and possess it,
and then repine. How then shall Man be happy, when
<hi>(setting aside all the crosses of Fortune)</hi> he will complain
even of Success, and Fruition it self shall disappoint him?</p>
                        <l>Fruition adds no new Wealth, but destroys;</l>
                        <l>And while it pleaseth much, yet still it cloys,</l>
                        <l>As in Prospects we are there pleas'd most,</l>

                        <l>Holds up delight, that with excess would saint.</l>
                        <p>And the reason, I humbly conceive, may be this: In all
earthly matters Expectation takes up more Joy on Trust,
than the Fruition of the thing is able to discharge. Most
Men in their own Fancies extract the Pleasures of things
from troubles annexed to them, which when enjoyed must
go together; <hi>surely a Good unlook'd for is a</hi> Virgin<note n="*" place="bottom">Fuller.</note> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
whereas those who obtain'd what long they have
gazed on in Expectation, only marry what themselves have
deflowred before. No Matters are so fair as the Pencil of
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:62151:249"/>
the Expectant lims them out in his Hopes. <hi>The first taste
of pleasure indeed is commonly very grateful to us; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
