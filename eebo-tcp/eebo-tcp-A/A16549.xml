         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>He that commeth after me was before me.</hi> Christ then is the Word; and euery Preacher of Christ is a voice; the which one word confounds all such as being called thereunto, doe neglect their dutie of preaching. In euery voice, specially a Church voice, three commendable qualities are required; that it bee cleere, sweete, and high.</p>
               <p>Cleere: for as <hi>Hierome</hi> said, <hi>Omnia in sacerdote debent esse vocalia:</hi> All things in a Diuine should preach: his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell preach, his diet preach, his whole life preach: <note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12.</note>

               <p>Couetous <hi>Iudas</hi> had an hoarse voyce: filthie <hi>Nicolaes</hi> an hoarse voyce: <hi>Simon Magus</hi> an hoarse voyce: <hi>Peter</hi> in denying his Master, through extreame coldnesse of feare, had an hoarse voyce too for a time. <hi>Manicheus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Pelagius,</hi> all Hereticall, Schismaticall, Atheisticall teachers are hoarse voyces in Gods quier.</p>

               <p>Secondly, the Church voice must be sweet: euery seed is not to be sowen at euery season, in euery ground: and so it is in Gods husbandrie: The voyce therefore must <note n="b" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15.</note> aright diuide the word which it sings and saies; obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing time, and keeping it selfe in tune, speaking to the proud boldly, to the meeke mildly, to all wisely.

               <p>Sinners are farre off from God, and exceeding deafe: and therfore we must be angrie crying aloud, and lifting vp our voyce like a <note n="h" place="margin">

               <p>First, sinners are farre off, as it is said of the <note n="i" place="margin">

                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.8.</note> he will draw neere to vs: as the good father of the prodigall sonne, when hee perceiued him a farre off, he had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. It is said in the text, that the sonne did go to his father; but the father ran to meete his sonne. The fathers compassion and mercie, was greater then the sonnes passion and miserie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, sinners are deafe, and therefore wee neede to crie aloud. Some will heare, but with one eare, like <note n="p" place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, men speake aloud, when as they be angrie: so the Preacher ought to be zealous in the cause of God; euermore displeased with the sinnes of his people, saying with <note n="u" place="margin">

               <p>The end of our preaching is not to make way for our selues &amp; our own preferment, but for our Master and his glorie: Make streight the way of the Lord, as saith the Prophet <hi>Esay.</hi> Wherefore leauing all other expositions, I come to the Prophets interpretation, as it is recorded in his 40. Chapter, at the 3. and 4. verses. <hi>A voice crieth in the wildernes, prepare yee the way of the Lord: make streight in the desert a path for our God. Euery valley shall be exalted, and euery mountaine and hill shall be made lowe: and the crooked shall bee straight, and the rough places plaine.</hi>

                  <hi>LVther</hi> is of opinion, that this Epistle should be <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite breuior, &amp; sine prolixior</hi>; shorter in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, longer at the end. For the beginning appertaines vnto the conclusion of the Epistle for Sunday before; and the end to be the beginning of the Epistle for Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following: yet so, that it may be both read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as a text absolute in it selfe. The summe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that wee must imploy and improue the manifold gifts of God vnto the glory of his name, and good of his people.</p>
               <p>This exhortation is inferred vpon a familiar compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son vsed in the words immediatly before: for <hi>as we haue many members in one body, and all members haue not one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; so we being many, are one body in Christ, and euery man among our selues, one anothers members.</hi> In which, obserue foure instructions.</p>
               <p>First, as the members are not made by their owne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but created by Gods almighty power, before they could execute any function in the body; not members because working, but on the contrary, working because members: In like sort, Christians are not members of Christ through their owne good works, but they doe good works because they be members, and inserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ: as the tree brings forth the fruit, and not the fruit the tree. The Papists then in their works of congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, run too much vpon the figure called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cart before the horse; merit before mercy. <hi>Potes à te de ficere</hi> (saith <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Augustine) sed teipsum reficere non potes; ille reficit, qui te fecit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the members are well <note n="c" place="margin">

seuerall offices and place; the foote is not grieued at the heads supremacie, neither doth the nose maligne the eye, nor eye couet to be tongue, but euery one performes his function without any faction: euen so we which are members of Christs mysticall body, must be content with our vocation and calling, <note n="d" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20.</note> neither enuying such as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, nor despising such are vnder vs. <note n="e" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Although there be diuersities of gifts, yet but one spirit: diuersities of administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet but one Lord: diuersities of operations, yet but one God, who worketh all in all.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Are all Apostles? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? haue all the gift of healing? doe all speake with tongues? doe all interpret?</hi> It is God who worketh all in all; communicating indifferently spirituall life to all his members; insomuch as the least is a member of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die so well as the greatest.

It is therefore necessarie we should manifest vnto Christ our sores, that he may see them, and search them, and salue them.</p>
               <p>Againe, by this example wee may learne to professe the faith of Christ openly, Though <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p>Hitherto concerning the patient: I come now to the physition, in whom two things are obseruable:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And Iesus put foorth his hand</hi>] He granted that cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, which the leper desired earnestly. The leper said, <hi>if thou wilt,</hi> and Christ answereth, <hi>I will</hi>; and as I will, I say, <hi>be thou cleane</hi>; and as I say, I doe. <hi>His leprosie was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly cleansed:</hi> hee spake the word and it was done; hee commanded and it was effected, euen with a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his lips, and touch of his finger.</p>
               <p>Here then is comfort for the distressed soule: the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per calles, and Christ heales him; the Centurion comes, and Christ helps him. Other Physitions are deceiued of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten themselues, and often deceiue others; and therefore we venture much, when we trust them a little. The best physicke (as one said) is to take no physicke: but if wee

               <p>It was vnlawfull to touch a leper, as we finde, Leu. 14. In that therfore Christ touched here this leper, he shewes himselfe to be greater then <hi>Moses</hi> aboue the law.

               <p>This distinction is insufficient; as hauing no firme ground in the Bible. For when almighty God inioines a particular command, for the triall of his people, contrary to the generall scope of his law, he doth at that instant <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Perkins treat. of cons. cap.</hi> 2.</note> dispense with the generall, and the particular onely binds; as in the sacrificing of <hi>Isaac; Offer thy sonne,</hi> was an exemption at that time from the law, <hi>Thou s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And as for admonitory precepts, how did this leper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly know, that Christs command, <hi>Tell no man,</hi> was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an instruction for other, then a prohibition vnto himselfe?

                  </note> who thinke this leper offended in publishing abroad Christs benefit, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he did it affectionately, and zealously. For we must giue thanks vnto God, not as we will, but as he will: Deut. 4.1. Iohn 2.5.</p>
               <p>Hence we may learne to temper our zeale with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and obedience: for <note n="m" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22.</note> obedience is better then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
               <p>If any demand, why Christ would haue this miracle concealed: I answere with <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>; O man, who art thou which disputes against God? <note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob</hi> 9.3.</note> If thou dispute with him, thou canst not answere one thing of a thousand: but he can render a thousand answeres vnto this friuolous obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

Therefore Christ saith in the next clause, <hi>Goe and shew thy selfe vnto the Priest:</hi> and then being adiudged cleane, tell whom thou wilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shew thy selfe vnto the Priest</hi>] Interpreters obserue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reasons of this command. First, to <note n="q" place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly, that as the law doth witnesse of Christ; and all the sacrifices are types of Christ: <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Idem ibidem.</hi>
                  </note> so likewise the Priests, expounders of the law, might also witnesse, that Christ is the true Messias of the world; that seeing this miracle, they might belieue; or in not belieuing, be left inexcusable.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, to <note n="x" place="margin">

               <p>Here the Gospell and Epistle meet. Christ did not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der euill for euill, but ouercome euill with goodnesse: prouiding things honest, not onely before God, but also in the sight of all men; auenging not himselfe, but giuing place to wrath, hauing peace so farre as might be with all men.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:25072:123"/>Secondly, we must continue well; for many runne, but one receiueth the crowne: we must therefore take heede that we doe not slip; or if we slip, that we doe not fall; or if we fall, that we fall not backward but forward, so that wee may with speede rise againe. The most iust <note n="t" place="margin">

                  <hi>Ezechiel</hi> by the riuer Chebar.</p>
               <p>Lastly, wee must end well; Death is our last enemie, which must be destroyed, and therefore we must run well vnto the end, and in the end. As good not to runne at all, as to runne neere the end, and then to lose the prize; to suffer Satan at the last houre to snatch our reward from vs. A runner will bee sure to stretch out his hand at the races end to take the marke; so when death approcheth, a Christian must stretch out the hand of faith apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Christ and his righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>Obserue yet a great difference betweene the Christian and other races. In the games of other runners, as it is here said, one onely doth winne the gole; <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ambros. in loc.</hi>
                  </note> but in the Christian course many receiue the prize, so many as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue stedfast vnto the end, though they doe not runne so fast, though they doe not runne from so farre as other. So Christ shewes in the parable of the vineyard, allotted for the Gospell on this day; Such as came to worke at the eleuenth houre had a peny, so well as they that came into the vineyard at the third houre.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in other races one hinders another; <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Marlorat. ex Caluin. in loc.</hi>
                  </note> but in our iourney to heauen one helpes another. The moe the merier, the greater companie the better encouragement, euery good man being a spurre to his neighbour.

               <p>Thirdly, runners and wrastlers contend for a crowne that shall perish, but we runne to obtaine an euerlasting

To propound a garland for the runner, and a crowne for the wrestler, proceeds altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Gods owne meere mercy: to run, and not to fall, to fall, and not finally to be cast downe, comes also from his especiall grace. So that it is <note n="e" place="margin">

The first hath his idoll as it were in the aire; the second his idoll in the earth; and the third his idoll in the water, as <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, some pawne their soules, albeit they be not so desperate, so giuen ouer to commit sinne with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as to sell their soules right out, yet for their profit and pleasure they will be content to pawne their soules vnto the diuell for a time: so <hi>Dauid</hi> in committing adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie did as it were pawne his soule; <hi>Noe</hi> when hee was drunke did pawne his soule; <hi>Peter</hi> in denying Christ did also pawne his soule: but these being all labourers in Gods vineyard redeemed their soules againe, with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained and hartie repentance. But let vs take heede how we play the merchant venturers in this case: for our soule is our best iewell, of greater value then the whole world, and the diuell is the craftiest vsurer and greatest oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor that euer was, if he can get neuer so little aduantage, if we keep not day with him, he will be sure at the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day to call for iustice, and to claime his owne, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <p>There is another kinde of pawning of soules, and that is vnto God; for Princes and Prelates, Ministers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are bound to God as it were in goods and bodie for all such as are vnder them: as the Prophet said vnto King <note n="g" place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 20.39.</note>

               <p>Thirdly, some lose their soules; as carnall and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Gospellers, ignorant negligent people, who though they come to Church either for fashion or feare; yet, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, they seldome or neuer thinke of their poore soule, from whence it came, or whither it shall goe, trifling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the time in the market, neither buying nor selling, nor giuing; but idly gaping and gazing vpon other, a fit pray for the cutpurse, betraying themselues and their soules vnto that old cunnicatcher Satan, who goes about daily, seeking whom he may deceiue, cunningly snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and stealing such soules as are vnguarded, vnregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

               <p>Fourthly, some giue their soules, as first the malitious and enuious person: for whereas an ambitious man hath a little honour for his soule; a couetous man a little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for his soule; a voluptuous man a little pleasure for his soule; the spitefull wretch hath nothing for his soule, but fretting and heart-griefe, like <hi>Cain,</hi> who said of himselfe,

               <p>Thirdly, such as destroy their bodie, that the diuel may haue their soule, giue themselues away for nothing: in one word, this is the case of all such as stand idle in the market, they serue the diuels turne for nothing: for <hi>the wages of sinne</hi> (saith <note n="m" place="margin">

So, many religious men haue numbred their yeeres, not from the day of their birth, but of their new birth, from their beginning of their regeneration and repentance, reputing all that time lost, which was idly misspent in the market of the world: so that whether we consider our life of nature, or life of grace, our whole time may well be called a short day.</p>

                  <hi>faith is the ground of things hoped for.</hi> A stedfast hope proceeds out of a liuely faith: if the sparke of faith should not giue light to the will, it could not be perswaded to lay hold vpon hope. Faith alway goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then hope followeth after.</p>

                  </note> logicke to conceiue what we must beleeue; hope our rhetorick to perswade vs in tribulation vnto patience. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith: <hi>Wee are saued by hope,</hi> Rom. 8.24. <note n="p" place="margin">

In a word, the difference betweene faith and hope in Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is the same that is betweene fortitude and prudence in policie. Fortitude not guided by prudence is rashnes, and prudence not ioyned with fortitude is vaine: So faith without hope is nothing, and hope without faith a meere presumption and tempting of God. And therefore wee must ioyne together all these graces, as <hi>Paul</hi> here, faith, hope, charitie: We waite for the hope of righteousnesse through faith, and faith worketh through loue.</p>
               <p>First faith teacheth vs the truth, and then hope teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs what to suffer; and loue what to doe for the truth. Faith engendreth hope; faith and hope loue, <hi>but the chief is lone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Againe, charitie is greater in latitude of continuance: faith apprehends the Lords gratious promise concerning eternall saluation, and hope doth expect it with patience. When God then shall haue fulfilled his word, and filled vs with vnspeakable ioy, when in that other life we shall see God face to face, faith is at an end, hope is at an end, their vse cease, but loue shall continue betweene God and vs an euerlasting bond.
