            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>George Langham,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>William Wiburn,</hi> as good a Citizen as the former.</p>
               <p>Colonel <hi>Richard Downes,</hi> you know whoſe Iudge he was, and that learned, merciful Iudge, Mr. <hi>Richard Keeble,</hi> who (for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage) in Chancery knew not how to deny any thing, and in a High Court of Iuſtice how to grant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And after all theſe, there is one <hi>Bowen</hi> that belonged to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> market (formerly a <hi>Church-yard,</hi> till that worldly Saint Alderman <hi>Titchbourn</hi> turn'd it to a marker) who not content to rail at the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (who one would think have been ſlandered long enough) broke out into ſuch impudent language againſt the Houſe of <hi>Peers</hi> now ſitting, as a man would ſcarce have thrown at the <hi>other Houſe,</hi> for which and other enormities he is now honored with an impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though <hi>Bowen</hi> told the Witneſſe, that <hi>for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Colonel <hi>Axtell</hi> was ſent thither, who commanded the Iriſh Foot for the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> and is the moſt injur'd perſon alive if he have not kill'd forty times more in cold blood then in hot; but how he got the Lord <hi>Montgarrets</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or how that Noble Lord came to loſe it, we need not tell you.</p>
               <p>And (after all) the ſame day was committed M. <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> (not long ſince call'd <hi>Secretary Scot</hi>) who was ſent priſoner out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> being one of the <hi>ſeven</hi> excepted from pardon, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (in the opinion of the people of <hi>England</hi>) not to be march'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor any where elſe but where he now is: And (for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all good men) both <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thence aſſure us, are as quiet as <hi>England,</hi> and (maugre all little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions) are like ſo to continue.</p>
