            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN I first happ'ned upon this <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> and by some peculiar beautys in the style, easily discover'd <hi>it's Owner,</hi> I was, I must confess, not a little surpriz'd: I could not have imagin'd that a Man of so bigg a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Author of the <hi>Guide in Controversy;</hi> One, whose thoughts had for some years convers'd with nothing less then <hi>Oecumenical Councels, Popes</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> should quitt all those <hi>fine amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> for the humble task of <hi>Life-writing,</hi> and <hi>drawing of Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.</hi> 'Twas mean prey, I thought, for a Bird of his Pounces: and the Design he did it with, made it ten times more a Riddle. The <hi>Doctrines of the Reformation</hi> have, for near two Centuries, kept the field, against all Encounterers: and do's He think they may be foil'd at last by two or three little Remarks upon the Life and Actions of <hi>a single Reformer?</hi> But it look's like a <hi>Jest,</hi> when the Irregularities committed by <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> are turn'd upon <hi>Us</hi> here in <hi>England:</hi> as if any thing that <hi>He</hi> said, or did, could affect a <hi>Church</hi> establish'd upon it's own bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and as independent on any forreign authorities, as the <hi>Crown, Her Defender</hi> wears. <hi>Luther's</hi> Voice is indeed to Us, what our<note n="a" place="bottom">Pag. 2. of Consid.</note> Author term's it, <hi>the Voice of the Stranger;</hi> and tho' we are allwaies ready to wipe off the unjust aspersions cast upon him by his <hi>Enemies,</hi> yet this is what we are oblig'd to, not as <hi>Sons,</hi> but as <hi>Friends.</hi> Whenever injur'd Virtue is set upon, every Honest man is concern'd in the Quarrel. But these last Attacqu's have been so very feeble, that had we for once trusted the Cause to it's own strength, 'twould have suffer'd but little Damage. And I for my part should have done so, did I not know there were a sort of Men in the World, who have the vanity to think every thing on their side unanswerable, that do's not receive a sett Reply; tho' at the same time they are pleas'd to answer nothing themselves. They fight indeed all of 'em, like <hi>Tartars;</hi> make a bold and furious onset, and if that does not doe, they retreat in disorder, and you never hear of 'em afterwards. And this, I expect, will be the present case. The <hi>Editor</hi> of these <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations</hi> won't much care for replying, I believe; because that must be <hi>de proprio,</hi> and can't be drawn from the old store of provisions laid in by the Fraternity. But whether the Poysons were of an earlyer mixture,
<pb facs="tcp:62660:3"/>
and design'd, like <hi>Italian</hi> Preparations, to work now at a distance, or whether later temper'd, is a thing we may safely be ignorant of; as long as we are secure of the <hi>Antidote,</hi> before they take their effect. And this the <hi>Theatre-Press</hi> thinks her self engag'd to promise: considering from Whose Munificence she had her <hi>Birth,</hi> and especially to Whom she ows her <hi>Lustre; a late Prelate,</hi> of a remarkable zeal for the establish'd Church; and who, were <hi>Religions</hi> to be try'd by <hi>Lives,</hi> would have liv'd down the Pope, and the whole Consistory. If the Services she do's now are not of the <hi>most deserving</hi> Character, 'tis what the Meanness of the Opposer, and a worn-out Cause will bear: she has already produc'd the strongest arguments against Popery, <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Bibles.</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Attempt is confin'd perfectly within the bounds of <hi>an Answer;</hi> and pretend's to nothing more then a bare pursuit of the Author step by step; and the laying open his Blunders, for the Reader's ease, just in the same order they ly. There was nothing frightful in this Task, but the toil of being forc'd to <hi>think</hi> so long upon so very <hi>thoughtless</hi> a Writer: in all other respects 'twas as easy as one would wish. The History-part lay within a little room; and the Reasonings upon it were so <hi>thin,</hi> that they needed only setting in the <hi>light,</hi> to be <hi>look'd thro'.</hi> In both, my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est helps have been drawn from one single Author, the <hi>Considerer</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: who in every Book of his has made it appear, that he can <hi>write</hi> Contradictions, as well as <hi>believe</hi> 'em. This small performance had seen the light much sooner, but that it waited the Edition of another Piece which should regularly have prevented it. But the Gentleman employ'd on that occasion having not yet had all the leisure he expected, 'twas thought fit rather to send this abroad, out of it's due place, then stay till every body had forgotten the Book it answer's: a misfortune, which I fear it has already in a great measure undergone. In the Defence of Our Reformation, to come, 'twill be found, that the <hi>Considerer</hi> is no good <hi>Historian;</hi> the <hi>Replyer,</hi> has prov'd him no good <hi>Catholic;</hi> the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter</hi> no good <hi>Subject;</hi> and all together no good <hi>Disputant:</hi> so that I have now no <hi>new side</hi> of him left, to entertain the Reader with. What he <hi>is,</hi> after all this, no body know's; 'tis much easyer to guess, what, under another Revolution, he <hi>will be.</hi>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ARTIN Luther's</hi> Life was a continual <hi>Warfare,</hi> he was engag'd against the united forces of the Papal world, and he stood the Shock of 'em bravely, both with Courage, and Success. After his Death, one would have expected, that generous Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries should have put up their Pens, and quitted at least so much of the Quarrel as was Personal. But on the contrary, when his Doctrines grew too strong to be shook by his Enemies, they persecuted his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and by the venome of their tongues suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently convinc'd the world, that the Religion they were of, allow'd not only <hi>Prayers</hi> for the Dead, but even <hi>Curses</hi> too. Among the rest, that have engag'd in this unmanly design, <hi>our Author</hi> appears: not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed after the blustring rate of some of the party, but with a more calm and better dissembled malice: He has charg'd his Instrument of Revenge with a sort of White Powder, that does the same base action, tho' with less noyse. 'Tis cruel thus to interrupt the Peace of the Dead; and <hi>Luther's Spirit</hi> has reason to expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with <hi>this Man,</hi> as once the <hi>Spirit of Samuel</hi> did<note place="margin">Ecclus. 46. 20. 1 Sam. 28. 15.</note> with <hi>Saul—Why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up?</hi> He know's the sequel of the story: <hi>the answer</hi> that was given was no very pleasing one; it only afforded the Enquirer an account of his own <hi>Discomfiture.</hi> Let us see whether this <hi>Disturber of Luther's Ashes</hi> will have any better fortune.</p>
            <p>The first thing we are presented with, is a double
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62660:4"/>
Character of <hi>the Good,</hi> and <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> set out by those <hi>Works</hi> or <hi>Properties,</hi> which are said to attend each of 'em in Scripture. And by this <hi>Test</hi> it is that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's</hi>
               <note place="margin">Consid. p. 2.</note> Spirit is to be try'd. For—<hi>so often as the Teachers of new and strange Doctrines come into the World, professing opposition to those receiv'd by our present superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and to the common Tenents of the Church, Christians are directed by St. Iohn c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>to try such Spirits, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are of God. And we are instructed by our Lord Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>that they shall know and discern them by their Fruits.</hi> The inference from hence is, that <hi>Luther's</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine should be try'd by his Works. Now, tho' we are very willing to stand to this Test, yet nothing hitherto said can any ways engage us to it. For here is a manifest violence offer'd to two places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: by leaving out the preceding verse in one, and the subsequent in t'other, he has quite perverted the meaning of both. <hi>St. Iohn</hi> sayes, <hi>Beloved believe not</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John. 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they be of God.</hi> How shall we try them? the next verse instructs us. <hi>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God; every Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib. v. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that Iesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is of God.</hi> Nothing can be plainer then that the Apostle here would have new Teachers prov'd, by the conformity their doctrine bore to that he had deliver'd. But this was not for our Author's purpose to observe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He drop'd the latter part of the Quotation, which would have expounded the former, and slip'd over to <hi>St. Matthew's—Ye shall know them by their Fruits.</hi> Whom?<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 16. Ibid. v. 17.</note> Consult the foregoing words. <hi>Beware of false Prophets, which come to you in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves.</hi> The caution here given is against such as come <hi>in Sheeps clothing,</hi> that is in all outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and meekness (as our learned <hi>Paraphrast</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound's

            <p>And here the business seems to be at an end. For if no proof has been brought, why a good Doctrine should alwaies require good outward works to support it: and yet it be the whole drift of the Pamphlet, to bring <hi>Luther's</hi> preaching to such a scrutiny, 'tis all built on a false foundation, and, when that's weak'ned, must drop a course. But because we are pretty well assur'd of <hi>Luther's Moralls</hi> too, we'll be so obliging as to give up what has been allready said, and put the Cause upon that Issue: tho' his Life dos not in the least concern the Church of England.

            <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Fleshly Lusts,</hi> there is no one action through the whole course of <hi>Luther's</hi> life, that can possibly come under that Character, but only his Match with <hi>Bora.</hi> Now this hapned not till 1525, and in 1517 <hi>Luther</hi> had begun to Reform: so that, should I put my self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>posture,</hi> the Considerer desires, yet here would be nothing for my observation to lay hold of for above eight years together. <hi>Fleshly Lusts</hi> therefore could have given me no prejudice against <hi>Luther's</hi> Doctrine, when it <hi>first appear'd,</hi> since his very Adversaries do not till long after that time charge 'em upon him. Yes but we<note place="margin">pag. 20.</note> are told, that he preach'd against the Vow of Continence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62660:6"/>
long before he married. Now tho' it be something im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, to call preaching an Act of Fleshly Lust, and give me that to try his Doctrine by, which is indeed a piece of the Doctrine it self; yet neither did <hi>Luther</hi> let fall a syllable against these Vows for several years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his first setting out. So that had I liv'd in the dawn of the Reformation, and made all those Observations I am desir'd to do, I can as yet see no reason, why I should not have been <hi>Luther's</hi> Proselyte. And thus much will serve to free <hi>Luther</hi> from Incontinence, as far as the method propos'd reaches: the Breach of Vow, and Marriage it self shall be more largely discours'd of in their proper places.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other Head of the Charge is <hi>Contention and Disobedience.</hi> And here again I am invited to consider, whether <hi>Luther</hi> was not in an high manner guilty of these? and, if so, whether a wise man that had liv'd in those days, could have had any reason to follow so unruly a Guide? Now the Question here is not <hi>whether Luther</hi> disobey'd? for that's confest: but <hi>when</hi> and <hi>in what manner</hi> he did it. For if upon enquiry it be found, that for near three years together he treated his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries with all mildness, and paid a just deference to his Superiors; if he threw not off their Authority, while there was any hope left of doing things in a regular way, and mingled no gall in his expressions till after all the venemous mouths in <hi>Europe</hi> had been open'd upon him, how can he with any colour of reason be term'd <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> or <hi>disobedient?</hi> And that this was his case any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial man that reads the joint accounts of <hi>Sleidan, Soave, Melancthon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And so of the rest.</note>. I will not say that in the prosecution of this he never went awry, he did so in reviving that doubt, which was sometime in the primitive Church, of St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Epistle being Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, because he thought it ran counter to St. <hi>Paul:</hi> but he withdrew this plea of his, when better inform'd; if quoting from it afterwards, as from Scripture, be owning it's Authority. 'Tis plain his followers think so: the most rigid of whom, and who in every puncttlio would be thought like Luther, do yet retain this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle in the Canon. Indeed in the <hi>1st.</hi> Edition of his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62660:9"/>
German Bible he call's it <hi>straminea;</hi> not absolutely, but in comparison with those of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> But in all the Editions after 1526 'tis left out: and the <hi>arida,</hi> the Pamphlet talk's of, is in none of 'em at all. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection drawn from his calling St. <hi>Paul</hi> Evangelist in preference to <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> is ridiculous, for he there tells you what he mean's by <hi>Evangelists, viz:</hi> such as preach the glad tidings of that <hi>comfortable Doctrine</hi> (as our Articles term it)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Justif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And what is there so heynous in this expression? 'Tis low ebb sure with his Accuser, when such Peccadillos as these are put in to swell the Charge. But the grand Article is to come. <hi>L.</hi> (he says) <hi>was so strangely affected with this new invention</hi> [he mean's justifying Faith] <hi>that he made bold much to prefer the Mahometan life as to good manners before the Christian.</hi> Now had L. spoke up to this accusation, yet <hi>Chrysostom's</hi> example would have been his defence.

But L has indeed said no such thing. In the place cited he compares <hi>Mahometans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

If Works are to decide the goodness or badness of L<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. cause, according to what was first propos'd, why are these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative points preposterously put upon us? But if our Author, in spite of his own design, is resolv'd to give us a list of his Doctrines, with what color of reason can that about <hi>Indulgences</hi> be slipp'd over? 'Twas the main Article that made the breach, as all their own writers confess: and do's it not deserve a mention? But we deal with a man that understands very well the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his scenes. This busyness of Indulgences is too gross to be touch'd upon, 'twould leave ill impressions upon the Reader's mind; and therefore he passes it over just as <hi>Mezeray</hi> and the French Writers do the battle of <hi>Cressy.</hi> It cannot be shewn so much as in <hi>Profile,</hi> no

And he took the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: Yet praying alwayes with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance, and supplication for all Saints; And for himself, that utterance might be given unto him, that he might open his mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the Gospel.</hi> I could not forbear setting down at full length this Panoply of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> wherewith <hi>Lr</hi>. compleatly arm'd himself in his spiritual warfare: and I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this description belong's so justly to any man as him, since the day's of the Apostles.

Indeed the sense he had of the tricks and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices us'd in convening these Synods for some Centuries together, and the noise of his Adversaries, who were perpetually crying <hi>Councils, Canons</hi> &amp;c. when they had nothing else to say for their cause, might perhaps force out an expression or two from him, that did not carry all the respect due to those great Names: he had fire in his temper, and a German bluntness, and, upon these provocations, might possibly strain a phrase with too great freedom: yet even the diligence of his accuser has in all his works been able to find out but a few passages of this nature; and of them the most material perhaps were never found out by any body else but himself.

may now be trusted with it, for the Tool has not Edge enough to hurt him. For what are the mighty Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations with which we are now to be entertain'd? The first is that—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> was so <hi>bold,</hi> as to think and say he was <hi>certain</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 21. n. 1.</note> of what he taught: a crime of so high a nature, that the Considerer has taken pains to prove it by a Passage as<note place="margin">§ 24. n. 1. 2.</note> long almost as from hence to the beginning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Now he might have spar'd his labor, for all well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Protestants are in this point as <hi>bold</hi> as <hi>Lr</hi>. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. We have a certainty, whose Evidence we find, and under whose guidance we think our selves secure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the pretended boast of Infallibility: a word, which sound's bigger indeed, and fill's the mouth better, but is not so satisfactory at the bottom, as a late Author has (tho' not <hi>infallibly,</hi> yet) <hi>certainly</hi> prov'd<note n="a" place="bottom">Disc. about Judge in Controv.</note>. But we'll allow the <hi>Considerer</hi> to decry this Protestant Certainty, which he never understood: if he had, our charity tells us, he would never have chang'd it for the gawdiest pretences on t'other side.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lr</hi>. maintain'd this certainty of his against other<note place="margin">§. 24. n. 3. §. 21. n. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Reform'd,</hi> which were equally certain; and in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to himself too: for in the point of <hi>Consubstantiation,</hi> tow'rd the latter end of his life he chang'd his mind, say the papers; and quote for it <hi>Melchior Adams,</hi> and <hi>Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</hi> I suppose my author is <hi>sure</hi> of <hi>Ls</hi>. instability in this point, because he averr's it so confidently: Now I am <hi>as sure,</hi> that from the authorities mention'd no such thing can be infer'd, as shall presently be made out. Here is certainty against certainty, and one of us must be in the wrong. Yet neither of Us is oblig'd to think his own sentiments ere the less right, merely because the other opposes 'em: Why then might not <hi>Lr</hi>. maintain his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty

against those of the Reformation that maintain'd the contrary? The conviction of his understanding lay within it self, and could not be weakned by another man's not being convinc'd. The reason of my certainty in the case is, because I am very well satisfy'd that what <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Hospinian</hi> have here said, do's not at all infer a <hi>change</hi> in <hi>Luther</hi>'s Opinion. The story they tell is this—<hi>Lr</hi>. some days before his death, own'd that he had written a little <hi>too warmly</hi> in the Sacramentary-Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy: upon this <hi>Melancthon</hi> desires him, [<hi>ut leni edito scripto se explicaret</hi>] that he would <hi>explain</hi> himself in some <hi>milder</hi> treatise. The heat of dispute had forc'd out from him Expressions, that seem'd to make his doctrine run higher then really it did. 'Twas his friends advice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he should in some just discourse, <hi>calmly</hi> and without reflection state the point; and (not <hi>correct,</hi> but) <hi>explain</hi> his first notions.

But to go farther, and yield him what he do's not ask—What if <hi>Hospinian</hi> should have said in other places that <hi>Lr</hi>. waver'd in the point of the Sacrament? do's it follow, that he really did so, because one of differing sentiments, and that would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

This is such a way of reasoning as is <hi>answer'd</hi> only by being <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis'd.</hi> However 'tis pretty odd to see <hi>instability and fluctuation in opinion</hi> so earnestly charg'd upon <hi>Lr</hi>. by such as have liv'd half their days in a poyse between two Churches; and write even now, when the Scales are turn'd, with so much <hi>waryness</hi> and <hi>reserve,</hi> that a body would not think 'em heartily of any.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lr</hi>. condemn'd his Brethren of the Reformation<note place="margin">§ 22. 25. 26.</note> too; not without their returning the Censure—There was eagerness I confess on both sides, but this is far from laying a blot upon <hi>Lr</hi>. It argues him a very honest man, who had such a zeal against Error, as not to suffer it in a Friend: and is an undenyable evidence, that he took not upon him the character of a Reformer, in opposition to a <hi>Party,</hi> (as has been falsly suggested) since, where truth was concern'd, he equally oppos<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d <hi>All.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Perhaps between him and the <hi>Sacramentarians</hi> (as they are call'd) was manag'd with a fierceness not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly warrantable: but it must be consider'd, that the best men of antiquity have been guilty of such excesses.

with which he treated his other adversaries, 'twas some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times strain'd a little too far, but in the general was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well fitted by the Providence of God to rowse up a people, the most phlegmatic of any in Christendome. <hi>Europe</hi> lay then under a deep Lethargy, and was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to be rescu'd from it, but by One, that <hi>would cry mightily, and lift up his voice with</hi> strength.

            <p>There is a little occasional Remark of the Author's, p. 45. which slipp'd me. He is there angry with <hi>Lr</hi>. for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—That <hi>Peter taught</hi> otherwise than he should by the word of God, and therefore <hi>Err'd:</hi> whereas his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample</hi> only, he says, and not his <hi>Doctrine</hi> was false. But this is trifling: for are there no Errors in matter of Practice? and do's not He who so err's, if he be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous station, teach as much by his Example, as he could by his doctrine; since every action is suppos'd all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be bottom'd upon some principle? But besides 'tis highly probable that <hi>Peter</hi> asserted an opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to this practice: for else how could St. <hi>Paul withstand him to the face?</hi> Withstanding by words on one side implyes an opposition in the same kind on t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When <hi>Elymas</hi> is said to have <hi>withstood Paul and Barnabas;</hi> and when <hi>Paul</hi> says of <hi>Alexander, he hath greatly withstood our words,</hi> do we think the withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was without speaking?</p>
            <p>He <hi>steps out of his way</hi> (p. 59.) to make a remark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Calvin:</hi> but because the Scene of our affairs now lyes at <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> is many miles off, he must pardon me, if I don't <hi>step out of my way</hi> to confute it.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the Considerer has been attacking <hi>Lr</hi>. in his <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Positions:</hi> and now and then a <hi>Work</hi> or two has crept in to keep his first <hi>design</hi> in Countenance: he's now making his last efforts upon his reputation by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62660:25"/>
shewing us what <hi>Company</hi> he kept. He would perswade<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> us that <hi>Lr</hi>. <hi>had frequent intercourses and Dialogues with the Devil.</hi> He proves it first by the story <hi>Lr</hi>. tells of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his book <hi>de Missa privata</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis true, he do's there say, that <hi>waking once at midnight, Satan began this disputation with him:</hi> but how began it? <hi>In animo instituit,</hi> say the words of the Relation: by suggesting bad thoughts to him, not by any <hi>personal conference,</hi> as the Pamphlet all along would insinuate. To fix this Idea upon the mind of the Reader there is an account here given of Satan's way in disputation: <hi>Diabolus sua argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta fortiter figere, &amp; urgere novit: voce quoque gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi &amp; forti utitur</hi> &amp;c, All which is wanting in the first <hi>Wirtenberg</hi>-Edition, but was requisite to support the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a <hi>real appearance,</hi> which my Author had rais'd. If <hi>Lr</hi>. relates these suggestions in the way of a formal and set Dialogue, it is only a contrivance of his to make the story more divertive in the telling; and was perfectly the style of the Convent in those days: I desire therefore the Reader to remember the excuse, <hi>Lr</hi>. has made for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self—<hi>Pium Lectoremoro, ut ista legat cum Iudicio, &amp; sciat me fuisse aliquando Monachum</hi>

            <p>He goes on with 2 or 3 Quotations from <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>Melchior Adamus,</hi> which in their utmost stretch can sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify no more then that <hi>Lr</hi>. lay under severe agonies of mind.

He know's <hi>Adams</hi> is a Collector, and took every thing upon trust,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62660:26"/>
without ever being fam'd for any exactness of judgment: and as for his <hi>Table-talk</hi> he would do well to vent it there, where 'twas first spoken, for we have told him more then once, that it is not like to bear the force of an argument with us: it may serve to <hi>divert</hi> a Reader, but is not fit to <hi>convince</hi> him. But <hi>Lr</hi>. himself confesses (Lib. de Vot. Monast.) that <hi>the Devil us'd all methods to hinder and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 62.</note> 
               <hi>him.</hi> No doubt on't, 'twas his interest, so to stop the progress of the Gospel: and since <hi>Ls</hi>. death, the same design has been carrying on by <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his Agents</hi> against his reputation. But this is so far from giving us a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice against <hi>Luther,</hi> that we think it a very good chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of him, that the Devil and he were at enmity, and no very bad one, that the <hi>Considerer</hi> is not his Friend. I have strictly examin'd particulars here, and letting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tittle, he has brought, go in his own sense, can disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, after all, none of those <hi>frequent intercourses and nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations,</hi> we were told of. Unless it be proper to say that <hi>Lr</hi>. <hi>negotiated</hi> with a <hi>Black-boar,</hi> and had an <hi>intercourse</hi> with the Devil about <hi>Nut-cracking.</hi> stories so silly, that they are fit to be the Objects of a stronger and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing Faith, than we Protestants can pretend to.</p>
            <p>Pass we on then to the next Paragraphs. And there I found my Author pretty well disengag'd from Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I was in hopes upon this to see a fair naked piece of reasoning, and was resolv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to give it as fair an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. But I quickly saw there was no need for it; <hi>sheer argument</hi> is not the talent of the man, I have to deal with: Little wrested sentences of authors are the Bladders, which bear him up, and he sinks downright, when he once pretends to swim without 'em. He discourses us here very largely upon the <hi>Craft and Wilyness of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> and proves how <hi>sly and double-fac'd</hi> his designs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are, for 4 or 5 pages together: all which we in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62660:26"/>
one Line <hi>answer,</hi> by <hi>granting</hi> it. But what inference do's he make from these Premises? that a man besett with Temptations <hi>cannot possibly know,</hi> with what design the Devil attacq's him? No: that <hi>Luther did not?</hi> Nor that neither: but only that 'twas pretty difficult for him to do it. Perhaps it was, but if fastings, prayers, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious application in order to a discovery of truth won't call in God Allmighty's assistance, what shall we say of that Text where 'tis promis'd, that we shall not be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted above what we are able? These means <hi>Lr</hi>. us'd, and these we question not but God accepted of, and led him into Truth. Now for our Author's saying that this <hi>might be</hi> a Satanical Illusion, so say I too: but the quaestion is, not what it <hi>might be,</hi> but what it <hi>really was.</hi> And to this there's not a syllable of proof offer'd. He has only busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been proving how ready Satan is <hi>to get an advantage over us:</hi> 'tis own'd; and he has been formerly told, that <hi>we are not ignorant of his devices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Arrow is now drawn to the head. <hi>There seem's</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 39.</note> 
               <hi>great evidence,</hi> he says, <hi>that the whole platform of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation proceeded Originally from the Devil.</hi> A gross calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny! which we could not easily pardon, if he did not kindly wipe it off, by the reasons that follow. His very next words are—For <hi>many of these very arguments against the former Church, which the Devil now openly own'd and urg'd to Lr</hi>. <hi>in this disputation held A. D. 1522. were the very same that had been urg'd by Lr</hi>. <hi>some years before.</hi> That is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Lr</hi>. urg'd these arguments <hi>first,</hi> and the Devil <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> therefore <hi>Lr</hi>. <hi>copied</hi> from the Devil. 'Tis amazing to consider how this inference should come into the head of any thing that thinks. The truth of the story is this. <hi>Lr</hi>. had publish'd several Treatises against the Mass long before this dispute: one in High Dutch in 1520; and the same year had writt against it in his <hi>Captivitas Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca:</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:62660:27"/>
another in Latin, entitled <hi>de abroganda Missa priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> A<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1521. and some months before this, in his book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Ambrosius Catharinus,</hi> and his <hi>Wormes-Articles.</hi> In 1522. the Devil (that is, <hi>Luther</hi>'s Conscience, by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigations) turn's these very reasonings upon him; and taking advantage of 'em as of confest principles, inferr's, that then <hi>Lr</hi>. must have been unpardonably wicked in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Masses for 15 year together. <hi>Audisne, inquit, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentissime Doctor? num ignoras Te per annos quindecim pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatas Missas quotidie fere celebrasse?</hi> &amp;c. How comes the Pamphlet to conclude then from this account, that <hi>whilst Lr</hi>. <hi>was in the bosome of the Church, the Devil by his arguments disputed him into a Reformation?</hi> Will he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that these reasonings must needs be receiv'd from Satan at first by <hi>Lr</hi>. because us'd by him afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Luther?</hi> This is so precarious a consequence, and yet establishes so unchristian a reflection, that it deserves only one of his own <hi>Deus tibi imperets</hi> for an Answer. Let the case be put home to him, and he must own the foolishness of it. He has left the Communion of the Church of England for some time; upon good grounds, I suppose, he'll tell us—and convincing reasons: should the Devil now employ these very reasons against him, by the force of them to set out how heynous his sin was in continuing so long in our Communion, would it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the Devil was the Author of his Conversion? Or rather would he not think us that made this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, neither good Christians, nor good Arguers? And yet he, who would pass for both, has not, we see, given <hi>Lr</hi>. fairer play. But <hi>the Old Serpent,</hi> he say's, <hi>was very silly,</hi> if his design upon <hi>Lr</hi>. in this conference was as we have represented it: <hi>for he might have consider'd in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of so much new truth, what might have hapned, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of despair he should prove a Reformer.</hi> What dos he<note place="margin">p. 85.</note>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62660:27"/>
mean here? Could the Devil fear a discovery of Truths, which (as he himself own's p. 71.) <hi>Lr</hi>. had preach'd up 5 years before? Could he dread a future Reformation, which had then been a good while afoot? These are such inadvertencies, that a body would think, even our Author with all his drowsy reasoning could never have been capable of 'em. No, his design was to stop a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation already begun, by involving in despair one of the chief supports of it. He gave no new light to <hi>Lr</hi>. but only accidentally added new strength to his Faith, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the assault was in vain. False therefore is that Assertion of the Pamphlet's, that <hi>Lr</hi>. <hi>yielded the field to the Devil in this Combat as Conqueror:</hi> All he yielded to in the dispute, was the conviction of those arguments, which he himself had before reform'd upon. The objections the Tempter rais'd from hence to discourage his Faith, and shake his constancy, those he withstood and baffled. What is there then in this Encounter that can be lay'd hold of to <hi>Ls</hi>. disadvantage? Is it, that he convers'd with the Devil? He did not, we see; the dispute was manag'd <hi>in animo atque in corde,</hi> by suggestions <hi>within,</hi> not <hi>without</hi> by any personal appearance. But had he really enter'd into Dialogue, yet the President, our Savior has given, would have been his warrant. And would one ransack the Lifes of their Popes [<hi>Sylvester</hi> the <hi>2d, Gregory 7, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict. 8, Hildebrand</hi> &amp;c.] 'twere easy to retaliate, and shew how much greater intimacies have been maintain'd between <hi>Satan</hi> and some of <hi>them.</hi> Is it, that his Doctrine of the Mass was struck out in this Conflict? or that it gave him any occasion of Reforming in this point? We have evidently made out the contrary by an elder date of some works of his, which establish these very opinions. Yet should it have been so, the actions of their own Saints would justify <hi>Ls</hi>. management. For their admir'd <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62660:28"/>
reform'd the Religious of his Covent upon just such another rancounter with the Devil<note n="a" place="bottom">Vid Antonin Chron. 3. Part. Tit. 23. Cap. 4. 6.</note>; and made use of his accusation, tho' contrary to the intention of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser. Is it that <hi>Lr</hi>. comply'd with the Tempter's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? no such matter! The supposition he allow'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'twas his own; but deny'd the Sequel, which his disputant would have fasten'd upon him. Yet should what he yielded to, have been Satan's own proposition, it do's not follow that he was therefore in the wrong: for <hi>Lying</hi> is not the indelible Character even of the <hi>Father of Lyes;</hi> sometimes a Truth serves his turn better. He quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Texts right upon our Savior, tho' he expounded em wrong: and surely he told no ly, when he confess'd Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Jesus to be the Son of the living God. Do's this story carry such scandalous impressions along with it, that even <hi>Chillingworth</hi> himself own's it as one of his motives for deserting our Communion? But pray take in the other part of the account too; and consider how he laugh'd at it when he return'd. So that after a search into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, all we find true in this affair is, that the Devil once made a solemn onset upon L<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. as before he had done on his Redeemer. A Calumny, which we are so far from disowning, that we are proud on't! The Devil had great reason to employ all his Engines against a Man, who had made such ravage in his Kingdome: and he took a good time to make his attacq's, when <hi>Lr</hi>. was in his soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes at the Castle of <hi>Wartsburg:</hi> for there it was, I think, that the scene of the Temptation lay. Upon the whole then, our Author's modesty seem's to be unexampled, who upon so slight grounds, nay upon no grounds at all, could be bold enough to say, that—<hi>the whole Platform of</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 71.</note> 
               <hi>the Reformation proceeded originally from the Devil.</hi> and agen that—<hi>the Devil is the Original Founder and Abetter of the</hi>

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:62660:28"/>
               <hi>Reformation.</hi> These are such sawcy expressions upon a Religion establish'd by Law, as deserve rather to be <hi>burnt,</hi> then <hi>confuted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manage and address of my author has been spent to no purpose in tricking up this story: for after all, we see, it has no hideous appearance. He's resolv'd now (in contradiction still to the method laid down of consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing works only and not disputing) to baffle the arguments the Opponent urges in the dispute, and shew how slight the propositions were, which <hi>Lr</hi>. let go for good. So that<note place="margin">p. 72.</note> the Tables are turn'd, and whereas the Scene before lay betwixt <hi>Lr</hi>. and Satan, 'tis now betwixt the Devil and the Considerer. And for my part, to give every one his due, I think the Devil has much the best on't. I shall pass by the little skirmishings on either side, and touch onely on what's material. The Devil argues against private Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,<note place="margin">§. 40. n. 3.</note> from the nature of Christ's institution, when he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed it about to his disciples, and said—<hi>Do this</hi> &amp;c. From St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Comment on these words 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. from the usage of the Primitive Church<note n="a" place="bottom">See Annot. in Conc. Trid. Sess. 22. Cap. 6. Where this usage is confess'd.</note>; and from the term <hi>Communion,</hi> which she allways express'd it by. Here the Answerer has nothing to say, but that the Priest in these Masses is <hi>ready</hi> to communicate the Sacrament to all that offer themselves. But this is not enough: for the Devil's quaestion is, whether it be not <hi>against the notion of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that the Consecrater alone should partake of it? He urges farther, that neither have they any <hi>intention</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it, because the words of Consecration are pronounc'd, according to the Canon of the Mass, with <hi>a Whisper,</hi> and so not defign'd for the peoples Ears. And to all this there's not a word reply'd. The Devil goes on to object, that as <hi>Lr</hi>. had <hi>withheld all</hi> the Sacrament in <hi>private</hi> Masses, so neither did he <hi>give it entire</hi> in <hi>public</hi> ones. To<note place="margin">§. 40. n. 4.</note>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:62660:29"/>
this the answerer returns nothing, but that the practise of the primitive Church is sufficient warrant, that the words of institution are not so to be expounded as if both kinds were necessary. But this bold assertion has been so fully vanquish'd in a late Reply to the Bishop of <hi>Meaux's</hi> treatise on this subject, that I shall not stop here to expose it. The Reader will there find, that not a single instance of Communion in one kind is to be found in all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of antiquity. At least, if our word will not be taken, that of the Council's will, which decreed it with a <hi>non-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante</hi> to the custome of the Primitive Church. Satan ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues<note place="margin">§. 40. n. 5.</note> against their form of ordination, which seem's rather to give the power of <hi>offering a Sacrifice,</hi> then <hi>distributing a Sacrament.</hi> For the words, he says, of the Suffragan, when he deliver's the Chalice into the Priest's hands, are—<hi>Take thou Power of consecrating, and Sacrificing for the Quick and the Dead.</hi> What say's the Replyer? Why, that <hi>Sacrificare</hi> in the Churches sense takes in the distributing part too. But we know this is not the Church-sense, and referr our selves to the <hi>Trent</hi>-Catechism to expound it. There <note n="a" place="bottom">Cap. de Euch. §. 75.</note> the Eucharist is said to be instituted upon a double account: the one that it might be a Spiritual food for our Souls, the other that it might be a Sacrifice for our Sins. So that whatever belong's to it as it is the food of our Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long's to it as a Sacrament: and certainly the ministring of it to the people belong's to it, as it is the food of our Souls, and therefore as a Sacrament not a Sacrifice. Besides the notion of <hi>Sacrificing</hi> has nothing in it of distribution. 'Tis offering something slain by the hands of a Priest, to God. Now this is all done, before it comes to be distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the People, as they who allow private Masses must needs acknowledge. It avails not the Considerer here to urge another part of the office, where the Priest is said to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62660:29"/>
be ordain'd <hi>in totum Presbyteratus officium:</hi> for if in the most solemn clause of it, where the power is specify'd; and convey'd, no mention be made of a power of <hi>impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrament,</hi> why should not the <hi>totum officium</hi> be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reduc'd to this, then this to that? Nor do's this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. L<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. Orders at all: for since no set form of words is prescrib'd by God as essential to Ordination, we doubt not, but that, where the Church intends to convey this, it is actually convey'd, tho the form of doing it should be a little defective: which is all the Devil here pretends to make out; and which yet I don't see how his Adversary has answer'd. Satan proceeds to another objection against his using the Mass as a Sacrifice propitiatory for sins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christ's institution. Our Author says, 'tis a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice, onely as those under the Law are said to be so, with respect to that on the Cross. But by his leave, we deny the Parallel: for the quaestion we would put, isn't whether the Sacrament of the Mass be as <hi>truly propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as those under the Law? but whether it be as <hi>truly a Sacrifice?</hi> If so, then 'tis a true proper Sacrifice, without relation to that of the Cross; (for such the Jewish Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were) and is not onely <hi>commemorative,</hi> or <hi>representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> as we are told at a push: Even as the annual offering of the Paschal Lamb was not only commemorative of that first Paschal Lamb, but also in it self, exclusively to that respect, an entire proper sacrifice. But if he shall say, 'tis not of it's self a true proper sacrifice, 'twill follow, that neither can it be so, with respect to that on the Cross; for whatever is not in it's own nature a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sacrifice, can never be made so by a relation to some other that is. The Parallel then is wide. For the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations under the law, were first in their own nature Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and then propitiatory in vertue of that last offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Cross: whereas the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62660:30"/>
has not that first ground of a real Sacrifice; and so nothing to support it's propitiatory vertue upon. But learned Protestants he says have long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> since yielded up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">§. 45.</note> this argument, and quotes <hi>Mede</hi> and <hi>Perkins</hi> for it. They say indeed that the Eucharist is a <hi>sacrifice in representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and who ever said otherwise? but deny expressly that 'tis <hi>really</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> such. Our Author <hi>wonders</hi> they should relieve themselves with this distinction, and yet own the Legal Sacrifices (tho' representative) to be proper and real. But I hope his <hi>wonder</hi> will abate a little, now I have shew'd him the difference between 'em. St. <hi>Paul's</hi> authority brought from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 18. is beside the purpose. The Apostle is there arguing against the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stics,</hi> who joyn'd in the Idol-Feasts, and whom he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accuses of participating of the Idol-God: even as those (he says) who joyn in the Christian-Feast, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>—Therefore the one is as much a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> as the other! No! But therefore the one is as much an <hi>act of Religious worship</hi> as the other, and a <hi>confederating</hi> with him to whom the Sacrifice is offer'd: for upon that the Apostles argument runns. Satan had therefore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to say, that Christ instituted not the Sacrament to be either a Sacrifice, or singly receiv'd: for look upon the words of institution—<hi>Do this</hi>—Do what? no doubt on't, what I did; that is, bless the bread and wine, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it. So that, where this is not done, there is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and where it is done, no sacrifice. For nothing is done but what Christ did. Now he did not offer up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: for then what need of the oblation of the Cross af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards? as 'twas well urg'd by near half the Divines and Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Counc. of Trent. pag. 545.</note>. Who asserted also that neither Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Fathers, Canon of the Mass, or any Council, ever said that Christ offer'd up himself in the last supper. But
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62660:30"/>
I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>am weary of saying what has been so often said, and shall therefore leave Satan and my Author to dispute it out, as not being much concern'd which way the victory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> goes: for the strength of the cause, I suppose, do's not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon either of their talking. Indeed since the main of the argument has prov'd good, 'tis a needless task to vindicate particulars. If what is said in the lump be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of force enough to ground <hi>Ls</hi>. aversion against the Mass, 'tis all we desire. So that had I leisure to pursue the minutes of the discourse, yet the argument would be but where it was: for one demonstration upon a subject is as good as a thousand. The disputing part might have been spar'd here, because 'tis forreign to the first design of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <hi>bare Works,</hi> and by them making an estimate of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. But I must be content to follow my Guide in his own way. Should I have set aside every thing that was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> impertinent, my Answer must have lain within the room of one of his paragraphs. But this hadn't been deference enough to an Author of his <hi>bulk;</hi> and the <hi>dwarf</hi> had look'd too despicably little, to encounter the <hi>Gyant.</hi>

               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:62660:31"/>The next <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Paragraph recapitulates, and has been An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd<note place="margin">§. 45. §. 46.</note> already. He beginn's then to make his <hi>Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

But what do's he mean by it? would he argue that because both thought themselves <hi>certainly</hi> in the right, therefore he of the two that was in the right, was <hi>not sure</hi> of it? Do's Truth know her self 'ere the less to be truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Error</hi> stand's up, and pretend's boldly to know the contrary? This strike's at <hi>all certainty,</hi> as well as <hi>Luther's:</hi> and my Author must be a <hi>Sceptic,</hi> and no <hi>Roman-Catholic</hi> if he believes it.</p>
            <p>He own's there were several specious pretences for a<note place="margin">§. 48, 49, 50, 51.</note> Reformation, and allow's <hi>Lr</hi>. not to have been destitute of many personal virtues; but then he says they did not ballance his vices: and to prove this, instances in his <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality</hi> and <hi>disobedience;</hi> two crimes, which he has dealt with, as <hi>Varillas</hi> dos with <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th;</hi> and, to make the more solemn shew, split 'em into twenty.

He cannot but own, that <hi>Lr</hi>. disswaded the Protestants from taking up arms in the Cause of Religion, but (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his usual way of guessing at peoples thoughts) imputes it to his being conscious of their weakness. All that I shall say to this kind censure is, that the passive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the primitive Christians has been us'd at the same rate by a late Author<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose face I have since seen thro' a pillory.</p>
            <p>He gives a finishing stroke to his reasonings now<note place="margin">§. 52.</note> tow'rds parting, by a <hi>Parallel</hi> drawn between <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Mahomet.</hi> A man is tempted here to return the kindness, and give him another between <hi>some body,</hi> that He knows, and <hi>Iudas.</hi> But we understand with what design this odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous comparison was made, and shall therefore (to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify him) <hi>not be provok'd.</hi> Only he'll give us leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive an old observation, that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and <hi>Pope Boniface</hi> were cotemporaries. Indeed <hi>Boniface</hi> got the start of him a little, and set up his kingdome about 15 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: but <hi>Mahomet</hi> having the advantage of so good a pattern, tho' he began something later, has thriv'd bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. There is an author too of ours that has writt a book, call'd <hi>Turco-Papismus,</hi> which I would desire him to read, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ventures at capping Characters. These, he has given us, are very childish, and have no other property of <hi>parallels,</hi> but that, draw 'em out o'both sides, as far as you please, they'll <hi>never meet.</hi> I am too weary now to allow my self any excursion from the main design; else here's a fair opportunity to shew how great a bungler my Author is in hitting features. And after all, let the likenesses be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so true, yet a <hi>Parallel</hi> in a writer of Controversy, is no more then a <hi>Simile</hi> from a pleader at the Bar: it may glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little, and look prettily, but will never convince the Jury. What is said upon this occasion then, I shall suppose within a Parenthesis, and so go on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:62660:32"/>He resumes his first method afresh, and after this long<note place="margin">§. 57.</note> account, would now at last try his <hi>doctrine</hi> by his <hi>works,</hi> according to that Text—<hi>Ye shall know them by their fruits,</hi> which he here repeats agen, and expounds as formerly. But I have shew'd him from the natural drift of the words, from the joint authorities of our and their own Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that this Text must have another meaning. Yet we have comply'd even with this sense too; and expected, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had condescendingly made <hi>Ls</hi>. works Umpires in the Controversy, that the gross of his book should have been taken up in setting <hi>them</hi> out: but find contrarily that two thirds of it have been employ'd against his <hi>doctrines.</hi> We may hope at least that he will be more pertinent in the close. Here then after some little flourishes about the<note place="margin">§. 61.</note> Connexion of Truth and Holyness, Error and Vice (which kindly destroy one another) he summ's up the Evidence; that is he setts out what bad consequences <hi>Luther's</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine had; instancing in <hi>Variety of Sects, Dissoluteness of Life</hi> &amp;c. which (he says) attended the Reformation. So that by <hi>Works,</hi> it seems, he did not mean <hi>Ls</hi>. <hi>Works,</hi> as we were foolishly made to believe for above an 100 pages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; (for on this Topic not one word here is said) but the works of those that follow'd <hi>Luther;</hi> and when <hi>His faylings</hi> are too light to carry any weight, <hi>other mens Vices</hi> are thrown into the Scale. What a strange thoughtless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is this to write a book, and then baulk the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of it, just when 'tis to be shutt up? <hi>The Deserter,</hi> it seems, is resolv'd to maintain his character, by running from every thing, and leaving his own very methods in the lurch. But how do's he <hi>prove</hi> this Dissoluteness of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners upon the Reform'd? why, as he do's other things, he <hi>says</hi> it. Now whether there were at that time any such bad things, as he talks of, among Protestants, or no; yet we are sure these fruits could not spring naturally from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62660:32"/>
               <hi>Ls</hi>. doctrine: they might perhaps arise from it, as Vermin from the power of the Sun, by Equivocal production; but that they were it's direct genuine issue, is a proposition in vain <hi>asserted,</hi> unless it be <hi>prov'd.</hi> To shew this, would be to his purpose: till he do's, we are left at a gaze; and have nothing (for all his fine promises at first) to try <hi>Ls</hi>. doctrines by, but the very doctrines themselves. But men had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to suspect 'em (he says) because <hi>they came into the world</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 58.</note> 
               <hi>neither with miracles, nor (if we consider all said) with the signs of a good Spirit, nor yet own'd or defended (nay also rejected and condemn'd by the Church.</hi>) For the first of these, <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Luther,</hi> we own, came without 'em, but neither had he any need of 'em. Their use is to <hi>establish</hi> some <hi>new</hi> doctrine, not to <hi>restore</hi> an <hi>old</hi> one, which was his case. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore he no where pretend's to any <hi>extraordinary imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> vocation, but onely to that <hi>ordinary call</hi> of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and the commission then given him to preach the truth of the Gospel, and confound Error. As to the <hi>signs of a good Spirit,</hi> I have <hi>consider'd all said,</hi> and cannot find that he had the signs of a bad one. He had a zeal for God's glory, which hurried him sometimes beyond what was decent in his expressions: but this imperfection was, we doubt not, easily pardon'd by that God, who in some measure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted <hi>Iehu's</hi> zeal, tho stain'd with gross hypocrify. In other things I hope I may by this time boldly pronounce him <hi>blameless.</hi> As for the <hi>Churches rejecting and condemning his Doctrine,</hi> 'tis the old figure of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> for the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> and is too trite a subject to be here insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Truth and Holyness, Error and Vice have a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion:</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 59.</note> What then? <hi>Luther</hi> we have prov'd an <hi>holy</hi> man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore this do's not touch us in the sense he would have it. Yet truth and holyness, Error and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vice are not, it seem's, so <hi>necessarily</hi> link'd together, but that <hi>a Teacher
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62660:33"/>
of something false may bring forth the fruits of a good life; and contrary, the Teacher of Truth the fruits of a bad:</hi> for these are his words in this very paragraph. So that <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Contingent</hi> are the same in this man's Logic.</p>
            <p>Agen he proves, that <hi>where more corrupt Doctrines are</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 60.</note> 
               <hi>believ'd, and taught, there for the general are more corrupt lives.</hi> Agreed! but are <hi>Luther's</hi> Doctrines of such a stamp? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in his gross way of delivering 'em, they may have such an appearance. The 4 main heads are, he says, 1. <hi>The</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 61.</note> 
               <hi>Nullity and Antichristianism of the former Clergy and the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obligation of their Laws.</hi> But I have made out from the <hi>Smalcald</hi> Articles, that <hi>Luther</hi> held no nullity in this case: &amp; tho' in points <hi>fundamental</hi> he allow'd not the Authority of councils, as depending merely on revelation for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet in things <hi>indifferent</hi> I have shew'd that he was as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be concluded by their sanctions as any man. 2. <hi>The inutility of works, pennance, mortifications</hi> &amp;c. This is all a slander: he decry'd not the <hi>use<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but the <hi>merit</hi> of them. 3. <hi>The servitude of Man's will, and inability to do good even in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate. Ls</hi>. Doctrine of free will is, when fairly expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the same with the Church of <hi>Englands:</hi> as such, we <hi>own</hi> it, and shall <hi>defend</hi> it. 4. <hi>The sole sufficiency of Faith in us for our Iustification.</hi> We have told him that <hi>Luther</hi> held good works as necessary to <hi>Salvation</hi> as any Papist of 'em all, tho' he did not think they were the <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> That they follow'd upon it, as <hi>heat</hi> attends the <hi>light</hi> of the Sun, he own'd: but then as heat do's not <hi>enlighten,</hi> however close join'd with that which do's, so neither do they <hi>justify.</hi> If then '<hi>twas out of these three latter points, that a great dissoluteness of Life, Covetousness, Oppression</hi> &amp;c. grew; 'tis to be hop'd the crimes imputed are but a fiction, and that the Reform'd are not so bad as they are represented, since those three points, when truly stated, have a quite different air, we see, from what he has bestow'd upon 'em.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62660:33"/>
The Parragraph referr'd to, I'me sure, proves no such thing:<note place="margin">§ 7.</note> there are two or three expressions from <hi>Erasmus, Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Musculus,</hi> which represent some of the Reform'd as worse then while they were Papists. And will he take the advantage of this, so far as to say, that the Reformation do's of it self make men worse? If he will, 'tis plain, he's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to make all the <hi>spiteful</hi> inferences he can, without troubling himself whether they are <hi>just</hi> or no.</p>
            <p>He proceeds to reflect on the many Sects that sprung<note place="margin">§ 62.</note> up after the Reformation. But a late <hi>Apologetical Vindicator of the Church of England</hi> has so fully clear'd this objection, that the most partial must be satisfy'd. I can add nothing to what that <hi>worthy Author</hi> has done, and shall therefore spare my self the trouble of transcribing. I shall only take notice of something the Considerer relates on this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>By reason of these Sects,</hi> he says, <hi>following the Reformation so close at the heels</hi> &amp;c,—<hi>Lr</hi>. <hi>often foretold that the true Religion should not long continue after his death.</hi> He bring's not a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>Lr</hi>. to confirm this report, which is an evident sign that he cannot: for upon lesser occasions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he do's not spare his <hi>Latin.</hi> Indeed <hi>Luther</hi> was so far from any <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of this nature, that his Adversaries have blam'd him for a too great <hi>presumption</hi> on t'other side: particularly <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> in his <hi>12th.</hi> Note urges against him a prophecy of his, that in two years the Papal Kingdome should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd. Tho' this too be a falsity, and was broach'd by <hi>Cochleus,</hi> a venemous writer; and one so careless of truth or falshood, that <hi>Sanders</hi> himself is not more. But my Author has a great knack at Remarks: i'the end of this Paragraph, he makes another about <hi>our refining in the points of Controversy, and coming nearer and nearer still to the Church of Rome.</hi> Now let any man compare <hi>Bellarmin's bold truths,</hi> with the <hi>softnings</hi> of the Bishop of <hi>Condom,</hi> and the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter,</hi> and then tell me, on which side this imputation

            <p>We are come now to the last stage of the Pamphlet;<note place="margin">§. 63.</note> where we may see how much art is requisite to manage circumstances well.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62660:34"/>
Pamphlet tell's us; <hi>Luther</hi> had early warnings given him by a lingring sickness, and was sensible of his death some time before it's approach. Neither hapned it amidst all the <hi>Iollity</hi> that is pretended: He had discours'd all that day on divine subjects, had employ'd his latter days in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and receiving the Sacrament, and his breath depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a prayer. But this prayer had never a <hi>miserere mei</hi> in't, says the Objecter. What then? must all good men at their death be ty'd up to a particular phrase? yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless it had something equivalent: <hi>Rogo te, mi Domine, Iesu Christe suscipe animam meam,</hi> was no assuming expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but as much a request of mercy as the other. He dy'd calmly too, and with all the easyness of a man falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep: not with the <hi>tortura oris,</hi> and <hi>dextrum latus totum infuscatum,</hi> which we are told of out of <hi>Cochleus.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderer might be asham'd, after he had professedly disown'd that senseless writer thro' his whole book, to close it up at last with a little piece of borrow'd malice from him. A thousand such particulars as these might be drawn from <hi>Lindanus, Pontacus, Thyrraeus</hi> and the rest of that rank Crew, who have taken care that neither <hi>Luther</hi> nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reformer should go down to the Grave with honor. <hi>Luther</hi> had the luck to detect one of these shamms whilst living: for even Then a story was sent abroad of his Death, with all the hideous circumstances imaginable <note n="a" place="bottom">Vide Lonicer. Theatr. p. 246.</note>: But he himself confuted it in writing, and shew'd us in this one report what credit may be given to the rest. Yet <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> was so taken with these fooleries, that he has, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously enough, inserted into his Notes of the true Church, this for one—<hi>The bad ends of it's opposers:</hi> and there with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62660:35"/>
a great deal of formality tells this story of <hi>Ls</hi>. death, and twenty more not less extravagant. But let the <hi>Considerer</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 104.</note> rebuke him for it: his words are, that <hi>the chief authors of Sects and Haeresies have, not unfrequently, nothing in their Life or Death exorbitant or monstrous:</hi> which also is a kind hint, that he himself has been committing an impertinence for above an 100 pages together; For 'tis an <hi>Observable</hi> very easily drawn I think from this <hi>Concession,</hi> that <hi>the Life and Death of a man can be no standard of his doctrine;</hi> which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently undoes all he has been doing, and putt's us in mind once agen of the <hi>humble-bees,</hi> and the <hi>Tinder-boxes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with his Paragraphs; and shall now examin a little his design in writing em. It was, I suppose, to lay a blot upon the <hi>Reformation</hi> in general, and particularly that of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> But first, how comes the <hi>Church of England</hi> to be concern'd in what <hi>Luther</hi> said, or did? Whilst he was pulling down the Papacy in <hi>Germany,</hi> she was carrying on the same design here at home. She had struggl'd and heav'd at a Reformation; ever since <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs</hi> dayes, for abont a 150 years together: her <hi>Lollards</hi> (as they were call'd) had all along <hi>spoken, written,</hi> and <hi>dy'd</hi> for it: she could not nevertheless bring it to the birth 'till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time, when the Eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> began to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd: then it was that she push'd it forward, and threw off the Popes Yoke in concert with other Churches. Her proceedings were regular, and by the joint Authorities of the state Civil and Ecclesiastical. If irregularities were done elsewhere, let them Answer for 'em, that did 'em. Whatever <hi>Luther's</hi> actions at that time might be, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us no more, then the Historian's flourish about <hi>Sultan Selim's</hi> Conquests do's his History of Haeresys: they were cotemporary indeed, and that's all; for there's no other dependence between 'em.</p>
            <p>But neither is <hi>the Reformation</hi> in general at all blasted by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62660:35"/>
this method. For let <hi>Luther</hi> be as bad as he will, yet the Doctrine of the Apostles, and the primitive Church is, we hope, ne'r the worse for his preaching it. He pretended to no <hi>new Revelation;</hi> had he done so 'twould have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, perhaps, that he should have liv'd up to it: he only pointed out some <hi>old Truths,</hi> that had layn hid a great while; and detected some <hi>Errors,</hi> which in the course of time had, like rust, overspread Christianity. Here have we nothing to do but to put our selves upon the search, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these pretences of his to antiquity be true or false: for if they be true, 'tis a confest point that they must be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten'd to, whoever he be that makes 'em. <hi>Idolatry</hi> is agreed to be a sin on all sides: should <hi>a Iew</hi> therefore object it to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as an hindrance of his Conversion, she were bound to reform even on this admonition. But where a new Religion is reveal'd, the case I confess, is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise: there the doctrine it self is in dispute whether true or false; all aids therefore are to be call'd in, that may any ways assist us in the discovery; and the Lives of the Revealers may be justly enough set over against the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to find whether they agree. Thus should that <hi>bad man Lr</hi>. have been the <hi>first discoverer</hi> of Errors in the Church, yet his <hi>badness</hi> would in no wise have prejudic'd his <hi>discovery.</hi> But what now if he were <hi>one of the latest</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testers against Popery? and even then, but <hi>one among many,</hi> that set about the same work? The objection at this rate lessens very much, and comes to no more then this, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And that this is the case, has been prov'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em to a demonstration a hundred times over. <hi>Melchior Adams</hi> has afforded us the Lives of no less then 22 <hi>Divines,</hi> who immediately before, and together with <hi>Luther</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted all the same design. The Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were never possess'd quietly: we have told 'em when they came in, and who they were that rose up against 'em,

Edit Lond. 1620.</note>: not to mention <hi>Field, Usher, Catalogus Testium Vt ritatis,</hi> and twenty more. <hi>Goldastus</hi>'s three Volumes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently explain the sense of all ages in this point; and <hi>Orthuinus Gratius</hi>'s Collection of Complaints lets us know what peoples thoughts were, when <hi>Luther</hi> appear'd. He did not awaken the world with new surprizing noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for then they would have suspended their judgments a while: whereas thousands follow'd his standard, as soon as ever it was advanc'd; and <hi>Melitz</hi> the Apostolic Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary own'd that in 1518 (a year after <hi>Lr</hi>. first preach'd) he found in his journy from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Saxony</hi> three on <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's</hi> side to one that stood for the Pope <note n="b" place="bottom">Vide Sleid. ad Ann.</note>. <hi>Luther</hi> then was <hi>one of the latest</hi> asserters of truth, and even at that time <hi>not single: Oecolampadius, Zuinglius, Carlstad,</hi> and many more were e'en as early as he: tho' 'tis true he signaliz'd himself above the rest by a peculiar bravery of mind, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedness in the cause of God, that was little less then miraculous. He <hi>labor'd more then them all,</hi> yet still they were his <hi>Fellow-Labourers in the Gospel:</hi> and therefore, were the Reformation to be run down by <hi>Life-writing,</hi> yet to think this task is perform'd by considering the actions of <hi>Lr</hi>. alone, when there were so many both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>with</hi> him that embark'd in the same cause, is the most senseless thing imaginable.</p>
            <p>But further, when <hi>the Considerer</hi> has manag'd this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the best advantage, he would do well to <hi>consider</hi> too, how it returns upon him. <hi>Luther,</hi> even in the colours he has laid upon him, do's not look half so ill as some <hi>Popes</hi> of theirs who were his Cotemporaries. <hi>Iulius</hi> was of a cruel restless temper, and sacrific'd the peace of all <hi>Italy</hi> to his ambition. <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> is deservedly infamous for his base prostitution of <hi>Indulgences. Paul</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> kept a <hi>Whore</hi>

openly, and own'd it; and advanc'd a-Bastard of his to the Principality of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza.</hi> Would we ascend higher to the known names of <hi>Hildebrand, Innocent, Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> and the rest of those lew'd Popes, whom <hi>Bellarmin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to have gone in a long Train to the Devil,</hi> we should quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find how advantageous <hi>Luther's</hi> character would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: and what reason <hi>Castilio's</hi> Painter had to reply upon the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> who blam'd him for putting a little too much colour into St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul's</hi> faces, that 'twas true indeed, in their Life time they were pale mortify'd men, but that since they were grown ruddy, by blushing at the sins of their Successors. Now let any man tell me, why <hi>manners</hi> are not (as much, nay) more requisite to an <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Guide,</hi> then a <hi>fallible Reformer?</hi> since in the one, we accept the Doctrine merely for the man's sake, in the other the man for his Doctrine's sake: especially since the first involves alwayes the latter's character; for Infallibility carrys along with it the perpetual power of reforming A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses. This holds good then against such as place the last appeal in the <hi>Pope:</hi> those who take refuge in a <hi>multitude,</hi> have an <hi>Arrian Council</hi> to Answer for; a Council, where the lives of the Fathers were as unorthodox as their <hi>Principles;</hi> and this in a much higher degree then is pretended upon <hi>Luther,</hi> if <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s word may be set over against the <hi>Considerer's.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of his (for I know not what else to call it) before the Dyet at <hi>Worms,</hi> was such as might have become the days of the Apostles. His Life was holy, and, when he had leisure for retirements, severe: his virtues active chiefly, and homilitical, not those lazy sullen ones of the Cloyster. He had no ambition but in the service of God: for other things, neither his enjoyment, nor wishes ever went higher then the bare conveniencies of living. He was of a temper particularly averse to covetousness, or any base sin; and charitable even to a fault, without respect to his own occasions. If among this <hi>Crowd of Virtues</hi> a <hi>fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> crept in, we must Remember that an Apostle himself <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Flaw</hi> is to be seen; yet the greatest Lights of the Church, and in the purest times of it, were, we know, not exact in all their Opinions. Upon the whole, we have certainly great reason to break out in the phrase of the Prophet, and say—<hi>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth glad tideings?</hi>
