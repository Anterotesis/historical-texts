         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Noble Sir, to perſiſt ſtill in your

accept of that in the birth, which
your encouragements furthered in

and have effected (God making

I cannot ſtand to ſpecifie them; this

Thou haſt here preſented to thy view, the Book of

though in a larger extent. Now if the
Tyrannie of thine affairs are ſo imperious, or
the Weakneſs of thy purſe ſo injurious, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede
thy peruſal of the Hiſtory of the Church
(which is abſolutely the beſt (ſave one) in the

Yet have they alwayes held up their heads above

the more Wine have they yielded; Juniper burnt
ſmells ſavouriest, ſo do they; Chamomile trod,
growes faſtest, ſo do they; pounded Spices ſmell

Truth may be blam'd, but never ſham'd, herein

My joy, Dean <hi>Thomas,</hi> I do love thee well,</l>
                     <l>And therefore take the liberty to tell</l>
                     <l>Thee of thy faults; I am inform'd you do</l>
                     <l>Preach the Epiſtle, nay the Goſpel too,</l>
                     <l>Each Sunday to your people; and refuſe</l>
                     <l>To take from them (as a reward) your dues:</l>
                     <l>Which prejudicial to the Church-men is.</l>
                     <l>My joy, Dean <hi>Thomas,</hi> I adviſe you this:</l>
                     <l>Take tythes, or elſe it is too much to preach</l>
                     <l>But once a week: for if thou gratis teach,</l>
                     <l>May not the people think that we likewiſe</l>
                     <l>Should do the ſame? <hi>Tom,</hi> be not ſo preciſe;</l>
                     <l>It is enough for you when you have ſound</l>
                     <l>A good Epiſtle and Goſpel, to expound</l>
                     <l>The liberty of holy Church expreſs'd</l>
                     <l>Therein, and 'tis no matter for the reſt.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Thomas</hi> reply'd: My Lord, if I abſtain</l>
                     <l>From tythes, will my pariſhioners complain?</l>
                     <l>I know they will not: and whereas you ſay,</l>
                     <l>It is too much to preach each Sabbath-day,</l>
                     <l>I think it is too little, for my part;</l>

                     <l>Whereas, ſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> you do bid me preach</l>
                     <l>When a good Chapter I do light upon;</l>
                     <l>I've read them over all, and finde not one</l>

                     <l>What was the Teſtament nor old nor new:</l>
                     <l>And I will not know any thing at all,</l>

Go, go your wayes, and ceaſe ſo much to prate,</l>
                     <l>Leſt you repent you, when it is too late.</l>
                     <l>I truſt, ſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> that my cauſe is clear</l>
                     <l>In Gods eyes; therefore, what need I to fear?</l>
                     <l>And ſo he went his way. But when time's glaſs</l>
                     <l>Had run a little more, he burned was.</l>
                     <l>Though bloody clouds were rais'd, Religion's raies</l>
                     <l>Shone forth in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in thoſe worſt of daies:</l>
                     <l>Partly by reading (comfort flowing thence)</l>
                     <l>And partly by fraternal conference;</l>
                     <l>Which ſo enrag'd the Papiſts, that they came</l>
                     <l>And burnt four noted perſons in one flame;</l>
                     <l>One <hi>Jerom Ruſſet,</hi> that profeſt the truth,</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Alexander Kennedy,</hi> a youth,</l>
                     <l>Were brought to Judgement: <hi>Kennedy's</hi> heart panted</l>
                     <l>For fear at firſt, and would have fain recanted.</l>
                     <l>But when no hopes was left, God's Spirit reviv'd</l>
                     <l>His drooping ſoul; yea inward comforts ſtriv'd</l>
                     <l>To ſhew themſelves, both in his face and tongue:</l>
                     <l>Then falling on his knees, theſe words out ſprung:</l>
                     <l>Great God! What love haſt thou to all expreſs'd,</l>
                     <l>And unto me vile wretch, above the reſt!</l>
                     <l>O who hath taſted of thy clemency</l>
                     <l>In ſuch a high degree (O Lord) as I!</l>
                     <l>For juſt now when I would deny thy power,</l>
                     <l>And Jeſus Chriſt, thy Son, my Saviour,</l>
                     <l>T'have plung'd my ſelf all over head and ears</l>
                     <l>In everlaſting flames, (unquench'd with tears)</l>
                     <l>Thy right hand hath not ſuffer'd me to dwell</l>
                     <l>With the black ſubjects of the Prince of hell:</l>
                     <l>And I, that was of late with fear oppreſt,</l>
                     <l>Enjoy by thee a joy-enamel'd breſt.</l>
                     <l>I fear not death, do with me as you pleaſe;</l>
                     <l>I praiſe God I am ready, death's an eaſe.</l>

Then railed they on him, and <hi>Jerom,</hi> who</l>
                     <l>Said alſo unto them, Miſcal us, do;</l>
                     <l>This is your hour and power to command;</l>

                     <l>No ſooner were they both condemn'd to die,</l>
                     <l>But <hi>Jerom</hi> comforted young <hi>Kennedy:</hi>

                     <l>To enter in unto our Maſters joy:</l>
                     <l>And, with our Saviour, paſs the narrow road</l>
                     <l>Which few ſhall finde; the way to hell is broad.</l>
                     <l>We die for Chriſt, and Chriſt hath death ſubdu'd,</l>
                     <l>Death cannot hurt us: hence me may conclude</l>

an anſwerable retaliation
<pb facs="tcp:57611:73"/>

the party whom they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd:
So neither are they

Martyrs) be not ſo pleaſant,
and conſequently leſs deſirable,
yet my hanging out the ſignes
of your hononrable names (at
the Frontiſpice of my Book)
will be very effectual to make
it vendible. Humility in your

will cover all faults. I know
