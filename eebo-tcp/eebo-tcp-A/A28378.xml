         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Wherein, I shall crave leave, to open, my Counsels, and Purposes, as concerning this <hi>present Edition,</hi> in these five <hi>Particulars.</hi> First, I have ranked the severall <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates</hi>; Either, according to the <hi>Dignity,</hi> of the <hi>Work</hi>; as <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> or <hi>Cicero's, Orations,</hi> do precede <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes,</hi> or <hi>Cicero's Epistles</hi>; Or else, according to the <hi>Series</hi> of the <hi>Times,</hi> wherein they were written; or to which, they refer. By which Means, they may give the better Light; the one Part, to the other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I thought it fitting, to intimate; That the <hi>Discourse,</hi> within contained; Entituled, <hi>A Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of the Felicities, of Queen</hi> Elizabeth; was written, by his <hi>Lordship,</hi> in <hi>Latine</hi> onely: whereof, though his <hi>Lordship</hi> had his particular Ends, then; yet, in regard, that I held it a <hi>Duty,</hi> That her own <hi>Nation,</hi> over which she so happily reigned, for many years; should
<pb facs="tcp:51170:4"/>
be acquainted, and possessed, with the Vertues, of that excellent <hi>Queen,</hi> as well as <hi>Forrein Nations;</hi> I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, many years agoe, to put the same, into the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Tongue</hi>; Not, <hi>Ad Verbum</hi>; For that had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut Flat, and Injudicious; But, (as far, as my slender A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility could reach,) according to the <hi>Expressions,</hi> which, I conceived; his <hi>Lordship</hi> would have rendred it in, if he had written the same in <hi>English</hi>: Yet ever acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> or <hi>Apelles, Pencill,</hi> could not be attained, but by <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> or <hi>Apelles,</hi> Himself. This <hi>Work,</hi> in the <hi>Latine,</hi> his <hi>Lordship</hi> so much affected; That He had ordained, by his <hi>last Will,</hi> and <hi>Testament,</hi> to have had it published, many years since: But that <hi>singular Person,</hi> entrusted therewith, soon after deceased. And therefore, it must now, expect a Time, to come forth, amongst his <hi>Lordships,</hi> other <hi>Latin Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>Letters</hi>; which is, as the Fourth <hi>Part,</hi> of this <hi>Volume</hi>; there are inserted some few, which were written, by other <hi>Pennes,</hi> and not by his <hi>Lordships</hi> own: Like as we find, in the <hi>Epistolar Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours; Cicero, Plinius secundus,</hi> and the rest: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I found them immixed, amongst his <hi>Lordships Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>; And that they are written, with some similitude of <hi>Stile</hi>; I was loath, they should b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, for that <hi>Treatise,</hi> of his <hi>Lordships,</hi> Inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>A Confession of the Faith</hi>; I have ranked that, in the Close, of this whole <hi>Volume</hi>: Thereby, to demonstrate to the <hi>World</hi>; That he was a <hi>Master,</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> as well as in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> or <hi>Politicks</hi>; And that he was Versed, no lesse, in the <hi>saving Knowledge</hi>; Than, in the <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,</hi> and <hi>Adorning, Knowledges.</hi> For though, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the same, many years, before his Death, yet I thought that, to be the fittest place; As the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Incense unto <hi>God,</hi> of the <hi>Faith,</hi> wherein he resigned his <hi>Breath</hi>; The Crowning, of all his other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb facs="tcp:51170:5"/>
and Abilities; And the best Perfume, of his Name, to the <hi>World,</hi> after his Death.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, if it be objected, that some few, of the <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> whereof this whole consisteth, had visited the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Light before; It is true, that they had been obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the <hi>World,</hi> by unknown Hands; But with such Skars, and Blemishes, upon their Faces; That they could passe, but for <hi>a Spurious,</hi> and <hi>Adulterine Brood,</hi> and not for his <hi>Lordships Legitimate Issue</hi>: And the Publishers, and Printers, of them, deserve to have an <hi>Action,</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation,</hi> brought against them, by the <hi>State of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> for Disgracing, and Personating, his <hi>Lordships Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for this present <hi>Collection,</hi> I doubt not, but that it will verifie it self, in the severall <hi>Parcells</hi> thereof; And manifest, to all understanding, and unpartiall, <hi>Readers,</hi> who is the <hi>Authour</hi> of it; By that <hi>Spirit,</hi> of <hi>Perspicuity,</hi> and <hi>Aptnesse,</hi> and <hi>Concisenesse,</hi> which runs through the whole <hi>Work</hi>; And is ever an Annex, of his <hi>Lordships Penne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is required now; And I have been moved by many; Both from <hi>Forrein Nations,</hi> and at <hi>Home</hi>; who have held in Price, and been Admirers, of this <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Authours Conceits,</hi> and <hi>Apprehensions</hi>; That some <hi>Memorialls,</hi> might be added, concerning his <hi>Lordships Life</hi>; Wherein I have been more <hi>Willing,</hi> then <hi>sufficient,</hi> to satisfie their <hi>Requests:</hi> And to that End, have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to contribute, not my <hi>Talent,</hi> but my <hi>Mite,</hi> in the next following <hi>Discourse</hi>; Though, to give the true Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, to his <hi>Lordships</hi> Worth; There were more need, of another <hi>Homer,</hi> to be the <hi>Trumpet,</hi> of <hi>Achilles</hi> Vertues.</p>

                  <p>His first, and childish, years, were not without some Mark of Eminency; At which Time, he was endued, with that Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, and Towardness, of Wit; As they were <hi>Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>At the ordinary years, of Ripeness, for the <hi>university</hi>; or rather, something earlier; He was sent, by his <hi>Father,</hi> to <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Colledge,</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi>; To be educated, and bred, under the <hi>Tuition,</hi> of <hi>Doctor John White-Gift,</hi> then <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of the <hi>Colledge</hi>; Afterwards, the Renowned <hi>Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; A <hi>Prelate,</hi> of the <hi>First Magnitude,</hi> for Sanctity, Learning, Patience, and Humility: Vnder whom, He was observed, to have been more, then an Ordinary Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, in the severall Arts, and Sciences. Whilst he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant, in the <hi>University,</hi> about <hi>16.</hi> years of Age, (As his <hi>Lordship</hi> hath been pleased, to impart unto my Self;) he first fell, into the Dislike, of the <hi>Philosophy,</hi> of <hi>Aristotle:</hi> Not for the <hi>Worthlesnesse,</hi> of the <hi>Authour,</hi> to whom he would ever ascribe, all <hi>High Attributes</hi>; But for the <hi>Unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> of the <hi>way</hi>; Being a <hi>Philosophy,</hi> (as his <hi>Lordship</hi> used to say,) onely strong, for Disputations, and Contentions; But Barren, of the <hi>Production,</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> for the Benefit, of the Life, of <hi>Man.</hi> In which Mind, he continued, to his Dying Day.</p>
                  <p>After he had passed, the <hi>Circle,</hi> of the <hi>Liberall Arts</hi>; His <hi>Father,</hi> thought fit, to frame, and mould him, for the <hi>Arts,</hi> of <hi>State</hi>: And, for that end, sent him over into <hi>France,</hi> with

Sir <hi>Amyas Paulet,</hi> then Employed <hi>Ambassadour Lieger,</hi> into <hi>France</hi>: By whom, he was, after a while, held fit to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted, with some <hi>Message,</hi> or <hi>Advertisement,</hi> to the <hi>Queen</hi>: which having performed, with great Approbation, he returned back, into <hi>France</hi> again; With Intention, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, for some years, there. In his absence, in <hi>France,</hi> his <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> died; Having collected, (as I have heard, of Knowing <hi>Persons,</hi>) a considerable summe of <hi>Money,</hi> which he had separated, with Intention, to have made a competent <hi>Purchase</hi> of <hi>Land,</hi> for the Lively-hood, of this his youngest <hi>Son</hi>; (who was onely unprovided for; And though, he was the youngest in years, yet he was not the lowest, in his <hi>Fathers</hi> Affection;) But the said <hi>Purchase,</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accomplished, at his <hi>Fathers</hi> Death, there came no greater share to him, than his single Part, and Portion, of the <hi>Money,</hi> dividable amongst <hi>5. Brethren</hi>: By which meanes, he lived, in some <hi>streits,</hi> and <hi>Necessities,</hi> in his younger years. For as for that pleasant <hi>Scite,</hi> and <hi>Mannour,</hi> of <hi>Gorhambury,</hi> he came not to it, till many years after, by the Death, of his <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Brother,</hi> Mr. <hi>Anthony Bacon</hi>; A <hi>Gentleman,</hi> equall to him, in <hi>Heigth</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi>; Though inferiour to him, in the <hi>Endowments,</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi>: Vnto whom he was, most nearly, conjoyned in Affection; They two, being the sole <hi>Male Issue,</hi> of a second <hi>Venter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being returned from <hi>Travaile,</hi> he applyed himself, to the study, of the <hi>Common Law</hi>; which he took upon him, to be his Profession. In which, he obtained to great Excellency; Though he made that, (as himself said,) but as an Accessary, and not as his Principall study. He wrote, severall <hi>Tractates,</hi> upon that Subject. Wherein, though some <hi>great Maisters,</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> did out-go him, in <hi>Bulk,</hi> and <hi>Particularities</hi> of <hi>Cases</hi>; yet, in the Science, of the <hi>Grounds</hi>

In this way, he was, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while, sworn, of the <hi>Queens Counsell Learned, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>; A Grace, (if I err not,) scarce known before.

<pb facs="tcp:51170:7"/>
Of which <hi>House,</hi> he was a <hi>Member</hi>; where he Erected, that Elegant <hi>Pile,</hi> or <hi>Structure,</hi> commonly known, by the Name, of the <hi>Lord Bacons Lodgings</hi>: which he inhabited, by Turns, the most part, of his Life, (some few years onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,) unto his Dying Day.

                  <p>It is a Truth, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) and a familiar Truth, that safety, and preservation, is to be preferred, before Benefit, or Encrease: In as much as those Counsels which tend to preservation, seem to be attended with necessity; whereas those Deliberations, which tend to Benefit, seem onely accompanied with perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

The Prints of this are, every where, to be found: The <hi>Patient,</hi> will ever part, with some of his <hi>Bloud,</hi> to save and clear the rest.

Why (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker</hi>) the <hi>Disputer</hi> will, if he be wise, and cunning,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51170:14"/>
grant somewhat, that seemeth to make against him, because he will keep himself within the strength of his opinion, and the better maintain the rest. But this Place advertiseth me, not to handle the Matter, in a Common Place. I will now deliver unto you that, which upon a <hi>probatum est,</hi> hath wrought upon my self, knowing your Affections to be like mine own. There hath fallen out, since the last <hi>Parliament,</hi> four Accidents or Ocur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of State; Things published and known to you all, by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one whereof, it seemeth to me, in my vulgar understanding, that the danger of this <hi>Realm</hi> is encreased: Which I speak not, by way of apprehending fear; For I know, I speak to English Courages; But by way of pressing Provision; For I do find, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) that when <hi>Kingdomes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> are entred into Tearms and Resolutions of Hostility, one against the other, yet they are, many times, restrained from their Attempts, by four Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>The first is by this same <hi>Aliud agere</hi>; when they have their Hands full of other Matters, which they have embraced, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for a diversion of their Hostile purposes.</p>
                  <p>The next is, when they want the Commodity, or opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of some places of near Approach.</p>
                  <p>The third, when they have conceived an apprehension of the Difficulty, and churlishness of the enterprise, and that it is not prepared to their Hand.</p>
                  <p>And the fourth is, when a <hi>State,</hi> through the Age of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi> groweth heavy, and indisposed, to actions of great Perill, and Motion, and this dull Humour, is not sharpened, nor infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by any provocations, or scorns. Now if it please you to examin, whither by removing the Impediments in these four kinds, the Danger be not grown, so many degrees nearer us, by accidents (as I said) fresh, and all dated since the last <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after the last <hi>Parliament,</hi> you may be pleased to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how the <hi>French King</hi> revolted from his <hi>Religion</hi>; whereby every Man of common understanding, may infer, that the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, between <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> is more reconcileable; And a greater inclination of affairs to a peace than before: which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, it followeth, <hi>Spain</hi> shall be more free, to intend his Malice, against this Realm.</p>
                  <p>Since the last <hi>Parliament,</hi> it is also notorious, in every mans knowledge, and remembrance; That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves, of that Avenue, and place of approach, for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was never in the Hands of any <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> before; And that is <hi>Callais</hi>; which, in true Reason, and Consideration of estate, of what value or service it is, I know not; but in common understanding, it is a knocking at our Doors.</p>
                  <p>Since the last <hi>Parliament</hi> also, that Ulcer of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed brake forth before, hath run on, and raged more: which cannot but be a great Attractive, to the Ambition, of the <hi>Couucel</hi>

                  <p>And lastly, it is famous now, and so will be many Ages hence, how by these two Sea-Journey's, we have braved him, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him to scorn: so that no Bloud, can be so frozen, or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, But must needs take Flames of Revenge, upon so mighty Disgrace.</p>
                  <p>So as this Concurrence of Occurents, all since our last Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; some to deliver, and free, our enemies; some to advance, and bring him, on his way; some to tempt, and allure him; some to spur on, and provoke him; cannot but threaten, an encrease of our Perill, in great Proportion.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) I will but reduce to the Memory of this <hi>House,</hi> one other Argument, for ample and large providing, and supplying Treasure; And this it is.</p>
                  <p>I see, Men do with great Alacrity, and Spirit, proceed, when they have obtained a course, they long wished for, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from. My self can remember, both in this <hi>Honourable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ssembly,</hi> and in all other places of this <hi>Realm,</hi> how forward, and affectionate, men were, to have an Invasive War. Then we would say; A Defensive War, was like eating, and consuming Interest; And needs we would be Adventurers, and Assailants. <hi>Habes quod totâ mente petisti.</hi> Shall we not now make it good? especially, when we have tasted, so prosperous Fruit, of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires?</p>
                  <p>The first of these Expeditions Invasive, was atchieved with great Felicity; ravished a strong and famous Port, in the Lap, and Bosome, of their high Countries: Brought them to such Despair, as they fired themselves, and their Indian Fleet; in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as a good Odour unto God, for the great and Barbarous Cruelties, which they have committed, upon the poor Indians, whither that Fleet was sayling; Disordred their Reckonings; so as the next News we heard of, was nothing but protesting of Bills, and Breaking credit.</p>
                  <p>The second Journey, was, with notable Resolution, born up against Weather, and all Difficulties; And besides the success, in amusing him, and putting him to infinite charge, sure I am, it was like a <hi>Tartars,</hi> or <hi>Parthians Bow,</hi> which shooteth backward; And had, a most strong, and violent effect, and Operation, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flaunders,</hi> so that our Neighbours, and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, have reaped the Harvest of it; And while the Life Bloud of <hi>Spain,</hi> went inward to the Heart, the outward Limmes, and Members trembled, and could not resist. And lastly, we have a perfect account, of all the Noble, and good Bloud, that was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth; And of all our Sea-walls, and good Shipping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mortality of Persons, wreck of Vessels, or any manner of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51170:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And these have been the happy Effects, of our, so long, and so much desired, Invasive War.</p>
                  <p>To conclude (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker</hi>) therefore I doubt not, but every Man will consent, that our Gift must bear, these two Marks, and Badges: The one, of the Danger, of the Realm, by so great a Proportion, since the last <hi>Parliament,</hi> encreased: The other, of the satisfaction we receive, in having obtained, our so earnest, and ardent Desire, of an <hi>Invasive War.</hi>

                  <p>IT is well known, to your <hi>Majesty,</hi> (excellent <hi>King</hi>) that the <hi>Emperours</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for their better Glory, and Ornament, did use in their <hi>Titles,</hi> the Additions of the <hi>Countries</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> where they had obtained victories: As <hi>Germanicus, Britannicus,</hi> &amp; the like: But after all those Names, as in the higher place, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Name of <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> as the greatest Name of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Honour, immediatly preceding that Name of <hi>Augustus</hi>; whereby they took themselves, to expresse some Affinity, that they had, (in respect of their Office,) with Divine Honour. Your <hi>Majesty</hi> mought, with good reason, assume to your self, many of those other Names; As, <hi>Germanicus, Saxonicus, Britannicus, Francicus, Danicus; Gothicus,</hi> and others, as appertaining to you; Not by Bloud-shed, (as they bare them,) but by Bloud: your <hi>Majesties</hi> Royall Person, being a noble confluence, of streams, and veynes, wherein the Royall Bloud of many <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> are met, and united. But no Name is more worthy of you, nor may more truly be ascribed unto you, then that Name, of <hi>Father of your people,</hi> which you bear, and express, not in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of your stile, but in the reall Course of your Government. We ought not to say unto you, as was said to <hi>Caesar Iulius; Quae miremur, habemus, quaelaudemus, expectamus:</hi> That we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, wherefore to admire you, And that now we expect some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, for which to commend you. For we may, (without su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion of Flattery) acknowledge, that we have found in your <hi>Majesty,</hi> great Cause, both of Admiration, and Commendation. For great is the Admiration, wherewith you have possessed us, since this <hi>Parliament</hi> began, in those two Causes, wherein we have had accesse unto you, and heard your Voice: That of the return of Sr. <hi>Francis Goodwine</hi>; And that of the Union: Whereby it seemeth unto us; The one of these, being so subtile a Question

So (I say) it appeareth unto us, in these two examples, that <hi>God</hi> hath given your <hi>Majesty</hi> a rare sufficiency, both to compasse, and fathome, the greatest matters, and to discern the least. And for matter of Praise, and Commendation, which chiefly belongeth to Goodness, we cannot but with great thankfulness profess; That your <hi>Majesty,</hi> within the Circle of one Year, of your Raign, (<hi>infra Orbem Anni Vertentis</hi>) hath endeavoured, to unite your <hi>Church,</hi> which was divided; To supply your <hi>Nobility,</hi> which was diminished; And to ease your <hi>People,</hi> in Cases, where they were burthened, and oppressed.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the first; In the Course of <hi>Remedy,</hi> which we desire, we pretend not, nor intend not, in any sort, to derogate from your <hi>Majesties</hi> Prerogative; Nor to touch, diminish, or question, any your <hi>Majesties</hi> Regalities, or Rights.

But yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, (most Excellent King,) to use that Freedom, which to Subjects, that poure out their Griefs before so gracious a <hi>King,</hi> is allowable, we may very well alledge unto your <hi>Majesty,</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, or Simitude, used by one of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in another Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; And not unfitly representing our Case, in this point: And it is of the Leaves, and Roots, of <hi>Net<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s without Venome, or Malignity: and yet it is that Root, that bears, and supports, all the Leaves.</p>
                  <p>To come now, to the substance, of our <hi>Petition.</hi> It is no other, then by the Benefit of your <hi>Majesties</hi> Laws, to be relieved, of the Abuses, of Purveyors; Which Abuses, do naturally divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, into three sorts. The first, they take in Kind, that they ought not to take. The second, they take in Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntity, a far greater proportion, then commeth to your <hi>Majesties</hi> Use. The Third, they take in an unlawfull manner: In a manner, (I say) directly, and expresly, prohibited, by divers Laws.</p>
                  <p>For the First of these; I am a little to alter their Name. For instead of <hi>Takers,</hi> they become <hi>Taxers</hi>: Instead of taking Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for your <hi>Majesties</hi> service, they tax your people, <hi>ad redimendam vexationem</hi>: Imposing upon them, and exto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ting from them, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers sums of Money, sometimes in gross, sometimes in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Stipends annually paid, <hi>Ne noceant,</hi> to be freed, and eased, of their oppression. Again, they take <hi>Trees,</hi> which by Law they cannot do; Timber-Trees, which are the Beauty, Countenance, and Shelter, of Mens Houses; That Men have long spared, from their own purse, and profit; That Men esteem, (for their use, and delight,) above ten times the value: That are a Loss, which Men cannot repair, or recover. These do they take, to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing, and Spoyling, of your Subjects Mansions, and Dwellin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s; Except they may be compounded with, to their own Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. And if a Gentleman, be too hard for them, while he is at home, They will watch their time, when there is but a Bayliffe, or a Servant, remaining, And put the Axe to the Root of the Tree, ere ever the Master can stop it. Again they use a strange, and most unjust, Exaction; In causing the Subjects, to pay Poundage, of their own Debts, due from your <hi>Majesty</hi> unto them: So as a poor Man, when he hath had his Hay, or his Wood, or his Poultry, (which, perchance, he was full loath to part with, and had, for the Provision, of his own Family, and not, to put to Sale,) taken
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51170:17"/>
from him; And that not at a just Price, but under the value; And commeth to receive his Mony, he shall have, after the rate, of 12. pence in the Pound, abated, for Poundage, of his due Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon so hard Conditions. Nay further, they are grown to that extremity, (as is affirmed, though it be scarce credible; save that in such Persons, all things are Credible) that they will take double Poundage; Once when the <hi>Debentur</hi> is made; And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gain the second time, when the Money is paid.</p>
                  <p>For the second Point, (most <hi>Gracious Soveraign</hi>) touching the <hi>Quantity</hi> which they take, far above that which is answered to your <hi>Majesties</hi> use, they are the onely <hi>Multipliers</hi> in the world; They have the Art of <hi>Multiplication</hi>: For it is affirmed unto me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> by divers Gentlemen, of good report, and Experience, in these Causes, as a Matter, which I may safely avouch, before your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> (To whom we owe all Truth, as well of Information, as Subjection;) That there is no Pound Profit, which redoundeth to your <hi>Majesty,</hi> in this Course; But induceth, and begetteth three Pound damage upon your Subjects; besides the Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. And to the end, they may make their Spoil, more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, what do they? whereas divers Statutes, do stric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, that whatsoever they take, shall be registred, and attested; To the end, that by making a Collation, Of that which is taken from the Countrey, and that which is answered above, their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits might appear; They, to the end, to obscure their Deceits, utterly omit the Observation of this, which the Law prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to descend, if it may please your <hi>Majesty,</hi> to the Third sort of <hi>Abuse</hi>; which is of the unlawfull <hi>Manner</hi> of their Taking, whereof this Question is a Branch; It is so manifold, as it rather asketh an Enumeration, of some of the Particulars, then a prosecution of all. For their <hi>Price</hi>: By Law they ought to take, as they can agree with the Subject; By Abuse they take, at an imposed, and enforced, <hi>Price</hi>: By Law, they ought to make, but one <hi>Aprizement,</hi> by Neighbours, in the Countrey; By Abuse, they make a second <hi>Aprizement</hi> at the <hi>Court Gate</hi>; And when the Subjects Cattell, come up, many Miles, lean, and out of Plight, by reason of their Travell, then they prize them anew, at an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated price: By Law, they ought to take, between Sun and Sun; By Abuse, they take by Twilight, and in the Night time, A Time well chosen for Malefactours: By Law, they ought not to take in the High wayes, (A place, by your <hi>Majesties</hi> high prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, protected; And by Statute, by speciall words, excepted;) By abuse, they take in the wayes, in Contempt of your <hi>Majesties</hi> prerogative, and Laws: By Law, they ought to shew their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; And the Form of Commission, is, by Law set down; The Commissions, they bring down, are against the Law; And becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, they know so much, they will not shew them. A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other particulars there are, whereof, (as I have given your
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51170:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Majesty</hi> a Tast,) so the chief of them, upon deliberate Advise, are set down in writing, by the Labour of certain <hi>Committees,</hi> and approbation of the whole <hi>House,</hi> more particularly, and lively, than I can express them; My self having them at the second hand, by reason of my Aboad above. But this writing, is a Collection of theirs, who dwell amongst the Abuses of these of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and Complaints of the People: And therefore, must needs have, a more perfect understanding, of all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of them.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth only, that I use a few words, the rather, to move your <hi>Majesty,</hi> in this cause. A few words, (I say,) a very few, For neither need so great Enormities any aggravating; Neither needeth so great Grace, as useth of it self, to flow from your <hi>Majesties</hi> Princely Goodness, any Artificiall perswading. There be two Things onely, which I think good, to set before your Majesty. The one, the Example, of your most Noble <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours, Kings</hi> of this <hi>Realm</hi>: who from the First <hi>King,</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> with the <hi>Great Charters</hi> of their Liberties, untill the last, have ordained, most of them, in their severall <hi>Raignes.</hi> some Laws, or Law against this kind of Offenders: And specially the Example of one of them; That King, who for his Greatness, Wisdom, Glory, and Union of severall Kingdoms, resembleth your Majesty most, both in Vertue, and Fortune, <hi>King Edward</hi> the Third; who, in his time onely, made ten seve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rall Laws, against this Mischief. The second, is the Example, of <hi>God</hi> himself; who hath said and pronounced; <hi>That he will not hold them guiltless, that take his Name in vain.</hi> For all these great Misdem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anours, are committed, in, and under your <hi>Majesties</hi> Name. And therefore we hope your <hi>Majesty,</hi> will hold th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m twice guilty, that commit these offences: Once for the Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, of the People: And once more, for doing it, under the Colour, and abuse, of your <hi>Majesties</hi> most dreaded, and beloved, Name. So then, I will conclude, with the saying of <hi>Pindarus; Optima Res Aqua</hi>: Not for the Excellency, but for the Common use of it: And so contrary-wise, the Matter of Abuse of Purvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, (if it be not the most hainous Abuse,) yet certainly, it is the most common, and generall, Abuse, of all others, in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>It resteth, that according to the Command laid upon me, I do, in all Humbleness, present this writing, to your <hi>Majesties</hi> Royall Hands; with most humble Petition, on the Behalf, of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; That, as your <hi>Majesty,</hi> hath been pleased, to vouchsafe, your Gracious Audience, to hear me speak: So you would be pleased, to enlarge your Patience, to hear this writing read, which is more Materiall.</p>

                  <head>A <hi>Speech</hi> used by <hi>Sir Francis Bacon</hi> in the Lower <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Parliament, 5<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Jacobi,</hi> concerning the Article, of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Naturalization, of the <hi>Scottish Nation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT may please you, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) Preface will I use none, but put my Self, upon your good Opinions, to which I have been accustomed beyond my Deservings. Neither will I hold you in suspence, what way I will choose; But now, at the first, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my self, that I mean to counsell the <hi>House,</hi> to naturalize this <hi>Nation.</hi> Wherein, nevertheless, I have a request to make unto you; which is of more Efficacy, to the purpose, I have in Hand, then all that I shall say afterwards. And it is the same, which <hi>Demosthenes</hi> did, more then once, in great Causes of Estate, make to the People of Athens; <hi>Vt cum Calculis Suffragiorum, suman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Magnanimitatem Reip.</hi> That when they took into their Hands, the Balls, whereby to give their Voices, (according as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of them was;) They would raise their Thoughts, and lay aside those Considerations, which their private Vocations, and Degrees, mought minister, and represent unto them: And would take, upon them, Cogitations, and Minds, agreeable to the Dignity, and Honour, of the <hi>Estate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi> as it was aptly, and sharply said, by <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> to <hi>Parmenio</hi>; when upon the Recitall, of the great offers, which <hi>Darius</hi> made, <hi>Parmenio</hi> said unto him; <hi>I would accept these offers, were I as Alexander:</hi> He Turned it upon him again; <hi>So would I,</hi> (saith he) <hi>were I as Parmenio.</hi> So, in this cause, if an honest <hi>English Merchant,</hi> (I do not single out that State, in disgrace; For this <hi>Island</hi> ever held it Honourable; But onely for an Instance, of a private profession:) If an <hi>English Merchant</hi> should say, <hi>Surely I would proceed no further in the union, were I as the King</hi>; It mought be reasonably answered; <hi>No more would the King, were he as an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Merchant.</hi> And the like may be said of a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of the <hi>Countrey,</hi> be he never so worthy, and sufficient; Or of a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> be he never so wise, and learned; Or of any other particular Condition, in this Kingdome. For certainly, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi> if a Man shall be onely, or chiefly, sensible, of those Respects, which his particular Vocation, and Degree, shall suggest, and infuse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; And not enter into true, and worthy Considerations, of Estate, he shall never be able aright to give Counsell, or take Counsell, in this Matter. So that if this Request be granted, I account the Cause obtained.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed to the Matter it self. All Consultations, do rest, upon Questions Comparative. For when a Question is, <hi>De Vero,</hi> it is simple. For there is but one <hi>Truth</hi>: But when a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>De Bono,</hi> it is for the most part Comparative: For there be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51170:18"/>
differing Degrees, of <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Evill</hi>; And the best, of the <hi>Good,</hi> is to be preferred, and chosen; And the worst, of the Evill, is to be declined, and avoyded. And therefore, in a Question of this Nature, you may not look for Answers, proper to every Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, alledged: For somewhat that cannot be specially an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, may, nevertheless, be encountred, and over-weighed, by matter of greater moment. And therefore the Matter, which I shall set forth unto you, will naturally receive this Distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of three parts.</p>
                  <p>First, an Answer, unto those Inconveniences, which have been alledged, to ensue, if we should give way to this <hi>Naturalization:</hi> which, I suppose, you will find, not to be so great, as they have been made: But that much Dross, is put into the Ballance, to help to make weight.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, an Encounter against the Remain, of those Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, which cannot properly be answered; By much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Inconveniences, which we shall incur, if we do not proceed, to this <hi>Naturalization.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, an Encounter likewise, but of another Nature; That is, by the gain, and benefit, which we shall draw, and purchase to our selves, by proceeding to this <hi>Naturalization.</hi> And yet to avoid Confusion, which evermore followeth of too much Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, it is necessary for me, before I proceed to perswasion, to use some Distribution of the Points, or Parts of <hi>Naturalization:</hi> Which certainly can be no better, nor none other, than the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Distribution, of <hi>Ius Civitatis, Ius Suffragii, vel Tribus,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titionis, sive Honorum.</hi> For all Ability, and Capacity, is either of private Interest, of <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum,</hi> or of publick Service. And the publick consisteth chiefly, either in Voyce, or in Office. Now it is the First of these, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that I will onely handle at this Time, and in this Place; And reserve the other two, for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee; Because they receive, more Distinction, and Restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>To come therefore, to the Inconveniences, alledged on the other part. The first of them is, that there may ensue of this <hi>Naturalization,</hi> a surcharge of people upon this <hi>Realm</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; which is supposed already, to have the full charge, and content: &amp; therefore, there cannot be an admission of the adoptive, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Diminution, of the Fortunes, and Conditions, of those that are Native Subjects of this Realme. A grave Objection, Mr. <hi>Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> and very dutifull: For it proceedeth not, of any unkindness, to the <hi>Scottish Nation,</hi> but of a Naturall Fastness to our selves. For that Answer of the <hi>Virgins; Ne forte non sufficiat Vobis &amp; Nobis,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, not out of any Envy, or malign humour, but out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and that originall charity, which begins with our selves. And I must confess, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that, as the Gentleman said, when <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> in regard of the Greatness of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, grew pent, and straitened; it is true, that (Brethren though

                  <p>Now (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) as I said; <hi>Si in Ligno viridi ita fit, quid fiet in arido?</hi> I am sure there will be no more such Spring-T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

much more here at hand? For that (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker</hi>) you must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it, of necessity, to some speciall Accident, of Time, and place, that draweth them thither. For you see, plainly, before your eyes, that in <hi>Germany,</hi> which is much nearer; And in <hi>France,</hi> where they are invited with priviledges, And with this very priviledge, of <hi>Naturalization,</hi> yet no such Number can be found. So as it cannot be, either nearness of place, or priviledge of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that is the Cause. But shall I tell you (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) what I think: Of all the places in the world, near or far of, they will never take, that course of life, in this Kingdome, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves with, in <hi>Poland.</hi> For we see it, to be the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all men, that they will rather discover Poverty abroad, then at home. There is never a Gentleman, that hath over-reached himself in Expence, and thereby must abate his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but he will rather travell, and do it abroad, then at home. And we know well, they have good high Stomacks, and have ever stood, in some terms, and Emulation, with us; And therefore they will never live here, except they can live in good fashion. So as I assure you (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) I am of Opinion, that the strife, which we now have to admit them, will have like Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele, as that Contention had, between the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the admitting of a <hi>Plebeian Consul</hi>; which while it was in Passing, was very vehement, and mightily stood upon: And when the People had obtained it; they never made any <hi>Plebeian Consul</hi>; No, not in 60. years after. And so will this be for many years, as I am perswaded, rather a Matter in Opinion, then in use, or effect: And this is the First Answer, that I give to this main Inconvenience, pretended, of Surcharge of <hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second Answer, which I give to this Objection, is this: I must have leave to doubt, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) that this <hi>Realm</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is not yet peopled to the full. For certain it is, that the Territories of <hi>France, Italy, Flaunders,</hi> and some parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> do in equall space of Ground, bear and contain, a far greater Quantity of People, if they were mustred by the <hi>Poll.</hi> Neither can I see, that this Kingdom, is so much inferiour, unto those sorrain Parts in fruitfulness, as it is in population; which makes me conceive, we have not our full charge. Besides, I do see manifestly among us, the Badges, and Tokens, rather of Scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then of Press of People; as Drowned Grounds, Commons, Wastes, and the like: Which is a plain Demonstration, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever there may be, an overswelling throng, and press of <hi>People,</hi> here about <hi>London,</hi> which is most in our Eye; yet the Body of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> is but thin sown with <hi>People.</hi> And whosoever shall compare, the Ruines, and Decayes, of ancient Towns, in this Realm, with the Erections, and Augmentations, of new; cannot but judge, that this <hi>Realm,</hi> hath been far better peopled in fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the saying is most true, though in another Sense; <hi>Omne solum Forti Patria.</hi> It was spoken, indeed, of the patience, of an exil'd Man: But it is no less true, of the valour, of a Warlike Nation. And certainly, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) I hope, I may speak it without offence: That if we did hold our selves worthy, whensoever just Cause should be given; Either to recover our ancient Rights; Or to revenge our late wrongs; Or to attain the Honour of our Ancestors; Or to enlarge the Patrimony of our Posterity; We would never, in this manner, forget Considerations, of Amplitude, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and fall at variance, about profit, and Reckonings; Fitter, a great deal, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or private Persons, then for <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</hi> And thus, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) I leave this first objection, to such Satisfaction, as you have heard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51170:20"/>The second Objection is, that the Fundamentall Laws of both these <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> are yet divers, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall: Nay more, that it is declared, by the Instrument, that they shall so continue; And that there is no intent, in his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi> to make Innovation in them: And therefore, that it should not be seasonable, to proceed to this Naturalization, whereby to endowe them, with our Rights, and Priviledges, except they should likewise receive, and submit themselves, to our Laws. And this Objection, likewise, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker</hi>) I allow to be a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Objection, and worthy to be well answered, and discussed.</p>
                  <p>The Answer, which I shall offer, is this. It is true, for mine own part, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) that I wish, the <hi>Scottish Nation,</hi> gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Laws: For I hold our Laws, with some reducement, worthy to govern, if it were, the world. But this is that which I say, and I desire therein your Attention; That, according to true reason of Estate, <hi>Naturalization</hi> is, in Order, First, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, to union of Laws; In degree, a less Matter, then union of Laws; And, in Nature, separable, not inseparable, from uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Laws. For Naturalization, doth but take out, the Marks of a Forrainer; But union of Laws, makes them entirely as our selves: <hi>Naturalization</hi> taketh away separation; But union of Lawes doth take away Distinction. Do we not see, (Mr. <hi>Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>) that, in the Administation, of the world, under the great <hi>Monarch, God</hi> himself, that his Lawes are divers; One Law in <hi>Spirits,</hi> another in <hi>Bodies</hi>; One Law in <hi>Regions celestiall,</hi> another in <hi>Elementary?</hi> And yet the Creatures, are all one Mass, and Lump, without any vacuum, or separation? Do we not see, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, in the State of the Church, that amongst <hi>People,</hi> of all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and Linages, there is one <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Saints?</hi> And that, we are all Fellow Citizens, and naturalized, of the Heavenly Hierusalem? And yet, nevertheless, divers, and severall, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Lawes, Policies, and Hierarchies; According to the Speech, of that worthy Father; <hi>In veste varietas sit, scissurae non sit.</hi> And therefore, certainly, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) the Bond of Law, is the more speciall, and private, Bond; And the Bond of <hi>Naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the more common, and generall. For the Lawes, are rather <hi>Figura Reip,</hi> then <hi>Forma</hi>; And rather <hi>Bonds of Perfection,</hi> then <hi>Bonds of Entirenesse.</hi> And therefore, we see, in the Experience, of our own Government, that in the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> all our Statute-Lawes, since <hi>Poynings Law,</hi> are not in force; And yet we deny them not, the Benefit, of <hi>Naturalization.</hi> In <hi>Gersey, Garne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi> and the <hi>Isle of Man,</hi> our Common-Lawes are not in force; And yet they have the Benefit of <hi>Naturalization.</hi> Neither need any Man doubt, but that our Laws, and Customes, must, in small time, gather, and win, upon theirs. For here's the Seat of the Kingdome, whence come the supreme Directions of Estate; Here is the <hi>Kings Person,</hi> and <hi>Example,</hi> of which the Verse saith.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</l>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51170:21"/>And therefore, it is not possible; Although not by solemne, and formall, Act of Estates; yet by the secret Operation, of no long time, but they will come under the yoak of our Lawes; And so, <hi>Dulcis tractus pari jugo.</hi> And this is the Answer, I give, to this second objection.</p>
                  <p>The third Objection, is, some Inequality, in the Fortunes, of these two <hi>Nations, England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>; By the Commixture whereof, there may ensue Advantage to them, and Loss to us. Wherein, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker</hi>) it is well, that this Difference, or Dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>isteth, but in externall Goods, of Fortune. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it must needs be confessed, that for the Goods of the Mind, and the Body, they are <hi>Alteri Nos; Other our selves.</hi> For to do them but right, we know, in their Capacity, and understanding they are a people Ingenious; In Labour, Industrious; In Courage, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant; In Body, Hard, Active, and Comely. More might be said, but in commending them, we do but, in effect, commend our selves: For they are of one Piece, and Continent, with us: And Truth is, we are participant, both of their Vertues, and Vices. For if they have been noted, to be a people not so tractable in G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vernment, we cannot, without flatte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing our selves, free our selves, altogether, from that Fault; Being, indeed, a thing inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to all Martiall <hi>People.</hi> As we see it evident, by the Example, of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and others. Even like unto Fierce Horses, that though they be, of better service then others, yet are they har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to guid, and to mannage.</p>
                  <p>But for this Objection, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker</hi>) I purpose to answer it; Not by Authority of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which saith. <hi>Beatius est dare quam accipere:</hi> But by an Authority framed, and derived, from the Judgement of our selves, and our Ancestors, in the same case, as to this point. For, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) in all the Line of our Kings, none useth to carry, greater Commendation, then his Majesties Noble Progenitour, King <hi>Edward,</hi> the First of that Name: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his other Commendations, both of War, and Pollicy, none is more celebrated, then his purpose, and Enterprise, for the Conquest of <hi>Scotland</hi>: As not bending his Designes to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Acquests abroad, but to solid strength at home: which, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, if it had succeeded well, could not, but have brought in, all those Inconveniences, of the Commixture, of a more Opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Kingdome,</hi> with a less, that are now alledged. For it is not the Yoke, either of our Arms, or of our Lawes, that can alter the nature of the <hi>Climate,</hi> or the Nature of the <hi>Soyl:</hi> Neither is it, the <hi>Manner,</hi> of the <hi>Commixture,</hi> that can alter, the <hi>Matter,</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture.</hi> And therefore, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) if it were good for us then, it is good for us now; And not to be prised the less, because we paid not so dear for it. But a more full Answer to this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I refer over to that, which will come after to be spoken, touching Surety, and Greatness.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Objection, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) is not properly an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51170:21"/>
but rather a preoccupation, of an Objection, of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side: For it may be said, and very materially, whereabout do we contend? The Benefit of <hi>Naturalization</hi> is, by the Law, in as many, as have been, or shall be born, since his <hi>Majesties</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the <hi>Crown,</hi> already setled, and invested. There is no more then, but to bring the <hi>Ante-Nati,</hi> into the Degree of the <hi>Post-Nati</hi>; that Men grown, that have well deserved, may be in no worse case, then children, which have not deserved: And Elder Brothers, in no worse case, then yonger Brothers. So as we stand, upon <hi>Quiddam,</hi> not <hi>Quantum</hi>; Being but a little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Time, of one Generation, from another.</p>
                  <p>To this, (Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) it is said by some; That the Law is not so, but that the <hi>Post-Nati,</hi> are Aliens, as well as the rest. A point, that I mean not much to argue; Both because it hath been well spoken to, by the Gentleman, that spake last before me; And because, I do desire, in this Case, and in this place, to speak rather of Convenience, then of Law. Onely this will I say; That that Opinion, seems to me, Contrary to reason of Law; Contrary to form of pleading in Law; And Contrary to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Experience, of Law. For Reason of Law, when I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate of it; Methinks, the wisdom, of the Common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> well observed, is Admirable, in the Distribution, of the Benefit, and protection, of the Laws; According to the severall Conditions of Persons, in an excellent Proportion. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are four, but bipartite. Two of <hi>Aliens,</hi> and Two of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> The first Degree, is of an <hi>Alien,</hi> born, under a <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> that is an Enemy. If such an one, come into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, without safe Conduct, it is at his perill: The Law giveth him no protection, neither for Body, Lands, nor Goods: So as if he be slain, there is no Remedy, by any Appeal, at the parties sute, although his wife were an <hi>English</hi> Woman: Marry at the <hi>Kings</hi> sute, the Case may be otherwise, in regard of the offence to the <hi>Peace.</hi> The Second Degree, is, of an <hi>Alien,</hi> that is born under the faith, and Allegiance, of a <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> that is a friend. Unto such a Person, the Law doth impart, a greater Benefit, and protection; That is, concerning things personall, Transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Moveable; As Goods, and Chattels, Contracts, and the like: But not concerning Freehold, and Inheritance. And the reason is, because he may be an Enemy, though he be not. For the <hi>State,</hi> under the Obeisance of which he is, may enter intoy Quarrell, and Hostility; And therefore, as the Law hath but a Transitory Assurance of him, so it rewards him, but with Transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Benefits. The third Degree, is, of a Subject, who having been an <hi>Alien,</hi> is, by <hi>Charter</hi> made <hi>Denizen.</hi> To such an one, the Law doth impart, yet, a more ample Benefit: For it gives him power, to purchase Free-Hold, and Inheritance, to his Own use: And likewise, enables the Children, born after his Denization, to inherit. But yet, nevertheless, he cannot make Title, or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51170:22"/>
convey Pedegree, from any Ancestour Paramount. For the Law, thinks not good, to make him, in the same Degree, with a Subject born: Because he was once an Alien, and so mought once have been an Enemy. And <hi>Nemo subitò fingitur</hi>: Mens Affections, cannot be so setled, by any Benefit, as when from their Nativity, they are inbred, and inherent. And the fourth Degree, which is the perfect Degree, is, of such a Person, that neither is Enemy, nor can be Enemy, in time to come; Nor could have been Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, at any time past; And therefore, the Law gives unto him, the full Benefit, of <hi>Naturalization.</hi> Now, (Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) if these be the true Steps, and Paces, of the Law, no Man can deny, but whosoever is born under the <hi>Kings</hi> Obedience, never could, in <hi>Aliquo puncto temporis,</hi> be an Enemy; (A <hi>Rebell</hi> he mought be, but no <hi>Enemy</hi>;) And therefore, in Reason of Law, is naturalized. Nay contrary-wise, he is bound, <hi>Iure Nativitatis,</hi> to defend this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> against all Invaders or Rebels: And therefore, as he is obliged, to the protection of Arms; And that perpetual<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and universally; so he is to have, the perpetuall, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, Benefit, and protection of Law, which is <hi>Naturalization.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Form of <hi>Pleading,</hi> it is true, that hath been said; That if a Man, would plead another, to be an <hi>Alien</hi>; He must not onely set forth, negatively, and privatively, that he was born, out of the Obedience, of our <hi>Soveraign</hi> Lord the <hi>King</hi>; But affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, under the Obedience, of a forrain <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; which never can be done in this case.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Authority,</hi> I will not press it; you know all what hath been published, by the <hi>Kings Proclamation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for <hi>Experience</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> we see it in the Subjects of <hi>Ireland</hi>; In the Subjects of <hi>Gersey,</hi> and <hi>Gernsey,</hi> parcels of the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi>; In the Subjects of <hi>Calleis,</hi> (when it was <hi>English,</hi>) which was parcell of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> But, as I said, I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to enter into an <hi>Argument</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> but to hold my self, to point of <hi>Convenience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as, for my part, I hold all <hi>Post-Nati,</hi> Naturalized, <hi>ipso Iure.</hi> But yet, I am far from Opinion, that it should be a thing super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, to have it done by <hi>Parliament</hi>; Chiefly, in respect, of that true principle; <hi>Principum Actiones praecipuè ad Famam sunt compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendae.</hi> It will lift up a Sign, to all the World, of our Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and good agreement with them. And these are (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker</hi>) the Materiall Objections, which have been made of the other Side, whereunto you have heard mine Answers: Weigh them in your Wisdomes; And so I conclude that General Part.</p>
                  <p>Now, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) according as I promised, I must fill the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ballance, in expressing unto you, the Inconveniences, which we shall incurre, if we shall not proceed, to this <hi>Naturalization.</hi> wherein, that Inconvenience, which of all others, and alone by it self, if there were none other, doth exceedingly move me, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51170:22"/>
may move you, is a Position of Estate, collected out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Time, which is this: That wheresoever severall <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,</hi> or <hi>Estates,</hi> have been united in <hi>Soveraignty</hi>; If that Union, hath not been fortified, and bound in, with a further Union; And namely that, which is now in Question, of <hi>Naturalization</hi>; This hath followed; That at one time, or other, they have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken again, being upon all Occasions apt to revolt, and relapse, to the former Separation.</p>
                  <p>Of this Assertion, the first Example, which I will set before you, is of that memorable <hi>Vnion,</hi> which was between the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and the <hi>Latines,</hi> which continued, from the Battaile, at the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Regilla,</hi> for many years, untill the Consulships of <hi>T. Manlius,</hi> and <hi>P. Decius.</hi> At what time, there began, about this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point of <hi>Naturalization,</hi> that War, which was called <hi>Bellum So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Roman State</hi> endured. wherein after Numbers of Battailes, and infinite Seiges, and Surprises of Towns, the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the end, prevailed, and mastered the <hi>Latines.</hi> But assoon as ever they had the Honour of the War, looking back into what Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and Confusion, they were near to have been brought, they presently naturalized them all. You speak of a <hi>Naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in <hi>Bloud</hi>; There was a <hi>Naturalization</hi> indeed in <hi>Bloud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me set, before you, again, the Example of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and the rest of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> their Associates. The <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> was a Nice, and Jealous, State, in this point, of imparting <hi>Naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ion,</hi> to their Confederates, But what was the issue of it? After they had held them, in a kind of Society, and Amity, for divers years: upon the first occasion given, (which was no more, then the Surprize, of the <hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi> by certain desperate Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, in the habit of Masquers; There ensued immediately, a generall Revolt, and Defection, of their Associats; which was the Ruine of their State, never afterwards to be recovered.</p>
                  <p>Of later time, let me lead your Consideration to behold, the like Events, in the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi>; which <hi>Kingdome</hi> was united with <hi>Castile,</hi> and the rest of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the persons of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi>; And so continued many years; But yet so, as it stood, a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> severed, and divided, from the rest, of the Body, of <hi>Spain,</hi> in priviledges; And directly, in this point of <hi>Naturalization,</hi> or Capacity of Inheritance. What came of this? Thus much; That now of fresh Memory, not past twelve years since, onely upon the voice of a Condemned Man, out of the Grate of a Prison, towards the Street, that cried <hi>Fueros,</hi> (which is as much as <hi>Liberties,</hi> or Priviledges;) There was raised a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rebellion, which was suppressed, with Difficulty, with an Army Royall; And their priviledges disannulled, and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated, with the rest of <hi>Spain.</hi> Upon so small a Spark, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding so long continuance, were they ready to break, and sever again.</p>

                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51170:23"/>The like may be said, of the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Pisa:</hi> Which City of <hi>Pisa,</hi> being united unto <hi>Florence,</hi> but not endued with the Benefit of <hi>Naturalization,</hi> upon the first light of forrain Assist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For <hi>Greatness,</hi> (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) I think a Man may speak it sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without Bravery; That this <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> having <hi>Scotland</hi> united, <hi>Ireland</hi> reduced, the Sea Provinces of the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> contracted, and <hi>Shipping</hi> maintained; Is one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Monarchies, in Forces, truly esteemed, that hath been in the <hi>world.</hi> For certainly, the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> here on <hi>Earth,</hi> have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance with the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi>; which our <hi>Saviour</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth, not to any great <hi>Kernell,</hi> or <hi>Nut,</hi> but to a very <hi>Small Grain</hi>; yet such an one, as is apt, to grow, and spread.

For if it be <hi>Time,</hi> to talk of this now; It is, either because the business, now in hand, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed without it; Or because, in Time, and Order, this Matter should be precedent; Or because, we shall leese some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, towards this Effect, so much desired, if we should go on, in the course, we are about. But none of these three; in my judgement, are true; And therefore, the Motion, as I said, unseasonable.</p>
                  <p>For first, that there may not be, a <hi>Naturalization,</hi> without an <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> in <hi>Laws,</hi> cannot be maintained. Look into the Example, of the <hi>Church</hi>; And the Union thereof; You shall see severall <hi>Churches,</hi> that joyn in one <hi>Faith,</hi> one <hi>Baptism,</hi> (which are the points of spirituall Naturalization,) do, many times, in Policy, Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and Customes, differ.

                  <p>Secondly, that this <hi>Vnion</hi> of <hi>Laws,</hi> should precede the <hi>Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization</hi>; Or that it should go on, <hi>pari passu,</hi> hand in hand, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, likewise, can hardly be maintained: But the contrary, that <hi>Naturalization</hi> ought to precede. Of which my Opinion, as I could yield many reasons, so because all this, is but a Digression, and therefore ought to be-short; I will hold my self now, onely to one, which is briefly and plainly this: That the <hi>Vnion</hi> of <hi>Laws,</hi> will ask a great Time, to be perfected, both for the <hi>Compiling,</hi> and for the <hi>Passing:</hi> During all which time, if this <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> should be denied to be taken away; I fear it may induce, such a Habit of <hi>Strangeness,</hi> as will rather be an Impediment, then a preparation, to further proceeding. For he was a wise Man that said; <hi>Opportuni Magnis Conatibus Transitus Rerum.</hi> And in those Cases, <hi>Non progredi est Regredi.</hi> An like, as in a pair of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, you must put out the former writing, before you can put
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51170:26"/>
in new; And again, that which you write in, you write Letter by Letter; But that which you put out, you put out at once: So we have now to deal with the Tables of Mens Hearts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is in vain, to think you can enter, the willing Acceptance of our <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi>; except you first put sorth, all Notes, either of <hi>Hostility,</hi> or <hi>Forrain Condition.</hi> And these, are to be put out, <hi>simulet semel,</hi> at once, without Gradations; whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points, are to be imprinted, and engraven, distinctly, and by degrees.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas it is conceived by some, that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, of our Benefits, and priviledges, is a good Hold, that we have over them, to draw them to submit themselves to our Laws: It is an Argument, of some probability, but yet to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, many wayes. For first, the Intent is mistaken; Which is not, as I conceive it, to draw them wholy, to a Subjection to our <hi>Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>; But to draw, both Nations, to one <hi>uniformity,</hi> of <hi>Law.</hi> Again to think, that there should be, a kind of Articulate, and Indented, Contract; That they should receive our <hi>Laws,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our <hi>priviledges,</hi> it is a Matter in reason of Estate not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; Being that, which scarcely a private Man, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if it come to that, whereof <hi>Seneca</hi> speaketh; <hi>Beneficium ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere, est Libertatem vendere:</hi> No, but Courses of Estate, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, and delineate, another way; Which is, to win them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Benefit, or Custome. For we see, in all Creatures, that Men do <hi>Feed</hi> them first, and <hi>Reclaim</hi> them after. And so, in the first Institution of <hi>Kingdomes, Kings</hi> did first win <hi>People,</hi> by many <hi>Benefits,</hi> and <hi>Protections,</hi> before they prest any <hi>Yoke.</hi> And for <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And lastly, the <hi>Naturalization,</hi> which is now propounded, is qualified, with such Restrictions, as there will be enough kept back, to be used, at all times, for an <hi>Adamant,</hi> of drawing them further on to our Desires. And therefore, to conclude, I hold this Motion, of <hi>Vnion</hi> of <hi>Laws,</hi> very worthy, and arising from ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To come therefore to that, which is now in Question: It is no more, but whither, there should be a Difference made, in this priviledge of <hi>Naturalization,</hi> between the <hi>Ante-Nati,</hi> and the <hi>Post-Nati</hi>; Not in point of <hi>Law,</hi> (for that will otherwise be decided,) but onely in point of Convenience; [As if a Law, were now to be made, <hi>de novo.</hi>] In which <hi>Question,</hi> I will, at this time, onely answer two <hi>Objections</hi>; And use two <hi>Arguments,</hi> and so leave it to your Judgement.</p>
                  <p>The first <hi>Objection</hi> hath been; That if a Difference, should be, it ought to be in favour of the <hi>Ante-Nati</hi>; Because, they are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, of Merit, Service, and Proof; whereas the <hi>Post-Nati</hi> are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51170:26"/>
That, (as the Scripture saith,) <hi>know not the Right Hand from the Left.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This were good Reason, (Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) if the Question were, of <hi>Naturalizing</hi> some particular Persons, by a private <hi>Bill:</hi> But it hath no proportion, with the generall Case. For now, we are not to look to respects, that are proper to some, but to those, which are common to all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Now then, how can it be imagined, but that those, that took their first Breath, since this happy <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> inherent in his <hi>Majesties</hi> Person, must be more assured, and affectionate to this Kingdome, then those generally can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to be, which were sometimes Strangers? For, <hi>Nemo subi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tò fingitur:</hi> The Conversions of <hi>Minds,</hi> are not so swift, as the Conversions of <hi>Times.</hi> Nay, in Effects of <hi>Grace,</hi> which exceed far the Effects of <hi>Nature,</hi> we see, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> makes a difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those he calls <hi>Neophites</hi>; That is, newly grafted into <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>; And those, that are brought up, in the Faith. And so, we see, by the <hi>Lawes</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> shall be <hi>Baptized,</hi> in regard, of the Faith, of their Parents; But the <hi>Child</hi> of an <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Objection</hi> hath been made; That we ought, to be more provident, and reserved, to restrain the <hi>Post-Nati,</hi> then the <hi>Ante-Nati</hi>: Because, during his Majesties time, being a <hi>Prince</hi> of so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Wisdome, and <hi>Iudgement,</hi> we need no better Caution, then the Confidence, we may repose in Him: But in the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e <hi>Reigns,</hi> of succeeding Ages, our Caution must be in <hi>Re,</hi> and not in <hi>Personâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) to this I answer; That as we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a <hi>Prince</hi> hereafter, less like to erre, in respect of his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: so again, we cannot expect a <hi>Prince,</hi> so like to exceed, (if I may so term it,) in this point of Beneficence, to that Nation, in respect of the Occasion. For whereas all <hi>Princes,</hi> and all Men are won, either by Merit, or Conversation, there is no Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that any of his <hi>Majesties Descendants,</hi> can have either of these Causes, of Bounty, towards that <hi>Nation,</hi> in so ample De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as his <hi>Majesty</hi> hath. And these be, the two <hi>Objections,</hi> which seemed to me most Materiall, why the <hi>Post-Nati,</hi> should be left free, and not be concluded, in the same Restrictions, with the <hi>Ante-Nati,</hi> whereunto you have heard the Answers.</p>
                  <p>The two Reasons, which I will use, on the other side, are brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly these. The one, being a Reason, of Common Sense; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Reason, of Estate. We see, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) the Time of the Nativity, is, in most Cases, principally regarded. In Nature, the Time of planting, and setting, is chiefly observed. And we see, the <hi>Astrologers,</hi> pretend to judge, of the Fortune of the Party, by the Time of the <hi>Nativity.</hi> In Lawes, we may, not unfitly, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, the Case of <hi>Legitimation,</hi> to the Case of <hi>Naturalization.</hi> For it is true, that the <hi>Common Canon Law,</hi> doth put the <hi>Ante-Natus,</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51170:27"/>
the <hi>Post-Natus,</hi> in one Degree; But when it was moved, to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England; Barones unâ voce responderunt, Nolumus Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Angliae mutare.</hi> And though, it must be confessed, that the <hi>Ante-Nati,</hi> and <hi>Post-Nati,</hi> are in the same Degree, in <hi>Dignities</hi>; yet were they never so, in <hi>Abilities</hi>: For no Man doubts, but the Son, of an <hi>Earl,</hi> or <hi>Baron,</hi> before his <hi>Creation,</hi> or <hi>Call,</hi> shall inherite the <hi>Dignity,</hi> as well as the Son born after.</p>
                  <p>But the Son, of an <hi>Attainted Person,</hi> born before the Attainder, shall not inherit, as the After born shall, notwithstanding <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Pardon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Estate</hi> is; That any Restriction, of the <hi>Ante-Nati,</hi> is Temporary; And expireth with this Generation: But if you you make it in the <hi>Post-Nati</hi> also, you do, but in substance, pen, a perpetuity of <hi>Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) in this point, I have been short, because I little expected this Doubt, as to point of Convenience: And there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore will not much labour, where I suppose, there is no greater Opposition.</p>

                     <hi>His Lordship,</hi> took the occasion, of this, which I shall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, upon the Answer, which was by us made, to the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, propounded, upon the <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Hostile Lawes</hi>; Quitting that <hi>Business,</hi> with these few words; That he would discharge, our Expectation of Reply, because their <hi>Lordships</hi> had, no Warrant
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51170:27"/>
to Dispute. Then, continuing his <hi>Speach,</hi> he fell into this other Cause, and said; That being now, to make Answer, to a proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ours, as we had done to one of theirs, he wished it could be passed over, with like Brevity. But he did foresee his way, that it would prove, not onely long, but likewise hard to find, and hard to keep; This Cause, being so to be carried, as above all, no wrong be done, to the <hi>Kings</hi> Soveraignty, and Authority; And in second place, no Misunderstanding do ensue between the two <hi>Houses.</hi> And therefore, that he hoped, his words should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a benign Interpretation; Knowing well, that pursuit, and Drift of Speech, and multitude of Matter, might breed words to pass from him, beyond the Compass of his Intention: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he placed more Assurance, and Caution, in the Innocency of his own meaning, and in the Experience of his Favours, then in any his Wariness, or Watchfulness, over his own Speech.</p>
                  <p>This respective preface used, <hi>his Lordship</hi> descended to the Matter it self; which he divided into three Considerations: For, he said, he would consider of the <hi>Petition.</hi>

                     <item>And thirdly, as from the <hi>Lower House,</hi> it was recommended to the <hi>Higher House.</hi>

                     </gap>iderations, there fell out naturally, a Subdivision, into the <hi>Persons</hi> of the Petitioners; And the Matter, and <hi>Parts,</hi> of the Petition. In the Persons of the <hi>Merchants,</hi> his <hi>Lordship</hi> made, (as I have collected them,) in number, eight Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations: whereof, the three first, respected the Generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Merchants</hi>; And the five following, were applyed, to the particular Circumstances, of the Merchants, now complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Lordships</hi> first, generall Observation, was; That <hi>Merchants</hi> were of two sorts: The one sought their Fortunes, (as the verse saith,) <hi>per Saxa, per Ignes</hi>: And, as it is said, in the same place, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremos currit Mercator ad Indos</hi>; Subjecting themselves, to Wether, and Tempest; To Absence, and, as it were, Exile, out of their Native Countreys; To Arrests, in Entrances of War; To For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Injustice, and Rigour, in times of Peace; And many other Sufferances, and Adventures. But that there were others, that took, a more safe, but a less generous Course, in raising their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. He taxed none, but did attribute, much more respect, to the former.</p>
                  <p>The second Generall <hi>Observation,</hi> which his <hi>Lordship</hi> made was, That the Complaints of <hi>Merchants,</hi> were, usually, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ubject, to much Errour; In regard, that they spake, (for the most part,) but upon Information; And that carried through many Hands; And of Matters done in Remote parts: So as, a false, or facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Factour, mought, oftentimes, make great Tragedies, upon no great Ground. Whereof, towards the End
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51170:28"/>
of his Speech, he brought an Instance, of one trading the <hi>Levant</hi>; That complained, of an Arrest of his Ship; And possessed the <hi>Counsell-Table,</hi> with the same Complaint, in a vehement, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fashion; Desiring, and pressing, some present, and Expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Letters, touching the same. Whereupon, some <hi>Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,</hi> well acquainted with the like Heates, and Forwardness, in Complaints, happened to say to him; Out of Conjecture, and not out of any Intelligence; <hi>What will you say, if your Ship, which you complain to be under Arrest, be now under Sail, in way homewards?</hi> Which fell out accordingly: The same Person, confessing, six dayes after, to the Lords, that she was indeed, in her way home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>The third generall <hi>Observation,</hi> which his <hi>Lordship</hi> made, was this, in Effect: That, although, he granted, that the Wealth, and Welfare of the <hi>Merchant,</hi> was not, without a Sympathy, with the generall Stock, and State of a <hi>Nation,</hi> especially an <hi>Island</hi>; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, it was a Thing, too familiar, with the <hi>Merchant,</hi> to make the Case of his Particular Profit, the publick Case of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There follow, the particular <hi>Observations,</hi> which have a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and application, to the <hi>Merchants,</hi> that trade to <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Levant.</hi> Wherein his <hi>Lordship,</hi> did first, honourably, and tenderly, acknowledge, that their <hi>Grievances</hi> were great, That they did multiply; And that they do deserve, compassion, and help; But yet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For since the Dissolving of the <hi>Company,</hi> which was termed the <hi>Monopoly</hi>; And was set free, by the speciall Instance, of this <hi>House</hi>; There hath followed, such a Confusion, and Relaxation, in Order, and Government, amongst them; As they do not onely incur, many Inconveniences; And commit many Errours; But in the pursuites, of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and suites, they do it so impolitiquely, and after such a Fashion; As Except, <hi>Legier Embassadours,</hi> (which are the Eyes, of Kings, in forrain Parts,) should leave their Centinell, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Merchants Factours,</hi> and Sollicitours, their Causes can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prosper. And, which is more, such is now the Confusion, in the Trade; As Shop Keepers, and Handy-Crafts-Men, become <hi>Merchants</hi> there; Who being bound, to no Orders, seek base means, by Gifts, and Bribery, to procure favours, at the Hands, of Officers there. So as the honest <hi>Merchant,</hi> that trades like a substantiall <hi>Merchant</hi>; And loves not to take Servile Courses, to buy the Right due to him, by the Amity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, his <hi>Lordship</hi> did observe, some Improbability, that the wrongs should be so great, considering Trading, into those parts, was never greater; <hi>whereas</hi> if the wrongs, and griefs, were so intollerable, and continuall, as they propound them; It would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51170:28"/>
work, rather, a generall Discouragement, and Coldness, of Trade, in <hi>Fact</hi>; Then an earnest, and hot Complaint, in <hi>Words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his <hi>Lordship</hi> did observe; That it is a Course, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>Fourthly, his <hi>Lordship</hi> did observe; In the manner, of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their <hi>Petition,</hi> they had inverted due order; Addressing themselves, to the <hi>Foot,</hi> and not to the <hi>Head.</hi> For considering, that they prayed, no new Law, for their Relief; And that, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, Matter of Inducement, to <hi>War,</hi> or <hi>Peace</hi>; They ought, to have begun, with his <hi>Majesty,</hi> unto whose Royall Judgement, Power, and Office, did properly belong, the discerning of that, which was desired; The putting in Act of that, which mought be granted; And the Thanks for that, which mought be obtained.</p>

                     </gap>fthly, his <hi>Lordship</hi> did observe; That, as they had not prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their <hi>Petition</hi> as it should be; So, they had not pursued their own Direction, as it was. For, having directed their <hi>Petition</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> the Lords spirituall, and Temporall, and the Commons in Parliament assembled; It imported, as if they had offered the like Petition, to the Lords; which they never did; Contrary, Not onely, to their own Direction, but, likewise, to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt; who presupposed, (as it should seem, by some Speech, that passed from us, at a former Conference;) That they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, severall <hi>Petitions,</hi> of like tenour, to both <hi>Houses.</hi> So, have you now, those eight <hi>Observations,</hi> part Generall, part Speciall, which his Lordship; made touching the <hi>Persons</hi> of those, which exhibited the <hi>Petition,</hi> and the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the same.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Matter,</hi> of the <hi>Petition,</hi> it self, his Lordship made this <hi>Division</hi>; That it consisteth of three parts.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>First, of the Complaints, of wrongs, in Fact.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, of the Complaints, of wrongs, in Law; As they may be truly termed; That is, of the Inequality of Lawes, which do regulate the Trade.</item>
                     <item>And thirdly, the <hi>Remedy</hi> desired, by Letters of <hi>Mart.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The <hi>wrongs,</hi> in <hi>Fact,</hi> receive a locall Distribution, of three. In the Trade to <hi>Spain</hi>; In the Trade to the <hi>West<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Trade</hi> to <hi>Spain:</hi> Although <hi>his Lordship</hi> did use, much signification, of Compassion, of the Injuries, which the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51170:29"/>
                     <hi>Merchants</hi> received; And attributed so much, to their Profession, and Estate; As from such a mouth in such a Presence, they ought to receive, for a great deal, of Honour, and Comfort; (which Kind of Demonstration, he did enterlace, throughout <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is whole Speech, as proceeding, <hi>Ex Abundantiâ Cordis,</hi>) yet, nevertheless, he did remember four <hi>Excusations,</hi> or rather <hi>Extenuations,</hi> of those <hi>wrongs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>The first was, that the <hi>Injustices,</hi> complained of, were not in the Highest Degree; Because, they were Delayes, and hard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and not Inique Sentences, or definitive Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Wherein I called to mind, what I heard a great <hi>Bishop,</hi> say; That <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> though they did not turn <hi>Iustice</hi> into <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> by <hi>Corruption</hi>; yet, they turned it, into Vinegar, by Delaies, which sowred it. Such a Difference did his <hi>Lordship</hi> make, which, no question, is a Difference, <hi>secundum Magis, &amp; Minus.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Secondly, his <hi>Lordship</hi> ascribed these <hi>Delayes,</hi> not so much to Mallice, or Alienation of Mind, towards us; As to the Nature, of the People, and Nation; which is Proud, and therefore Dilato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: For all proud Men are full of <hi>Delayes,</hi> and must be waited on; And specially, to the Multitudes, and Diversities, of Tribunals, and places of justice; And the Number of the Kings Counsels, full of <hi>Referrings,</hi> which ever prove, of necessity, to be Defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; Besides, the great Distance of Territories. All which, have made, the Delayes, of <hi>Spain,</hi> to come into a Byword, through the <hi>World.</hi> Wherein, I think, his <hi>Lordship</hi> might allude, to the <hi>Proverb</hi> of <hi>Italy; Me Venga la Morte di Spagna. Let my Death come from Spain:</hi> For then, it is sure, to be long a comming.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, his <hi>Lordship</hi> did use, an Extenuation of these wrongs, drawn from the Nature of Man; (<hi>Nemo subitò fingitur:</hi>) For that, we must make an account; That, though the Fire of Enmity, be out, between <hi>Spain,</hi> and us, yet it vapoureth: The utter Extinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, must be the work of Time.</item>
                     <item>But lastly, his <hi>Lordship</hi> did fall, upon that Extenuation, which of all the rest, was must forcible; which was; That many of these <hi>wrongs,</hi> were not sustained, without some Aspersion, of the <hi>Merchants</hi> own Fault, in ministring the Occasion, which grew chiefly in this manner.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>There is contained, an <hi>Article,</hi> in the <hi>Treaty,</hi> between <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>us</hi>; That, we shall not transport, any Native Commodities, of the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> into <hi>Spain:</hi> Nay more, that we shall not transport, any <hi>Opificia; Manufactures,</hi> of the same <hi>Countreys.</hi> So that, if an English Cloath, take but a Dye, in the <hi>Low Countryes,</hi> it may not be transported by the <hi>English:</hi> And the Reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause even those <hi>Manufactures,</hi> although the Materiall come from other Places, do yield unto them, a Profit and Sustentation, in regard their People are set on work by them: They have a gain, likewise, in the Price; And they have, a Custome, in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting. All which, the Pollicy of <hi>Spain,</hi> is, to debar them of;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51170:29"/>
Being no less desirous, to Suffocate the <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> then to reduce their <hi>Obedience.</hi> This <hi>Article,</hi> the <hi>English Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi> either doth not, or will not, understand: But being drawn, with his threefold Cord, of Love, Hate, and Gain; They do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, to transport, the <hi>Low-Countrey</hi> Commodities, of these natures; And so, draw upon themselves, these Arrests, and Troubles.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Trade,</hi> to the <hi>Indies</hi>; His Lordship did discover unto us, the state of it, to be thus. The Pollicy of <hi>Spain,</hi> doth keep that Treasury of theirs, under such Lock, and Key, as both Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, yea, and Subjects, are excluded, of Trade, into those Countries.: Insomuch as the <hi>French King,</hi> who hath reason to stand, upon equall termes, with <hi>Spain,</hi> yet nevertheless, is, by expresse Capitulation, debarred. The <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> whom the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> hath studied, by all means, to content, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise debarred: Such a <hi>vigilant Dragon</hi> is there, that keepeth this <hi>Golden Fleece</hi>: yet neverthelesse, such was his <hi>Majesties</hi> Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in the Debate, and Conclu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion, of the last Treaty; As he would never condiscend, to any Article, importing the Exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> from that <hi>Trade:</hi> As a <hi>Prince,</hi> that would not acknowledge, that any such Right, could grow, to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the <hi>Donative,</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi>; whose Authority he Disclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: Or by the Title, of a dispersed, and punctuall Occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of certain Territories, in the name of the rest: But stood firm, to reserve that point, in full Question, to further Times, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions. So as it is left, by the Treaty, in Suspence, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred, nor permitted. The Tenderness, and Point of Honour whereof, was such, as they, that went thither, must run their own Perill. Nay further, his <hi>Lordship affirmed</hi>; That if yet, at this time, his Majesty would descend, to a Course of Entreaty, for the release, of the <hi>Arrests,</hi> in those parts, And so confess an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion; And quit the point of Honour; his <hi>Majesty,</hi> mought have them, forthwith released: And yet his <hi>Lordship</hi> added; That the Offences, and Scandalls, of some, had made this point worse then it was: In regard, that this very last <hi>Voyage</hi> to <hi>Virginia,</hi> intended for <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Plantation</hi>; Where the Spaniard, hath no People, nor Possession, is already become inflamed for <hi>Pyracy.</hi> Witness <hi>Bingley,</hi> who first, insinuating his purpose, to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, in that worthy Action, of Enlarging <hi>Trade,</hi> and <hi>Plantation,</hi> is become a <hi>Pyrate</hi>; And hath been so pursued, as his Ship, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>Ireland,</hi> though his Person, is not yet in hold.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Trade,</hi> to the <hi>Levant</hi>; His <hi>Lordship</hi> opened unto us, that the Complaint consisted, in effect, but of two Particulars: The one, touching the Arrest of a <hi>Ship,</hi> called the <hi>Triall,</hi> in <hi>Sicely</hi>; The other, of a <hi>Ship,</hi> called the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> in <hi>Sardinia.</hi> The First, of which <hi>Arrests,</hi> was, upon pretence, of <hi>Pyracy:</hi> The Second, upon pretence, of carrying <hi>Ordnance,</hi> and <hi>Powder,</hi> to the <hi>Turk.</hi> That <hi>Processe,</hi> concerning the <hi>Triall,</hi> hath been, at the <hi>Merchants</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51170:30"/>
drawn to a Review, in <hi>Spain</hi>; which is a Favour, of excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rare President; Being directly, against the Liberties, &amp; Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of <hi>Sicely.</hi> That of the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> notwithstanding it be of that nature, as, (if it should be true,) tendeth, to the great Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of our Nation: (whereof, Hold hath been already taken, by the <hi>French Ambassadour,</hi> residing at <hi>Constantinople</hi>; Who entred, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Scandalous Expostulation, with his <hi>Majesties Ambassadour</hi> there, upon that, and the like, Transportations, of Munition, to the <hi>Turk</hi>); yet neverthelesse, there is an Answer given, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, from the <hi>Kings, Ambassadour Legier,</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>; That there shall be, some Course taken, to give reasonable Contentment, in that Cause, as far as may be: In both which <hi>Ships,</hi> (to speak tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) the greatest Mass, of loss, may be included: For the rest are mean, in respect of the value, of those two Vessels. And thus much his <hi>Lordship Speech</hi> comprehended, concerning the <hi>wrongs</hi> in <hi>Fact.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Wrongs,</hi> in <hi>Law</hi>; That is to say; the <hi>Rigour</hi> of the <hi>Spanish Lawes,</hi> extended upon his <hi>Majesties Subjects,</hi> that traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique thither, his <hi>Lordship</hi> gave this Answer. That they were no new <hi>Statutes,</hi> or <hi>Edicts,</hi> devised for our <hi>People,</hi> or our <hi>Times</hi>; But were the ancient Lawes, of that <hi>Kingdome: Suus cuique Mos.</hi> And therefore, as Travellers, must endure the Extremities, of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and Temper of the Air, where they travell: So <hi>Merchants,</hi> must bear with the Extremities, of the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and Temper of the <hi>Estate,</hi> where they trade. Whereunto his <hi>Lordship</hi> added; that our own <hi>Lawes,</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> were not exempted, from the like Complaints, in Forrain Parts; Especially, in point, of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Causes, &amp; Depredations; And that same swift Alteration, of Property, which is claimed by the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> in case of Goods, taken, in <hi>Pyrates</hi> hands. But that, we were to understand, thus much, of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spains</hi> Care, and Regard, of our <hi>Nation</hi>; That he had written, his Letters, to all <hi>Corrigidors, Officers</hi> of <hi>

                        </gap>orts,</hi> and other his <hi>Ministers</hi>; Declaring his will, and pleasure, to have his <hi>Majesties Subjects,</hi> used, with all Freedome, and Favour: And with this Addition, that they should have more Favour, when it might be shewed, then any other. Which words, howsoever the Effects prove, are not suddainly to be requited, with peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Resolutions, till Time declare, the direct Issue.</p>
                  <p>For the third Part, of the <hi>Matter,</hi> of the Petition; which was, the <hi>Remedy,</hi> sought by <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Mart</hi>; His <hi>Lordship</hi> seemed desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to make us capable, of the Inconvenience, of that, which was desired, by setting, before us, two notable <hi>Exceptions</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: The one, that the <hi>Remedy,</hi> was utterly incompetent, and vain: There other, that it was dangerous, and pernicious, to our <hi>Merchants</hi>; And, in Consequence, to the whole <hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>weaknesse,</hi> of the <hi>Remedy</hi>; His Lordship, wished us, to enter into Consideration, what the <hi>Remedy</hi> was, which the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, (which, was now sought, to be put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51170:30"/>
gave, in this Case; which was thus: That the Party grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, should first complain, to the Keeper, of the private Seal; And from him, should take Letters unto the Party, that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Spoyl, for Restitution. And in default of Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be made upon such <hi>Letters,</hi> served; Then, to obtain of the <hi>Chanceller, Letters</hi> of <hi>Mart,</hi> or <hi>Reprisall</hi>: which Circuit of <hi>Remedy,</hi> promised nothing, but endlesse, and fruitless, Delay; In regard that the first Degree prescribed, was never likely to be effected: It being so wilde a Chace, as to serve Processe, upon the wrong-Doer, in Forrain Parts. Wherefore his <hi>Lordship</hi> said, that it must be, the <hi>Remedy</hi> of <hi>Statute,</hi> that must do good, in this case: which useth to proceed, by Certificats, Attestations, and other means of Information; Not depending upon a privy Seal, to be served upon the Party, whom happily they must seek out, in the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Danger,</hi> of the <hi>Remedy</hi>; His <hi>Lordship</hi> directed our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, to take notice, of the proportions, of the <hi>Merchants</hi> Goods, in either <hi>Kingdome:</hi> As that the Stock, of Goods, of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which is within his <hi>Majesties</hi> Power, and Distresse, is a Trifle: Whereas the Stock of <hi>English</hi> Goods, in <hi>Spain,</hi> is a Masse, of mighty value. So as, if this Course, of <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Mart,</hi> should be taken, to satisfie, a few hot Pursuitours, here; All the Goods, of the <hi>English</hi> Subjects, in <hi>Spain,</hi> shall be exposed, to Seisure, and Arrest; And we have little, or nothing, in our Hands, on this side, to mend our selves upon. And thus much, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) is that, which I have collected, out of that excellent <hi>Speech,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the First main part which was; The <hi>Consideration,</hi> of the <hi>Petition</hi> as it proceeded, from the <hi>Merchant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There followeth now, the <hi>Second Part</hi>; Considering the <hi>Petition,</hi> as it was offered in this <hi>House.</hi> Wherein his <hi>Lordship</hi>; after an affectionate Commemoration, of the Gravity, Capacity, and Duty, which he generally found, in the proceedings of this <hi>House</hi>; desired us, neverthelesse, to consider with him, how it was possible, that the Entertaining of <hi>Petitions,</hi> concerning private <hi>Injuries,</hi> and of this <hi>Nature,</hi> could avoid, these three <hi>Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> The First, of <hi>Injustice</hi>; The Second, of Derogation, from his <hi>Majesties</hi> supreme, and absolute Power, of concluding, <hi>Warre,</hi> or Peace; And the Third, of some prejudice, in reason of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Injustice,</hi> it is plain, and cannot be denied, that we hear but the one Part: Whereas that <hi>Rule, Audi alteram Partem,</hi> is not, of the Formality, but of the Essence, of <hi>Iustice</hi>: Which is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore figured, with <hi>both Eyes shut,</hi> and <hi>both Eares open.</hi> Because, she should hear both sides, and respect Neither: So that, if we should hap, to give, a right Judgement, it mought be <hi>Iustum,</hi> but not <hi>Iustè,</hi> without hearing both <hi>Parties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Point of <hi>Derogation</hi>; his <hi>Lordship</hi> said; He knew well, we were no lesse ready, to acknowledge, then Himself; That

                  <p>In the 4th. year of <hi>King Edward</hi> the <hi>Third</hi>; The <hi>Commons</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned; That the <hi>King</hi> would enter, into certain Covenants, and Capitulations, with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Brabant</hi>: In which <hi>Petition,</hi> there was also inserted, somewhat touching a <hi>Money Matter.</hi> The <hi>Kings</hi> Answer was; That for that, that concerned the <hi>Moneys,</hi> they mought handle it, and examine it; But touching the <hi>Peace,</hi> he would do, as to himself seemed good.</p>
                  <p>In the 18th. year, of <hi>King Edward</hi> the <hi>Third</hi>; The <hi>Commons</hi> peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that they might have, the Triall, and proceeding, with certain <hi>Merchants Strangers,</hi> as <hi>Enemies</hi> to the <hi>State.</hi> The <hi>Kings</hi> Answer was; <hi>It should remain, as it did, till the King had taken fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order.</hi>

                  <p>In the 2d. year of <hi>King Richard the second,</hi> the <hi>Merchants</hi> of the Seacoast, did complaine, of diverse spoiles upon their Shipps, and Goods, by the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The <hi>Kings</hi> Answer was, that with the Advise of his Councell, he would procure remedy.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Lordship</hi> cited two other Presidents; The one in the second yeare, of <hi>King Henry the Fourth</hi>; of a <hi>Petition,</hi> Against the <hi>Merchants</hi> of <hi>Genova:</hi> The other, in the 11th. yeare, of <hi>King Henry</hi> the 6th; Of a <hi>Petition,</hi> against the <hi>Merchants,</hi> of the <hi>Stilliard</hi>; which I omit, because they contain, no variety of Answer.</p>

                     </gap> that sometimes, <hi>Parliaments</hi> have been made acquainted, with Matter of <hi>Warr,</hi> and Peace, in a generallity; But it was, upon one of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hese Two Motives: When the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Counsell,</hi> conceived; That either it was Materiall, to have some Declaration, of the zeal, and Affection, of the <hi>People:</hi> Or else, when the <hi>King</hi> needed, to demand <hi>Moneys,</hi> and <hi>Aides,</hi> for the Charge, of the <hi>Warrs:</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if Things did sort to <hi>Warre,</hi> we were sure enough, to hear of it.

                  <p>Now, (Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) for the last part; Wherein, his <hi>Lordship,</hi> considered the <hi>Petition,</hi> As it was, recommended from us, to the upper House; His <hi>Lordship</hi> delivered, thus much, from their <hi>Lor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or his <hi>Majesties</hi> Service, when it should be blown abroad;) Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I say, then that we did, in any sort, determine, by this their Overture, to do that wrong to his <hi>Highness</hi> Supreme Power; Which happily, might be inferred, by those, that were rather apt to make evill, then good Illations, of our proceeding. And yet, that their <hi>Lordships,</hi> for the reasons, before made, most plainly tell us; That they neither could, nor would, concur with us, nor approve the course. And therefore concluded; That it would not be amiss, for us, for our better Contentment, to behold the Conditions, of the last <hi>Peace</hi> with <hi>Spain,</hi> which were, of a strange nature, to him that duely observes them; No <hi>Forces</hi> recalled, out of the <hi>Low-Conntries</hi>; No new <hi>Forces,</hi> (as to <hi>Voluntaries</hi>) restrained to go thither: So as the <hi>King,</hi> may be in peace, and never a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but may be in <hi>War</hi>: And then, to think thus with our selves; That that <hi>King,</hi> which would give no ground, in

                  <p>And thus (Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) have I passed over, the <hi>Speech,</hi> of this worthy <hi>Lord</hi>; whose <hi>Speeches</hi> (as I have often said,) in regard of his place, and Judgement, are extraordinary Lights, to this <hi>House</hi>; And have both the properties of <hi>Light</hi>; That is <hi>Conducting,</hi> and <hi>Comforting.</hi> And although (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker</hi>) a Man would have thought, nothing had been left, to be said; Yet I shall now, give you account, of another <hi>Speech,</hi> full of excellent Matter, and Ornaments; And without Iteration. Which, neverthelesse, I shall report, more compendiously; Because, I will not offer the <hi>Speech,</hi> that wrong, as to report it at large, when your minds per-case, and Attentions, are already wearied.</p>
                  <p>The other <hi>Earl,</hi> who, usually, doth bear a principall part, upon all important Occasions; used a <hi>Speech,</hi> first of <hi>Preface,</hi> then of <hi>Argument.</hi> In his <hi>Preface,</hi> he did deliver, that he was perswaded, that both <hi>Houses</hi> did differ, rather in <hi>Credulity,</hi> and Belief, then in Intention, and Desire. For it mought be, their <hi>Lorships,</hi> did not believe, the Information so far, but yet desired, the Reformation as much.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Lordship</hi> said further<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that the <hi>Merchant</hi> was a State, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of persons; Not only to be respected, but to be prayed for; And graced them, with the best Additions: That they were, the Convoyes, of our supplies; The Vents of our Abundance; <hi>Neptunes</hi> Almesmen; and Fortunes Adventurers. His <hi>Lordship,</hi> proceeded, and said; This <hi>Question,</hi> was new to us, but antient to them: Assuring us, that the <hi>King,</hi> did not beare, in vaine, the Devise of the <hi>Thistle,</hi> with the word; <hi>Nemo me lasce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For the <hi>Arguments,</hi> or <hi>Reasons,</hi> they were Five in number, which his <hi>Lordship</hi> used, for satisfying us, why their <hi>Lordships,</hi> might not concur with us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in this <hi>Petition.</hi> The first was, the Composition of our <hi>House</hi>; which he took, in the first foundation thereof, to be meerly <hi>Democraticall</hi>; Consisting, of <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Shires,</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses</hi> of <hi>Townes</hi>; And intended to be of those, that have their Residence, Vocation, and Employment, in the places, for which they serve: And therefore, to have a private, and locall wisedom, according to that Compasse; And so, not fit, to examine, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Estate</hi>

                     </gap> which depend, upon such Variety, of Circumstances; And therefore, added, to the President, formerly vouched, of the 17. of <hi>King Richard</hi> the 2d; When the <hi>Commons</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:51170:33"/>
disclaimed, to intermeddle, in matter of <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi>; That their Answer was, that they would not presume, to treat, of so high, and variable a Matter. And although, his <hi>Lordship</hi> acknowledged; That there be divers Gentlemen, in the Mixture, of our <hi>House</hi>; That are of good Capacity, and Insight, in Matters of Estate; yet that was the Accident of the <hi>Person,</hi> and not the Intentention of the place. And Things were to be taken, in the <hi>Institution,</hi> not in the <hi>Practice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Lordships</hi> second <hi>Reason,</hi> was; That both, by <hi>Philosophy, and Civill Law, Ordinatio Belli, &amp; pacis, est absoluti Imperij</hi>; A principall <hi>Flower</hi> of the <hi>Crown.</hi> Which <hi>Flowers,</hi> ought to be so dear unto us, as we ought, if need were, to water them with our <hi>Blood.</hi> For if those <hi>Flowers,</hi> should, by neglect, or upon facility, and good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, wither, and fall, the Garland would not be worth the wearing.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Lordships</hi> third <hi>Reason was</hi>; That <hi>Kings,</hi> did so love, to imitate <hi>Trimum Mobile,</hi> as that, they do not like, to move in borrowed Motions: So that, in those things, that they do, most willingly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; yet they indure not, to be prevented, by Request. Whereof he did alledge, a notable Example, in <hi>King Edward</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. who would not hearken, to the <hi>Petition</hi> of his <hi>Commons,</hi> that besought him, to make the <hi>Black Prince, Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales.</hi> But yet, after that Repulse, of their <hi>Petition,</hi> out of his own meer Motion, he created him.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Lordships</hi> fourth <hi>Reason,</hi> was; That it mought be some scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, to step, between the <hi>King,</hi> and his own <hi>Vertue</hi>: And that it was the Duty of <hi>Subjects</hi>; Rather, to take honours, from <hi>Kings</hi> Servants, and give them to <hi>Kings</hi>; then to take honours from <hi>Kings,</hi> and give them to their Servants: Which, he did, very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, set forth, in the Example of <hi>Ioab</hi>; who lying at the <hi>Siege</hi> of <hi>Rabbah</hi>; And finding, it could not hold out; writ to <hi>David,</hi> to come, and take the Honour, of taking the Town.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Lordships</hi> last <hi>Reason</hi> was, that it cast some aspersion upon his <hi>Majesty</hi>; Implying, as if the <hi>King,</hi> slept, out the <hi>Sobbs</hi> of his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> untill he was awaked, with the <hi>Thunderbolt</hi> of a <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But his <hi>Lordships Couclusion,</hi> was very Noble; Which was, with a Protestation; That what Civill Threats, Contestation, Art, and Argument, can do, hath been used, already, to procure <hi>Remedy,</hi> in this Cause: And a Promise; That if <hi>Reason,</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as their <hi>Lordships</hi> were ready, to spend their Breath, in the pleading, of that we desire: so they would be ready, to spend their Blouds, in the Execution thereof.</p>
                  <p>This was the <hi>Resolution,</hi> of that which passed.</p>

Now we hope, to find, and feel, the Effects of your Goodness, in your Gracious Answer, to these our <hi>Petitions.</hi> For this we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that the <hi>Attribute,</hi> which was given, by one of the wisest Writers, to Two, of the best <hi>Emperours; Divus Nerva, &amp; Divus Traianus</hi>; (So saith <hi>Tacitus,</hi>) <hi>Res olim insociabiles miscuerunt, Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, &amp; Libertatem</hi>; May be truly applyed, to your <hi>Majesty.</hi> For never was there, such a Conservatour of <hi>Regality,</hi> in a <hi>Crown</hi>; Nor never, such a <hi>Protectour,</hi> of lawfull Freedome, in a <hi>Subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Onely this, (<hi>Excellent Soveraign,</hi>) Let not the sound of <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,</hi> (though it be sad,) seem harsh, to your Princely Eares: It is but <hi>Gemitus Columbae</hi>; The <hi>Mourning of a Dove</hi>; With that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Humility of Heart, which appertaineth, to loving and Loyall <hi>Subjects.</hi> And far be it from us; But that, in the midst, of the Sense, of our Grievances, we should remember, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the infinite Benefits, which by your <hi>Majesty,</hi> next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>God,</hi> we do enjoy; Which bind us, to wish unto your life, Fulness of Dayes; And unto your <hi>Line Royall,</hi> a Succession, and Continuance, even unto the worlds end.</p>
                  <p>It resteth, that unto these <hi>Petitions,</hi> here included, I do adde one more, that goeth to them all: Which is; That if, in the words, and frame, of them, there be any Thing offensive; Or that we have expressed our Selves, otherwise then we should, or would; That your <hi>Majesty</hi> would cover it, and cast the Vaile,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51170:34"/>
of your Grace upon it; And accept of our good Intentions; And help them, by your benign Interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I am, most humbly, to crave, a particular pardon, for my self, that have used these few words; And scarcely, should have been able, to have used any at all, in respect of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which I bear, to your Person, and Judgement, had I not been somewhat relieved, and comforted, by the Experience, which in my Service, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And first, in generall, we acknowledge, that this <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures,</hi> was Planted, into the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> by the ancient common <hi>Law</hi> of this <hi>Land:</hi> That it hath been Fenced in, and Preserved, by many <hi>Statutes</hi>; And that it yieldeth, at this day, to the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Fruit,</hi> of a great <hi>Revenue.</hi> But yet notwithstanding, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Stemme,</hi> of this Tree, may be raised a <hi>Pillar,</hi> of support to the <hi>Crown,</hi> Permanent, and durable as the <hi>Marble,</hi> by investing the <hi>Crown,</hi> with a more ample, more certain, and more loving, Dowry, then this of <hi>Tenures,</hi> we hope we propound no Matter of Disservice.</p>

                  <p>First, I say, let us see, how it concerns the <hi>King,</hi> and then how it concerns <hi>Us?</hi> For the <hi>King</hi>; certainly, if it be observed, it cannot be denyed, but if you may not receive his pleasure, by his <hi>Repre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In these Cases, if their <hi>Councells</hi> may not supply their Persons, to what infinite Accidents, do you expose them? N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the other point, of <hi>weakning</hi> the <hi>Councel:</hi> you know they are nothing, without the <hi>King.</hi> They are no <hi>Body Politique:</hi> They have no <hi>Commission</hi> under <hi>Seal.</hi> So as, if you begin, to distinguish, and disjoyn them, from the <hi>King,</hi> they are <hi>Corpus Opacum</hi>; For they have <hi>Lumen de Lumine</hi>; And so, by distinguishing, you extinguish, the principle Engine, of the <hi>Estate.</hi> For it is truly affirmed; That <hi>Cousilium non habet po estatem delega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

their Warrant. And therefore, I conclude, that, in this point, there can be, unto us, neither Disgrace, nor Disadvantage.</p>
                  <p>For the Point, of the <hi>Speaker.</hi> First, on the <hi>Kings</hi> Part, it may have a shrewd Illation: For it hath a shew, as if, there could be a stronger Duty, then the Duty, of a <hi>Subject,</hi> to a <hi>King.</hi> We see, the Degrees, and Differences, of Duties, in Families, between <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Son</hi>; <hi>Master,</hi> and <hi>Servant</hi>; In Corporate Bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Communalties, and their Officers; Recorders, Stewards, and the like; yet all these, give place, to the <hi>Kings</hi> commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Bonds are more speciall, but not so Forcible. On our Part, it concerns us nothing. For first it is, but <hi>de Canali,</hi> of the Pipe; How the <hi>Kings</hi> Message shall be conveyed to us, and not of the Matter. Neither hath the <hi>Speaker,</hi> any such Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; As that, comming out of his mouth, it presseth us more, then out of a <hi>Privy Councellours.</hi> Nay, it seems to be, a great Trust, of the <hi>Kings,</hi> towards the <hi>House</hi>; When the <hi>King,</hi> doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is one use of wit, to make clear Things Doubtfull; But it is a much better, use of wit, to make Doubtfull Things clear; And to that, I would, Men would bend themselves.</p>

                  <p>First, because, (to be plain with you,) I did not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, what it meant, or what it was; And, I do not love, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer at that, that I do not throughly conceive. That Private Men, should <hi>undertake,</hi> for the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi>: Why? A Man mought as well undertake, for the four <hi>Elements:</hi> It is a thing, so giddy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and so vast, as cannot enter, into the Brain, of a sober Man. And specially, in a new <hi>Parliament</hi>; When, it was impossible to know, who should be of the <hi>Parliament</hi>; And when all Men, that know never so little, the Constitution of this <hi>House,</hi> do know it to be so open to Reason; As Men, do not know, when they enter into these Dores, what mind themselves will be of, untill they hear Things argued, and debated. Much lesse, can any Man make, a pollicy, of Assurance; what Ship, shall come safe home, into the Harbour, in these Seas. I had heard, of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,</hi> in severall kinds: There were <hi>undertakers,</hi> for the Plantations, of <hi>Derry,</hi> and <hi>Colerane,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the better to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and bridle, those Parts: There were, not long ago, some <hi>undertakers,</hi> for the <hi>North-West Passage.</hi> And now, there are some <hi>undertakers,</hi> for the Project, of <hi>Died,</hi> and <hi>Dressed, Cloaths.</hi> And, in short, every Novelty useth to be strengthened, and made
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51170:37"/>
good, by a kind of <hi>undertaking.</hi> But, for the Ancient <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which moves, in a certain Manner, and Sphear; To be <hi>undertaken,</hi> it passes my reach, to conceive, what it should be. Must we be all <hi>Died,</hi> and <hi>Dressed</hi>; And no pure <hi>Whites</hi> amongst us? Or must there be, a new passage found, for the <hi>Kings Business,</hi> by a point of the <hi>Compass,</hi> that was never <hi>sailed</hi> by, before? Or must there be, some <hi>Forts</hi> built, in this <hi>House,</hi> that may command, and contain the rest? (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker</hi>) I know, but two <hi>Forts,</hi> in this <hi>House,</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> ever hath; The <hi>Fort</hi> of <hi>Affection,</hi> and the <hi>Fort</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi>; The one, Commands the <hi>Hearts,</hi> and the other, Commands the <hi>Heads</hi>; And others, I know none.

                  <p>The second <hi>Reason,</hi> that made me silent, was, because this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> And such a Thing, do I take, this <hi>Rumour</hi> to be.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, when that the <hi>King,</hi> had in his two severall <hi>speeches,</hi> freed us, from the main of our Fears, In affirming, directly, that there was no <hi>undertaking</hi> to him; And that, he would have taken it, to be no less derogation, to his own <hi>Majesty,</hi> then to our Merits; To have the Acts, of his people, transferred, to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; That did quiet me, thus far; That these Vapours, were not gone up to the <hi>Head,</hi> howsoever, they might glow, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuate, in the <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse, since I perceive, that this Cloud, still hangs over the <hi>House</hi>; And that it may do hurt, as well in Fame abroad, as in the <hi>Kings</hi> Eare, I resolved with my self, to do the part, of an honest voice, in this <hi>House,</hi> to counsell you, what I think, to be for the best.</p>
                  <p>Wherein first, I will speak plainly, of the pernicious Effects of the Accident, of this Brute, and Opinion, of <hi>undertaking</hi>; To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Particulars</hi>; Towards the <hi>House</hi>; Towards the <hi>King</hi>; And wards the <hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I will tell you, in Mine Opinion, what <hi>undertaking,</hi> is tolerable; And how far, it may be justified, with a good mind; And on the other side, this same Ripping up, of the <hi>Question,</hi> of <hi>Vndertakers</hi>; How far it may proceed, from a good Mind; And in what kind, it may be thought Malicious, and Dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I will shew you, my poor advice, what Meanes there are, to put an end, to this Question of <hi>Vndertaking</hi>; Not falling, for the present, upon a precise Opinion; But breaking it, how many wayes there be, by which you may get out of it; And lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51170:38"/>
the choice of them, to a <hi>Debate,</hi> at the <hi>Committee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Lastly, I will advise you, how things, are to be handled, at the <hi>Commitee,</hi> to avoid distraction, and losse of Time.</p>
                  <p>For the First of these, I can say to you, but as the Scripure saith, <hi>Si invicem mordetis, ab invicem consumemini.</hi> If ye Fret, and Gall, one anothers Reputation; The end will be, that every Man shall go hence, like <hi>Coyn</hi> cried down; Of lesse price, than he came hither. If some, shall be thought, to fawn upon the <hi>Kings</hi> Business openly; And others, to crosse it secretly; Some shall be thought <hi>Practicers,</hi> that would pluck the Cardes; And others, shall be thought <hi>Papists,</hi> that would shuffle the Cardes; what a Misery is this, that we should come together, to foul one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, instead of procuring the publick good?</p>
                  <p>And this ends not in particulars, but will make, the whole <hi>House,</hi> Contemptible: For now, I hear Men say; That this Question, of <hi>undertaking,</hi> is the predominant Matter of this <hi>House.</hi> So that we are now, according to the <hi>Parable</hi> of <hi>Iotham,</hi> in the Case, of the <hi>Trees</hi> of the <hi>Forrest</hi>; That when Question was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Vine</hi> should <hi>raign</hi> over them? That mought not be: And whether the <hi>Olive</hi> should <hi>raign</hi> over them? That mought not be; But we have accepted the <hi>Bramble,</hi> to <hi>raign</hi> over us. For it seemes, that the good <hi>Vine,</hi> of the <hi>Kings Graces,</hi> that is not so much in esteem: And the good Oyle, whereby we should salve, and relieve, the wants, of the Estate, and Crown, that is laid aside too: And this <hi>Bramble,</hi> of <hi>Contention,</hi> and <hi>Emulation</hi>; This <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> which (as was truly said, by an understanding Gentleman,) is a <hi>Bastard:</hi> (For every Fame, that wants a Head, is <hi>Filius popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi>;) This must <hi>Raign,</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> amongst us.</p>
                  <p>Then for the <hi>King</hi> nothing can be more opposite, <hi>Ex diametro,</hi> to his Ends and Hopes, then this. For you have heard him profess like a <hi>King</hi>; and like a <hi>gracious King,</hi> that he doth not, so much, respect, his present supply; As this demonstration, that the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> Hearts are more knit to him, then before. Now then, if the Issue shall be this, that whatsoever shall be done for Him, shall be thought to be done, but by a number of Persons, that shall be laboured, and packt; This will rather be a sign of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Alienation, then of a naturall Benevolence, and Affection, in his People, at home; And rather Matter, of Disrepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then of Honour, abroad. So that to speak plainly to you; The <hi>King</hi> were better call, for a new Pair of Cards, then play upon these, if they be packt.</p>
                  <p>And then for the <hi>People</hi>; It is my manner, ever, to look, as well beyond a <hi>Parliament,</hi> as upon a <hi>Parliament</hi>; And if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, shall think themselves, betrayed by those, that are their <hi>Deputies,</hi> and <hi>Atturnies</hi> here; it is true, we may bind them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them, But it will be, with such Murmur, and Insatisfaction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as I would be loath to see.</p>
                  <p>These Things mought be dissembled; And so things left, to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51170:38"/>
bleed inwards; But that is not the way, to cure them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have searched the <hi>Soare,</hi> in hope, that you will endeavour the <hi>Medecine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this to do more throughly, I must proceed, to my Second Part; To tell you cleerely, and distinctly, what is to be set on the Right hand, and what on the left, in this business.</p>

Again, if any Man,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51170:39"/>
shall have been of Opinion, that it is not a particular Party, that can bind the <hi>House</hi>; Nor, that it is not Shews or <hi>Colours,</hi> can please the <hi>House</hi>; I say, that Man, though his speech tend to discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it is coupled with Providence. But by your leave, if any Man since the <hi>Parliam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now for the <hi>Remedy</hi>; I shall rather break the Matter, (as I said in the Beginning,) then advise positively. I know but three wayes. Some <hi>Message</hi> of <hi>Declaration</hi> to the <hi>King.</hi> Some <hi>Entry,</hi> or <hi>protestation,</hi> amongst our selves: Or some, <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>punctuall Examination.</hi> As for the last of these, I assure you, I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, if I could tell where to begin, or where to end. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, I have often seen it, that Things, when they are in smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, trouble more, then when they break out. Smoak blinds the Eyes, but when it blazeth forth into Flame, it gives light to the Eyes. But then, if you fall to an <hi>Examination,</hi> some <hi>Person</hi> must be charged; some <hi>Matter</hi> must be charged: And the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> of that <hi>Matter,</hi> must be likewise charged; For it may be in a Good Fashion, and it may be in a Bad; In as much difference as between Black, and White: And then, how far Men will <hi>ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously confess</hi>; How far they will <hi>politickly deny</hi>; And what we can <hi>Make,</hi> and <hi>gather,</hi> upon their Confession; And how we shall <hi>prove,</hi> against their <hi>Deniall,</hi> It is an endless peece of Work; And, I doubt, that we shall grow, weary of it.</p>
                  <p>For a <hi>Message</hi> to the <hi>King</hi>; It is the Course, I like best; so it be carefully, and considerately, handled: For if, we shall represent to the <hi>King,</hi> the Nature of this <hi>Body,</hi> as it is; Without the vayles, or shadows, that have been cast upon it; I think, we shall do him Honour, and our selves Right.</p>
                  <p>For any Thing, that is to be done, <hi>amongst our selves,</hi> I do not see much gained by it; Because it goes no further then <hi>our selves</hi>: Yet if any thing, can be wisely conceived, to that end, I shall not be against it; But, I think, the purpose of it, is fittest to be; Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the House conceives, that all this, is but a Mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; Then to take knowledge, that there is, indeed, a Just Ground; And then, to seek, by a <hi>Protestation,</hi> to give it a <hi>Remedy.</hi> For <hi>Protestations,</hi> and <hi>Professions,</hi> and <hi>Apologies,</hi> I never found them very Fortunate; But they rather encrease suspicion, then clear it.</p>
                  <p>Why then the Last Part is, that these things, be handled at
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51170:39"/>
the <hi>Committee,</hi> seriously, and temperately: Wherein I wish, that these four Degrees, of <hi>Questions,</hi> were handled, in order.</p>

Wherein, if this pretence, by the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Cartels,</hi> to make <hi>Soveraign Princes,</hi> as the <hi>Banditi</hi>; And to proscribe their Lives; and to expose their <hi>Kingdomes</hi> to prey; If these pretences, (I say,) and all Persons, that submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

to that part of the <hi>Popes</hi> Power, be not, by all possible Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, repressed, and punished; The State of <hi>Christian Kings,</hi> will be no other, then the ancient Torment, described by the <hi>Poets,</hi> in the <hi>Hell</hi> of the <hi>Heathen: A man sitting, richly roabed, solemnly attended, delicious fare</hi> &amp;c. <hi>With a Sword hanging over his Head, hanging by a small thread, ready every moment to be cut down, by an accursing, and accursed, hand.</hi> Surely, I had thought, they had been the Prerogatives, of <hi>God</hi> alone, and of his secret Judgements; <hi>Solvam Cingula Regum; I will loosen the Girdles of Kings</hi>; Or again; <hi>He powreth contempt upon Princes</hi>; Or, <hi>I will give a King in my wrath, and take him away again, in my displeasure.</hi> And the like: but if these be the Claims, of a <hi>Mortall Man,</hi> certainly, they are but the <hi>Mysteries,</hi> of that <hi>Person,</hi> which exalts himself, above all that is called <hi>God: Supra omne quod dicitur Deus</hi>; (Note it well:) Not above <hi>God,</hi> (though that, in a sense, be true, in respect of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they claim over the <hi>Scriptures</hi>;) But, <hi>Above all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led God</hi>; That is, Lawfull <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Magistrates.</hi>

                  <p>But, <hi>my Lords,</hi> in this <hi>uel,</hi> I find this <hi>Talbot</hi> that is now before you, but a Coward: For he hath given ground; He hath gone backward, and forward; But in such a fashion, and with such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange, of Repenting, and Relapsing, as I cannot tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it doth extenuate, or aggravate, his Offence.

                  <p>The Offence, wherewith I charge this <hi>Talbot, Prisoner</hi> at the <hi>Bar,</hi> is this, in brief, and in Effect: <hi>That he hath maintained, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, under his hand, a power in the Pope for the Deposing, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, of Kings.</hi> In what sort he doth this, when I come, to the proper, and particular, <hi>charge,</hi> I will deliver it, in his own words, without Pressing, or Straining.</p>

The other, that, (as I said at first,) this is a common Cause, of <hi>Princes</hi>; It involveth <hi>Kings,</hi> of both <hi>Religions</hi>; And therefore, his <hi>Majesty,</hi> did most worthily, and prudently, ring out the <hi>Alarum Bell,</hi> to awaken all other <hi>Princes,</hi> to think of it, seriously, and in Time. But this is a miserable case, the while; That these <hi>Roman Souldiers,</hi> do, either thrust the Spear, into the Side of <hi>Gods Annointed</hi>; Or, at least, they <hi>Crown</hi> them with <hi>Thorns</hi>; That is, piercing, and pricking, Cares, and Feares, that they can never be quiet, or secure, of their Lives, or States. And as this Perill, is common to <hi>Princes,</hi> of both <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> So <hi>Princes</hi> of both <hi>Religions</hi> have been, likewise, equally sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, of every Injury, that touch't their <hi>Temporall.</hi>

                  <p>Now, to go on, with the <hi>Narrative.</hi> There was an <hi>Extract</hi> made, of certain <hi>Sentences,</hi> and <hi>Portions,</hi> of this <hi>Book</hi>; (Being, of this nature, that I have set forth;) By a great <hi>Prelate,</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,</hi> upon a just Occasion; And, there being some Hollowness, and Hesitation, in these Matters, (wherein, it is a thing impious, to doubt,) discovered, and perceived, in <hi>Talbot</hi>; He was asked, his Opinion, concerning these Assertions, in the Presence of his <hi>Majesty:</hi> And afterward, they were delivered to him; That, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on advise, and <hi>Sedato animo,</hi> he mought declare himself; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, under his hand, he subscribes thus.
<q>May it please your Honourable good <hi>Lordships</hi>: Concerning this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Suarez,</hi> I do perceive, by what I have read, in his Book, that the same, doth concern, <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>; The Controversie growing, upon <hi>Exposition</hi> of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>Councels</hi>; Wherein, (being ignorant, and not studied,) <hi>I</hi> cannot take upon me, to judge: But I do sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit mine Opinion therein, to the Iudgement, of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Roman Church,</hi> as in all other Points, concerning <hi>Faith,</hi> I do. And for Matter, concerning my Loyalty, I do acknowledge, my <hi>Soveraign Liege Lord King James,</hi> to be lawfull, and undoubted, King, of all the <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; And I will bear, true faith, and Allegeance, to his Highness, during my life.</q>

                  <p>NOw, (my <hi>Lords,</hi>) upon these words, I charge <hi>William Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi> to have committed a great Offence; And such an one, as if he had entred, into a voluntary, and malicious, Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the like writing; It would have been, too great an Offence, for the <hi>Capacity</hi> of this <hi>Court.</hi> But because, it grew from a <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> askt by a <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>

                  <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> a Mans Allegeance, must be Independant, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visionall, and conditionall. <hi>Elizabeth Barton,</hi> that was called, the <hi>Holy Maid of Kent,</hi> affirmed; <hi>That if K.

                  <p>And in like manner, if a Man should, voluntarily publish, or maintain; That whensoever a <hi>Bull,</hi> or <hi>Deprivation,</hi> shall come forth against the <hi>King,</hi> that from thenceforth, he is no longer

The <hi>Subject</hi> petitioneth, to the <hi>King,</hi> in <hi>Parliament.</hi> He Petitioneth likewise, out of <hi>Parliament.</hi> The <hi>King,</hi> on the other side, gives <hi>Graces,</hi> to the <hi>Subjects,</hi> in <hi>Parliament:</hi> He gives them likewise, and poureth them, upon his <hi>People,</hi> out of <hi>Parliament:</hi> And so, no doubt, the <hi>Subject,</hi> may give, to the <hi>King,</hi> in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and out of <hi>Parliament.</hi> It is true, the <hi>Parliament,</hi> is <hi>Intercur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Magnus</hi>; The great <hi>Intercourse,</hi> and main <hi>Current,</hi> of <hi>Graces,</hi> and Donatives, from the <hi>King,</hi> to the <hi>People</hi>; from the <hi>People,</hi> to the <hi>King</hi>: But <hi>Parliaments</hi> are held, but at certain times: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Passages, are alwayes open, for Particulars: Even as you see, great <hi>Rivers,</hi> have their <hi>Tides</hi>; But particular <hi>Springs,</hi> and <hi>Fountains,</hi> run continually.</p>
                  <p>To proceed therefore; As the Occasion, (which was the failing of Supply, by <hi>Parliament,</hi>) did awake the Love, and Benevolence, of those, that were at hand, to give: So it was apprehended, and thought fit, by my <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Councell,</hi> to make a proof, whether the occasion, and Example both, would not awake, those in the Country, of the better sort, to follow. Whereupon, their <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi> devised, and directed <hi>Letters,</hi> unto the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> and <hi>Iustices,</hi> which declared what was done here above, and wished, that the Country might be moved, especially Men of value.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>My Lords,</hi> I beseech you, give me favour, and attention, to set forth, and observe, unto you, five <hi>Points:</hi> (I will number them, because other Men may note them; And I will but touch them, because they shall not be drowned, or lost in discourse;) which I hold worthy, the observation, for the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> of <hi>Slanders:</hi> Whereby, it will appear, most evidently; What care was taken, that that, which was then done, might not have the effect, no nor the shew, no nor so much as the shadow, of a <hi>Tax</hi>: And that it was, so far, from breeding, or bringing in, any ill president, or Example, As, contrary wise, it is a <hi>Corrective,</hi> that doth <hi>correct,</hi> and <hi>allay,</hi> the Harshness, and Danger, of former <hi>Examples.</hi>

                  <list>
                     <item>The first is; That what was done, was done, immediately after such a <hi>Parliament,</hi> as made generall Profession to give, and was interrupted by Accide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </list>
                  <p>I conclude therefore, (My <hi>Lords,</hi>) that this was a <hi>True,</hi> and <hi>pure, Benevolence</hi>; Not an <hi>Imposition,</hi> called a <hi>Benevelence,</hi> which the <hi>Statute</hi> speaks of; As you shall hear, by one of my <hi>Fellows.</hi> There is a great Difference, I tell you, (though <hi>Pilate</hi> would not see it,) between <hi>Rex Iudaeorum and se d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this, I say, was a <hi>Benevolence,</hi> wherein every man, had a <hi>Princes Prerogative</hi>; A <hi>Negative Voyce</hi>: And this word, <hi>(Excuse moy,)</hi> was a <hi>Plea peremptory.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I do wonder, how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>I.

                  <p>Now to the particular <hi>Charge.</hi> Amongst other <hi>Countries,</hi> these Letters, of the <hi>Lords,</hi> came to the <hi>Iustices</hi> of <hi>D—shire,</hi> Who sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, the Contents thereof; And gave Directions, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,

                     <hi>Here the Papers were read.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>MY <hi>Lords,</hi> I know, this <hi>Paper,</hi> offends your Ears, much, and the Eares of any good <hi>Subject:</hi> And sorry I am, that the Times, should produce Offences, of this nature: But since they do, I would be more sorry, they should be passed, without severe punishment: <hi>Non tradite factum,</hi> (as the <hi>Verse</hi> sayes, altered a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;) <hi>Aut si tradatis, Facti quoque tradite poenam.</hi> If any man, have a mind, to discourse, of the Fact; let him likewise, discourse, of the punishment, of the Fact.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Writing,</hi> (<hi>my Lords,</hi>) there appears, a <hi>Monster,</hi> with four <hi>Heads</hi>; Of the progeny, of him, that is the <hi>Father of</hi> Lies, and takes, his <hi>Name,</hi> from <hi>Slander.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first is, a wicked, and seditious, Slander; Or, (if I shall use the <hi>Scripture</hi> phrase,) a Blaspheming<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the <hi>King</hi> himself; Setting him forth, for a <hi>Prince,</hi> perjured, in the great, and solemne, <hi>Oath,</hi> of his <hi>Coronation</hi>; which is, as it were, the <hi>Knot</hi> of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme</hi>: A <hi>Prince,</hi> that should be a <hi>Violatour,</hi> and <hi>Infringer,</hi> of the <hi>Liberties, Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Customes,</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome:</hi> A mark, for an <hi>H.</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. A Match, for a <hi>R.</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, a <hi>Slander,</hi> and <hi>Falsification,</hi> and <hi>wresting,</hi> of the Law, of the <hi>Land,</hi> grosse, and palpable: It is truly said, by a Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian; <hi>Tortura Legum pessima:</hi> The <hi>Torture</hi> of <hi>Lawes,</hi> is worse, then the <hi>Torture</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third is, a slander, and false charge, of the <hi>Parliament</hi>; That they had denied, to give to the <hi>King:</hi> A Point, of notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous untruth.</p>
                  <p>And the last is, a Slander, and <hi>Taunting,</hi> of an infinite Number,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51170:45"/>
of the <hi>Kings</hi> loving <hi>Subjects,</hi> that have given, towards this <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,</hi> and <hi>free Contribution:</hi> Charging them, as Accessary, and Coadjutours, to the <hi>Kings</hi> Perjury. Nay, you leave us not there; But you take, upon you, a <hi>Pontificall Habite</hi>; And couple, your <hi>Slander,</hi> with a <hi>Curse:</hi> But thanks be to <hi>God,</hi> we have learned suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, out of the <hi>Scripture</hi>; That, <hi>as the Bird flies away, so the causelesse Curse shall not come.</hi>

                  <p>For the first of these, which concerns the <hi>King,</hi> I have taken to my self, the opening, and Aggravation, thereof: The other three, I have distributed, to my <hi>Fellows.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cannot, but enter, into this part, with some Wonder and Astonishment; How it should come, into the Heart, of a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to vapour forth, such a wicked, and venemous <hi>slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> against the <hi>King</hi>; whose Goodness, &amp; Grace, is comparable (if not incomparable,) unto any the <hi>Kings,</hi> his <hi>Progenitors.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, gives me a Just, &amp; necessary, occasion, to do two things. The one to make, some Representation, of his <hi>Majesty</hi>; Such as truly he is found to be, in his Government, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>I. S.</hi> chargeth, with Violation of <hi>Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Liberties.</hi> The other, to search, and open the Depth of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>I.S.</hi> his Offence. Both which, I will do briefly; Because, the one, I cannot expresse, sufficiently; And the other, I will not presse, too far.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> I mean to make, no <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> or <hi>Laudative</hi>: The <hi>Kings</hi> delights not in it, neither am I fit for it: But if it were, but a <hi>Councellor,</hi> or <hi>Noble-man,</hi> whose Name had suffered, and were to receive, some kind of Reparation, in this <hi>High Court,</hi> I would do him that Duty, as not to pass his Merits, and just Attributes, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, such as are limitted with the present Case) in silence: For, it is fit, to burn Incense, where evill Odours, have been cast, and raised. Is it so, that <hi>King Iames</hi> shall be said to be a Violater, of the <hi>Liberties, Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Customes</hi> of his <hi>Kingdomes</hi>? Or is he not, rather, a noble, and Constant, <hi>Protector,</hi> and <hi>Conservator,</hi> of them all? I conceive, this consisteth, in maintaining <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>true Church</hi>; In maintaining the <hi>Lawes</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> which is the <hi>Subjects Birth-right</hi>; In <hi>temperate use,</hi> of the <hi>Prerogative</hi>; In due, and free, <hi>Administration</hi> of <hi>Iustice</hi>; And Conservation, of the <hi>Peace,</hi> of the <hi>Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Religion,</hi> we must ever acknowledge, in first place, that we have a <hi>King,</hi> that is, the <hi>Principall Conservator</hi> of true <hi>Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>He hath Awaked, and Reauthorized, the whole <hi>Party,</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> throughout <hi>Europe</hi>; which through the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and diverse Artifices, and Inchantments, of the advers part, was grown, a little Dull, and Dejected. He hath summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Fraternity</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> to infranchise Themselves, from the Usurpation, of the <hi>see of Rome.</hi> He hath made himself a <hi>Mark, of Contradiction for it.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:51170:45"/>Neither can I omit, when I speak of <hi>Religion,</hi> to remember, that excellent <hi>Act</hi> of his <hi>Majesty</hi>; which though it were done, in a <hi>Forraign Country,</hi> yet the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is one; And the <hi>Contagion</hi> of these things, will soon pass Seas, and Lands: I mean, in his constant, and holy, proceeding against the <hi>Heretick Vorstius</hi>; whom, (being ready, to enter into the <hi>Chair,</hi> and there to have authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, one of the most <hi>pestilent,</hi> and <hi>Heathenish Heresies,</hi> that ever was begun;) His <hi>Majesty,</hi> by his constant opposition, dismounted, and pulled down.

                  <p>But, (my <hi>Lords,</hi>) this is a Sea of Matter; And therefore, I must give it over, and conclude; That there was never <hi>King,</hi> raigned, in this <hi>Nation,</hi> that did better keep Covenant, in preserving the Liberties, and procuring the Good, of his People. So that, I must needs say, for the <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>England; O Fortunatos nimium, sua si bona nôrint:</hi> As, no doubt, they do, both know, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it: Whatsoever, a few turbulent Discoursers, may, through the Lenity of the time, take Boldness to speak.</p>
                  <p>And as for this particular, touching the <hi>Benevolence,</hi> wherein, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>I.S.</hi> doth assign, this breach of Covenant; I leave it, to others, to tell you; what the <hi>King</hi> may do; Or what other <hi>Kings,</hi> have done: But I have told you, what our <hi>King,</hi> and my <hi>Lords,</hi> have done: Which, I say, and say again, is so far, from introducing, a new President; As it doth, rather, correct, and mollifie, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie, former presidents.</p>
                  <p>Now, (Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi>) let me tell you your fault in few words; For that, I am perswaded, you see it already; Though I wooe no Mans Repentance; But I shall, as much as in me is, cherish it, where I find it. Your <hi>Offence</hi> hath three parts knit together,

                  <p>Your <hi>Menace,</hi> that if there were a <hi>Bulling-broke,</hi> or I cannot tell what, there were Matter for him, is a very seditious Passage.

                  <list>
                     <item>The first is, the Clemency, of the <hi>King</hi>; Because, it is Newes, and a kind of Rarety, to have a proceeding, in this place, upon <hi>Treason:</hi> And perhaps, it may be marvelled by some, why after, so long an Intermission, it should light upon this <hi>Fellow:</hi> Being a person, but contemptible; A kind of venemous fly; And a Hang by of the Seminaries.</item>
                     <item>The Second is, the Nature of this <hi>Treason,</hi> as concerning the <hi>Fact</hi>; which, of all kinds, of compassing the <hi>Kings</hi> Death, I hold to be the most perillous; And as much differing from other Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spiracies, as the lifting up of a 1000 Hands, against the <hi>King,</hi> (like the <hi>Giant Briareus,</hi>) differs, from lifting up one, or a few Hands.</item>
                     <item>The Third Point, that I will speak unto, is, the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Opinion</hi>; Which is the Ground of this <hi>Treason</hi>; Wherein, I will not argue, or speak, like a Divine, or Scholler; But, as a Man, bred, in a Civill Life: And to speak plainly, I hold the Opinion to be such, that deserveth, rather, Detestation, then Contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>
                     <item>The Fourth Point, is the <hi>Degree,</hi> of this Mans <hi>Offence</hi>; which is more presumptuous, then I have known, any other, to have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into, in this kind: And hath, a greater Overflow, of <hi>Malice</hi>

                     <item>And Fifthly, I will remove somewhat, that may seem to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and extenuate, this <hi>Mans Offence</hi>; in that, he hath not affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, simply; That it is lawfull to kill the King, but conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that if the <hi>King</hi> be <hi>Excommunicate,</hi> it is lawfull to kill him; which maketh little Difference, either in Law, or Perill.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the <hi>Kings Clemency,</hi> I have said it, of late, upon a good Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; And I still speak it, with comfort: I have now, served his <hi>Majestie, Solliciter,</hi> and <hi>Atturney,</hi> eight years, and better: yet, this is the first time, that ever I gave in Evidence, against a <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> at this <hi>Barr,</hi> or any other. There hath not wanted Matter, in that Party, of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> whence this kind of <hi>Offence</hi> floweth, to irritate the <hi>King</hi>: He hath been irritated, by the <hi>Powder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> which might have turned Judgement, into Fury: He hath been irritated, by wicked, and monstrous, <hi>Libels</hi>; Irritated, by a generall Insolency, and presumption, in the <hi>Papists,</hi> throughout the Land; And yet, I see, his <hi>Majesty</hi> keepeth <hi>Caesars</hi> Rule: <hi>Nil

And that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> which may be, of Guard, or Custody, is a perpetuall Misery. And therefore, they that have written, of the <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> of <hi>Ambassadours,</hi> and of the <hi>Amplitude</hi> of <hi>Safe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Manners,</hi> of <hi>Conspiring,</hi> and <hi>compassing</hi> the <hi>Kings Death,</hi> are many: But it is most apparent, that amongst all the rest, this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth. First, because it is grounded, upon pretenced <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>; which is a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> that enflameth the <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> of a Man, with Daring, and Resolution, more than any Thing else. Secondly, it is the Hardest to be avoided; For when a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> is plotted, or Attempted, against a <hi>King,</hi> by some one, or some few <hi>Conspiratours,</hi> it meets with a Number of Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.

Or an universall Temptation; Doth enter, at once, into the Hearts of all, that are any way prepared, or of any Predisposition, to be <hi>Traytors:</hi> So that whatsoever faileth in any one, is supplied in Many: If one <hi>Man</hi> faint, another will dare: If one man hath not the Opportunity, another hath: If one <hi>Man</hi> Relent, another will be Desperate.

                  <p>Now, I will come unto that, which is the <hi>Principall</hi>; That is, his <hi>Majesties Princely,</hi> yea, and as I may truly term it, <hi>Sacred</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, in this Cause. Wherein, I will first Speak, of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> of his <hi>Iustice,</hi> and then of the <hi>Strength</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>First, it pleased my <hi>Lord Chief Iustice,</hi> to let me know; (That, which I heard, with great Comfort;) Which was, the <hi>Charge,</hi>

                     </gap>hat his <hi>Majesty</hi> gave to Himself first; And afterwards, to the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> in this Case; worthy, certainly, to be written in <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi>; wherein, his <hi>Majesty</hi> did fore-rank, and make it his prime Direction, that it should be carried, without touch, to any, that was innocent. Nay more, not onely without <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,</hi> but without <hi>Aspersion:</hi> which was a most <hi>Noble,</hi> and <hi>Princely</hi> Caution, from his <hi>Majesty:</hi> For Mens Reputations, are tender Things; And ought to be, like <hi>Christs Coat,</hi> without <hi>Seam.</hi> And it was, the more to be respected, in this Case, because it met, with two great <hi>Persons</hi>; A <hi>Noble Man,</hi> that his <hi>Majesty,</hi> had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and advanced; And his <hi>Lady,</hi> being of a Great, and Honourable House: Though, I think it be true, that the Writers say, that there is no <hi>Pomgranate,</hi> so fair, or so sound, but may have a perished <hi>Kernell.</hi> Nay, I see plainly, that in those excel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beams of <hi>Iustice,</hi> issuing from that Vertue, which doth shine in him; I say, I see it was so evenly carried, without prejudice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; (whither it were a true Accusation, of the one part, or a Practise, of a false Accusation on the other;) As shewed plainly, that his Majesties, Judgement, was <hi>tanquam Tabula Rasa,</hi> as a clean pair of <hi>Tables</hi>; And his Ear, <hi>tanquam Ianua aperta</hi>; As a Gate, not side open, but wide open, to Truth, as it should be, by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, discovered. Nay I see plainly, that at the first, (till further Light did break forth,) his <hi>Majesty,</hi> was little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, with the First <hi>Tale</hi>; which he vouchsafeth not so much, as the Name of a <hi>Tale</hi>; But calleth it a <hi>Rumour,</hi> which is an <hi>Headless Tale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Strength, or Resolution, of his <hi>Majesties Iustice,</hi> I must tell your <hi>Lordships</hi> plainly. I do not marvell, to see <hi>Kings,</hi> thunder out <hi>Iustice,</hi> in Cases of <hi>Treason,</hi> when they are touched Themselves; And that, they are <hi>Vindices Doloris Proprij:</hi> But that a <hi>King,</hi> should, <hi>pro Amore Iustitiae,</hi> onely; Contrary to the <hi>Tide</hi> of his own <hi>Affection,</hi> for the preservation of his <hi>People,</hi> take such Care<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> For, I think, I may truly affirm, that there was never, in this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> nor in any other <hi>Kingdome,</hi> the <hi>Bloud</hi> of a private Gentleman, vindicated, <hi>Cum tanto Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ath been, almost, turned, into a <hi>Iustitium,</hi> or <hi>Vacancy:</hi> The <hi>People</hi> themselves, being more willing, to be Lookers on, in this Business, then to follow their own. There hath been, no Care of <hi>Discovery</hi> omitted, no <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> lost. And therefore, I will conclude this Part, with the Saying of <hi>Salomon; Gloria Dei celare rem, &amp; gloria Regis Scruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri rem.</hi> And his <hi>Majesties</hi> Honour, is much the greater, for that, he hath shewed, to the World, in this Businesse, as it hath Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my <hi>Lord of Sommerset</hi>; (whose Case, in no sort I do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge, being ignorant of the Secrets, of the Cause, but taking him, as the Law takes him, hitherto, for a <hi>Suspect</hi>;) I say, the <hi>King</hi> hath, to his great Honour, shewed; That were any Man, in such a Case of Bloud, as the <hi>Signet upon his Right Hand,</hi> (as the <hi>Scripture</hi> sayes,) yet would He put him off.</p>
                  <p>Now will I come, to the particular <hi>Charge,</hi> of these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whose <hi>Qualities,</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> I respect, and love: For they are all my particular Friends: But now, I can only do, this Duty, of a Friend, to them, to make them know, their Fault to the full.</p>
                  <p>And therefore first, I will, by way of <hi>Narrative,</hi> declare to your <hi>Lordships,</hi> the <hi>Fact,</hi> with the occasion of it; Then you shall have their <hi>Confessions</hi> read, upon which you are to proceed; Together, with some <hi>Collaterall Testimonies,</hi> by way of Aggravation: And lastly, I will note, and observe to your <hi>Lordships,</hi> the <hi>Materiall

                     </hi> may keep secret their Informations, and then no Man ought to enquire after them, while they are shrined in their Breast. But where a <hi>King</hi> is pleased, that a Man shall answer, for his false <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>; There, I say, the false <hi>Information,</hi> to a <hi>King</hi>; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I know, my <hi>Lords,</hi> the <hi>Masters of the Chancery,</hi> are <hi>Reverend Men</hi>; And the great Mass, of Businesse, of the <hi>Court,</hi> cannot be sped, without them; And it is a Thing, <hi>the Chanceller</hi> may soon fall into, for his own Ease, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too much upon them. But the Course, that I will take, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, shall be this: That I will make no Binding <hi>Order,</hi> upon any report of the <hi>Masters,</hi> without giving a seven nights day, at the least, to shew cause, against the Report; (which nevertheless, I will have done modestly, &amp; with due reverence, towards them:) And again, I must utterly discontinue, the Making, of an <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi> or <hi>Conditionall Order</hi>; That if a <hi>Master of the Chancery,</hi> do certifie thus, that then it is <hi>Ordered,</hi> without further Motion: For that is a Surprise, and gives no time, for Contradiction.</item>

                  <head>The <hi>Speech,</hi> which was used, by the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> of <hi>the Great Seal,</hi> in the Star-Chamber, before the Summer Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits, the <hi>King</hi> being then in <hi>Scotland, 1617.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe King, by his perfect <hi>Declaration,</hi> published in this place, concerning <hi>Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Iustices</hi>; Hath made the <hi>Speech</hi> of his <hi>Chanceller,</hi> accustomed before the <hi>Circuits,</hi> rather of <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> than of <hi>use.</hi> For, as in his <hi>Book</hi> to his <hi>Son,</hi> he hath set forth a true <hi>Character,</hi> and <hi>Platform,</hi> of a King; So, in this his <hi>Speech,</hi> he hath done, the like, of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> and <hi>Iustice:</hi> Which sheweth, that as his <hi>Majesty,</hi> is excellently able, to <hi>Govern,</hi> in <hi>chief</hi>; So, he is likewise well seen, and skilfull, in the inferiour Offices, and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> of Justice, and Government: which is a Thing, very rare in <hi>Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet, neverthelesse, somewhat must be said, to fulfill an old <hi>Observance</hi>; But yet, upon the <hi>Kings Grounds,</hi> and very briefly: For as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, in another <hi>Case; In these things, who is he, that can come, after the King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, you that are the <hi>Iudges</hi> of <hi>Circuits,</hi> are, as it were, the <hi>Planets</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome</hi>; (I do you no Dishonor, in giving you that name;) And, no doubt, you have a great stroak, in the Frame, of this Government; As the other have, in the great <hi>Frame,</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> Do therefore, as they do; Move alwayes and be carried, with the <hi>Motion</hi> of your first <hi>Mover,</hi> which is your <hi>Soveraign.</hi> A <hi>popular Iudge</hi> is a Deformed Thing: And <hi>Plaudite's,</hi> are fitter for <hi>Players,</hi> then for <hi>Magistrates.</hi> Do good to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Love them, and give them Justice. But let it be, as the <hi>Psalm</hi> saith, <hi>Nihil inde Expectantes</hi>; Looking for nothing, neither Praise, nor Profit.</p>
                  <p>Yet my Meaning is not, when I wish you, to take heed of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, that you should be imperious, and Strange, to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> of the <hi>Countrey:</hi> You are, above them, in Power, but your Rank is not much unequall: And learn this; That Power, is ever of greates<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, you must remember, that besides your ordinary <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> you do carry the two <hi>Glasses,</hi> or, <hi>Mirrours,</hi> of the <hi>State:</hi> For it is your Duty, in these your Visitations; <hi>To repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to the people, the Graces, and Care, of the King.</hi> And again, upon your Return; <hi>To present, to the King, the Distastes, and Griefs, of the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mark, what the <hi>King</hi> sayes, in his Book: <hi>Procure reverence to the King and the Law: Inform my people truly of me</hi>; (which we know is, hard to do, according to the <hi>Excellency</hi> of his <hi>Merit,</hi> but yet En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it;) <hi>How zealous I am for Religion; How I desire, Law may

                  <p>Touching the <hi>Infestation</hi> of <hi>Pyrates,</hi> he hath been carefull, and is, and hath put things, in way.</p>
                  <p>All things that concern the Reformation, or the <hi>Plantation,</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi>; He hath given, in them, punctuall, and resolute, Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I give but a few <hi>Instances,</hi> of a <hi>publique Nature</hi>; The <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Counsell,</hi> I may not enter into; Though, his <hi>Dispatches</hi> into <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> now in his absence, are also Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as to the outward sending. So that, I must conclude, that his Majesty, wants but more <hi>Kingdomes</hi>; For I see, he could suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to all.</p>
                  <p>As for the other <hi>Glasse,</hi> I told you of; Of representing to the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Griefs,</hi> of his <hi>People</hi>; without doubt, it is properly your Part: For the King, ought to be informed, of any thing, amisse in the state, of his <hi>Countries,</hi> from the <hi>Observations,</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> of the <hi>Iudges</hi>; (That, indeed, know the Pulse of the Country;) Rather then from <hi>Discourse.</hi> But for this <hi>Glasse,</hi> (thanks be to <hi>God,</hi>) I do hear, from you all; That there was never greater Peace, Obedience, and Contentment, in the <hi>Country:</hi> Though the best <hi>Governments,</hi> be, alwayes, like the fairest <hi>Crystals</hi>; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, every little <hi>Isicle,</hi> or <hi>Grain,</hi> is seen; which in a <hi>Fouler Stone,</hi> is never perceived.</p>
                  <p>Now to some <hi>Particulars,</hi> and not Many. Of all other things, I must begin, as the King begins; That is, with the Cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; And especially, the <hi>Hollow Church Papist.</hi> Saint <hi>Aug.</hi> hath a good Comparison, of such Men, affirming; That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hey bear all the Stinging Leaves. Let me know of such <hi>Roots,</hi> and I will root them, out of the Country.</p>
                  <p>Next, for the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>: In the principall place, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend,

both to you, and the <hi>Iustices,</hi> the <hi>Countenancing,</hi> of <hi>Godly,</hi> and <hi>Zealous, Preachers.</hi> I mean, not <hi>Sectaries,</hi> or <hi>Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>; But those, which are sound, and conform; But yet pious, and Reverend. For there will be a perpetuall Defection, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you keep Men in, by <hi>Preaching,</hi> as well as Law doth, by <hi>punishing</hi>: And commonly, <hi>Spirituall Diseases,</hi> are not Cured, but by <hi>Spirituall Remedies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, let me commend unto you, the Repressing, (as much as may be,) of Faction in the Countrys; of which ensue, infinite In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, and perturbations, of all good Order; And Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, of all good Service, in Court, or Country, or wheresoever. <hi>Cicero,</hi> when he was <hi>Consul,</hi> had devised, a fine Remedy; (A Milde one, but an effectuall, and an apt one;) For he saith, <hi>Eos qui otium perturbant, reddam otiosos. Those, that trouble, others</hi> Quiet, <hi>I will give them Quiet</hi>; They shall have nothing to do; Nor no Authority, shall be put into their Hands. If I may know, from you, of any who are in the Country, that are Heads, or Hands, of Faction; Or Men, of turbulent Spirits; I shall give them <hi>Cicero's</hi> Reward, as much as in me is.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; study the <hi>Kings Book</hi>; And study your selves, how you profit by it; And all shall be well. And you, the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of Peace,</hi> in particular; Let me say this to you; Never <hi>King,</hi> of this Realm, did you so much Honour, as the <hi>King</hi> hath done you, in his <hi>Speeeh</hi>; By being, your immedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But because, you are to be there, not only <hi>Chief Iustice,</hi> but a <hi>Counseller</hi> of <hi>Estate,</hi> I will put you in mind, of the great Work, now in hand; that you may raise your thoughtes, according unto it, <hi>Ireland</hi> is the last, <hi>Ex Filiis Europae,</hi> which hath been reclaimed, from Desolation, and a Desert, (in many parts,) to Population, and Plantation; And from Savage, and Barbarous, Customes, to Humanity, and Civility.

The Work, is not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, to perfection, but is in fair Advance.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The First is, that you have speciall care, of the Three <hi>Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> That of the <hi>North,</hi> which is in part acted: That of <hi>Weshford,</hi> which is now in Distribution: And that of <hi>Longford,</hi> and <hi>Letrim,</hi> which is now in survey. And take this from me; That the Bane, of a Plantation, is, when the <hi>Vndertakers,</hi> or <hi>Planters,</hi> make such hast, to a little <hi>Mechanicall present profit,</hi> as disturbeth the whole <hi>Frame,</hi> and noblenesse of the work, for Times to come. Therefore, hold them to their <hi>Covenants,</hi> and the strict <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:51170:58"/>The Second is, that you be carefull, of the <hi>Kings Revenew</hi>; And by little and little, constitute him, a good <hi>Demeasn,</hi> if it may be; Which hitherto is little, or none. For the <hi>Kings</hi> Case is hard, when every Mans Land, shall be improved, in value, with increase ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold; And the <hi>King</hi> shall be tied, to his <hi>Dry Rent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My last Direction, (though first in weight,) is, that you do all good Endeavours, to proceed resolutely, and constantly (and yet with due Temparance, and Equality) in <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>; least <hi>Ireland Civill,</hi> become more dangerous to us, then <hi>Ireland Savage.</hi> So <hi>God</hi> give you Comfort of your <hi>Place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Sir <hi>William Iones Speech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I had forgotten one Thing, which was this. You may take, exceeding great Comfort, that you shall serve, with such a <hi>Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> One, that (I think) is a Man, ordain'd of <hi>God,</hi> to do great <hi>Good,</hi> to that <hi>Kingdome.</hi> And this, I think good, to say to you; That the true Temper, of a <hi>Chief Iustice,</hi> towards a <hi>Deputy,</hi> is; Neither ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy to second him, nor factiously to oppose him.</p>

                  <p>SIR <hi>Iohn Denham</hi>; the <hi>King,</hi> of his grace, and favour, hath made choice of you, to be one of the <hi>Barons,</hi> of the Exchecquer; To succeed, to one of the gravest, and most Reverend <hi>Iudges,</hi> of this <hi>Kingdome</hi>; For so I hold <hi>Baron Altham was.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> takes you not upon Credit, but Proof, and great Proof of your former Service; And that, in both those kinds, wherein you are now to serve: For as you have shewed your self a good <hi>Iudge</hi> beween party and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; so you have shewed your self a good <hi>Administer,</hi> of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue</hi>; Both when you were <hi>Chief Baron</hi>; And since as <hi>Counseller</hi> of <hi>Estate,</hi> there in <hi>Ireland</hi>; where the <hi>Counsell</hi> (as you know) doth in great part, mannage, and messuage, the <hi>Revenew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to both these Parts, I will apply some <hi>Admonitions</hi>; But not vulgar, or discursive; But apt for the Times, and in few words: For they are best remembred.</p>
                  <p>First therefore, above all, you ought to maintain, the <hi>Kings Prerogative,</hi> And to set down with your self that the <hi>Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> are not two Things; But the <hi>Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative is Law</hi>; And the Principall <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> The <hi>First-Born,</hi> or <hi>Pars Prima,</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> And therefore, in conserving, or maintaining that, you conserve and maintain, the <hi>Law.</hi> There is not, in the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> one Law of the Head, and another of the Body, but all is one Entire <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next <hi>Point,</hi> that I would now advise you, is, that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your self, diligently, with the <hi>Revenew</hi>; And also with

                        </gap>,</hi> and <hi>Presidents,</hi> of this <hi>Court.</hi> When the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Case, of the <hi>Copper Mines,</hi> was argued in this <hi>Court</hi>; And judged for the <hi>King</hi>; It was not, upon the fine Reasons, of <hi>Witt</hi>; As that, the <hi>Kings Prerogative,</hi> drew to it, the chief, <hi>in quaque spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:</hi> The <hi>Lion</hi> is the chief of <hi>Beasts</hi>; The <hi>Eagle</hi> the chief of <hi>Birds</hi>; The Whale, the chief of <hi>Fishes</hi>; And so Copper, the chief of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; For these are but <hi>Dalliances</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ornaments</hi>; But it was the grave <hi>Records,</hi> and <hi>Presidents,</hi> that grounded, the <hi>Iudgement,</hi> of that <hi>Cause:</hi> And therefore, I would have you, both guide, and arm, your self with them, against these Vapours, and Fumes, of Law; which are extracted, out of Mens Inventions, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</p>
                  <p>The third <hi>Advice,</hi> I will give you, hath a large Extent: It is, that you do your Endeavour, in your place, so to mannage the <hi>Kings Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Revenue,</hi> as the <hi>King</hi> may have most <hi>Profit,</hi> and the <hi>Subject,</hi> least <hi>vexation:</hi> For when there is much <hi>vexation</hi> to the <hi>Subject,</hi> and <hi>little Benefit</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> then the <hi>Exchecquer</hi> is Sick: And when there is, <hi>Much Benefit</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> with lesse <hi>Trouble,</hi> and <hi>vexation,</hi> to the <hi>Subject,</hi> then the <hi>Exchecquer</hi> is sound: As for <hi>Example</hi>; If there shall be much <hi>Racking,</hi> for the <hi>Kings</hi> old Debts; And the more <hi>Fresh,</hi> and <hi>Late Debts</hi> shall be, either more negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently called upon, or over easily discharged, or over indulgent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stalled: Or if the <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Informations</hi> be many; and the <hi>Kings Part,</hi> or <hi>Fines</hi> for <hi>Compositions,</hi> a Trifle: Or if there be, much ado, to get the <hi>King new Land,</hi> upon <hi>Concealments,</hi> and that which he hath already, be not well <hi>known,</hi> and <hi>surveyed</hi>; Nor the woods preserved; (I could put you many other <hi>Cases,</hi>) this fals within that, which I term, the <hi>sick Estate</hi> of the <hi>Exchecquer.</hi> And this is that, which makes every Man ready, with their Undertakings, and their Projects, to disturb, the ancient <hi>Frame</hi> of the <hi>Exchecquer</hi>; (Then the which, I am perswaded, there is not a better;) This being the <hi>Burthen</hi> of the <hi>Song</hi>; That much goeth out of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Purse</hi>; And little commeth, to the <hi>Kings Purse.</hi> Therefore, give them not, that Advantage, so to say.

                  <p>First, because, if the <hi>Parties</hi> own <hi>Iudgement,</hi> should be admitted, in case of <hi>Elections,</hi> Touching himself, it would follow, that the most confident, and over-weening, Persons, would be received; And the most considerate Men, and those that understand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves best, should be rejected.</p>

will: Wherein, you must expect from me, such an Answer, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as is pertinent to the <hi>Occasion,</hi> and compassed, by due respect of <hi>Time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I may divide, that which you have said, into four parts.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The second was, indeed, a large <hi>Field</hi>; Containing, a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Acknowledgement,</hi> of his <hi>Majesties, Benefits, Attributes,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third was, some <hi>Passages,</hi> touching the <hi>Institution,</hi> and <hi>Vse</hi> of <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth, and last was, certain <hi>Petitions,</hi> to his <hi>Majesty</hi>; on the behalf, of the <hi>House,</hi> and your <hi>self.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">1. Part.</note> and preferring it, before other <hi>Estates,</hi> it needs no <hi>Answer.</hi> The <hi>Schools</hi> may dispute it; But <hi>Time</hi> hath tryed it; And we find it to be the Best. Other <hi>States,</hi> have curious Frames, soon put out of order; And they, that are made fit to last, are not, commonly, fit to grow, or spread: And contrarywise, those that are made fit to spread, and enlarge, are not fit, to continue, and endure. But <hi>Monarchy,</hi> is like a <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> well composed, both to grow, and to continue. From this I passe.</p>
                  <p>For the second part,<note place="margin">2. Part.</note> of your <hi>Speech,</hi> wherein you did, with no lesse Truth, then Affection, acknowledge, the great Felicity, which we enjoy, by his <hi>Majesties Reign,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi>; His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,</hi> hath commanded me, to say unto you: That <hi>Praises,</hi> and <hi>Thanks-givings,</hi> he knoweth, to be the true Oblations, of Hearts, and loving Affections: But that, which you offer him, he will joyn with you, in offering it up to <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>Authour</hi> of all <hi>Good</hi>; who knoweth also, the <hi>uprightness,</hi> of his <hi>Heart</hi>; who, He hopeth, will continue, and encrease, his <hi>Blessings,</hi> both upon <hi>Himself,</hi> and his <hi>Posterity</hi>; And likewise, upon his <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> and the <hi>Generations</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>But I, for my part, must say unto you, as the <hi>Grecian Orator</hi> said, long since, in the like case: <hi>Solus dignus harum rerum Laudator Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.

                  <p>And because, this is no part of a <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> but meerly <hi>Story,</hi> and that they be, so many <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> fit to be recorded, I will onely mention them; extracting part of them, out of that, you, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi> have said.

                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the Third <hi>Point,</hi> of your <hi>Speech,</hi> concerning <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. Part.</note> I shall need to say little: For there was never, that Honour done, to the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that his <hi>Majesty</hi> did it, in his last Speech; making it, in effect, the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>Monarchy:</hi> For that, although <hi>Monarchy,</hi> was the more Ancient, and be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; yet by the Advice, and Assistance of <hi>Parliament,</hi> it is the stronger, and the surer built.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, I shall say no more, of this <hi>Point,</hi> but as you, (Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) did well note: That when the <hi>King</hi> sits in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and his <hi>Prelates, Peeres,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> attend him, he is in the <hi>Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his <hi>Orb</hi>: So, I wish things, may be so carried, that he may be then, in greatest <hi>Serenity,</hi> and <hi>Benignity,</hi> of <hi>Aspect</hi>; shining upon his <hi>People,</hi> both in <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi> Now you know well, that that the <hi>shining</hi> of the <hi>sun,</hi> fair upon the <hi>ground,</hi> whereby all things exhilarate, and do fructifie; is either hindered by <hi>Clouds</hi> above, or <hi>Mists</hi> below; perhaps by <hi>Brambles,</hi> and <hi>Briars,</hi> that grow upon the <hi>Ground</hi> it self. All which, I hope, at this time, will be dispelled, and removed.</p>
                  <p>I come now, to the last part of your <hi>Speech,</hi> concerning the <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4. Part.</note> But before, I deliver, his <hi>Majesties</hi> Answer, respectively, in particular; I am to speak unto you, some few words in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: Wherein, in effect, I shall but glean; His <hi>Majesty,</hi> having so excellently, and fully, expressed himself.</p>
                  <p>For that, that can be spoken, pertinently, must be, either touching the <hi>Subject,</hi> or <hi>Matter,</hi> of <hi>Parliament Businesse</hi>; Or of the <hi>Manner,</hi> and <hi>Carriage</hi> of the same; Or lastly, of the <hi>Time,</hi> and the <hi>Husbanding,</hi> and <hi>Marshalling,</hi> of <hi>Time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Matters,</hi> to be handled, in <hi>Parliament,</hi> they are, either of <hi>Church, State, Lawes,</hi> or <hi>Grievances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the First two, concerning <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>State</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ye have heard, the <hi>King</hi> himself speak, and as the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith; <hi>Who is he, that in such things shall come after the King?</hi> For the other two, I shall say somewhat, but very shortly.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Lawes,</hi> they are Things proper, for your own Element: And therefore therein, ye are rather to lead, then to be led. Only, it is not amisse, to put you in mind, of two Things: The one, that you do not <hi>multiply,</hi> or <hi>accumulate, Lawes,</hi> more then ye need. There is a Wise, and Learned, <hi>Civilian,</hi> that applies, the <hi>Curse</hi> of the <hi>Prophet, Pluet super eos Laqueos, To Multiplicity</hi> of <hi>Lawes</hi>; For
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51170:62"/>
they do but ensnare, and entangle the <hi>People.</hi> I wish rather, that ye should either revive good <hi>Lawes,</hi> that are fallen, and disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; Or provide, against the slack execution, of <hi>Lawes,</hi> which are already in Force; Or meet, with the subtile Evasion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, from <hi>Lawes,</hi> which <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Craft,</hi> hath undermined; then to make, <hi>Novas Creaturas Legum, Lawes upon a new Mould.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other <hi>Point,</hi> touching <hi>Lawes,</hi> is; That ye busie not your selves, too much, in private <hi>Bills</hi>; except it be in <hi>Gases,</hi> wherein the Help, and Arm, of ordinary <hi>Iustice,</hi> is too short.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Grievances,</hi> his <hi>Majesty,</hi> hath with great Grace, and Benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, opened himself. Neverthelesse, the Limitations, which may make up your <hi>Grievances,</hi> not to beat the Air only, but to sort, to a desired effect, are<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> principally, two. The one, (to use his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi> term,) that ye do not <hi>Hunt</hi> after <hi>Grievances</hi>; Such as may seem, rather, to be stirred here, when ye are met, then to have sprung, from the desires of the Country: Ye are to <hi>represent</hi> the <hi>People</hi>; ye are not to <hi>personate</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>The other, that ye do not, heap up <hi>Grievances,</hi> as if <hi>Numbers</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> should make a <hi>shew,</hi> where the <hi>Weight</hi> is small; Or as if, all things amiss, (like <hi>Plato's Common wealth,</hi>) should be remedied at once. It is certain, that the best <hi>Governments,</hi> yea and the best <hi>Men,</hi> are like the best <hi>precious Stones,</hi> wherein every Flaw, or Isickle, or Grain, are seen, and noted more, then in those, that are, generally, foul, and corrupted.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, contain, your selves, within that Moderation, as may appear to bend, rather to the Effectuall Ease of the <hi>People,</hi> then to a Discursive Envy, or scandall upon the <hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Manner,</hi> of <hi>Carriage,</hi> of <hi>Parliament Businesse,</hi> ye must know, that ye deal with a <hi>King,</hi> that hath been longer <hi>King,</hi> then any of you, have been <hi>Parliament Men</hi>; And a <hi>King,</hi> that is no lesse sensible, of <hi>Formes,</hi> then of <hi>Matter</hi>; And is as far, from induring Diminution, of <hi>Majesty,</hi> as from regarding <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lattery,</hi> or <hi>Vain Glory</hi>; And a <hi>King,</hi> that understandeth, as well, the Pulse, of the Hearts, of People, as his own Orb. And therefore, both let your Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have a decent, and Reverent Form, and Stile; And (to use the words of former <hi>Parliaments,</hi>) let them be, <hi>Tanquam Gemitus Columbae,</hi> without Pique, or Harshnesse; And on the other side, in that ye do for the <hi>King,</hi> Let it have a Mark, of <hi>Vnity, Alacrity,</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi>; which will be of this Force; That whatsoever ye do, in substance, will be doubled in Reputation abroad, as in a Crystall Glass.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Time,</hi> if ever <hi>Parliament</hi> was to be measured by the Houre-glass, it is this; In regard of the instant Occasion, flying away irrecoverably. Therefore let your <hi>Speeches,</hi> in the <hi>House,</hi> be the <hi>Speeches</hi> of <hi>Counsellors,</hi> and not of <hi>Oratours:</hi> Let your <hi>Committees,</hi> tend to dispatch, not to dispute; And so marshall the <hi>Times,</hi> as the publique Businesse, especially the proper Businesse, of the <hi>Parliament</hi> be put first; And private <hi>Bills</hi> be put last, as time
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51170:62"/>
shall give leave, or within the spaces, of the <hi>Publique.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Foure <hi>Petitions,</hi> his <hi>Majesty</hi> is pleased to grant them all, as liberally, as the Ancient, and true Custom, of <hi>Parliament,</hi> doth warrant; And with the cautions, that have ever gon with them; That is to say; That the <hi>priviledge,</hi> be not used, for Defrauding of Creditours, and Defeating of ordinary Justice: That <hi>Liberty</hi> of, <hi>Speech,</hi> turn not into License; but be joyned, with that Gravity, and Discretion, as may tast of Duty, and Love, to your <hi>Soveraign,</hi> Reverence to your own <hi>Assembly,</hi> and Respect to the <hi>Matters</hi> ye handle. That your <hi>Accesses,</hi> be at such fit Times, as may stand best with his <hi>Majesties</hi> pleasure, and Occasions. That <hi>Mistakings,</hi> and <hi>Misunderstandings,</hi> be rather avoided, and prevented, (as much as may be,) then salved, or cleared.</p>

                        <p>It is good Advice, in dealing, with Cautelous, and Malicious, persons; Whose Speech, is ever at distance, with their Meanings; <hi>Non quid dixerint, sed quò spectârint, videndum:</hi> A Man, is not to regard, what they affirm, or what they hold; But, what they would convey, under their pretended Discovery, and what turn they would serve. It soundeth strangely, in the Eares, of an <hi>English Man</hi>; That the Miseries, of the <hi>present State,</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> exceed them, of former times, whatsoever. One would, strait-way, think with himself; Doth this Man beleeve what he saith? Or not beleeving it, doth he think it possible, to make us beleeve it? Surely, in my conceit, neither of both; But his End, no doubt, was, to round the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Eare, by seeming, to tell a Tale, to the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> For such Bookes, are ever wont, to be translated, into diverse <hi>Languages</hi>: And, no doubt, the Man, was not so simple, as to think, he could perswade, the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the Contrary, of what they tast, and feele. But he thought, he might better abuse, the States, abroad, if he directed his Speech to them, who could best convict him, and disprove him, if he said untrue: So that, as <hi>Livy</hi> saith, in the like case; <hi>AEtolos, magis, coram quibus verba facerent, quam ad quos, pensi habere: That the</hi> Aaetolians, <hi>in their Tale, did more respect those, which did over-hear them, then those, to whom they directed their Speech:</hi> So, in this matter, this Fellow, cared not, to be counted a <hi>Lier,</hi> by all

And to move him hereunto, <hi>Lopez</hi> set before <hi>Andrada,</hi> that if he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him, he should have credit, to work his Deliverie; Whereas, if he did impeach him, he was not like, to find, any other Means, of Favour. By which subtil perswasion, <hi>Andrada,</hi> when he came to be examined, answered, according to the Direction, and Lessoning, which <hi>Lopez</hi> had given him.

This Jewell, when <hi>Lopez</hi> had accepted, he cunningly cast with himself; That if he should offer it, to her <hi>Majesty,</hi> first, He was assured, she would not take it; Next, that thereby, he should lay her asleep, and make her Secure of him, for greater Matters; According to the saying; <hi>Fraus sibi fidem in parvis praestruit, ut in magnis opprimat</hi>; which accordingly he did, with Protestations of his Fidelity: And her <hi>Majesty,</hi> as a <hi>Princesse</hi> of Magnanimity, not apt to fear, or suspicion, returned it to him, with Gracious words.</p>

at his Landing; And about him, were found the <hi>Letters</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, written in <hi>Iargon,</hi> or <hi>Verball Cyphar,</hi> but yet somewhat sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious, in these words; <hi>This Bearer will tell you, the price, in which your Pearles are esteemed, and in what resolution, we rest, about a little Musk, and Amber, which I am determined to buy.</hi> Which Words, the said <hi>Manuel Louys,</hi> afterwards, voluntarily confessed, to be desciphered, in this sort; That by the <hi>Allowance</hi> of the <hi>Pearles,</hi> he meant, that the <hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> and the <hi>Secretary,</hi> did gladly accept, the Offer of <hi>Lopez,</hi> to <hi>poyson the Queen,</hi> signified by <hi>Ferre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi> Letter; And for the Provision, of <hi>Amber,</hi> and <hi>Musk,</hi> it was meant, that the <hi>Count,</hi> looked shortly, for a Resolution from the <hi>King of Spain</hi>: concerning a Matter of importance; Which was, For <hi>Burning</hi> of the <hi>Queens Ships,</hi> and another Point, tending to the satisfaction, of their Vindicative Humour.</p>
                  <p>But while the sense, of this former <hi>Letter,</hi> rested ambiguous; And that, no direct particular, was confessed, by <hi>Ferrera</hi>; Nor sufficient Light given, to ground, any rigorous examination, of him; Cometh over <hi>Manuel Louys,</hi> with the Resolution from <hi>Spain</hi>: Who first understanding, of <hi>Ferrera's</hi> Restraint; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doubting, how far things were discovered, to shadow the matter, like a cunning Companion, gave advertisement, of an Intent he had, to do service, and hereupon obtained a Pasport. But after his comming in, he made no hast, to reveal any thing, but thought to dally, and abuse, in some other sort. And while the Light was thus in the Clouds, there was also intercepted, a little <hi>Ticket,</hi> which <hi>Ferrera,</hi> in Prison, had found meanes, to write, in care to conceale <hi>Lopez,</hi> and to keep him out of danger, to give a Caveat of staying all further Answers, and Advertisements, in these Causes. Whereupon, <hi>Lopez</hi> was first called in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
                  <p>But in Conclusion, this matter being with all Assiduity, and Pollicy, more and more, pierced, and mined into; First, there was won, from <hi>Manuel Louys,</hi> his <hi>Letters,</hi> from the <hi>Count de Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes,</hi> and <hi>Secretary Iuara,</hi> to <hi>Ferrera</hi>; In both which, mention is made, of the <hi>Queens Death.</hi> In that of the <hi>Counts,</hi> under the Term, of a <hi>Commission</hi>; And in that of the <hi>Secretaries,</hi> under the Term, of the <hi>Great Service,</hi> whereof should arise, an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall <hi>Benefit,</hi> to the <hi>whole World.</hi> Also the <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Credit,</hi> written by <hi>Gonzalo Gomez</hi>; One to <hi>Pedro de Carrera</hi>; And the other, to <hi>Iuan Pallacio,</hi> to take up, a sum of Money, by <hi>Emanuel Louys,</hi> by the foresaid false Name, of <hi>Fr. de Thores; Letters</hi> so large, and in a manner, without Limitation, as any sum, by vertue thereof, mought be taken up. Which <hi>Letters,</hi> were delivered, to <hi>Louys,</hi> by the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> own hands, with directions, to shew them to <hi>Lopez,</hi> for his assurance. A matter, of Gods secret work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in staying the same; For thereupon, rested only, the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, of the Fact of <hi>Lopez.</hi> Upon so narrow a point, consisted the safety, of her <hi>Majesties</hi> Life; already, sold by Avarice, to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51170:93"/>
Mallice and Ambition; But extraordinarily, preserved, by that <hi>Watchman, which never slunbreth.</hi> This same <hi>Emanuel Louys,</hi> and <hi>Steven Ferrera</hi> also; Whereof the one, mannaged the Matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; And the other, resided here, to give correspondence, never meeting, after <hi>Emanuel</hi> had returned, severally examined, without Torture, or Threatning, did, in the end, voluntarily, and clearly, confesse the Matters, above mentioned: And in their Confessions, fully consent, and concur; Not only in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but in all points, particularities, and Circumstances: Which confessions, appear expressed, in their own Naturall Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, testified, and subscribed, with their own Hands; And in open Assembly, at the <hi>Arraignment</hi> of <hi>Lopez,</hi> in the <hi>Guild hall,</hi> were, by them confirmed, and avouched, to <hi>Lopez</hi> his face; And therewithall are extant, undefaced, the Originall <hi>Letters,</hi> from <hi>Count de Fuente, Secretary Iuara,</hi> and the Rest.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Lopez</hi> himself, at his first Apprehension, and Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did indeed deny; And deny, with deep, and terrible Oathes, and Execrations, the very Conferences, and Treaties, with <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera,</hi> or <hi>Andrada,</hi> about the <hi>Empoysonment.</hi> And being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if they were proved against him, what he would say? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; <hi>That he would yield himself guilty, of the Fact intended.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse, being afterwards confronted by <hi>Ferrera,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly maintained to him, all that he said; Reducing him, to the Times, and places, of the said <hi>Conferences,</hi> he confessed the Matter; As by his <hi>Confession,</hi> in writing, signed with his own Hand, appeareth. But then he fell, to that slender Evasion, as his last Refuge; That he meant, onely, to cousen the <hi>King of Spain,</hi> of the Money; And in that he continued, at his <hi>Arraignment</hi>; when, notwithstanding, at the first, he did retract his own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>; And yet, being asked, whither he was drawn, either by Mean of Torture, or promise of Life, to make the same <hi>Confession,</hi> he did openly testifie, that no such Means, was used towards him.</p>
                  <p>But the Falshood of this Excuse, being an Allegation, that any <hi>Traytour</hi> may use, and provide for himself, is convicted, by three notable <hi>Proofes.</hi> The first, That he never opened this Matter, neither unto her <hi>Majesty,</hi> unto whom he had ordinary Accesse; Nor to any <hi>Counseller</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> to have permission, to toll on, and inveagle these Parties, with whom he did treat, if it had been thought so convenient. Wherein, percase, he had opportunity, to have done, some good service, for the further Discovery, of their secret Machinations, against her <hi>Majesties Life.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that he came, too late, to this shift; Having first bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his guilty Conscience, in denying those Treaties, and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, till they were, evidently, and manifestly, proved to his Face. The third, that in conferring, with <hi>Ferrera,</hi> about the manner, of his assurance, he thought it better, to have the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in the Hands, of such <hi>Merchants,</hi> as he should name in <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi>;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51170:93"/>
then to have brought it into <hi>England</hi>: Declaring his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be, after the Fact done, speedily to fly to <hi>Antwerp</hi>; And there, to tarry some time, and so to convey himself, to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>; where it is affirmed, that <hi>Don Salomon,</hi> a Jew, in good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, is <hi>Lopez</hi> his near <hi>Kinsman</hi>; And that, he is greatly favoured, by the said <hi>Don Salomon</hi>; whereby, it is evident, that <hi>Lopez,</hi> had cast his Reckonings, upon the supposition, of the Fact done.</p>
                  <p>Thus may appear, both, how justly, this <hi>Lopez</hi> is condemned, for the Highest <hi>Treason</hi>; that can be imagined; And how, by <hi>Gods</hi> marvellous Goodness, her <hi>Majesty,</hi> hath been preserved. And surely, if a Man do truly consider, it is hard to say; Whither <hi>God,</hi> hath done greater things, <hi>By</hi> her <hi>Majesty,</hi> or <hi>For</hi> Her: If you ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

First, because, as the former sort, doth deface, the <hi>Government,</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in the persons of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi>; So the other, doth lead into Contempt, the Exercises of <hi>Religion,</hi> in the Persons of sundry <hi>Preachers:</hi> So as it disgraceth an higher matter, though in the meaner Person.</p>
                  <p>Next, I find, certain indiscreet, and dangerous Amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if the <hi>Civill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To conclude this Point; As it were to be wished, that these <hi>Writings,</hi> had been abortive, and never seen the Sun; So the next is, since they be commen abroad, that they be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, (by all that have Understanding, and Conscience,) as the untemperate Extravagancies, of some Light persons. Yea, further, that Men beware, (except they mean to adventure, to deprive themselves, of all sense of <hi>Religion,</hi> and to pave their own Hearts, and make them as the High Way,) how they be conversant in them; And much more, how they delight in that Vein; But rather to turn their <hi>Laughing,</hi> into <hi>Blushing</hi>; And to be ashamed, as of a <hi>short Madnesse</hi>; That they have, in matters
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51170:96"/>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> taken their Disport, and Solace. But this, perchance, is of these Faults, which will be soonest acknowledged; Though I perceive, neverthelesse, that there want not some, who seek to blaunch, and excuse it.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Wrongs</hi> of them, which are possessed, of the <hi>Government,</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> towards the other, may, hardly, be dissembled, or Excused. They have charged them, as though, they <hi>denied Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

They have been swift of Credit, to receive Accusations against them, from those, that have quarrelled with them, but for speaking, against Sin, and Vice. Their Accusations, and Inquisitions, have been strict, Swearing Men to <hi>Blanks,</hi> and <hi>Generalities</hi>; Not included within compass of Matter certain; Which the Party, which is to take the <hi>Oath,</hi> may comprehend, to be, a Thing Captious, and Strainable.

As for their easie <hi>Silencing</hi> of them, in such great scarcety of Preachers, it is to punish the People, and not them. Ought they not, (I mean the <hi>Bishop,</hi>) to keep one Eye open, To looke upon the Good, that the Men do; but to fix them both, upon the Hurt, that they suppose commeth by them? Indeed, such as are intemperate, and Incorrigible, <hi>God</hi> forbid they should be permitted to Preach: But shall every inconsiderate Word, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, captiously watched, and for the most part, hardly enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, be as a Forfeiture, of their voice, &amp; Gift, in preaching? As for sundry particular Molestations, I take no pleasure to recite them.

And it is truly said; <hi>Tam sunt Mores qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Schismatici, quam Dogmata Schismatica: There be as well Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Fashions, as Opinions.</hi> First, they have impropriated, unto themselves, the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Zealous, Sincere,</hi> and <hi>Reformed</hi>; As if, all others, were <hi>Cold, Minglers</hi> of <hi>Holy Things, and Prophane,</hi> and <hi>Friends of Abuses:</hi> Yea, be a man indued, with great Vertues, and fruitfull in good workes; yet if he concur not with them, they term him, (in Derogation,) a <hi>Civill,</hi> and <hi>Morall, Man</hi>; And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him, to <hi>Socrates,</hi> or some <hi>Heathen Philosopher</hi>: Whereas the <hi>Wisedom</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> teacheth us otherwise: Namely, to judge, and denominate Men <hi>Religious,</hi> according to their <hi>Works,</hi> of the <hi>Second Table</hi>: Because they of the <hi>First,</hi> are often <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> and practised in <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> So Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith; <hi>That a Man, doth vainly boast, of Loving God, whom he never saw, if he love not his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom he hath seen.</hi> And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith; <hi>This is true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to visite the Fatherlesse, and the Widow.</hi> So as that, which is, with them, but <hi>Philosophicall,</hi> and <hi>Morall,</hi> is, in the <hi>Apostles</hi> Phrase, <hi>True Religion, and Christianity.</hi> As in Affection, they challenge, the said <hi>Vertues</hi> of <hi>Zeal,</hi> and the rest; So in Knowledge, they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute unto themselves, <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Perfection.</hi> They say, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>King Edwards</hi> time, and in the Beginning of her <hi>Majesties Raign,</hi> was but in the <hi>Cradle</hi>; And the <hi>Bishops,</hi> in those times, did somewhat, for <hi>Day-Break</hi>; But that, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as they censure, <hi>vertuous Names,</hi> by the Names, of <hi>Civill,</hi> and <hi>Morall</hi>; So do they censure <hi>Men,</hi> truly, and godly wise, (who see into the vanity of their Affections,) by the name of <hi>Politicks</hi>: saying, that their Wisdome, is but Carnall, and sav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now, for their own <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> what is it? Surely, they exhort well, and work Compunction of Mind; And bring Men well to the Question; <hi>Viri, Fratres, quid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither, indeed, are many of them, able, to do it; What through want, of Grounded knowledge; What through want, of Study, and Time.

                  <p>Another Point, of great Inconvenience, and perill, is, to enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the <hi>People,</hi> to hear <hi>Controversies,</hi> and all Kinds of <hi>Doctrine.</hi> They say, no part, of the Counsell, of God, is to be suppressed, nor the People defrauded.

                  <p>Another <hi>Extremity,</hi> is the <hi>Excessive Magnifying</hi> of that, which though it be a principall, and most holy Institution; yet hath it Limits, as all things else have. We see, wheresoever, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they find in the <hi>Scriptures; The Word,</hi> spoken of, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it of <hi>Preaching.</hi> They have made it, in a manner, of the <hi>Essence,</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> to have a <hi>Sermon</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent. They have, in a sort, annihilated the use of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and <hi>Formes</hi> of <hi>Divine Service</hi>; Although, the <hi>House of God</hi> be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, of the Principall, <hi>Domus Orationis; A House of Prayer, and not a House of Preaching.</hi> As for the Life, of the good <hi>Monks,</hi> and <hi>Hermits,</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> I know, they will condemne a Man, as half a <hi>Papist,</hi> if he should maintain them, as other then Prophane, because they heard no <hi>Sermons.</hi> In the mean time, what <hi>Preaching</hi> is, and who may be said to <hi>Preach,</hi> they move no <hi>Question.</hi> But, (as far, as I see,) every man, that presumeth to speak in <hi>Chair,</hi> is accounted a <hi>Preacher.</hi> But I am assured, that not a few, that call hotly, for a <hi>Preaching Ministery,</hi> deserve to be the First themselves, that should be expelled.

that would think it, a Tempting of God, to hear, or read, what may be said against them: As if there could be, A, <hi>Quod bonum est, tenete</hi>; without an <hi>Omnia probate,</hi> going before.</p>
                  <p>This may suffice, to offer unto themselves, a Thought, and Consideration, whether, In these things, they do well, or no? And to correct, and asswage, the Partiality, of their <hi>Followers.</hi> For as for any Man, that shall, hereby, enter into a Contempt of their <hi>Ministery</hi>; it is but his own <hi>Hardness</hi> of <hi>Hart.</hi> I know, the work of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> doth chiefly rest, upon these Men, and they have Zeal, and Hate, of Sin. But again, let them take Heed, that it be not true, which one of their Adversaries said; <hi>That they have but two small wants; Knowledge, and Love.</hi> And so I conclude this <hi>Point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last Point, touching the due <hi>Publishing,</hi> and <hi>Debating,</hi> of these <hi>Controversies,</hi> needeth no long Speech. This strange Abuse, of Antiques, and Pasquils, hath been touched before. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I repeat that, which I said; That a Character of <hi>Love,</hi> is more proper for Debates, of this Nature, then that of <hi>Zeal:</hi> As for all direct, or indirect, Glaunces, or Levels, at Mens <hi>Persons,</hi> they were ever, in these Causes, disallowed.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, whatsoever be pretended, the <hi>People</hi> is no meet <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator</hi>; but rather the quiet, modest, and private Assemblies, and Conferences, of the <hi>Learned. Qui apud Incapacem loquitur, non disceptat, sed calumniatur.</hi> The <hi>Presse,</hi> and <hi>Pulpit,</hi> would be freed, and discharged, of these Contentions: Neither Promotion, on the one Side; nor Glory, and Heat, on the other Side, ought to continue those <hi>Challenges,</hi> and <hi>Cartells,</hi> at the <hi>Crosse,</hi> and other Places. But rather, all Preachers, especially such as be of good temper, and have Wisdome with Conscience, ought to inculcate, and beat upon a Peace, Silence, and Surseance. Neither let them fear <hi>Solons Law,</hi> which compelled, in Factions, every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Person, to range himself, on the one side; Nor yet, the fond <hi>Calumny of Neutrality.</hi> But let them know, that is true, which is said by a <hi>wise Man; That Neuters, in Contentions, are either better, or worse, then either Side.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things have I, in all sincerity, and simplicity, set down, touching the <hi>Controversies,</hi> which now trouble, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And that, without all Art, and Insinuation. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not like to be gratefull, to either Part. Notwithstanding, I trust, what hath been said, shall find a Correspondence, in their minds, which are not embarqued in Partiality; And which love the Whole, better then a Part. Wherefore, I am not, out of hope that it may do good; At the least, I shall not repent my self, of the <hi>Meditation.</hi>

For there hath scarce been known a <hi>King,</hi> that hath lived, to an Extreame, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Old-age, but he hath suffered some Detriment, in his <hi>Territories,</hi> and gone lesse in his <hi>Reputation.</hi> Of which Thing, there is a most eminent Example, in <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Second, King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> a most puissant <hi>Prince,</hi> and an Excellent <hi>Governer</hi>; Who, in the last years of his Life, and Impotent Old-age, was sensible of this, whereof we speak; And therefore, with great circumspection, submitted Himself, to Natures Law; Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily surrendred the Territories he had gotten in <hi>France</hi>; Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished a Firm Peace in that <hi>Kingdom</hi>; Attempted the like in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Places; That so, He might transmit his <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Entire, to his next <hi>Heir.</hi> Contrary-wise, <hi>Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this <hi>Desire,</hi> in her, of <hi>Peace,</hi> together with her fortunate accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment thereof, I reckon to be one, of her chiefest Praises. For this was Happy for her Times, Comely for her Sex, and Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to her Conscience.

For the <hi>Succours,</hi> sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Netherlands, France,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>; The <hi>Expeditions</hi> by <hi>Sea</hi> into both the <hi>Indies,</hi> whereof some circled the whole <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi>; The <hi>Fleets</hi> sent into <hi>Portugall</hi> and to annoy the Coasts of <hi>Spain</hi>; And lastly, the often Suppressions, and Overthrows, of the <hi>Rebells</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi>; did both shew the warlike Prowesse of our <hi>Nation,</hi> to be no whit diminished; And did much encrease the <hi>Renown</hi> of the <hi>Queen.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is another Cause also, for which we may justly admire, this Peace, so constantly pursued, and maintained, by the <hi>Queen.</hi> And that is, that it did not proceed, from any <hi>Bent,</hi> or <hi>Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of those <hi>Times</hi>; But from the <hi>Prudency,</hi> of her <hi>Government,</hi> and discreet <hi>Carriage</hi> of Things. For whereas, she her self, was not without manifest Danger, from an ill affected <hi>Party</hi> at home, for the Cause of <hi>Religion</hi>; And that the Strength and Forces of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> were in the Place of a Bulwark, to all <hi>Europe,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the then dreadfull, and overflowing, Ambition, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>; She might have apprehended just Cause of a <hi>War</hi>: But, as she was still ready, with her <hi>Councell,</hi> so she was not, behind hand, with her Forces. And this we are taught by an Event, the most Memorable, of any in our time, if we look upon the <hi>Felicity</hi> thereof. For when as the <hi>Spanish Navy,</hi> (set forth with such wonderfull Preparations, in all kinds; the Terrour, and Amazement of all <hi>Europe</hi>; Carried on with almost Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of victory;) came braving upon our <hi>Seas</hi>; It took not so much, as one poor Cock-boat of ours, nor fired any one Village, nor landed one Man upon <hi>English Ground</hi>; But was utterly defeated, and after a shamefull Flight, and many shipwracks, quite dispersed; So as the <hi>Peace,</hi> of this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> was never more Firm, and Solid. Neither was her <hi>Felicity</hi> lesse, in Escaping Treacherous <hi>Attempts</hi> at home, then in subduing, and Defeating, forrain <hi>Invasions.</hi> For not a few <hi>Treasons,</hi> plotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her Life, were, most fortunately, discovered, and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And this was no cause, to make her lead, a more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or diffident, life, then before. No new <hi>Encrease</hi> of her <hi>Guard</hi>; No <hi>Immuring</hi> her self within her own Walls, or Forbearing to be
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51170:106"/>
seen abroad; But as one assured, and confident; And that was more mindfull of her <hi>Escape</hi> from <hi>Danger,</hi> then of the <hi>Danger</hi> it self, she was constant, to her former Customes, and Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, it is worth our labour, to consider the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Times,</hi> in which she <hi>Raigned.</hi> For there are some <hi>Times,</hi> so <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,</hi> and <hi>Ignorant,</hi> that it is no greater matter, to govern <hi>People,</hi> then to govern a <hi>Flock</hi> of <hi>Sheep.</hi> But this <hi>Queen,</hi> fell upon Times, of singular Learning, and Sufficiency; In which, it was not possible, to be eminent, without admirable Endowments of wit, and a Rare Temper of Vertue. Again, the <hi>Raignes</hi> of <hi>Women,</hi> are, For the most part, obscured by their <hi>Husbands</hi>: Upon whom, all their Praises, and worthy Acts, do re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this was the peculiar Glory of this <hi>Princesse</hi>; That she had no Props, or Supports, of her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but those, that were, of her own making. She had no <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of her <hi>Mother</hi>; No <hi>Vnckle</hi>; None other of the <hi>Royall Bloud</hi> and <hi>Linage,</hi> that might be <hi>Partner</hi> in her <hi>Cares,</hi> and an <hi>Vphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of the <hi>Regall Dignity.</hi> And as for those, whom she raised to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> she carried such a discreet Hand over them, and so enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed her Favour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi>; she was strook with a <hi>Torpour,</hi> and <hi>Frigidity</hi> in her <hi>Nerves</hi>; Notwithstanding, which is rare in such <hi>Diseases,</hi> she retained both her <hi>Speech,</hi> and <hi>Memory,</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> though but flow and weak, even to the end. And in this Case, she continued, but a few dayes; So as it cannot be called, the <hi>Last Act</hi> of her <hi>Life,</hi> but the <hi>First step</hi> to her <hi>Death.</hi> For as it is, a Miserable Condition, to see the Facultie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, of our Body, buried before us; And to survive long after them; So it is a Faire, and Naturall, Conclusion of our Life, when the Senses, are, by little and little, layd asleep, that the Dissolution of the whole, should immediatly follow.</p>
                  <p>I will adde one Thing more, to make up, the full Measure, of her <hi>Felicity:</hi> which is, that she was not only most Happy, in her own <hi>Person,</hi> but in the Abilities, and vertues of her <hi>Servants,</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> For she was served by such <hi>Persons,</hi> as, I suppose, this <hi>Island</hi> never brought forth the like, before her Times. Now when <hi>God</hi> beareth a love to <hi>Kings,</hi> no doubt, he raiseth up, the <hi>Spirits,</hi> of <hi>Wise Servants,</hi> as a concurrent Blessing.</p>
                  <p>There are two faire <hi>Issues,</hi> of her <hi>Happinesse,</hi> born to her, since her <hi>Death</hi>; I conceive, not lesse Glorious, and Eminent, then those she enjoyed a live. The one of her <hi>Successour</hi>; The other of her <hi>Memory.</hi> For she hath gotten such a <hi>Successour,</hi> who although for his <hi>Masculine Vertues,</hi> and <hi>Blessing</hi> of <hi>Posterity,</hi> and <hi>Addition</hi> of <hi>Territories,</hi> he may be said, to exceed her Greatnesse, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to obscure it; Notwithstanding, he is most zealous, of her Name, and Glory; And doth even give, a <hi>Perpetuity</hi> to her <hi>Acts</hi>; Considering both in the Choice of the <hi>Persons,</hi> and in the <hi>Orders,</hi> &amp; <hi>Institutions</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> he hath departed so little from her. So as, a <hi>Son</hi> could hardly succeed a <hi>Father,</hi> with lesse Noise, or Inno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vation. As for her <hi>Memory,</hi> it hath gotten such Life, in the Mouths, and Hearts, of Men, as that, Envy being put out by her Death, and her Fame lighted, I cannot say, whether the <hi>Felicity</hi> of her <hi>Life,</hi> or the <hi>Felicity</hi> of her <hi>Memory,</hi> be the greater. For if (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) there fly abroad, any factious <hi>Fames,</hi> of Her, raised either by Discontented <hi>Persons,</hi> or such, as are averse in <hi>Religion</hi>; (which notwithstanding dare now scarce shew their Faces, and are every where cryed down;) The same, are neither true, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they be long liv'd. And for this cause especially, have I made this <hi>Collection,</hi> (such as it is,) touching her <hi>Felicity,</hi> and the Marks of <hi>Gods</hi> Favour towards Her; That no malicious Person, should dare to interpose a <hi>Curse,</hi> where <hi>God</hi> hath given a <hi>Blessing.</hi> Now if any Man, shall alledge that against me, which was once said to <hi>Caesar; We see what we may admire, but we would fain see what
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51170:107"/>
we can commend</hi>; Certainly, for my part, I hold true <hi>Admiration,</hi> to be the highest Degree of <hi>Commendation.</hi> And besides, such <hi>Felicities</hi> as we have recounted, could not befall any <hi>Princesse,</hi> but such an one, as was extraordinarily supported, and cherished by <hi>Gods</hi> Favour; And had much in her own <hi>Person,</hi> &amp; Rare <hi>Vertues,</hi> to create, and work out, unto her self, such a <hi>Fortune.</hi> Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I have thought good, to insert something now, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her <hi>Morall Part</hi>; Yet only in those things, which have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred occasion, to some Mallicious Tongues, to traduce her.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Queen,</hi> as touching her <hi>Religion,</hi> was <hi>Pious; Moderate; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,</hi> and an Enemy to <hi>Novelty.</hi> First for her <hi>Piety</hi>; Though the same were most conspicuous, in her <hi>Acts,</hi> and the <hi>Form</hi> of her <hi>Government</hi>; yet it was Pourtrayed also, in the common Course of her <hi>Life,</hi> and her daily <hi>Comportment.</hi> Seldome would she be absent, from Hearing <hi>Divine Service,</hi> and other Duties of <hi>Religion,</hi> either in her <hi>Chappell,</hi> or in her <hi>Privy Closet.</hi> In the reading of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> especially of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> she was very Frequent: She composed certain <hi>Prayers,</hi> her self, upon emergent occasions. Whensoever she named <hi>God,</hi> though it were in common discourse, she would, for the most part, adde, The Title of <hi>Maker</hi>; saying; <hi>God my Maker:</hi> And compose, both her Eyes, and Countenance, to a Submisnesse, and Reverence. This I have often (my self) observed, being in her presence. Now whereas some have divulged her unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of <hi>Mortality,</hi> in that she would never endure any Menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either of her <hi>Age,</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> it is most false: For she would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and that, many years, before her Death, with a great deal of Meeknesse, professe, that she found her self grown, an old Woman; And she would, sometimes, open her self, what she liked best, for an <hi>Inscription</hi> upon her <hi>Tombe</hi>; Saying; That she loved no pompous, or vain-glorious, Titles, but would onely have, a Line, or two, for her Memory; wherein, her <hi>Name</hi>; and her <hi>Virginity</hi>; and the years of her <hi>Raign</hi>; and her Establishing of <hi>Religion</hi>; and her Maintaining of <hi>Peace</hi>; should be, in the fewest words, comprehended. It is true, that whilest she was in her vigorous years, and able to bear Children, if at any time she were moved, to declare her <hi>Successour,</hi> she would make Answer; <hi>That she would never endure, to see her winding sheet, before her Eyes.</hi> And yet notwithstanding, some few years, before her death, one day, when she was in a deep Meditation, and, (as it may be ghessed,) in that of her <hi>Mortality,</hi> One, that might be bold, said unto her; <hi>Madam, there are divers Offices, and great places in the state, which you keep too long void;.</hi> She arose up, in some displeasure, and said; <hi>I am sure, my Office will not be long void.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for her <hi>Moderateness</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> I shall seem to be at a stand, in regard of the Severe <hi>Lawes,</hi> made against her <hi>Subjects,</hi> of the <hi>Romish Religion.</hi> Notwithstanding, that which I shall say, is no more, then what I know for certain, and diligently observed.

Most certain it is, that it was the Firm Resolution, of this <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,</hi> not to offer any violence to <hi>Consciences:</hi> But then, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Side, not to suffer the State of her <hi>Kingdome,</hi> to be ruined, under pretence of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> Out of this Fountain, she concluded; First, That to allow Freedome, and Toleration, of two <hi>Religions,</hi> by publick <hi>Authority,</hi> in a <hi>Nation</hi> Fierce, and Warlike; And that would easily fall, from Dissention of Minds, to Siding and Blowes, would bring inevitable Ruin to this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Again, in the Newnesse of her <hi>Raign,</hi> when there was a generall distrust, she singled out some of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> of the most Turbulent, and Factious, Spirits, and commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, as a wise Lady, and of a high Courage, she was not a whit terrified, at the <hi>Roaring</hi> of a <hi>Bull</hi>; Being well assured, of her <hi>Peoples</hi> Love, and Fidelity, to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards her; As also of the Disability, of the <hi>Popish Faction,</hi> within the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> to do her Hurt, if no <hi>Forraign Enemy</hi> joyned with them. But then, about the three and twentieth year of her <hi>Raign,</hi> there followed a Mighty Change. And this Distinction of the Times, is not any Device of mine, but it is expressed in the publick <hi>Acts</hi> of that <hi>Time,</hi> and, as it were, <hi>cut in Brasse.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>year,</hi> was there never any <hi>Capitall or severe Punishment,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon any of her <hi>Subjects,</hi> as they had Relation to the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> by the <hi>Lawes</hi> formerly made. But just then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan that proud, and vast Intention of <hi>Spain,</hi> to conquer this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> by little and little, to shew it Self. Of this, the principall Part was, to stir up, by all means, a <hi>Party</hi> within the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> of such, as were ill affected to the <hi>State,</hi> and desirous of <hi>Innovation,</hi> that might adhere to the <hi>Forrainer,</hi> at his Landing. For this, they had no other Hopes, then the Difference in <hi>Religion.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they set it down, to pursue this Course, with all their power. And the <hi>Seminaries,</hi> at that time, budding, <hi>Priests</hi> were sent into <hi>England,</hi> to plant, and disperse, a Love, to the <hi>Romish Religion</hi>; To teach, and inculcate, the power, of the <hi>Popes Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> in freeing Subjects from their Allegeance; And to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken, and prepare, the minds of Men, to an Expectation, of a Change.

                  <p>Now for the <hi>Constancy,</hi> of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> and the observance thereof, I know no better Argument then this; That although she found the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> confirmed, in her <hi>Sisters</hi> dayes, by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi>; And established, by all strong, and potent, Meanes, that could be devised; And to have taken, deep Root, in this <hi>Kingdom</hi>; And that all those, which had any Authority, or bare Office in the <hi>State,</hi> had subscribed to it; yet for that she saw, it was not agreeable, to the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> nor to the <hi>Primitive Purity,</hi> nor to her own <hi>Conscience,</hi> she did, with a great deal of Courage, and with the assistance, of a very few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, quite expell, and abolish it. Neither, did she this, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, and Heady Courses, but Timing it wisely, and soberly.

Nay, and her usuall Custom was, in the beginning of every <hi>Parliament,</hi> to forewarn the <hi>Houses,</hi> not to question, or innovate, any thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready established, in the <hi>Discipline,</hi> or <hi>Rites</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And thus much of her <hi>Religion.</hi>

                  <p>This <hi>Knowledge</hi> then, of making, the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> a <hi>Mirrour,</hi> for the <hi>Government</hi> of a <hi>State,</hi> being a Wisdome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most lost, (Whereof the Reason, I take to be, because of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, for one Man, to embrace both Philosophies;) I have thought good, to make some proof, (as far as my weaknesse, and the Straights, of Time, will suffer,) to, revive, in the Handling, of one particular, wherewith now I most humbly present your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty:</hi> For surely, as hath been said, it is a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Discourse,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently used towards <hi>Kings</hi>; And to what <hi>King,</hi> should it be more proper, then to a <hi>King</hi> that is stvdious, to conjoyn contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative Vertue, and Active Vertue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> is the first <hi>King,</hi> that had the Honour, to be <hi>Lapis Angularis,</hi> to unite, these two Mighty, and warlike, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> under one <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi> It doth not appear, by the Records, and Memories, of any <hi>true History</hi>; Or scarcely by the Fiction, and Pleasure, of any <hi>Fabulous Narration,</hi> or <hi>Tradition</hi>; That ever, of any Antiquity, this <hi>Island,</hi> of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> was united, under one <hi>King,</hi> before this day. And yet there be no <hi>Mountains,</hi> nor <hi>Races,</hi> of <hi>Hills</hi>; There be no <hi>Seas,</hi> or <hi>great Rivers</hi>; There is no <hi>Diversity,</hi> of Tongue, or <hi>Language,</hi> that hath invited, or provoked, this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient separation, or Divorce. The Lot of <hi>Spain</hi> was, to have the severall <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> of that Continent, (<hi>Portugall</hi> onely except,) to be united, in an Age, not long past; And now, in our Age, that of <hi>Portugall</hi> also, which was the last that held out, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate, with the rest. The Lot of <hi>France,</hi> hath been, much about the same time, likewise, to have reannexed, unto that <hi>Crown,</hi> the severall <hi>Dutchies,</hi> and <hi>Portions,</hi> which were in former times, dismembred. The Lot of this <hi>Island,</hi> is the last, reserved for your <hi>Majesties</hi> happy times, by the speciall Providence, and Favour, of <hi>God</hi>; who hath brought your <hi>Majesty,</hi> to this happy Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with great Consent of Hearts, and in the strength of your years, and in the Maturity of your Experience. It resteth, but that, (as I promised,) I set before your <hi>Majesties</hi> Princely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, the <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> touching the <hi>Vnion,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture,</hi>

of <hi>Bodies</hi>; And the <hi>Correspondence,</hi> which they have, with the <hi>Grounds of Policy,</hi> in the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> of <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, therefore, that <hi>Position; Vis unita fortior</hi>; Being one of the common Notions of the Mind, needeth not much, to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nduced, or illustrate.</p>
                  <p>We see the <hi>Sunne,</hi> when he entreth, and while he continueth, under the <hi>sign</hi> of <hi>Leo,</hi> causeth more vehement Heats, then when he is in <hi>Cancer</hi>; what time, his <hi>Beams,</hi> are, neverthelesse, more perpendicular. The Reason whereof, in great part, hath been truly ascribed, to the Conjunction, and Cor-Radi-ation, in that place of <hi>Heaven,</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> with the four <hi>Stars,</hi> of the <hi>first Magnitude; Syrius, Canicula, Cor Leonis,</hi> and <hi>Cauda Leonis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the <hi>Moon,</hi> likewise, by ancient <hi>Tradition,</hi> while she is in the same <hi>Sign,</hi> of <hi>Leo,</hi> is, said, to be at the <hi>Heart</hi>; which is not, for any Affinity, which that place of <hi>Heaven,</hi> can have, with that part, of Mans Body; But onely, because the <hi>Moon</hi> is then, by reason of the Conjunction, and Nearness, with the Stars afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, in greatest strength of Influence; And so, worketh upon that part, in <hi>Inferiour Bodies,</hi> which is most <hi>Vitall,</hi> and <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rincipall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So we see, <hi>Waters,</hi> and <hi>Liquours,</hi> in small Quantity, do, easily, putrifie, and corrupt; but in large Quantity, subsist long, by reason, of the Strength, they receive, by <hi>Vnion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> the more generall, do little hurt, by reason, of the <hi>united</hi> weight, which they offer to subvert; but narrow, and particular, <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> have, many times, overturned, whole <hi>Towns,</hi> and <hi>Cities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then, this <hi>Point,</hi> touching the Force of <hi>Vnion,</hi> is evident. And therefore, it is more fit, to speak, of the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Vnion:</hi> wherein, again, it will not be pertinent, to handle one <hi>Kind</hi> of Union, which is <hi>Vnion</hi> by <hi>Victory,</hi> when one Body, doth, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, subdue another, and converteth the same, into his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Extinguishing, and Expulsing, what part soever of it, it cannot overcome. As when the <hi>Fire,</hi> converteth the <hi>Wood,</hi> into Fire, purging away the <hi>Smoak,</hi> and the <hi>Ashes,</hi> as unapt Matter to enflame: Or when the <hi>Body,</hi> of a <hi>Living Creature,</hi> doth convert, and assimilate, <hi>Food,</hi> and <hi>Nourishment,</hi> purging, and expelling, whatsoever it cannot convert. For these Representations, do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, in matter of <hi>Policy,</hi> to <hi>Vnion</hi> of <hi>Countries,</hi> by <hi>Conquest</hi>; where the <hi>Conquering State,</hi> doth extinguish, extirpate, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse, any part of the <hi>State Conquered,</hi> which it findeth so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as it cannot alter, and convert it. And therefore, leaving <hi>violent Vnions,</hi> we will consider, onely, of <hi>Naturall Vnions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Difference</hi> is excellent, which the best <hi>Observers,</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> do take, between <hi>Compositio,</hi> and <hi>Mistio; Putting together,</hi> and <hi>Mingling:</hi> The one, being but a Conjunction, of Bodies, in place, the other, in Quali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, and Consent: The one, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Sedition, and Alteration, The other, of Peace, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51170:113"/>
Continuance: The one, rather a <hi>Confusion,</hi> then an <hi>Vnion,</hi> the other, properly, an <hi>Vnion.</hi> Therefore, we see, those Bodies, which they call <hi>Imperfectè mista,</hi> last not, but are speedily dissolved. For take, for Example, <hi>Snow</hi> or <hi>Froath,</hi> which are <hi>Compositions,</hi> of <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>Water</hi>; And in them, you may behold, how easily they sever, and dissolve, the <hi>Water,</hi> closing together, and excluding the <hi>Air.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So those three <hi>Bodies,</hi> which the <hi>Alchymists</hi> do so much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, as the three <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Things</hi>; That is to say; <hi>Earth, Water,</hi> and <hi>Oyl</hi>; (which it pleaseth them to term, <hi>Salt, Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi>;) we see, if they be united, onely, by <hi>Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or putting together, how weakly, and rudely, they do incorporate: For <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> maketh, but an unperfect slime: And if they be forced together, by <hi>Agitation,</hi> yet upon a little setling, the <hi>Earth</hi> resideth in the Bottome. So <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Oyl,</hi> though by <hi>Agitation,</hi> it be brought into an <hi>Ointment,</hi> yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little setling, the <hi>Oil</hi> will float on the Top: So as such <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Mistures,</hi> continue no longer, then they are forced; And still, in the end, the worthiest getteth above.</p>
                  <p>But otherwise it is, of <hi>perfect Mistures.</hi> For we see, these three <hi>Bodies,</hi> of <hi>Earth, Water,</hi> and <hi>Oil,</hi> when they are joyned, in a <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable,</hi> or <hi>Minerall,</hi> they are so united, as without great subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Art,</hi> and Force of <hi>Extraction,</hi> they cannot be separated, and reduced, into the same <hi>simple Bodies,</hi> again. So as the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, between <hi>Compositio,</hi> and <hi>Mistio,</hi> clearly set down, is this: That <hi>Compositio,</hi> is the Joyning, or putting together, of <hi>Bodies,</hi> without a new <hi>Form</hi>; And <hi>Mistio,</hi> is the Joyning, or putting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, of <hi>Bodies,</hi> under a new <hi>Form.</hi> For the new <hi>Form,</hi> is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune Vinculum</hi>: And without that the old <hi>Forms,</hi> will be at Strife, and Discord.</p>
                  <p>Now to reflect, this <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> upon <hi>Matter,</hi> of <hi>Estate:</hi> There hath been, put in practise, in <hi>Government,</hi> these two seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kinds, of <hi>Pollicy</hi> in <hi>Vniting</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and <hi>Conjoyning,</hi> of <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms:</hi> The one to retain the ancient <hi>Form,</hi> still severed, and onely conjoyned in <hi>Soveraignty</hi>: The other, to super induce a new <hi>Form,</hi> agreeable, and convenient, to the <hi>entire Estate.</hi> The former of these, hath been more usuall, and is more Easie; but the latter is more Happy. For if a Man, do attentively revolve, <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of all <hi>Nations,</hi> and judge truly thereupon, he will make this <hi>Conclusion:</hi> That there was never any <hi>States,</hi> that were good <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures,</hi> but the <hi>Romans.</hi> Which, because it was the best <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and is the best <hi>Example</hi> of this <hi>Point,</hi> we will chiefly insist thereupon.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after the <hi>Foundation,</hi> of the <hi>City of Rome,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Sabines,</hi> mingled upon equall Terms.

                  </p>
                  <p>But that, which is chiefly to be noted, in the whole Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of the <hi>Romane Government</hi>; they were so liberall, of their <hi>Naturalizations,</hi> as, in effect, they made perpetuall <hi>Mixtures.</hi> For the manner was, to grant the same, not onely to <hi>particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> but to <hi>Families,</hi> and <hi>Lineages</hi>; And not onely so, but to whole <hi>Cities,</hi> and <hi>Countries.</hi> So as, in the end, it came to that, that <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Communis Patria,</hi> as some of the <hi>Civilians</hi> call it.</p>
                  <p>So we read of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had been beaten with Rods, and thereupon charged the <hi>Officer,</hi> with the violation, of the Priviledge, of a <hi>Cittizen,</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; The <hi>Captain</hi> said to him; <hi>Art thou then a Romane? That Priviledge hath cost me dear.</hi> To whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> replied; <hi>But I was so born,</hi> And yet, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> professeth himself, that he was a <hi>Iew,</hi> by <hi>Tribe:</hi> So as it is manifest, that some of his Ancestors, were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized; and so it was conveyed to him, and their other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants.</p>
                  <p>So we read, that it was one, of the first Despites, that was done, to <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>; That whereas he had obtained <hi>Naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for a <hi>City</hi> in <hi>Gaule,</hi> one of the <hi>City</hi> was beaten with <hi>Rods,</hi> of the <hi>Consul Marcellus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So we read, in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that in the <hi>Emperour Claudius</hi> time, the <hi>Nation</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> (that part which is called <hi>Comata,</hi> the wilder part,) were Suitours, to be made capable, of the honour, of being <hi>Senatours,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> His words are these: <hi>Cum de supplendo Senatu a<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So likewise, the Authority of <hi>Nicholas Matchiavell,</hi> seemeth not to be contemned; who, enquiring the Causes, of the Growth,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51170:114"/>
of the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> doth give Judgement; There was not one greater then this; That the State, did so easily compound, and incorporate with strangers.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that most <hi>Estates,</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> have taken the other Course. Of which this effect hath followed; That the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, of further <hi>Empire,</hi> and <hi>Territory,</hi> hath been, rather, matter of Burthen, then matter of Strength, unto them: yea and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it hath kept alive, the Seeds, and Roots, of Revolts, and Rebellions, for many Ages: As we may see, in a fresh, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Example, of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi>: Which, though it were united, to <hi>Castile,</hi> by Marriage, and not by <hi>Conquest</hi>; And so descended in Hereditary Union, by the space of more then an 100. years; yet because it was continued, in a divided Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and not well Incorporated, and Cemented, with the other <hi>Crowns</hi>; Entred into a Rebellion, upon point of their <hi>Fueros,</hi> or <hi>Liberties,</hi> now of very late years.</p>
                  <p>Now to speak briefly, of the severall parts, of that form, whereby <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> are perfectly united; They are, (besides the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> it self,) four in Number: <hi>Vnion</hi> in Name; <hi>Vnion</hi> in <hi>Language; Vnion</hi> in <hi>Lawes; Vnion</hi> in <hi>Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Name,</hi> though it seem, but a superficiall, and Outward Matter, yet it carrieth much Impression, and Enchantment: The Generall, and common Name, of <hi>Grecia</hi> made the <hi>Greeks,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies apt to unite, (though otherwise full of <hi>Divisions,</hi> amongst themselves,) against other <hi>Nations,</hi> whom they called <hi>Barbarous.</hi> The <hi>Helvetian</hi> Name, is no small Band, to knit together, their Leagues, and Confederacies, the faster. The common Name of <hi>Spain</hi>; (no doubt,) hath been, a speciall meanes, of the better union, and Conglutination, of the severall <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> of <hi>Castile, Aragon, Granada, Navarre, Valentia, Catalonia,</hi> and the rest; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending also now lately <hi>Portugall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Language,</hi> it is not needful to insist upon it; because both your <hi>Majesties Kingdomes,</hi> are of one <hi>Language,</hi> though of severall <hi>Dialects</hi>; And the Difference, is so small, between them, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth, rather an inriching, of one <hi>Language,</hi> then a continuance of two.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Lawes,</hi> which are the Principall Sinnewes of <hi>Government,</hi> they be of three Natures; <hi>Iura,</hi> which I will term <hi>Freedomes,</hi> or <hi>Abilities; Leges</hi>; and <hi>Mores.</hi>
                  </p>

                        </gap>ct mixture</hi>; Whereof the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is Time. For the <hi>Naturall Philosophers</hi> say well; that <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio</hi> is <hi>Opus Hominis</hi>; and <hi>Mistio Opus Naturae.</hi> For it is the Duty of <hi>Man,</hi> to make a fit Application, of Bodies together: But the perfect <hi>Fermentation,</hi> and Incorporation, of them, must be left to <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi>; And <hi>Vnnaturall Hasting</hi> thereof, doth disturb the work, and not dispatch it.</p>
                  <p>So we see, after the <hi>Graft,</hi> is put into the <hi>Stock,</hi> and bound, it must be left to <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> to make that <hi>Continuum,</hi> which, at the first, was but <hi>Contiguum.</hi> And it is not any continuall pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or Thrusting together, that will prevent <hi>Natures</hi> season, but rather hinder it. And so in <hi>Liquours,</hi> those <hi>Commixtures,</hi> which are, at the first, troubled, grow after, clear, and setled, by the benefit, of Rest, and Time.</p>
                  <p>The Second <hi>Condition</hi> is; That the greater draw the lesse. So we see, when two <hi>Lights</hi> do meet, the greater, doth darken, and, dim the lesse. And when a smaller <hi>River,</hi> runneth into a greater, it looseth both his <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Stream.</hi> And hereof, to conclude, we see an excellent Example, in the <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi> The <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> contained Two <hi>Tribes</hi>; The <hi>Kingdom,</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> contained Ten: <hi>King David,</hi> raigned, over <hi>Iudah,</hi> for certain years; And after the Death of <hi>Isbosheth,</hi> the Son of <hi>Saul,</hi> obtained, likewise, the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Israell</hi> This Union continued in him, &amp; likewise in his Son <hi>Salomon,</hi> by the space of 70. years, at least, between them both: But yet, because the Seat, of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>

The Parts ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Second <hi>Question,</hi> therefore, is; Allowing the Generall <hi>Vnion</hi> of <hi>Lawes,</hi> to be too great a Work, to embrace, whether it were not convenient, that <hi>Cases Capitall,</hi> were the same, in both <hi>Nations?</hi> I say, the <hi>Cases</hi>; I do not speak, of the <hi>Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> or <hi>Trials</hi>; That is to say; whether the same <hi>Offences,</hi> were not fit, to be made <hi>Treason,</hi> or <hi>Felony,</hi> in both places?</p>
                  <p>The Third <hi>Question</hi> is, whether <hi>Cases Penall,</hi> though not <hi>Capitall,</hi> yet if they concern the <hi>Publick State,</hi> or otherwise, the <hi>Discipline</hi> of <hi>Manners,</hi> were not fit, likewise, to be brought, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one <hi>Degree?</hi> As the <hi>Case,</hi> of <hi>Misprision</hi> of <hi>Treason</hi>; The <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Premunire</hi>; The <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Fugitives</hi>; The <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Incest</hi>; The <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Simony</hi>; and the rest.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Question,</hi> that is more urgent, then any of these, is; Whether these <hi>Cases,</hi> at the least, be they of an higher, or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, degr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for Example; A perjury, committed, in a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> cannot be prejudiciall, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51170:122"/>
Because <hi>Depositions,</hi> taken in <hi>Scotland,</hi> cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and used, here in <hi>England.</hi> But a <hi>Forgery,</hi> of a <hi>Deed,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I mean, with a false <hi>Date</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> may be used, and given in Evidence, in <hi>England.</hi> So likewise, the Depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, of a <hi>Town</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> doth not, directly, prejudice, the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>England</hi>: But if an <hi>English Merchant,</hi> shall carry Silver, and Gold, into <hi>Scotland,</hi> (as he may,) and thence transport it, into forrain parts, this prejudiceth the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> And may be, an Evasion, to all the <hi>Lawes,</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ordained in that <hi>Case</hi>: And therefore, had need to be bridled, with as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a <hi>Law,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it is here in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this kind, there are many <hi>Lawes.</hi>

                  <p>So the <hi>Lawes,</hi> prohibiting Transportation of sundry <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,</hi> as <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Silver, Ordnance, Artillery, Corn,</hi> &amp;c. if there be not, a Correspondence of <hi>Lawes,</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> will, in like manner, be deluded, and frustrate: For any <hi>English Merchant,</hi> or <hi>Subject,</hi> may carry such <hi>Commodities,</hi> first into <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well, as he may carry them, from Port, to Port, in <hi>England.</hi> And out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> into Forrain Parts, without any Perill of <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Libells,</hi> may be devised, and written, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and published, and scattered in <hi>England.</hi>

And as to the <hi>Will</hi> of Man, it is that, which is most Maniable, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient; As that, which admitteth most <hi>Medicines,</hi> to cure, and alter it. The most <hi>Soveraign,</hi> of all, is <hi>Religion</hi>; which is able to change, and transform it, in the deepest, and most inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and Motions: And next to that is <hi>Opinion,</hi> and <hi>Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension</hi>; Whether it be infused by Tradition, and Institution; or wrought in, by Disputation, and Perswasion: And the Third is <hi>Example,</hi> which transformeth the Will of Man, into the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of that, which is most obversant, and familiar towards it. And the Fourth is, when one <hi>Affection,</hi> is <hi>healed,</hi> and <hi>corrected,</hi> by another: As when Cowardise, is remedied by Shame, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour; Or Sluggishnesse, and Backwardnesse, by indignation, and Emulation; And so of the like.

                  <p>But before, I enter, into the <hi>Points controverted,</hi> I think good to remove, (if it may be,) two Opinions, which do directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and oppone, to <hi>Reformation</hi>: The one, bringing it to a <hi>Nullity</hi>; And the other, to an <hi>Impossibility.</hi> The First is; <hi>That it is against good Policy, to innovate any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>For the First of these, it is excellently said, by the Prophet; <hi>State super vias antiquas, &amp; videte, quaenam sit via recta, &amp; vera, &amp; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulate in eâ.</hi> So as, he doth not say; <hi>State super vias antiquas, &amp; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulate in eis:</hi> For it true, that with all <hi>VVise,</hi> and <hi>Moderate,</hi> Persons, <hi>Custom,</hi> and <hi>Vsage,</hi> obtaineth that Reverence, as it is sufficient Matter, to move them, to make a stand, and to discover, and take a View; But it is no warrant, to guide, and conduct them: A just Ground, I say, it is, of <hi>Deliberation,</hi> but not of <hi>Direction.</hi> But, on the other side, who knoweth not, that <hi>Time,</hi> is truly compared, to a <hi>Stream,</hi> that carrieth down, <hi>fresh,</hi> and <hi>pure Waters,</hi> into that <hi>salt Sea of Corruption,</hi> which invironeth all <hi>Human Actions?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if Man shall not, by his Industry, Vertue, and Policy, as it were, with the Oare, row against the Stream, and inclination of <hi>Time</hi>; All Institutions, and Ordinances, be they never so pure, will corrupt, and degenerate. But not, to handle this matter, Common-place like, I would only ask, why the <hi>Civill State,</hi> should be purged, and restored, by Good, and Wholesome, <hi>Lawes,</hi> made every Third, or Fourth, year, in <hi>Parliament assembled</hi>; Devising <hi>Remedies,</hi> as fast as <hi>Time,</hi> breedeth <hi>Mischief</hi>; And contrariwise,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51170:131"/>
the <hi>Ecclesiasticall State,</hi> should still continue, upon the Dreggs of <hi>Time,</hi> and receive, no Alteration now, for this Five and Forty years, and more? If any Man, shall object, that if the like Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, had been used, in <hi>Civil Causes</hi> also, the Errour had not been great; Surely the Wisedome of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> hath been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, in Experience, for Three Hundred years space, at the least. But, if it be said to me, that there is a Difference, between <hi>Civill Causes,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> they may as well tell me, that <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>Chappels,</hi> need no Reparations, though <hi>Castles,</hi> and <hi>Houses,</hi> do; Whereas commonly, to speak truth, <hi>Dilapidations,</hi> of the Inward, and Spirituall, <hi>Edifications,</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> are, in all times, as great, as the <hi>Outward,</hi> and Materiall. Sure I am, that the very word, and Stile, of <hi>Reformation,</hi> used by our <hi>Saviour; Ab initio non fuit sic</hi>; was applyed, to <hi>Church Matters</hi>; And those, of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Nature,</hi> concerning the <hi>Law Morall.</hi>

                  <p>Neverthelesse, He were both unthankfull, and unwise, that would deny, but that the Church, of <hi>England,</hi> during the time of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> of <hi>famous Memory,</hi> did flourish.

For that Reverence, should be used, to the <hi>Church,</hi> which the good <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> used, to their <hi>Fathers Nakedness</hi>; That is, as it were, to go backwards, and to help, the Defects thereof, and yet to dissemble them.

                        <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and became <hi>Grandees</hi> in <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> and great <hi>Councellers</hi> to <hi>Princes,</hi> then did they <hi>deleague,</hi> their <hi>proper Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as Things, of too inferiour a Nature, for their Greatnesse; And then, after the Similitude, and Imitation, of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Counts Palatine,</hi> they would have their <hi>Chancellers,</hi> and <hi>Iudges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that <hi>Example,</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Potentates,</hi> giveth no good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. For the Reasons, why <hi>Kings,</hi> administer, by their <hi>Iudges,</hi> although themselves are <hi>Supream Iudges,</hi> are two. The one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Offices of <hi>Kings</hi> are, for the most part, of Inheritance; And it is a <hi>Rule,</hi> in all <hi>Lawes,</hi> that <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> are rather Matters, that <hi>Ground in Interest,</hi> then in <hi>Confidence</hi>; For as much, as they may fall upon <hi>Women,</hi> upon <hi>Infants,</hi> upon <hi>Lunaticks, and Ideots, persons incapable,</hi> to Execute <hi>Iudicature,</hi> in <hi>Person</hi>; And therefore, such <hi>Offices,</hi> by all <hi>Lawes,</hi> might, ever, be exercised, and administred, by <hi>Delegation.</hi> The Second Reason is, because of the Amplitude of their Jurisdictions; Which is a great, as either their <hi>Birth-right, from their Ancestours,</hi> or their <hi>Sword-right from God,</hi> maketh it. And therefore, if <hi>Moses,</hi> that was <hi>Governer,</hi> over no <hi>great People,</hi> and those collected together, in a <hi>Camp</hi>; And not scattred, in <hi>Provinces,</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi>; Himself of an extraordinary <hi>Spirit</hi>; Was, neverthelesse, not able, to <hi>suffice,</hi> and hold out, in person, to judge the People; But did, by the advise of <hi>Iethro,</hi> approved from <hi>God,</hi> substitute <hi>Elders,</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi> how much more, other <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Princess</hi>?</p>
                     <p>There is a Third <hi>Reason,</hi> likewise, though not much to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose; And that is; That Kings, either in respect of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> or of the <hi>Greatnesse</hi> of their own <hi>Patrimonies,</hi> are, usually, <hi>Parties in Suites</hi>; And then, their <hi>Iudges,</hi> stand indifferent, between Them, and the <hi>Subject.</hi> But in the Case of <hi>Bishops,</hi> none of these <hi>Reasons</hi> hold. For first, their <hi>Office</hi> is <hi>Elective,</hi> and for <hi>Life,</hi> and not <hi>Patrimoniall,</hi> or <hi>Hereditary</hi>: An <hi>Office, meerly</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, Science,</hi> and <hi>Qualification:</hi> And for the <hi>Second Reason,</hi> it is true, that their <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> is Ample, and Spacious; And that their Time, is to be divided, between the Labours; As well, in the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as in <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Iurisdiction.</hi> But yet, I do not see, (supposing, the <hi>Bishops Courts,</hi> to be used, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, and without any indirect course held, to multiply Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for gain of Fees;) But that the <hi>Bishop,</hi> might very well, for <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Moment,</hi> supply, his <hi>Iudiciall Function,</hi> in his own <hi>Person.</hi> For we see, before our Eyes, that one <hi>Chanceller</hi> of <hi>England</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatcheth, the <hi>Suites</hi> in <hi>Equity,</hi> of the whole <hi>Kingdome</hi>; which is not so much, by reason, of the Excellency, of that <hi>Rare Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Person,</hi> which now holdeth the place; But it was ever so, though, more, or lesse, burdenous, to the Suiter, as the <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> was more, or lesse, able, to give dispatch. And if Hold be taken, of that which was said before, that the <hi>Bishops Labour</hi> in the <hi>Word,</hi> must take up, a principall Part of his Time; so, I may say again, that <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> have, ever, taken up, most of the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51170:134"/>
                        <hi>Chancellers</hi> Time; Having been, for the most part, Persons, upon whom the <hi>Kings,</hi> of this <hi>Realm,</hi> have most relyed, for Matters of <hi>Councell.</hi> And therefore, there is no Doubt, but the <hi>Bishop,</hi> whose Circuit is lesse ample, and the Causes, in Nature, not so multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying; with the Help, of <hi>References,</hi> and <hi>Certificates,</hi> to, and from, fit Persons, for the better Ripening of Causes, in their mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; And such ordinary Helps, incident to <hi>Iurisdiction</hi>; May, very well, suffice his <hi>Office.</hi> But yet, there is another <hi>Help</hi>; For the Causes, that come before him, are these: <hi>Tithes; Legacies; Administrations,</hi> and other <hi>Testamentary Causes; Causes Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall; Accusations</hi> against <hi>Ministers,</hi> tending to their <hi>Suspension, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,</hi> or <hi>Degrading; Simony; Incontinency; Heresy; Blasphemy; Breach of the Sabboth</hi>; And other, like <hi>Causes,</hi> of <hi>Scandall.</hi> The first two of these, in mine Opinion, differ from the Rest; That is, <hi>Tithes,</hi> and <hi>Testaments</hi>; For those, be Matters of profit, and, in their nature, <hi>Temporall</hi>; Though, by a Favour, and Connivence, of the <hi>Temporall Iurisdiction,</hi> they have been allowed, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the <hi>Courts Ecclesiasticall:</hi> The one, to the end, the <hi>Clergy,</hi> might sue for that, that was their <hi>Sustentation,</hi> before their own <hi>Iudges</hi>; And the other, in a kind of Piety, and Religion, which was thought incident, to the performance, of <hi>Dead Mens Wills.</hi> And surely, for these two, the <hi>Bishop,</hi> in mine opinion, may, with lesse danger, discharge himself, upon his <hi>Ordinary Iudges.</hi> And I think, likewise, it will fall out, that those Suites, are in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test number. But for the rest, which require a <hi>Spirituall Science,</hi> and <hi>Discretion,</hi> in respect of their <hi>Nature</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>There is a <hi>Third Point</hi> also, not of <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> but of <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Proceeding,</hi> which may deserve <hi>Reformation.</hi> The rather, because it is contrary, to the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Customes,</hi> of this <hi>Land,</hi> and <hi>State</hi>; which, though they do not rule those <hi>Proceedings,</hi> yet may they be advised with, for better Directions; And that is, the <hi>Oath ex Officio</hi>; Whereby Men, are enforced, to accuse themselves; And that, that is more, are sworn unto Blancks, and not unto <hi>Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>Charges</hi> declared.

                     <p>TO speak of a <hi>Learned Ministery</hi>; It is true, that the <hi>Worthiness,</hi> of the <hi>Pastours,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ministers,</hi> is, of all other points of <hi>Religion,</hi> the most <hi>Summary</hi>; I do not say, the <hi>Greatest,</hi> but the most <hi>Effectual,</hi> towards the rest: But herein to my Understanding, while Men, go on, in Zeal, to hasten this work, they are not aware, of as great, or greater Inconvenience, then that, which they seek to remove. For while, they in veigh, against a <hi>Dumb Ministery,</hi> they make, too easie, and too promiscous, an Allowance of such, as they account <hi>Preachers</hi>; Having not Respect enough, to their <hi>Learnings,</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arts, which are <hi>Handmaides,</hi> to <hi>Divinity</hi>; Not Respect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to <hi>Years,</hi> except it be, in Case, of <hi>Extraordinary Gift</hi>; Not Respect enough, to the <hi>Gift</hi> it self, which, many Times, is none at all.

must, rather, leave the <hi>Arke,</hi> to shake, as it shall please <hi>God,</hi> then put, unworthy <hi>Hands,</hi> to hold it up: And when we are, in <hi>Gods Temple,</hi> we are warned, rather, to <hi>put our Hands, upon our Mouth, then to offer, the Sacrifice, of Fooles.</hi> And surely, it may be justly thought, that amongst many Causes of <hi>Atheisme</hi>; which are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably met in our Age; As <hi>Schismes,</hi> and <hi>Controversies; Profane Scoffings, in Holy Matters</hi>; and others; It is not the least, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers do adventure, to handle the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which are unfit, and unworthy. And herein, I would have, no man, mistake me, as if I did extoll, curious, and affected, <hi>Preaching</hi>; which is, as much, on the other side, to be disliked; And breedeth <hi>Atheism,</hi> and <hi>Scandall,</hi> as well as the other; (For who, would not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, at one, that cometh into the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> as if he came upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> to play Parts, or Prizes?)

And this was, as I take it, a Forthnights Exercise: which in my Opinion, was the best way, to frame, and train, up <hi>Preachers,</hi> to handle the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as it ought to be handled, that hath been practised. For we see, <hi>Oratours,</hi> have their <hi>Declamations; Lawyers,</hi> have their <hi>Moots; Logicians</hi> their <hi>Sophems</hi>; And every practise of Science, hath an Exercise of Erudition, and initiation, before Men come to the Life; Onely <hi>Preaching,</hi> which is the worthiest; And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is most danger to be amisse; Wanteth an Introduction, and is ventred, and rushed upon, at the first: But unto this <hi>Exercise</hi> of the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> I would wish, these two <hi>Additions</hi>; The one, that after this <hi>Exercise,</hi> which is, in some sort, <hi>Publick,</hi> there were, immediately, a <hi>Private Meeting,</hi> of the same <hi>Ministers</hi>; Where they might, brotherly admonish, the one, the other; And specially the elder sort, the younger, of any Thing, that had passed, in the <hi>Exercise,</hi> in <hi>Matter, or Manner,</hi> unsound, and uncomely; And, in a word, might, mutually, use such Advise,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:51170:137"/>
Instruction, Comfort, or Encouragement, as Occasion might minister; For <hi>publick Reprehension,</hi> were to be debarred. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Addition,</hi> that I mean, is, That the same <hi>Exercise,</hi> were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the <hi>Vniversities,</hi> for <hi>young Divines,</hi> before they presumed to Preach, as well, as in the <hi>Countrey,</hi> for <hi>Ministers.</hi> For they have, in some <hi>Colledges,</hi> an <hi>Exercise,</hi> called a <hi>Common Place</hi>; Which can, in no Degree, be so profitable, being but the Speech, of one Man, at one time. And if it be feared, that it may be Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, to whet Mens Speeches, for Controversies, it is easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, by some strict Prohibition, that Matters of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, tending, any way, to the violating, or Disquieting, the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> be not handled or entred into; Which Prohibition, in regard, there is ever to be, a <hi>Grave person, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,</hi> or <hi>Moderatour,</hi> cannot be frustrate. The <hi>second Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is, whether it were not convenient, there should be a more exact <hi>Probation,</hi> and <hi>Examination,</hi> of <hi>Ministers</hi>; Namely, that the <hi>Bishops,</hi> do not ordain alone, but by Advise; And then, that Ancient, <hi>Holy Orders</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> might be revived: By the which, the <hi>Bishop</hi> did ordain <hi>Ministers,</hi> but at <hi>foure set times,</hi> of the <hi>year</hi>; which were called, <hi>Quatuor Tempora</hi>; which, are, now, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ember-weeks</hi>; It being thought fit, to accompany, so High an <hi>Action,</hi> with <hi>generall Fasting,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Sermons,</hi> and all <hi>Holy Exercises</hi>; And the <hi>Names,</hi> likewise, of those, that were to be <hi>Ordained,</hi> were published, some dayes, before their <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>; To the end, <hi>Exceptions</hi> might be taken, if just Cause were. The Third Consideration, is, that if the Case of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> be, that where a <hi>Computation</hi> is taken, of all the <hi>Parochian Churches,</hi> (allowing the <hi>Vnion</hi> of such, as were too small, and adjacent;) And again, a <hi>Computation,</hi> to be taken, of the <hi>persons,</hi> who are worthy to be <hi>Pastours</hi>; And, upon the said Account, if it fall out, that there are many more <hi>Churches,</hi> then <hi>Pastours</hi>; Then of Necessity, Recourse must be had, to one of these Remedies; Either, that <hi>Pluralities,</hi> must be allowed; (specially, if you can by <hi>permutation,</hi> make the <hi>Benefices</hi> more compatible:) Or that there be <hi>Allowed Preachers,</hi> to have a more generall Charge, to supply, and serve, by turn, <hi>Parishes</hi> unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: For that some <hi>Churches,</hi> should be provided, of <hi>Pastours,</hi> able to teach; and others wholy Destitute, seemeth, to me, to be against the <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi>; And against the <hi>Practice,</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi>

                        <hi>EXcommunication,</hi> is the greatest <hi>Iudgement,</hi> upon <hi>Earth</hi>; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which is ratified in <hi>Heaven</hi>; And being, a <hi>Precursory,</hi> or <hi>Prelusory Iudgement,</hi> of the great <hi>Iudgement,</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> And therefore, for this, to be used unreverently, and to be made, an <hi>Ordinary Processe,</hi> to lackey up and down, for <hi>Fees,</hi> how can it be, without Derogation, to <hi>Gods Honour,</hi> and making, the <hi>power of the Keyes,</hi> contemptible?

For, as the <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> taketh hold, upon the <hi>least sin,</hi> of the <hi>Impenitent</hi>; And taketh no hold, of the <hi>greatest Sin</hi> of the <hi>Convert,</hi> or <hi>Penitent:</hi> So <hi>Excommunication,</hi> may, in case, issue, upon the smallest Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; And, in Case, not issue, upon the greatest: But is this <hi>Contumacy,</hi> such a <hi>Contumacy,</hi> as <hi>Excommunication</hi> is now used for? For the <hi>Contumacy,</hi> must be such, as the Party, (as far, as the Eye, and Wisdom, of the <hi>Church,</hi> can discern,) standeth in State, of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi> and <hi>Damnation:</hi> As one, that for that time, seemeth given over, to <hi>Finall Impenitency.</hi> Upon this <hi>Observation,</hi> I ground two <hi>Considerations:</hi> The one, that this <hi>Censure,</hi> be restored, to the true <hi>Dignity,</hi> and <hi>Vse,</hi> thereof; which is, that it proceed not, but in Causes, of great weight; And that it be decreed, not by any <hi>Deputy,</hi> or <hi>Substitute,</hi> of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> but by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; And not by him alone, but by the <hi>Bishop Assisted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other <hi>Consideration,</hi> is, That in liew, thereof, there be given, to the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Court,</hi> some ordinary <hi>Processe,</hi> with such Force, and Coercion, as appertaineth; That so the <hi>Dignity,</hi> of so high a <hi>Sentence,</hi> being, retained, and the Necessity, of <hi>Mean Processe</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, the <hi>Church,</hi> may be, indeed, restored, to the Ancient Vigour, and Splendour. To this purpose, joyn'd with some other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Good, purposes, was there a <hi>Bill,</hi> drawn in <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the Three and Twentieth Year, of the <hi>Raign,</hi> of the <hi>Queen</hi> decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; (which was the Gravest <hi>Parliament,</hi> that I have known; And the <hi>Bill,</hi> recommended, by the gravest, <hi>Counsellor</hi> of <hi>Estate,</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi>; Though afterwards, it was stayed, by the <hi>Queenes,</hi> speciall <hi>Commandement,</hi> the Nature of those Things considered.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First therefore, I will speak somewhat, of the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the Work; And then, of the <hi>Means</hi> to compass, and effect it. For the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the <hi>Work,</hi> I will divide it, into four Noble, and Worthy, Consequences, that will follow thereupon. The First of the four, is <hi>Honour</hi>; whereof I have spoken enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:51170:141"/>
were it not, that the <hi>Harp</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> puts me in mind, of that Glorious <hi>Embleme,</hi> or <hi>Allegory,</hi> wherein the wisdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, did figure, and shadow out, works of this Nature. For the <hi>Poets feigned,</hi> that <hi>Orpheus</hi> by the vertue, and sweetnesse, of his <hi>Harp,</hi> did call, and assemble, the <hi>Beasts,</hi> and <hi>Birds,</hi> of their Nature, <hi>wild,</hi> and <hi>savage,</hi> to stand about him, as in a <hi>Theater</hi>; Forgetting their Affections, of Fierceceness, of Lust, and of Prey; and listening to the Tunes, and Harmonies, of the <hi>Harp</hi>: and soon after, called likewise the <hi>Stones,</hi> and the <hi>Woods,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and stand in order about him: which Fable, was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently interpreted, of the <hi>Reducing,</hi> and <hi>Plantation,</hi> of <hi>Kingdoms</hi>; when <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Barbarous Manners,</hi> are brought, to give over, and discontinue, their <hi>Customs,</hi> of <hi>Revenge,</hi> and Blood, and of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Life, and of Theft, and of Rapine; And to give Ear, to the wisdome of <hi>Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Governments,</hi> whereupon, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followeth, the <hi>Calling</hi> of <hi>Stones,</hi> for Building, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; and of Trees, for the seats of Houses, Orchards, and Enclosures, and the like.</p>
                  <p>This Work, therefore, of all other, most Memorable, and Honourable, <hi>your Majesty</hi> hath now in Hand; specially, if your <hi>Majesty</hi> joyn, the <hi>Harp</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> in casting out, the Evill Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of <hi>Superstition</hi>; with the <hi>Harp</hi> of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> in casting out <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,</hi> and <hi>Barbarisme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second <hi>Consequence,</hi> of this <hi>Enterprise,</hi> is the <hi>Avoiding,</hi> of an <hi>Inconvenience,</hi> which commonly attendeth upon Happy Times, and is an evill effect, of a good Cause. The Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this present Age, seemeth to encline to Peace, almost generally in these Parts; And your <hi>Majesties,</hi> most Christian, and vertuous, affections, do promise the same, more specially, to these your <hi>Kingdomes.</hi> An effect, of <hi>Peace,</hi> in Fruitfull <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> (where the stock of <hi>People,</hi> receiving no <hi>Consumption,</hi> nor <hi>Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution,</hi> by <hi>warre,</hi> doth continually multiply, and encrease;) must, in the end, be a <hi>Surcharge,</hi> or <hi>Overflow</hi> of <hi>People,</hi> more then the <hi>Territories</hi> can well maintain; Which, many times, insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a generall Necessity, and want of Means, into all estates; Doth turn, <hi>Externall Peace,</hi> into <hi>Internall Troubles,</hi> and <hi>Seditions.</hi> Now what an excellent Diversion, of this Inconvenience, is ministred, by <hi>Gods Providence,</hi> to your <hi>Majesty,</hi> in this <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Ireland?</hi> wherein, so many <hi>Families,</hi> may receive, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentations,</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi>; And the Discharge of them, also, out of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> may prevent many Seeds of <hi>Future perturbations</hi>? So that it is, as if a Man were troubled, for the Avoidance of water, from the place, where he hath built his <hi>House</hi>; And afterwards, should advise with himself, to cast those waters, and to turn them, into Fair Pools, or Streams, for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, provision, or use. So shall your <hi>Majesty,</hi> in this <hi>Work,</hi> have a double Commodity; In the <hi>Avoidance</hi> of <hi>People</hi> here, and in <hi>Making use</hi> of them there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:51170:142"/>The third <hi>Consequence,</hi> is the great <hi>Safety,</hi> that is like to grow, to your <hi>Majesties Estate,</hi> in generall, by this Act; In discomfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>Hostile Attempts</hi> of <hi>Forreiners</hi>; which the Weaknesse of that <hi>Kingdome,</hi> hath heretofore invited: Wherein, I shall not need, to fetch Reasons, afar off, either for the generall, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. For the generall, because nothing is more evident, then that, which one of the <hi>Romans,</hi> said of <hi>Peloponnesus; Testudo intra tegumen tuta est. The Tortoise is safe within her shell</hi>: But, if she put forth, any part of her Body, then it endangereth, not onely the part that is so put forth, but all the Rest. And so, we see in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> if any part be left naked, it puts in hazard the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And, in the <hi>Naturall Body</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> if there be any weak, or Affected, part, it is enough, to draw Rheums, or Maligne <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> unto it, to the Interruption, of the <hi>Health,</hi> of the <hi>whole Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>Particular,</hi> the Example is too Fresh, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition of that <hi>Kingdome,</hi> hath been a conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>al Attractive, of Troubles, and Infestations, upon this <hi>Estate</hi>; and though <hi>your Majesties</hi> Greatnesse, doth, in some sort, discharge this Fear, yet with your encrease of <hi>Power,</hi> it cannot be, but <hi>Envy</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise encreased.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, and last Consequence, is the great <hi>Profit,</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> which is like to redound, to your <hi>Crown,</hi> by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, upon this unpolished Part thereof: Whereof, <hi>your Majesty,</hi> (being in the strength of your years,) are like, by the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> to receive, more then the <hi>First Fruits</hi>; And your <hi>Posterity,</hi> a growing, and Springing Veine of Riches, and Power. For this <hi>Island,</hi> being another <hi>Britain</hi>; As <hi>Britain</hi> was said, to be another <hi>World</hi>; Is endowed, with so many <hi>Dowries</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> (considering the <hi>Fruitfullnesse</hi> of the Soil, the <hi>Ports,</hi> the <hi>Rivers,</hi> the <hi>Fishings,</hi> the <hi>Quarries,</hi> the Woods, and other <hi>Materialls</hi>; And specially, the <hi>Race,</hi> and <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Men, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,</hi> hard, and active<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) As it is not easie, no not upon the <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> to find, such Confluence of Commodities, if the <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> did joyn with the <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> So then for the <hi>Excel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lency,</hi> of the work, in point of <hi>Honour, Policy, Safety,</hi> and <hi>Vtility,</hi> here I cease. For the <hi>Means,</hi> to effect this Work; I know your <hi>Majesty</hi> shall not want, the Information of Persons expert, and industrious, which have served you there, and know the <hi>Region</hi>: Nor the Advise, of a Grave, and Prudent <hi>Counsell,</hi> here; which know the Pulses, of the Hearts, of People, and the wayes, and Passages, of conducting great Actions: Besides that, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve all; which is, that <hi>Fountain,</hi> of Wisdome, and Universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which is in your self: yet notwithstanding, in a thing, of so publick a Nature, it is not amisse, for your <hi>Majesty,</hi> to hear va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Opinion. For as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> saith well; <hi>The good Fortune, of a Prince, or State, doth, sometimes, put a good Motion, into a Fools Mouth.</hi> I do think therefore, the <hi>Means,</hi> of accomplishing this
<pb facs="tcp:51170:142"/>
Work consisteth of two principall Parts. The first, the <hi>Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Encouragement,</hi> of <hi>Vndertakers</hi>: The second, the <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> of the <hi>Project,</hi> it self. For as in all <hi>Engines</hi> of the <hi>Hand,</hi> there is somewhat, that giveth the Motion and Force, and the rest, serveth to guide, and govern, the same: So it is in these <hi>Enterprises,</hi> or <hi>Engines,</hi> of Estate. As for the former of these, there is no doubt, but next unto the <hi>Providence,</hi> and <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e your self in it, the more shall you quicken, and animate, the whole procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For this is is an <hi>Action,</hi> which as the worthinesse of it, doth bear it, so the Nature of it requireth it, to be carried in some <hi>Heighth</hi> of <hi>Reputation</hi>; And fit, in mine Opinion, for <hi>Pulpits,</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and all places, to ring, and resound of it. For that, which may seem Vanity, in some Things; (I mean, <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Fame</hi>;) is of great efficacy, in this Case.</p>
                  <p>But now, let me descend, to the inferiour <hi>Sphears,</hi> and speak, what Cooperation, in the Subjects, or undertakers, may be rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I do not say, but that I think, the <hi>Vndertakers</hi> themselves, will be glad to have some <hi>Captains,</hi> or <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Service,</hi> intermixed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, for their safety; But I speak, of the Generality of <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers</hi>; which, I wish, were <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Estate,</hi> and <hi>Plenty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now therefore, it followeth well to speak, of the aforesaid three <hi>Motives</hi>: For it will appear the more, how necessary it is, to allure, by all means, <hi>Vndertakers</hi>; Since those Men, will be least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Project</hi> it self, I shall need to speak the lesse, in regard, it is so considerately digested already, for the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Tyrone</hi>; And Therefore, my Labour shall be, but in those Things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I shall either Adde to, or Dissent from, that which is set down; Which will include, Five <hi>Points,</hi> or <hi>Articles.</hi> First, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hey mention a <hi>Commission,</hi> for this <hi>Plantation</hi>; Which, of all Things, is most necessary, both to <hi>Direct,</hi> and <hi>Appease, Controversie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>To this I adde Two <hi>Propositions.</hi> The one, that which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, is meant, though not expressed; That the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> should, for certain times, reside, and abide, in some Habitable <hi>Town,</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> near in Distance, to the Country, where the Plantation shall be; To the end; Both that they may be more at Hand, for the Execution of the <hi>Parts,</hi> of their <hi>Commission</hi>; And withall, it is like, by drawing of <hi>Concourse</hi> of <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Trades Men,</hi> to such <hi>Townes,</hi> it will be some Help, and Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the <hi>Vndertakers,</hi> for Things, they shall stand in need of. And likewise, it will be a more safe place of Receit, and Store, wherein to Unlade, and Deposite, such Provisions, as are after to be employed.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, that your <hi>Majesty,</hi> would make a <hi>Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,</hi> between the <hi>Commission</hi> there, and a <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Plantation,</hi> here. Wherein I warrant, my self, by the <hi>President,</hi> of the like <hi>Councell,</hi> of <hi>Plantation,</hi> for <hi>Virginia</hi>; An enterprise, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, differing as much from this, as <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> differs from
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51170:144"/>
                     <hi>Caesars Commentaries.</hi> But when I speak of a <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> I mean, some <hi>Persons,</hi> chosen, by way of <hi>Reference</hi>; Upon whom the <hi>Labour,</hi> may rest; To prepare, and report, Things, to the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Estate,</hi> here, that concern that <hi>Businesse.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, your <hi>Majesty,</hi> have a grave, and sufficient, <hi>Councell</hi> in <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eland</hi>: From whom, and upon whom, the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> are to have Assistance, and Dependance; yet that supplies not the Purpose, whereof I speak. For considering, that upon the <hi>Advertisements,</hi> as well of the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> as of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it self; There will be many Occasions, to crave Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from your <hi>Majesty,</hi> and your <hi>Privy Councell</hi> here, which are busi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d with a world of Affaires; It cannot but give greater <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,</hi> and some better <hi>Perfection,</hi> unto some <hi>Directions,</hi> and <hi>Resolutious</hi>; If the <hi>Matters,</hi> may be considered of afore hand, by such, as may have a continuall Care, of the Cause. And it will be, likewise, a <hi>Comfort,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> to some <hi>Principall Vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> if they may be admitted of that <hi>Councell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a <hi>Clause,</hi> wherein the <hi>Vndertakers,</hi> are restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they shall execute the <hi>Plantation,</hi> in <hi>Person</hi>; from which I must dissent, if I will consent, with the Grounds, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken. For it is not probable, that <hi>Men,</hi> of great <hi>Meanes,</hi> and <hi>Plentifull Estates,</hi> will indure the <hi>Travaile, Diseasements,</hi> and <hi>Adventures,</hi> of going thither in <hi>Person</hi>; But rather, I suppose, Many will undertake <hi>Portions,</hi> as an <hi>Advancement,</hi> for their <hi>Younger Children,</hi> or <hi>Kins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>olks</hi>; Or for the <hi>Sweetnesse,</hi> of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,</hi> of a great <hi>Bargaine,</hi> in the end, when it is overcome. And therefore, it is like, they will imploy <hi>Sons, Kinsfolks, Servants,</hi> or <hi>Tenants</hi>; And yet be glad, to have the <hi>Estate,</hi> in themselves. And, it may be, some again, will joyn their <hi>Purses,</hi> together; And make, as it were, a <hi>Partner-ship,</hi> or <hi>Ioynt-Adventure</hi>; And yet man forth, some one Person, by consent, for the Executing of the <hi>Plantation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is a <hi>Main Point,</hi> wherein, I fear, the <hi>Project,</hi> made, hath two much of the Line, and Compass; And will not be, so naturall, and easie, to Execute; Nor yet, so Politick, and Convenient: And that is, that the Buildings, should be, <hi>Sparsim,</hi> upon every <hi>Portion</hi>; And the <hi>Castle,</hi> or <hi>Principall House,</hi> should draw the <hi>Tenements,</hi> and <hi>Farmes</hi> about it, as it were into <hi>Villages, Hamlets,</hi> or <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ndships</hi>; And that there should be, only, Foure <hi>Corporate Townes,</hi> for the <hi>Artificers,</hi> and <hi>Trades-Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Opinion is, that the Building, be altogether in <hi>Townes,</hi> to be compounded, as well of <hi>Husbandries,</hi> as of <hi>Arts.</hi> My <hi>Reasons</hi> are.</p>

And thus, the <hi>Poore</hi> themselves, shall find the <hi>Provision,</hi> and other <hi>People</hi> the sweetnesse, of the <hi>Abatement,</hi> of the <hi>Tax.</hi> Now if it be objected, that Houses of Correction, in all places, have not done the good expected; (as it cannot be denied, but in most places, they have done much Good;) It must be remembred, that there is a great Difference, between that, which is done, by the Distracted Government, of <hi>Iustices</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi>; And that, which may be done by a setled <hi>Ordinance,</hi> subject to a <hi>Regular Visitation,</hi> as this may be; And besides, the Want hath been, commonly, in <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> of a competent, and Certain, <hi>Stock,</hi> for the <hi>Materialls</hi> of the <hi>Labour,</hi> which, in this case, may be likewise supplied.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Advancement</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> I do subscribe, to the Opinion, of one, of the Wisest, and Greatest, Men, of your <hi>Kingdome.</hi> That for <hi>Grammar Schools,</hi> there are already too many; and therefore, no Providence, to adde, where there is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. For the great <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Schools,</hi> which are in your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse Realm,</hi> doth cause a <hi>Want,</hi> and doth cause likewise an <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow</hi>; Both of them, Inconvenient, and one of them Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. For by Means thereof, they find <hi>Want</hi> in the <hi>Countrey,</hi> and <hi>Towns,</hi> both of <hi>Servants</hi> for <hi>Husbandry,</hi> and <hi>Apprentices</hi> for <hi>Trade</hi>; And, on the other side, there being more <hi>Schollers</hi> bred, then the <hi>State,</hi> can prefer, and Employ; And the Active part, of that life, not bearing a proportion, to the <hi>Preparative</hi>; It must needs fall out, that many <hi>Persons,</hi> will be bred, unfit, for other

                     <hi>Vocations,</hi> And <hi>unprofitable</hi> for that, in which they are brought up; Which fills the <hi>Realm,</hi> full of <hi>Indigent, Idle,</hi> and <hi>Wanton</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which are but <hi>Materia Rerum novarum.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore, in this Point, I wish, Mr. <hi>Suttons Intention,</hi> were exalted a Degree; That that, which he meant, for <hi>Teachers</hi> of <hi>Children,</hi> your <hi>Majesty</hi> should make for <hi>Teachers</hi> of <hi>Men</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it hath been, my ancient Opinion, and Observation; That in the <hi>Vniversities</hi> of this <hi>Realm,</hi> (which I take to be, of the best endowed <hi>Vniversities</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi>) there is Nothing more want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, towards <hi>the flourishing State</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> then the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and plentifull, <hi>Salaries,</hi> of <hi>Readers,</hi> in Arts, and <hi>Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> In which Point, as your <hi>Majesties Bounty,</hi> already, hath made a Beginning; So this Occasion, is offered of <hi>God,</hi> to make a <hi>Proceeding.</hi> Surely, <hi>Readers</hi> in the <hi>Chair,</hi> are, as the <hi>Parents</hi> in <hi>Sciences,</hi> and deserve, to enjoy a Condition, not inferiour to their <hi>Children,</hi> that embrace the <hi>Practicall</hi> Part.

If my Heart be misjudged, by Imputation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, or Opposition, by any envious, or officious Informer, I have great wrong; And the greater, because the Manner of my <hi>Speech,</hi> did most evidently shew, that I spake simply; And onely, to satisfie my Conscience, and not with any Advantage, or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to sway the Cause: And my Terms, carried all signification, of Duty, and Zeal, towards her <hi>Majesty,</hi> and her Service. It is true, that from the Beginning, whatsoever was above a <hi>Double Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy,</hi> I did wish, might, (for president sake) appear to be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; And, (for Discontents sake,) mought not have been

And therefore, I most humbly pray, your good Lordship; First, to continue me in your own good Opinion; And then, to perform the part, of an <hi>Honourable Friend,</hi> towards your poor <hi>Servant,</hi> and <hi>Alliance</hi>; In drawing her <hi>Majesty,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, of the Sincerity, and Simplicity, of my Heart; And to bear with the rest, and restore me, to her <hi>Majesties</hi> Favour.</p>

For her <hi>Majesty</hi> seemeth to me, to be a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereby, 3. wayes; First, her <hi>Purse</hi> shall have some Rest: Next, it will divert, the Forein <hi>Designes,</hi> upon the <hi>Place</hi>: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though her <hi>Majesty,</hi> be like, for a time, to govern but <hi>precariò,</hi> in the North; And be not, (as to a true Command,) in better state there, than before; yet, besides the two respects, of Ease of Charge, and Advantage of Opinion, abroad, before mentioned, she shall have a time, to use her Princely policy, in 2. points to weaken them. The one, by Division, and Disunion, of the Heads; The other, by Recovering, and Winning the <hi>People,</hi> from them, by <hi>Iustice</hi>; which, of all other Courses, is the best.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>Athenian Question</hi>; you discourse well; <hi>Quid igitur agendum est?</hi> I will shoot my Fools Bolt, since you will have it so. The Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> to be incouraged, and comforted. Above all Things, the <hi>Garrisons</hi> to be instantly provided for. For <hi>Opportunity maketh a Theef:</hi> And if he should mean never so well now; yet such an Advantage, as the Breaking, of her <hi>Majesties Garrisons,</hi> might tempt a true Man.</p>
                  <p>And because, he may as well waver, upon his own Inconstancy, as upon Occasion; (And wanton Variablenesse, is never restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but by Fear;) I hold it necessary, he be menaced, with a <hi>strong Warr:</hi> Not by <hi>Words,</hi> but by <hi>Musters,</hi> and <hi>preparations</hi> of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> here, in case the Accord proceed not: But none to be sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, lest it disturb the Treaty, and make him look to be over-run, as soon as he hath laid away Arms. And but that your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> is too easie, to passe in such Cases, from Dissimulation, to Verity; I think, if your <hi>Lordship</hi> lent your Reputation, in this Case; That is, To pretend, that if Peace go not on, and the <hi>Queen</hi> mean to make, not a <hi>Defensive Warr,</hi> as in times past, but a <hi>full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquest</hi> of those parts, of the Countrey, you would accept the Charge; I think, it would help, to settle <hi>Tyrone,</hi> in his seeking Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and win you, a great deal of <hi>Honour, gratis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that, which most properly concern's, this Action, if it prove a Peace; I think, her <hi>Majesty</hi> shall doe well, to cure the Root of the Disease; And to Professe, by a <hi>Commission,</hi> of Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men, of Respect, and Countenance, a <hi>Reformation</hi> of Abuses, Extortions, and Injustices there; And to plant, a stronger, and surer Government, than heretofore, for the Ease, and Protection, of the <hi>Subject.</hi> For the <hi>Removing</hi> of the <hi>Sword,</hi> or Government in Arms, from the <hi>Earl of Ormond</hi>; Or the sending of a <hi>Deputy,</hi> (which will ecclipse it,) if Peace follow, I think it unseasonable.</p>

                  <p>YOur late Note of my Silence, in your Occasions, hath made me set down, these few wandring Lines, as one that would say somewhat, and can say nothing, touching your <hi>Lordships</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Charge</hi> for <hi>Ireland</hi>; Which my Endeavour, I know, your <hi>Lordship</hi> will accept graciously; whether your <hi>Lordship</hi> take it, by the Handle of Occasion, ministred from your Self; or of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, from which it proceeds.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Lordship,</hi> is designed to a <hi>Service,</hi> of great <hi>Merit,</hi> and great <hi>Peril</hi>: And as the Greatness of the <hi>Peril</hi> must needs include, a like proportion of <hi>Merit</hi>: So the Greatnesse of the <hi>Merit,</hi> may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, no small Consequence of <hi>Peril,</hi> if it be not temperately go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned. For all immoderate <hi>Successe,</hi> extinguisheth <hi>Merit,</hi> and stirreth up, <hi>Distast,</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi>; The assured Forerunners, of whole Charges of <hi>Peril.</hi> But I am at the last point first; Some good Spirit, leading my Penn, to presage, to your <hi>Lordship,</hi> successe: Wherein, it is true, I am not without my <hi>Oracles,</hi> and <hi>Divinations</hi>; None of them <hi>Superstitious,</hi> and yet not all <hi>Natural.</hi> For first, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into the Course of <hi>Gods Providence,</hi> in Things now depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; And calling to consideration, how great things <hi>God</hi> hath done, by her <hi>Majesty,</hi> and for her: I collect, he hath disposed, of this great <hi>Defection,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> thereby, to give an urgent occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the <hi>Reduction,</hi> of that whole <hi>Kingdom</hi>; As upon the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of <hi>Desmond,</hi> there insued, the <hi>Reduction</hi> of that whole <hi>Province.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, your <hi>Lordship</hi> goeth against, three of the unluckiest <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> of all others; <hi>Disloyalty, Ingratitude,</hi> and <hi>Insolency</hi>: Which three <hi>Offences,</hi> in all <hi>Examples,</hi> have seldom their <hi>Doom,</hi> adjourn'd to the <hi>world to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, he that shall have had the Honour, to know your <hi>Lordship,</hi> inwardly, as I have had, shall find <hi>Bona Exta,</hi> whereby he may better ground, a Divination of <hi>Good,</hi> than upon the <hi>Dissecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> But that part I leave: For it is fit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And if any Man be of Opinion, that the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Enemy,</hi> doth extenuate, the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Service,</hi> being but a <hi>Rebell,</hi> and a <hi>Savage</hi>; I differ from him; For I see, the justest Triumphs, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> in their greatnesse, did obtain; And that, whereof the <hi>Emperours,</hi> in their Stiles, took Addition, and Denomination, were of such an <hi>Enemy,</hi> as this: That is, <hi>People Barbarous,</hi> and not reduced to <hi>Civility,</hi> magnifying a kind of lawlesse Liberty, and prodigal of Life, hardned in Body, fortified in Woods and Boggs, and placing both Justice and Felicity in sharpnesse of their Swords: Such were the <hi>Germans,</hi> and auncient <hi>Brittons,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others. Upon which kinde of <hi>People,</hi> whether the Victory were a <hi>Conquest</hi>; or a <hi>Reconquest,</hi> upon a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or a <hi>Revolt</hi>; It made no difference, (that ever I could find,) in Honour. And therefore, it is not the Enriching <hi>Predatory Warr,</hi> that hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence in Honour; Else should it be more Honour, to bring in a Carick of rich Burthen, than one of the 12. <hi>Spanish Apostles.</hi> But then, this Nature of <hi>People,</hi> doth yield, a higher point of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> considered in Truth, and Substance, than any warr can yield, which should be atchieved, against a <hi>Civil Enemy</hi>; If the

Therefore I will onely add this VVish, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>English Phrase,</hi> which termeth, a well-willing Advice, a Wish: That your <hi>Lordship,</hi> in this whole Action, looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, would set down this Position; <hi>That Merit is worthier than Fame</hi>; And looking back hither, would remember this Text, <hi>That Obedience is better than Sacrifice.</hi> For Designing to <hi>Fame,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> may make your <hi>Lordship,</hi> in the Adventure of your <hi>Person,</hi> to be valiant, as a private <hi>Souldier,</hi> rather than as a <hi>General:</hi> It may make you, in your Commandements, rather to be Gracious, than Disciplinary: It may make you presse Action, (in respect of the great Expectation conceived,) rather hastily, than seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and safely: It may make you, seek rather, to atchieve the war, by force, than by Intermixture of Practice: It may make you, (if <hi>God</hi> shall send prosperous Beginnings,) rather seek the <hi>Fruition</hi> of that <hi>Honour,</hi> than the <hi>Perfection,</hi> of the <hi>work,</hi> in hand. And for the other point, that is the Proceeding, like a good <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi> upon expresse warrant, and not upon good Intention; your <hi>Lordship</hi> knoweth, in your wisdom; That as it is most fit for you, to desire convenient Liberty of Instructions; so it is no lesse fit for you, to observe the due Limits of them: Remembring, that the Exceeding of them, may not onely procure, in case of adverse Accident, a dangerous Disavow; But also, (in case of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Successe;) be subject to Interpretation, as if all were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, to the right End.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I presumed, to write these few Lines, to your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> in <hi>Methodo Ignorantiae</hi>; which is, when a Man speaketh of a Subject, not according to the Matter, but according to the Model, of his own Knowledge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For I suppose, of all former Matters, there is a full Expiation: wherein, for any thing that your <hi>Lordship</hi> doth, I, for my part, (who am remote,) cannot cast, nor devise, wherein any Errour should be; except in one point, which I dare not censure, nor disswade: which is, that (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> saith,) <hi>In this Affliction,</hi> you look up, <hi>ad Manum Percutientem,</hi> and so make your peace with <hi>God.</hi> And yet I heard it noted, that my <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Leicester,</hi> (who could never get to be taken for a <hi>Saint,</hi> neverthelesse in the <hi>Queens</hi> Disfavour,) waxed seeming Religious: which may be thought by some, and used by others, as a Case resembling yours; If Men do not see, or will not see, the difference between your two Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. But to be plain with your <hi>Lordship,</hi> my Fear rather is, because I hear, how some of your good, and wise, Friends, not unpractised in the <hi>Court,</hi> and supposing themselves, not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen, in that deep, and unscrutable, Center of the Court, which is her <hi>Majesties Minde,</hi> doe not onely toll the Bell, but even ring out Peals, as if your Fortune were dead, and buried; And as if, there were no possibility, of recovering her <hi>Majesties</hi> Favour; And as if, the best of your Condition, were to live, a private, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Life, out of Want, out of Peril, and out of manifest disgrace; And so in this perswasion of theirs, include a perswasion to your <hi>Lordship,</hi> to frame, and accommodate your Actions, and Mind, to that End: I fear, I say, that this untimely Despair, may,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51170:162"/>
in time, bring forth, a just Despair, by causing your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> to slacken, and break off your wise, loyal, and Seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Endeavours, and Industries, for Reintegration to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties favour: In Comparison whereof, all other Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are but as <hi>Atomi</hi>; or rather, as <hi>Vacuum,</hi> without any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance at all. Against this Opinion, it may please your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> to consider, of these Reasons, which I have collected; And to make judgement of them; Neither out of the Melancholy, of your present Fortune; nor out of the Infusion of that, which commeth to you, by others Relation, (which is subject to much Tincture;) But <hi>ex Rebus ipsis,</hi> Out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the Nature, of the Persons, and Actions, themselves; As the trustiest, and least deceiving Grounds, of Opinion. For though I am so unfortunate, as to be a stranger to her <hi>Majesties</hi> Eye, and to her Nature; yet by that which is apparent, I doe manifestly discern, that she hath the Character, of the Divine Nature, and Goodnesse; <hi>Quos amavit, amavit usque ad sinem</hi>; And where she hath a Creature, she doth not deface, nor defeat it: Insomuch, as if I observe rightly, in those persons, whom heretofore she hath honoured, with her special Favour, she hath covered, and remitted, not only Defects, and Ingratitudes, in Affection, but Errours in State, and Service. Secondly, if I can spell, and Scholar-like put together, the parts of her <hi>Majesties</hi> proceeding, now towards your <hi>Lordship</hi>; I cannot but make this Construction; That her <hi>Majesty,</hi> in her Royal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, never purposed, to call your <hi>Lordships</hi> Doings, into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Question; But onely, to have used a Cloud, without a Shower, in censuring them, by some temporary Restraint onely, of Liberty, and debarring from her presence. For first, the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Cause in the <hi>Starr-Chamber,</hi> you not called, was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by the Violence, of Libelling, and Rumours; (wherein the <hi>Queen</hi> thought to have satisfied the world, and yet spared your <hi>Lordships</hi> Appearance;) And after, when that Means, which was intended, for the Quenching, of malicious Brutes, turned to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them; (Because it was said, your <hi>Lordship,</hi> was condemned unheard; And your <hi>Lordships</hi> Sister wrote that piquant <hi>Letter,</hi>) then her <hi>Majesty</hi> saw plainly, that these winds of Rumours, could not be commanded down, without a Handling of the Cause, by Making you Party, and Admitting your Defence. And to this purpose, I doe assure your <hi>Lordship,</hi> that my Brother, <hi>Francis Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> who is too wise, (I think) to be abused, and too honest, to abuse; Though he be more reserved, in all particulars, than is needful; yet, in generality, he hath ever constantly, and with asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration, affirmed to me, that both those Dayes; That of the <hi>Starr-Chamber,</hi> and that at my <hi>Lord Keepers,</hi> were wonne from the <hi>Queen,</hi> meerly upon necessity, and point of Honour, against her own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. Thirdly, in the last proceeding, I note 3. points; which are directly signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51170:162"/>
any point, which was Irreparable, or might make your <hi>Lordship,</hi> in any degree, uncapable, of the return of her favour; Or might fix, any Character Indeleble, of disgrace upon you: For she spared, the Publick Place, of the <hi>Starr-Chamber</hi>: She limited the Charge, precisely, not to touch Disloyalty; And no Record re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to Memory, of the Charge, or Sentence. Fourthly, the very Distinction, which was made, in the Sentence, of Sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the places of Service in State; And leaving to your <hi>Lordship,</hi> the Place, of <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Horse,</hi> doth, to my understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>indicativè,</hi> point at this; That her <hi>Majesty</hi> meant, to use your <hi>Lordships</hi> Attendance in <hi>Court,</hi> while the Exercises, of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, stood suspended. Fifthly, I have heard, and your <hi>Lordship</hi> knoweth better, that now, since you were in your own Custodie, her <hi>Majesty,</hi> in <hi>Verbo Regio,</hi> and by his Mouth, by whom she committeth, her Royal Graunts, and Decrees, hath assured your <hi>Lordship,</hi> she will forbid, and not suffer, your Ruine. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I have heard, her <hi>Majesty,</hi> to be a <hi>Prince,</hi> of that Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that she will spare, the Service, of the ablest <hi>Subject,</hi> or <hi>Peer,</hi> when she shall be thought, to stand in need of it: So she is, of that Policy, as she will not loose, the Service, of a meaner than your <hi>Lordship,</hi> where it shall depend, meerly, upon her Choice, and Will. Seventhly, I hold it for a Principle; That those <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e hardest to cure, whereof the <hi>Cause</hi> is obscure; And those easiest, whereof the <hi>Cause</hi> is manifest: VVhereupon I conclude, that since it hath been your Errour, in your Courses, towards her <hi>Majesty,</hi> which hath prejudiced you; That your Reforming, and Conformity, will restore you; So as you may be <hi>Faber Fortunae propriae.</hi> Lastly, considering your <hi>Lordship,</hi> is removed, from Dealing in Causes of State, and left onely to a Place of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; Methinks, the Ambition of any Man, who can endure no Partners, in State-Matters, may be so quenched, as they should not, laboriously, oppose themselves, to your Being in <hi>Court</hi>: So as upon the whole Matter, I cannot find, neither in her <hi>Majesties</hi> Person, nor in your own Person, nor in any third Person; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in former Presidents, nor in your own Case, any Cause, of dry, and peremptory, Despair. Neither do I speak this, but that if her <hi>Majesty,</hi> out of her Resolution, would design you, to a private Life, you should be as willing, upon her Appointment, to goe into the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> as into the <hi>Land of Promise.</hi> Onely, I wish your <hi>Lordship,</hi> will not preoccupate Despair, but put trust, next to <hi>God,</hi> in her <hi>Majesties</hi> Grace; and not to be wanting to your Self. I know your <hi>Lordship,</hi> may justly interpret, that this, which I perswade, may have some reference to my particular; because I may truly say; <hi>Te Stante, Non Virebo,</hi> (For I am withered in my self;) but <hi>Manebo,</hi> or <hi>Tenebo</hi>; I shall, in some sort, be, or hold out. But though your <hi>Lordships</hi> Years, and Health, may expect return of Grace, and Fortune; yet your Eclipse for a time,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51170:163"/>
is an <hi>Vltimum Vale,</hi> to my Fortune: And were it not, that I desire, and hope, to see my <hi>Brother</hi> established, by her <hi>Majesties</hi> favour; (as I think him well worthy, for that he hath done, and suffred,) it were time, I did take that Course, from which I disswade your <hi>Lordship.</hi> But now in the mean time, I cannot choose, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, those honest Duties, unto you, to whom I have been so deeply bounden.</p>

Wherein, for <hi>Munster,</hi> it may be, (because it is not <hi>Res integra</hi>; but that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Vndertakers,</hi> stand interessed,) there will be some Difficulty: But surely, in mine Opinion, either by Agreeing with them, or by Over-ruling them, with a Parliament, in <hi>Ireland</hi>; (which in this Course, of a Politick Proceeding, infinite Occasions, will require, speedily, to be held;) It will be fit, to supply, fit quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Persons,</hi> of <hi>Vndertakers.</hi> The other, that it be not left, (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,) to the Pleasure, of the <hi>Vndertakers,</hi> and <hi>Adventurers,</hi> where, and how, to <hi>build,</hi> and <hi>plant</hi>; But that they doe, according to a Prescript, or Formulary: For first, the Places, both <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> and <hi>Inland,</hi> which are fittest, for <hi>Colonies,</hi> or <hi>Garrisons</hi>; As well, for doubt of the Foreiner, as for the Keeping the Countrey, in Bridle, would be found, surveyed, and resolved upon: And that the Patentees, be tyed, to build, in those places onely, and to fortify, as shall be thought convenient.

                     <hi>SIR,</hi> For our Money matters, I am assured, you received no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction: For you know my Minde; And you know my Means; which now, the Openness of the time, caused, by this blessed Consent, and Peace, will encrease; And so our Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to your time, be observed. For the present, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Roman Adage</hi>; (That one <hi>Cluster of Grapes, ripeneth best besides another</hi>;) I know, you hold me not unworhty, whose mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> will make no great difference,) as for the Stuff and Sufficiency, which, I know, to be in you; And whereof, I know, his <hi>Majesty,</hi> may reap great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And therefore, my general Request is, that according to that industrious Vivacity, which you use, towards your Friends, you will further his <hi>Majesties</hi> good Conceit, and Inclination, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me; To whom words, can not make me known; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mine own, nor others; but Time will, to no Disadvantage, of any, that shall fore-runn, his <hi>Majesties</hi> Experience, by your Testimony, and Commendation. And though, Occasion give you the Precedence, of Doing me this special good O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

More particularly, having thought good, to make Oblation, of my most humble Service, to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> by a few Lines, I doe desire your loving care, and help, by your Self, or such Means, as I referr to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51170:168"/>
your Discretion, to deliver, and present the same, to his <hi>Majesties</hi> Hands. Of which <hi>Letter,</hi> I send you a Copy, that you may know, what you carry; And may take, of <hi>Mr. Matthew,</hi> the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> it Self; if you be pleased, to undertake the Delivery. Lastly, I doe commend to your Self, and such your Curtesies, as Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may require, this Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Matthew</hi>; eldest Sonne, to my <hi>Lord Bishop,</hi> of <hi>Duresm,</hi> and my very good Friend; Assuring you, that any Curtesy, you shall use towards him, you shall use, to a very worthy young <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and one, I know, whose Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, you will much esteem. And so I ever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</p>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Faules,</hi> I did write unto you, yesterday, by Mr. <hi>Lake,</hi> (who was dispatched hence, from their <hi>Lordships,</hi>) a Letter, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivour, of those Sparks of former Acquaintance, between us, in my <hi>Brothers</hi> time: And now, upon the same Confidence, finding so fit a Messenger, I would not fail to salute you; Hoping it will fall out so happily, as that you shall be one, of the <hi>Kings</hi> Servants, which his <hi>Majesty,</hi> will first employ, here with us: where, I hope, to have some means, not to be barren, in Friendship, towards you.

                  <p>MR. <hi>Kempe,</hi> This Alteration is so great, as you might justly conceive, some Coldness of my Affection towards you, if you should hear nothing from me, I living in this Place. It is in vain to tell you, with what wonderfull Still, and Calm, this Wheel is turned round: Which, whether it be, a <hi>Remnant,</hi> of her <hi>Felicity,</hi> that is gone, or a Fruit, of his <hi>Reputation,</hi> that is comming, I will not determine. For I cannot, but divide my Self, between her <hi>Memory,</hi> and his <hi>Name</hi>: Yet we account it, but a fair <hi>Morn</hi> before <hi>Sun-rising,</hi> before his <hi>Majesties</hi> Presence; Though, for my part, I see not, whence any VVeather should arise. The <hi>Papists</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, with Fear enough, and Hope too much.

My <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Southampton,</hi> expecteth Release, by the next Dispatch, and is already much visited, and much well wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There is continual poasting, by Men of good Quality, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>King.</hi> The rather, I think, because this Spring time, it is but a kinde of Sport. It is hoped, that as the <hi>State</hi> here, hath performed the part, of good <hi>Atturneys,</hi> to deliver the <hi>King,</hi> quiet Possession, of his <hi>Kingdoms</hi>: So the <hi>King,</hi> will re-deliver them, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Possession of their <hi>Places</hi>; Rather filling Places void, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Men placed.

Histories,</hi> so <hi>Histories,</hi> are <hi>speaking Pictures</hi>: wherein, if my Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be not too great, or my Reading too small, I am of this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That if <hi>Plutarch,</hi> were alive, to write <hi>Lives,</hi> by <hi>Parallels,</hi> it would trouble him, for Vertue, and Fortune both, to finde for her, a <hi>Parallel,</hi> amongst <hi>Women.</hi> And though she was of the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Sexe,</hi> yet her <hi>Government,</hi> was so <hi>Active,</hi> as in my simple Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it made more Impression, upon the several <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> than it received from thence. But, I confess, unto your <hi>Lordship,</hi> I could not stay there, but went a little further, into the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Times, which have passed, since <hi>King Henry</hi> the 8th; wherein I find the strangest Variety, that, in so little Number, of <hi>Successions</hi> of any <hi>Hereditary Monarchy,</hi> hath ever been known: The <hi>Reign</hi> of a <hi>Child</hi>: The offer of an <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> though it were but as a <hi>Diary Ague</hi>; The <hi>Reign,</hi> of a Lady, married, to a <hi>Foreiner</hi>; And the <hi>Reign,</hi> of a <hi>Lady,</hi> Solitary, and Unmarried; So that, as it commeth to pass, in Massive Bodies; That they have certain Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidations, and Waverings, before they fix, and settle; So it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that by the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> this <hi>Monarchy,</hi> (before it was to settle in his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and his Generations; In which, I hope, it is now established, for ever;) Hath had these Prelusive changes, in these Barren <hi>Princes.</hi> Neither, could I contain my Self here; (As it is easier to multiply, than to stay a Wish;) But calling to Remembrance, the Unworthiness, of the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in the main continuance thereof; And the Partiality, and Obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the latest, and largest Offer, that I have seen; I conceived, it would be Honour, for his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and a work very memorable, if this <hi>Island</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as it is now joyned, in <hi>Monarchy,</hi> for the Ages to come; so it were joyned in <hi>History,</hi> for the Times past; And that one Just, and compleat, <hi>History,</hi> were compiled, of both <hi>Nations.</hi> And if any Man think, it may refresh the Memory, of former Discords, he may satisfy himself with the Verse; <hi>Olim haec meminisse juvabit.</hi> For the Case being now altered, it is Matter of Comfort, and Gratulation, to remember former Troubles. Thus much, if it may please your <hi>Lordship,</hi> is in the <hi>Optative Mood.</hi> It is time, that I did, Look a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, into the <hi>Potential</hi>: wherein the Hope, which I conceived, was grounded, upon 3. <hi>Observations.</hi> The First, the <hi>Nature</hi> of these <hi>Times,</hi> which flourish in Learning, both of Art, and Language: which giveth Hope, not onely that it may be done, but that it may be well done. Secondly, I doe see that, which all the <hi>World</hi> see's, in his <hi>Majesty,</hi> both a wonderfull Judgement in Learning, and a singular Affection towards Learning; And works, which are of the <hi>Mind,</hi> and not of the <hi>Hand.</hi> For there cannot be, the like Honour sought, in building of <hi>Galleries,</hi> and Planting of <hi>Elmes,</hi> along high-wayes, and the outward <hi>Ornaments,</hi> wherein <hi>France</hi> now is busie; (Things rather of <hi>Magnificence,</hi> than of <hi>Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>;) As there is, in the <hi>Vniting</hi> of <hi>States, Pacifying</hi> of <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51170:171"/>
Nourishing,</hi> and <hi>Augmenting,</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> and the particular Actions appertaining unto these; Of which kind, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> judged truly, when he said to <hi>Caesar; Quantum Operibus tuis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahet Vetustas, tantum addet laudibus.</hi> And lastly, I call to minde, that your <hi>Lordship,</hi> at some times, had been pleased, to express unto me, a great desire, that something of this Nature should be performed; Answerable, indeed, to your other noble, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Courses, and Actions: Joyning, and adding, unto the great Services, towards his <hi>Majesty</hi>; (which have, in small Compass of Time, been put upon your <hi>Lordship,</hi>) other great Deservings, both of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and <hi>Particulars</hi>: So as the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of so great, and wise a Man, doth seem to me, a good War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, both of the Possibility, and Worth, of this Matter. But all this while, I assure my Self, I cannot be mistaken, by your <hi>Lordship,</hi> as if I sought an O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So, in all Humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I conclude, my presenting unto your <hi>Lordship,</hi> of this <hi>Wish</hi>; which, if it perish, it is but a loss of that, which is not: And so craving pardon, that I have taken so much time, from your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> I remain.</p>

                  <p>A Great Desire, will take a small Occasion; to hope, and put in Trial, that which is desired. It pleased you, a good while since, to express unto me, the good Liking, which you conceived, of my <hi>Book,</hi> of the <hi>Advancement of Learning</hi>; and that more Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly, (as it seem'd to me,) than out of Curtesie, or Civil Respect.

Wherein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I set down, in plain Terms, my request unto you, I will open my Self, what it was, which I chiefly sought, and propounded, to my Self, in that <hi>Work</hi>; That you may perceive, that which I now desire, to be pursuant thereupon. If I doe not much erre, (For any Judgement, that a Man maketh, of his own Doings, had need be spoken, with a <hi>Si nunquam fallit Imago,</hi>) I have this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that if I had sought mine own Commendation, it had been, a much fitter Course <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But for as much, as my End, was Merit, of the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> (to my Power,) and not <hi>Glory</hi>; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my purpose was, rather to Excite, other Mens Wits, than to magnify mine own; I was desirous, to prevent the uncertainness, of mine own Life, &amp; Times, by uttering rather Seeds, than Plants: Nay, and further, (as the <hi>Proverb</hi> is,) by sowing with the <hi>Basket,</hi> rather than with the <hi>Hand:</hi> Wherefore, since I have only taken upon me, to ring a Bell, to call other wits together, (which is the meanest Office,) it cannot but be consonant to my Desire, to have that Bell heard, as farr as can be. And since they are but Sparks, which can work but upon Matter prepared, I have the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to wish, that those Sparks may fly abroad, That they may the better find, and light, upon those Minds, and Spirits, which are apt to be kindled. And therefore, the Privateness of the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> considered, wherein it is written, excluding so many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; As on the other side, the Obscurity of the Argument, in many parts of it, excludeth many others; I must accompt it, a <hi>Second Birth,</hi> of that <hi>Work,</hi> if it might be translated into <hi>Latine,</hi> without manifest loss, of the Sense, and Matter. For this purpose, I could not represent to my Self, any Man, into whose hands, I doe more earnestly desire, that <hi>Work</hi> should fall, than your Self: For by that, I have heard, and read, I know no Man, a greater

Master, in Commanding Words, to serve Matter. Nevertheless, I am not ignorant of the worth of your Labours; Whether such as your Place, and Profession imposeth; Or such, as your own Vertue, may, upon your Voluntary Election, take in hand. But I can lay before you, no other perswasions, than either the <hi>Work</hi> it Self, may affect you with; Or the <hi>Honour,</hi> of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> to whom it is dedicated; Or your Particular Inclination to my Self; who, as I never took so much comfort, in any Labours of mine own, so I shall never acknowledge my Self, more obliged, in any thing, to the Labour of another, than in that, which shall assist it.

For with me it is thus; and I think with all Men in my Case: If I bind my Self, to an Argument, it loadeth my Minde: But if I rid my Mind, of the present Cogitation, it is rather a Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This hath put me into these <hi>Miscellanies</hi>; which I purpose to suppress, if <hi>God</hi> give me leave, to write, a just, and perfect Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, of Philosophy, which I goe on with, though slowly.

And though, for the Matter it self, my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be, in some things, fixed, and not Accessible by any Mans Judgement, that goeth not my way; yet even in those Things, the Admonition of a Friend, may make me, express my Self, di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>MR. <hi>Matthew</hi>; I plainly perceive, by your affectionate writing, touching my Work, that one, and the same Thing, affecteth us both; which is, the good End, to which it is dedicate. For as to any Ability of mine, it cannot merit, that Degree, of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. For your Caution for <hi>Church Men,</hi> and <hi>Church Matters</hi>; As for any Impediment, it might be, to the Applause, and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity, of my <hi>Work</hi>; It moveth me not; But as it may hinder the Fruit, and Good, which may come, of a quiet, and calm, passage, to the good Port, to which it is bound, I hold it a just respect; So as to fetch a fair Winde, I go not too farr about.

                  <p>MR. <hi>Atturney,</hi> I thought best, once for all, to let you know, in plainness, what I finde of you, and what you shall find of me: You take to your self, a Liberty, to disgrace, and disable my <hi>Law,</hi> my <hi>Experience,</hi> my <hi>Discretion</hi>: What it pleaseth you, I pray, think of me; I am one, that know's both mine own wants, and other Mens: And it may be, perchance, that mine mend, others stand at a stay. And surely, I may not endure, in publick place, to be wronged, without repelling the same, to my best advantage, to right my Self. You are great, and therefore have the more Enviers; which would be glad, to have you paid, at anothers cost. Since the time, I missed the <hi>Solliciters</hi> place, (the rather I think by your means,) I cannot expect, that you, and I shall ever serve, as <hi>Atturney,</hi> and <hi>Solliciter,</hi> together; But either, to serve with another, upon your Remove, or to step into some other Course: So as, I am more free, than ever I was, from any Occasion, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Conforming my Self to you; More than general good manners, or your particular good Usage, shall provoke. And if you had not been, short sighted, in your own Fortune, (as I think,) you might have had more use of me. But that Tide is passed. I write not this, to shew my Friends, what a brave <hi>Letter,</hi> I have written, to Mr. <hi>Atturney</hi>: I have none of those Humours: But that I have written, is to a good End; That is, to the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Carriage, of my <hi>Masters Service</hi>; And to our particular, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Understanding One of Another. This <hi>Letter,</hi> if it shall be answered by you, in deed, and not in word, I suppose, it will not be worse, for us both: Else it is but a few Lines lost; which, for a much smaller Matter, I would have adventured.

Certainly, were it not, that I think my Self born, to doe my <hi>Soveraign</hi> Service; And therefore, in that Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I will live and dye; Otherwise, for mine own Private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, it were better for me, that the <hi>King,</hi> did blot me out of his <hi>Book</hi>; Or that I should turn my Course, to endeavour, to serve, in some other kinde, than for me, to stand thus at a stopp; And to have that little Reputation, which by my Industry I gather, to be scattered, and taken away, by continual Disgraces, every new Man comming above me. Sure I am, I shall never have fairer Promises, and Words, from all your <hi>Lordships.</hi> For I know not what my Services are, (saving that your <hi>Lordships</hi> told me, they were good;) And I would beleeve you, in a much greater Matter. Were it nothing else, I hope the Modesty of my Sute, deserveth somewhat; For I know well, the <hi>Solliciters</hi> Place, is not as your <hi>Lordship,</hi> left it; Time working Alteration, somewhat in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, much more in that special Place. But to conclude, as my <hi>Honourable Lady,</hi> your Wife, was some Mean, to make me, to change the Name of Another; So if it please you, to help me, to change mine own Name, I can be, but more and more bounden to you: And I am much deceived, if your <hi>Lordship,</hi> finde not the <hi>King,</hi> well inclined, and my <hi>Lord of Salisbury</hi> forward, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate.</p>

                  <p>HOw honestly ready I have been (most gracious <hi>Soveraign,</hi>) to doe your <hi>Majesty</hi> humble Service, to the best of my power, and in a manner, beyond my power, (as I now stand,) I am not so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, but your <hi>Majestie</hi> knoweth. For both, in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> of <hi>Vnion,</hi> (the Labour whereof, for Men of my Profession, rested most upon my hand;) And this last <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the <hi>Bill</hi> of the <hi>Subsidy</hi>; Both Body and Preamble; In the <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Attainders,</hi> both <hi>Tresham,</hi> and the rest; In the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Purveyance</hi>; In the <hi>Ecclesiastical Petitions</hi>; In the <hi>Grievances</hi>; And the like; as I was ever carefull, (and not without good Success,) sometimes to put forward, that which was good; sometimes to keep back, that which was not so good; So your <hi>Majesty</hi> was pleased, kindly to accept of my Services, and to say to me; Such Conflicts were the Warrs of Peace; And such Victories the Victories of Peace; And therefore such Servants, that obtained them, were by <hi>Kings,</hi>

                  <head>A <hi>Letter,</hi> to my <hi>Lord Mayour,</hi> upon a Proceeding, in a Private Cause.</head>
                  <p>MY very good <hi>Lord</hi>; I did little expect, when I left your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> last, that there would have been, a Proceeding against Mr. <hi>Barnard,</hi> to his Overthrow. Wherein I must confess my Self, to be, in a sort, Accessary: Because, he relying upon me, for Counsel, I advised that Course, which he followed. Wherein now I begin, to question my self, whether in preserving my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, unto your <hi>Lordship,</hi> and the Rest, I have not failed, in the Duty, of my Profession, towards my Client, For certainly, if the words had been hainous, and spoken in a malicious fashion, and in some publick place, and well proved; And not a Prattle, in a Tavern, caught hold of by one, who, (as I hear) is a detected Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophant (<hi>Standish</hi> I mean;) yet I know not, what could have been done more, than to impose upon him, a grievous Fine; And to require, the Levying of the same; And to Take away his means of Life, by his <hi>Disfranchisement</hi>; And to commit him, to a Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Prison, during <hi>Christmass</hi>; In Honour whereof, the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in other Courts, doe, commonly, of grace, obtain some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement. This Rigor of Proceeding, (to tell your <hi>Lordship,</hi> and the rest, as my good Friends, my Opinion, plainly,) tendeth not to strengthen <hi>Authority,</hi> which is best supported, by Love, and Fear, intermixed; But rather, to make People discontented, and Servile; especially, when such Punishment is inflicted, for words, not by Rule of <hi>Law,</hi> but by a <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> of <hi>Discretion,</hi> which would evermore, be moderately used. And I pray <hi>God,</hi> whereas Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> when I was with you, did well, and wisely, put you in mind, of the Admonitions, you often received from my <hi>Lords,</hi> that you should bridle unruly Tongues; That those kind of Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Rumours, whereunto those Admonitions doe referr, which are concerning the <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Honour thereof,</hi> doe not pass too licentiously, in the <hi>City,</hi> unpunished; while these Words, which concern your particular, are so straightly enquired into, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with such Extremiy. But these Things, your own wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, (first, or last,) will best represent unto you. My writing unto you at this time, is, to the end, that howsoever I doe take it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unkindly, that my Mediation prevailed no more; yet I might preserve, that further Respect, that I am willing to use, unto such a State, in delivering my Opinion, unto you, freely, before I would be of Counsel, or move any thing, that should cross your Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; which, notwithstanding, (in case, my Client, can receive no Relief, at your hands,) I must, and will doe. Continuing, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, in other Things, my wonted good Affection, to your Selves, and your Occasions.</p>

                  <p>THis Day, in the Afternoon, was read, your <hi>Majesties</hi> Letters, of Direction, touching <hi>Peacham</hi>; which because it concerneth properly the Duty of my Place, I thought it fit, for me, to give your <hi>Majesty,</hi> both a speedy, and a private, Account thereof; That your <hi>Majesty</hi> knowing Things, clearly, how they pass, may have the true Fruit, of your own Wisdom, and clear-Seeing Judgement, in Governing the <hi>Business.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, for the <hi>Regularity,</hi> which your <hi>Majesty,</hi> (as a Master in Business of <hi>Estate,</hi>) doth prudently prescribe, in Examining, and taking Examinations, I subscribe to it; Onely, I will say for my Self; that I was not, at this time, the Principal Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>For the Course, your <hi>Majesty</hi> directeth, and commandeth, for the feeling of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> their Several Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by distributing our Selves, and enjoyning Secrecy; we did first, finde an Encounter, in the Opinion, of my <hi>Lord Cooke</hi>; who seemed to affirm, that such particular, and, (as he call'd it,) <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular</hi> Taking of Opinions, was not according to the Custom of this <hi>Realm</hi>; And seemed to divine, that his <hi>Brethren,</hi> would never doe it. But when I replyed, that it was our Duty, to pursue your <hi>Majesties</hi> Directions; And it were not amiss, for his <hi>Lordship,</hi> to leave his <hi>Brethren,</hi> to their own Answers; It was so concluded; and his <hi>Lordship,</hi> did desire, that I mought conferr with Himself; And Mr. <hi>Serjeant Mountague,</hi> was named, to speak with <hi>Iustice Crooke</hi>; Mr. <hi>Serjeant Crew,</hi> with <hi>Iustice Houghton</hi>; and Mr. <hi>Solliciter,</hi> with <hi>Iustice Dodderidge.</hi> This done, I took my Fellows aside, and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that they should presently speak with the 3. <hi>Iudges,</hi> before I could speak with my <hi>Lord Cooke,</hi> for doubt of Infusion; And that they should not, in any case, make any doubt to the <hi>Iudges,</hi> as if they mistrusted, they would not deliver any Opinion apart, but speak resolutely to them, and onely make their Comming to be, to know, what time they would appoint, to be attended with the Papers. This sorted not amiss; For Mr. <hi>Solliciter,</hi> came to me, this Evening, and related to me, that he had found <hi>Iudge Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deridge,</hi> very ready, to give Opinion, in secret; And fell upon the same reason, which upon your <hi>Majesties</hi> first <hi>Letter,</hi> I had used to my <hi>Lord Cooke,</hi> at the <hi>Council Table</hi>; which was, that every <hi>Iudge,</hi> was bound, expresly, by his <hi>Oath,</hi> to give your <hi>Majesty</hi> Counsel, when he was called; And whether he should doe it, joyntly, or severally, that rested, in your <hi>Maiesties</hi> good pleasure, as you would require it. And though the Ordinary Course, was to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51170:180"/>
assemble them, yet there mought intervene Cases, wherein the other Course was more convenient. The like Answer made <hi>Iustice Crook. Iustice Houghton,</hi> who is a soft Man, seemed desirous, first, to conferr; Alleging, that the other 3. <hi>Iudges,</hi> had all served the <hi>Crown,</hi> before they were <hi>Iudges,</hi> but that he had not been much acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with Business, of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>We purpose therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orthwith, they shall be made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Papers</hi>; And if that could be done, as suddainly, as this was, I should make small doubt of their Opinions: And howsoever, I hope, Force of Law, and President, will bind them to the Truth: Neither am I wholly out of hope, that my <hi>Lord Cooke</hi> himself, when I have, in some dark manner, put him in doubt, that he shall be left alone, will not continue singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Owen,</hi> I know not the reason, why there should have been no Mention made thereof, in the last Advertisement: For I must say for my Self, that I have lost no moment of Time in it, as my <hi>Lord of Canterbury</hi> can bear me witness. For having received, from my <hi>Lord,</hi> an <hi>Additional,</hi> of great Importance; which was, that <hi>Owen,</hi> of his own Accord, after Examination, should compare the Case of your <hi>Majesty,</hi> (if you were <hi>Excommunicate,</hi>) to the Case, of a Prisoner, Condemned at the Barr; which <hi>Additional</hi> was subscribed by one Witness; but yet I perceived it was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken aloud, and in the Hearing of others; I presently sent down a Copy thereof, which is now come up, attested with the Hands, of 3. more, lest there should have been, any Scruple, of <hi>Singularis Testis</hi>; So as for this Case, I may say, <hi>Omnia parata</hi>; And we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but a Direction, from your <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I forget not, nor forslow not, your <hi>Majesties</hi> Commandement, touching <hi>Recusants</hi>; Of which, when it is ripe, I will give your <hi>Majesty,</hi> a true Account, and what is possible to be done, and where the Impediment is. Mr. <hi>Secretary,</hi> bringeth <hi>Bonam Voluntatem,</hi> but he is not versed much, in these things; And sometimes urgeth the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> without the <hi>premises,</hi> and by haste hindreth. It is my <hi>Lord Treasurer,</hi> and the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> must help it, if it be holpen. I have heard more wayes than one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of an ofter of 20000 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> for farming, the Penalties of Recusants, not including any Offence <hi>Capital,</hi> or of <hi>Premunire</hi>; wherein I will presume to say, that my poor Endeavours, since I was, by your great, and sole grace, your <hi>Atturney,</hi> have been no small Spurrs, to make them feel your <hi>Laws,</hi> and seek this <hi>Redemption</hi>; Wherein, I must also say, my <hi>Lord Cooke</hi> hath done his part: And I doe assure your <hi>Majesty,</hi> I know it, somewhat inwardly, and groundedly, that by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses we have taken, they conform daily, and in great Numbers; And I would to <hi>God,</hi> it were as well a <hi>Conversion,</hi> as a <hi>Conformity</hi>;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51170:181"/>
But if it should die, by Dispensation, or Dissimulation, then I fear, that whereas your <hi>Majesty,</hi> hath now, so many ill Subjects, poor, and detected, you shall then have them, rich and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. And therefore, I hold this offer, very considerable, of so great an Increase, of <hi>Revenew</hi>; If it can pass, the <hi>fiery Trial,</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi>; which I wish, all <hi>Projects</hi> may pass.</p>
                  <p>Thus, in as much, as I have made to your <hi>Majesty,</hi> somewhat a naked, and particular account, of Business, I hope your <hi>Majesty,</hi> will use it accordingly. <hi>God</hi> preserve your <hi>Majesty.</hi>

                  <p>For <hi>Peachams</hi> Case, I have, since my last Letter, been with my Lord <hi>Cooke,</hi> twice; Once before Mr. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cretaries</hi> going down, to your <hi>Majesty</hi>; And once since, which was yesterday: At the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of which times, I delivered him <hi>Peachams papers</hi>; And at this Latter, the <hi>Presidents,</hi> which I had, with care, gathered, and selected: For these Degrees, and order, the Business requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>At the former, I told him, that he knew my Errand, which stood upon two points: The one to inform him, of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Case, of <hi>Peachams Treasons</hi>; (For I never give it, other word, to him;) The other, to receive his Opinion, to my Self, and in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, according to my Commission, from your <hi>Majesty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the former time, he fell, upon the same Allegation, which he had begun, at the <hi>Council Table</hi>; that <hi>Iudges,</hi> were not to give Opinion, by Fractions, but entirely, according to the Vote, whereupon they should settle, upon conference: And that, this <hi>Auricular</hi> Taking of Opinions, single, and apart, was new, and dangerous; And other words, more vehement, than I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat.</p>
                  <p>I replyed, in Civil, and plain, Terms; That I wisht his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> in my love to him, to think better of it; For that this, that his <hi>Lordship</hi> was pleased, to put into great Words, seemed to me, and my Fellows, when we spake of it, amongst our selves, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and familiar Matter, For a <hi>King</hi> to consult with his <hi>Iudges,</hi> either assembled, or selected; or one, by one. And then, to give him a little Outlet, to save his first Opinion, (wherewith he is most commonly in love,) I added, that <hi>Iudges,</hi> some times, might make a Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, for Reason of <hi>Estate,</hi> should think it fit, to have it otherwise, and should so demand it, there was no declining: Nay, that it touched, upon a Violation, of their <hi>Oath,</hi> which was, to counsel the <hi>King,</hi> without Distinction, whether it were joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or severally. Thereupon, I put him the Case, of the <hi>Privy Council</hi>; As if your <hi>Majesty,</hi> should be pleased, to command any
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51170:182"/>
of them, to deliver their Opinion, a part, and in private; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were a good Answer, to deny it, otherwise, than if it were propounded, at the Table. To this he said, That the Cases were not alike, because this concern'd Life. To which I replyed, That Questions of <hi>Estate,</hi> mought concern Thousands of Lives, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Things more precious, than the Life, of a particular; As <hi>Warr,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, his <hi>Lordship, tanquam Exitum quaerens,</hi> desired me, for the time, to leave with him, the <hi>Papers,</hi> without pressing him, to consent, to deliver a private Opinion, till he had perused them. I said, I would; And the more willingly, because I thought his <hi>Lordship,</hi> upon due consideration, of the <hi>Papers,</hi> would finde the Case, to be so clear a Case, of <hi>Treason,</hi> as he would make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, to deliver his Opinion, in private; And so I was perswaded, of the rest, of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi>; who likewise, (as I partly understood,) made no Scruple, to deliver their Opinion, in private. Whereunto he said, (which I noted well,) That his Brethren were wise Men; And that, they might make a shew, as if they would give an Opinion, as was required; But the end would be, that it would come to this; They would say, they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, and so pray advice, with the rest. But to this I answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that I was sorry, to hear him say so much, lest, if it came so to pass, some that loved him not, might make a Construction, that that, which he had foretold, he had wrought. Thus your <hi>Majesty</hi> see's, that as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith; <hi>Gressus nolentis tanquam in Sepi spinarum</hi>; It catcheth upon every Thing.</p>
                  <p>The latter Meeting, is yet, of more Importance; For then, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming armed, with divers presidents, I thought, to set in, with the best strength, I could, and said; That before I descended, to the Record, I would break the <hi>Case,</hi> to him thus. That it was true, we were to proceed, upon the antient <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>King Edward the</hi> 3. because other <hi>Temporary Statutes</hi> were gone; And therefore, it must be said in the <hi>Indictment; Imaginatus est, et Compassavit, Mortem, et finalem Destructionem, Domini Regis</hi>: Then must the particular <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> follow in this manner; viz. <hi>Et quod, ad perimplendum nefandum Propositum suum, composuit, &amp; conscripsit, quendam detestabilem, et ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenosum libellum, sive scriptum, in quo inter alia proditoria, continetur,</hi> &amp;c.

This I represented to him, (being a thing he is well acquainted with,) that he might perceive, the

                  <p>That there be 4. Means or manners, whereby the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> is compassed, and imagined.</p>

                     <item>The second, by <hi>Disabling</hi> his <hi>Title</hi>; As by affirming, that he is not <hi>lawfull King</hi>; Or that another ought to be <hi>King</hi>; Or that hee is an <hi>Vsurper</hi>; Or a <hi>Bastard</hi>; Or the like.</item>
                     <item>The third, by <hi>Subjecting</hi> his <hi>Title,</hi> to the <hi>Pope</hi>; and thereby Making him, of an <hi>Absolute King,</hi> a <hi>Conditional King.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>These things, I relate to your <hi>Majesty,</hi> in summ, as is fit; which when, I opened to my <hi>Lord</hi>; I did insist a little more upon, with more efficacy and edge, and Authority of <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Record,</hi> than I can now express.</p>
                  <p>Then I placed <hi>Peachams Treason,</hi> within the last Division, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to divers presidents, whereof I had the <hi>Records</hi> ready; And concluded, that your <hi>Majesties</hi> Safety, and Life, and Authority, was thus by Law inscansed, and quartered; And that it was in vain, to fortify, on Three of the sides, and so leave you open on the Fourth.</p>
                  <p>It is true, he heard me, in a grave fashion, more than accustomed, and took a Pen, and took notes of my Divisions; And when he read the <hi>Presidents,</hi> and <hi>Records,</hi> would say; This you mean falleth within your first, or your second, Division. In the end, I expresly demanded his Opinion, as that, whereto both he, and I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. But he desired me, to leave the <hi>Presidents,</hi> with him, that he might advise upon them. I told him, the rest of my <hi>Fellows,</hi> would dispatch their part, and I should be behinde with mine; which I perswaded my Self, your <hi>Majesty</hi> would impute, rather to his Backwardness, than my Negligence. He said, as soon as I should understand, that the rest were ready, he would not be long after, with his Opinion.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>I. S.</hi> your <hi>Majesty</hi> knoweth, the day draweth on; And my <hi>Lord Chancellers</hi> Recovery, the Season, and his Age, promising, not to be too hasty.

                  <p>MY <hi>Lord Chanceller,</hi> sent for me, to speak with me, this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, about 8. of the clock. I perceive, he hath now, that <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Sanitatis,</hi> as to feel better his former weakness. For it is true, I did a little mistrust, that it was but a <hi>Boutade,</hi> of Desire, and good Spirit, when he promised himself, strength for Friday, though I was wonn, and carried with it. But now, I finde him, well inclined, to use, (should I say) your <hi>Liberty,</hi> or rather your <hi>Interdict,</hi> signifyed by Mr. <hi>Secretary,</hi> from your <hi>Majesty.</hi> His <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> shewed me also, your own <hi>Letter,</hi> whereof he had told me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but had not shewed it me. What shall I say? I doe much admire, your Goodness, for writing such a <hi>Letter,</hi> at such a time.</p>
                  <p>He had sent also, to my <hi>Lord Treasurer,</hi> to desire him, to come to him about that time. His <hi>Lordship</hi> came; And, not to trouble
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51170:183"/>
your <hi>Majesty,</hi> with circumstances, both their <hi>Lordships</hi> concluded, my Self present, and concurring; That it could be no prejudice, to your <hi>Majesties</hi> Service, to put off the day, for I. S. till the next <hi>Term.</hi> The rather, because there are Seven, of your <hi>Privy Council,</hi> which are at least, Numerus, and part of the Court, which are by Infirmity, like to be absent; That is, my Lord <hi>Chanceller,</hi> my Lord <hi>Admiral,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Exceter,</hi> my Lord <hi>Zouch,</hi> my Lord <hi>Stanhope,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chanceller</hi> of the <hi>Dutchy</hi>: wherefore they agreed, to hold a Council, too morrow, in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that I was alwayes of Opinion, that it was no time lost; And I doe think so, the rather, because I could be content, that the Matter of <hi>Peacham,</hi> were first setled, and put to a point. For there be, perchance, that would make the Example upon I.S. to stand for all. For <hi>Peacham,</hi> I expect, some account, from my <hi>Fellows,</hi> this day. If it should fall out otherwise, then, I hope, it may not, be left so. Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> in your last <hi>Letter,</hi> very wisely, put in a Disjunctive, that the <hi>Iudges,</hi> should deliver an Opinion, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, either to my Lord <hi>Chanceller,</hi> or to our Selves, distributed: His Sickness, made the later way, to be taken: But the other may be reserved, with some Accommodating, when we see, the success of the Former.</p>
                  <p>I am appointed, this day, to attend my Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> for a Proposition, of Raising Profit; and Revenew, by <hi>Infranchising Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyholders.</hi> I am right glad, to see the <hi>Patrimonial</hi> part of your Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, well look'd into, as well as the <hi>Fiscal.</hi> And I hope it will so be, in other parts, as well as this. <hi>God</hi> preserve your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie.</hi>

                     </gap>sent to your <hi>Majesties</hi> high wisdom, that which I conceive, and have had long in my minde, concerning your <hi>Majesties</hi> service, and honourable profit in this Business.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Project,</hi> which hath proceeded, from a worthy Service, of the <hi>Lord Treasurer,</hi> I have, from the beginning, constantly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; As may well appear, by my sundry Labours, from time to time, in the same. For I hold it, a worthy character, of your <hi>Majesties Reign,</hi> and <hi>Times</hi>; Insomuch, as though your <hi>Majesty,</hi> mought have, at this time, (as is spoken,) a great Annual Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, for the Quitting of it, yet I shall never be the Man, that should wish your <hi>Majesty,</hi> to deprive your Self, of that <hi>Beatitude; Beatius est dare, quam accipere</hi>; In this cause; But to sacrifice your profit, (though as your <hi>Majesties</hi> State is, it be precious to you,) to so great a Good of your <hi>Kingdom</hi>: Although this <hi>Project,</hi> is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Profit, immediate, unto you, by the encreasing of <hi>Customes,</hi> upon the <hi>materials,</hi> of <hi>Dyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here is the Case. The <hi>New Company,</hi> by this <hi>Patent,</hi> and <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> are to have two Things, wholly diverse, from the first Intention; Or rather, <hi>Ex Diametro,</hi> opposite unto the same; which nevertheless, they must, of necessity have, or else the <hi>Work</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. So as I may call them <hi>Mala Necessaria,</hi> but yet withall <hi>Temporarie.</hi> For, as Men make Warr, to have Peace, so these <hi>Merchants,</hi> must have license, for <hi>Whites,</hi> to the end, to banish <hi>Whites</hi>; And they must have license, to use <hi>Teyntours,</hi> to the end to banish <hi>Teyntours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is therefore that I say; your <hi>Majesty,</hi> upon these two points, may justly, and with honour, and with preservation of your first Intention, inviolate, demand Profit, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Interim, as long as these unnatural points continue, and then to cease: For your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> may be pleased to observe, that they are to have all the <hi>Old Companies</hi> Profit, by the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Whites</hi>; They are, again to have, upon the proportion of <hi>Cloathes,</hi> which they shall vent, died, and dressed, the <hi>Flemmings</hi> profit, upon the <hi>Teyntour.</hi> Now then I say; As it had been, too good Husbandry, for a <hi>King,</hi> to have taken profit of them, if the Project could have been effected at once, (as was voiced;) So on the other side, it might be, perchance, too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51170:186"/>
Husbandry, and Providence, to take nothing of them, for that, which is meerly lucrative to them, in the mean time. Nay, I say further, this will greatly conduce, and be a kinde of Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the End desired. For I alwayes feared, and doe yet fear, that when Men, by condition <hi>Merchants,</hi> though never so honest, have gotten into their Hands, the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Whites,</hi> and the <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> to <hi>Teyntour</hi>; wherein they shall reap profit, for that, which they never sowed; But have gotten themselves Certainties, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the States hopes; They are like enough, to sleep upon this, as upon a Pillow; And to make no haste, to goe on with the rest. And though it may be said, that that is a thing, will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear to the State, yet, (no doubt,) means may be devised, and found, to draw the Business in length. So that I conclude, that if your <hi>Majesty,</hi> take a profit of them, in the <hi>Interim,</hi> (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering you refuse profit, from the <hi>Old Company,</hi>) it will be both Spurr, and Bridle, to them, to make them Pace aright, to your <hi>Majesties</hi> End.</p>
                  <p>This in all humbleness, according to my vowed Care, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, being no Mans Man, but your <hi>Majesties,</hi> I present, leave, and submit, to your <hi>Majesties</hi> better Judgement; And I could wish, your <hi>Majesty</hi> would speak, with Sir <hi>Thomas Lake</hi> in it; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his good Habit, which he hath in business, beareth, (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,) an indifferent Hand in this particular; And (if it please your <hi>Majesty,</hi>) it may proceed, as from your Self, and not as a Motion, or Observation, of mine.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> need not, in this, to be streightned in time; As if this must be demanded, or treated, before you sign their <hi>Bill.</hi> For I, foreseeing this, and foreseeing, that many things mought fall out, which I could not foresee, have handled it so, as with their good Contentment, there is a <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Revocation,</hi> inserted into their <hi>Patent.</hi> And so commending your <hi>Majesty,</hi> to <hi>Gods</hi> blessed, and precious Custody; I rest,</p>

He, on his part, imparted to me, diverse Things, of great weight, concerning the Reparat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on, of your <hi>Majesties</hi> Means, and <hi>Finances,</hi> which I heard gladly; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as he perceiving the same, I think, was the readier, to open himself to me, in one Circumstance, which he did much inculcate. I concurr fully with him, that they are to be held secret: For I never saw, but that Business, is like a Child, which is framed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibly in the Wombe; And if it come forth too soon, it will be abortive. I know, in most of them, the Prosecution must rest, much, upon my Self. But I, that had the Power, to prevail, in the <hi>Farmers</hi> Case, of the <hi>French Wines,</hi> without the help, of my Lord <hi>Cooke,</hi> shall be better able, to goe through these, with his help, the ground being no less just.

break, it must either, be put upon the <hi>Patent,</hi> or upon the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> made by themselves. For the <hi>Patent,</hi> I satisfied the <hi>Board,</hi> that there was no Title in it, which was not, either <hi>Verbatim,</hi> in the <hi>Patent,</hi> of the <hi>Old Company</hi>; Or by special warrant, from the <hi>Table,</hi> inserted. My <hi>Lord Cooke,</hi> with much respect to me, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, but disliked the <hi>Old Patent</hi> it self, and disclaimed, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the <hi>Table,</hi> when the Additions were allowed. But, in my Opinion, (howsoever my <hi>Lord Cooke,</hi> to magnify his Science in <hi>Law,</hi> draweth every thing, (though sometimes unproperly, and unseasonably,) to that kinde of Question,) it is not convenient, to break the Business, upon those Points. For considering, they were but Clauses, that were in the former <hi>Patents,</hi> and in many other <hi>Patents,</hi> of <hi>Companies</hi>; And that the <hi>Additions,</hi> likewise, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Allowance, of the <hi>Table,</hi> it will be, but clamoured, and, perhaps, conceived, that to quarrel them now, is but an Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken; And that the <hi>Times</hi> are changed, rather than the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> But that, which preserveth entire your <hi>Majesties</hi> Honour, and the Constancy of your Proceedings, is to put the Breach, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Orders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this Light, I gave in my <hi>Report,</hi> which the <hi>Table</hi> readily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and much approved; That if the <hi>Table,</hi> reject their <hi>Orders,</hi> as unlawfull, and unjust, it doth free you, from their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: For whosoever contracteth, or undertaketh any thing, is alwayes understood, to perform it, by lawfull means; So as, they have plainly abused the State; if that which they have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, be either impossible, or unjust.</p>

He is free from a <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> Perfect in his powers, of <hi>Memory,</hi> and <hi>Speech</hi>; And not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in his <hi>Voice,</hi> nor <hi>Look</hi>; He hath no panting, or labouring, <hi>Respiration</hi>; Neither are his <hi>Coughs</hi> dry, or weak: But whosoever thinketh, his Disease is but <hi>Melancholy,</hi> he maketh no true Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; For it is, plainly, a formed, and deep <hi>Cough,</hi> with a <hi>Pectoral surcharge</hi>; So that, at times, he doth almost, <hi>Animam age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> I forbear, to advertise your <hi>Majesty,</hi> of the Care I took, to have Commissions in readiness, because Mr. <hi>Secretary Lake,</hi> hath let me understand, he signifyed as much, to your <hi>Majesty</hi>: But, I hope, there shall be no use, for them, at this time. And, as I am glad, to advertise your <hi>Majesty,</hi> of the Amendment, of your <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellers Person</hi>; So I am sorry, to accompany it, with an Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the Sickness, of your <hi>Chancery Court,</hi> though, (by the Grace of <hi>God,</hi>) that Cure will be much easier, than the other. It is true, I did lately write to your <hi>Majesty,</hi> that for the Matter, of the <hi>Habeas Corpora,</hi> (which was the third Matter in <hi>Law,</hi> you had given me in charge;) I did think, the Communion in Service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my Lord <hi>Chanceller,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Chief Iustice,</hi> in the great Business of <hi>Examination,</hi> would so joyn them, as they would not square, at this time; But pardon me, (I humbly pray your <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi>) if I have too Reasonable Thoughts.</p>

I remember, a greater Matter than this, was dispatched, by a Letter, from <hi>Royston</hi>; which was, the Placing of the <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> that now is: And I imagine, the King did it on purpose, that the Act mought appear, to be his own.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Chanceller</hi> told me, yesterday, in plain Terms, that if the <hi>King,</hi> would ask his opinion, touching the Person, that he would commend, to succeed him, upon Death, or Disability, he would name me, for the fittest Man. You may advise, whether use, may not be made of this offer.</p>
                  <p>I sent, a pretty while since, a <hi>Paper,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Iohn Murrey</hi>; which was, indeed, a little Remembrance, of some Things past; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my honest, and faithfull Services to his <hi>Majesty</hi>; Not by way of Boasting, (from which I am farr,) but as Tokens, of my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying his Service; uprightly, and carefully. If you be pleased, to call for the Paper, which is with Mr. <hi>Iohn Murrey</hi>; And to find a fit time, that his <hi>Maiesty,</hi> may cast an eye upon it, I think it will doe no Hurt: And I have written to Mr. <hi>Murrey,</hi> to deliver the <hi>Paper,</hi> if you call for it. <hi>God</hi> keep you in all Happiness.</p>

                  <p>First, it is necessary, I let your <hi>Majesty</hi> know, the <hi>Ground</hi> of the <hi>Difference,</hi> between the Two <hi>Courts</hi>; that your <hi>Majesty,</hi> may the better understand the <hi>Narrative.</hi>

And that Article, (<hi>If any Man, after a Iudgement given, had drawn the said Iudgement, to a new Examination, in any other Court</hi>) was by him, specially, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in charge; which had not used to be given, in charge before. It is true, it was not solemnly dwelt upon, but, as it were, thrown in amongst the rest.</p>
                  <p>The last day, of the <hi>Term</hi>; (And that which all Men condemn, the supposed last day, of my <hi>Lord Chancellers</hi> life;) There were two Indictments preferred, of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> for suing in <hi>Chancery,</hi> after <hi>Iudgement</hi> in <hi>Common Law</hi>; The one by <hi>Rich. Glanvile,</hi> the other by <hi>William Allen</hi>: The former against <hi>Courtney,</hi> the party in <hi>Chancery, Gibb</hi> the Counseller, and <hi>Deurst</hi> the Clark; The latter, against <hi>Alderman Bowles,</hi> and <hi>Humfry Smith,</hi> parties in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi>; Serjeant <hi>More</hi> the Counseller, <hi>Elias Wood,</hi> Solliciter in the Cause, and Sir <hi>Iohn Tindall,</hi> Mr. of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and an Assessor, to my <hi>Lord Chanceller.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Cases</hi> themselves, it were too long, to trouble your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> with them; But this I will say; If they were set on, that preferred them, they were the worst Marks-men, that ever were, that set them on. For there could not have been chosen; two such Causes, to the Honour, and Advantage, of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> for the Justness of the <hi>Decrees,</hi> and the Foulness, and Scandal, both of Fact, and person, in those that impeach the <hi>Decrees.</hi>

                  <p>But for that, which may concern your Service, which is my End, (leaving other Men to their own wayes;) First, my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is plainly, that my Lord <hi>Cooke,</hi> at this time, is not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced; Both because, he is so well habituate, for that which remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th, of these <hi>Capital Causes</hi>; And also, for that, which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inde, is in his Breast, touching your Finances, and Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, of your <hi>Estate.</hi> And, (if I mought speak it,) as I think, it were good, his hopes were at an end, in some kinde, so I could wish, they were raised, in some other.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, this great, and publick Affront, not only to the Reverend, and well deserving, person, of your <hi>Chanceller</hi>; (And, at a time, when he was thought, to lye, on Dying, which was barbarous;) But to your <hi>High Court</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> which is the <hi>Court,</hi> of your absolute power; May not, (in my Opinion,) pass lightly, nor end, onely, in some Formal Attonement; But Use is to be made thereof, for the setling of your <hi>Authority,</hi> and strengthning of your <hi>Praerogative,</hi> according to the true Rules of <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to reconcile, and accommodate these two Advices, which seem almost opposite. First, your <hi>Majesty,</hi> may not see it, (though I con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ss it be suspicious,) that my Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> was, any way, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orehand, privy to that, which was done; Or that he did set it, or animate it; But onely took the Matter, as it came before him; And that his Errour was onely, that at such a time, he did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it, in some good manner.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if it be true, (as is reported,) that any of the <hi>Puisne Iudges,</hi> did stirr this Business; Or that, they did openly revile,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51170:190"/>
and menace the <hi>Iury,</hi> for doing their Conscience; (A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they did, honestly, and truly,) I think, that <hi>Iudge,</hi> is worthy, to leese his place. And to be plain with your <hi>Majesty,</hi> I do not think, there is any Thing, a greater <hi>Polychreston,</hi> or <hi>ad multa utile,</hi> to your Affairs, than upon a just, and fit Occasion, to make some Example, against the Presumption, of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> in Causes, that conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rn your <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty:</hi> whereby the whole Body, of those <hi>Magistrates,</hi> may be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the better in awe; And it may be, this will light, upon no unfit Subject, of a Person, that is Rude, and that no Man cares for.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if there be, no one, so much in fault, (which I cannot yet affirm, either way, and there must be a just <hi>Ground, God</hi> forbid el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e;) yet I should think, that the Very Presumption, of Going so far, in so high a Cause, deserveth to have that done, which was done in this very case, upon the Indictment of <hi>Sergeant Heale,</hi> in <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> time; that the Judges, should answer it, upon their knees, before your <hi>Majesty,</hi> or your <hi>Council,</hi> and receive a sharp Admonition: At which time also, my Lord <hi>Wray,</hi> being then <hi>Chief Iustice,</hi> slipt the Collar, and was forborn.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for the persons themselves, <hi>Glanvile,</hi> and <hi>Allen,</hi> which are base Fellowes, and turbulent, I think, there will be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and proved against them, (besides the preferring of the <hi>Bil's,</hi>) such Combinations, and Cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mptuous Speeches, and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; As there will be good Ground, to call them, and perhaps some of their petty <hi>Counsellers,</hi> at <hi>Law,</hi> into the <hi>Starre-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all this, which I have said, your <hi>Majesty,</hi> may be pleased to observe, that I doe not engage you much, in the main point of the <hi>Iurisdiction</hi>; For which I have a great deal of Reason, which I now forbear. But two Things, I wish to be done. The one, that your <hi>Maiesty,</hi> take this occasion, to redouble unto all your <hi>Iudges,</hi> your antient, and true <hi>Charge,</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> That you will endure, no Innovating, the Point of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi>; But will have every <hi>Court,</hi> empaled, within their own Presidents; And not assume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, new Powers, upon Conceits, and Inventions, of <hi>Law</hi>: The other, that in these <hi>high Causes,</hi> that touch upon <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> your <hi>Majesty</hi> give them straight Charge, that upon any Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions intervenient hereafter, they do not make the Vulgar, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their Contestations, by publick Handling them, before they have consulted with your <hi>Majesty,</hi> to whom the Reiglement, of those things, onely appertaineth.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I am not without hope, that your <hi>Majesty,</hi> mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this Business, according to your great Wisdom; (unto which I acknowledge my Self, not to be worthy, to be Card-holder, or a Candle-holder;) will make profit, of this <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> as a Thing of <hi>Gods</hi> sending.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I may not forget, to represent to your <hi>Majesty,</hi> that there
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51170:191"/>
is no Thinking of <hi>Arraignments,</hi> untill these Things, be somewhat accommodate; And some outward, and superficial, Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at least, made, between my Lord <hi>Chanceller,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Chief Iustice.</hi> For this Accident, is a Banquet, to all the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents Friends. But this is a Thing, that falleth out, naturally, of it Self; In respect, of the <hi>Iudges</hi> Going <hi>Circuit,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Chancellers</hi> Infirmity, with Hope of Recovery.

                        <hi>It may please your most excellent</hi> Majesty,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOur Privy Council, have wisely, and truly, discerned, of the <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Demands,</hi> of the <hi>New Company,</hi> that they are unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and unjust; And themselves, have now acknowledged, the Work impossible, without them, by their <hi>Petition</hi> in Writing, now registred, in the <hi>Council-Book</hi>: So as this Conclusion, (of their own making,) is become peremptory, and final to themselves; And the Impossibility confessed, the Practice, and Abuse, reserved to the Judgement, the <hi>State</hi> shall make of it,</p>
                  <p>This Breach then, of this great Contract, is wholly on their part; which could not have been, if your <hi>Majesty,</hi> had broken, upon the <hi>Patent</hi>: For the <hi>Patent,</hi> was your <hi>Maiesties</hi> Act; The <hi>Orders,</hi> are their Act; And in the former Case, they had not been liable, to further Question, now they are.</p>
                  <p>There rest two Things, to be considered: The one if they, (like <hi>Proteus,</hi> when he is hard held,) shall yet again, vary their shape; And shall quit their <hi>Orders,</hi> convinced of Injustice, and lay their Imposition onely, upon the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Whites,</hi> whether your <hi>Majesty,</hi> shall further expect? The other, if your <hi>Majestie</hi> dissolve them, upon this Breach, on their part, what is further to be done, for the setting of the Trade, again, in joynt, and for your own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and profit? In both which points, I will not presume to give Opinion, but onely, to break the Business, for your <hi>Majesti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> better Judgement.</p>
                  <p>For the first, I am sorry, the Occasion was given, (by my Lord <hi>Cookes</hi> Speech, at this time, of the Commitment of some of them;) That they should seek, <hi>Omnem movere lapidem,</hi> to help themselves.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51170:191"/>
Better it had been, if (as my Lord <hi>Penton</hi> said to me, that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, very judiciously, and with a great Deal of Foresight;) That, for that time, they should have had, a Bridge, made for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>em, to be gone. But my Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> floweth, according to his own Tides, and not according to the Tides of Business. The thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> said, was good, and too little, but, at this time, it was too much. But that is past. Howsoever, if they should goe back, and seek again, to entertain your <hi>Majesty,</hi> with new <hi>Orders,</hi> or <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,</hi> (as is said to be intended,) your <hi>Majesty</hi> hath ready; two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, of <hi>Repulse,</hi> if it please your <hi>Majesty</hi> to use them.</p>
                  <p>The one, that this is now the Fourth time, that they have mainly broken, with your <hi>Majesty,</hi> and contradicted themselves. First, they undertook, to dye, and dress, all the <hi>Cloa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hes</hi> of the <hi>Realm</hi>; Soon after, they wound themselves, into the Trade, of <hi>Whites,</hi> and came down to the proportion contracted. Secondly, they ought to have performed that Contract according to their Subscription, <hi>pro ratâ,</hi> without any of these <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Impositions.</hi> Soon after, they deserted their Subscription, and had recourse, to these Devices, of <hi>Orders.</hi> Thirdly, if by <hi>Order,</hi> and not by <hi>Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> yet their <hi>Orders,</hi> should have laid it, upon the <hi>Whites,</hi> which is an Unlawfull, and Prohibited, Trade. Nevertheless, they would have brought in, lawfull, and setled <hi>Trades,</hi> full <hi>Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, Merchandize</hi> of all Natures, <hi>Poll-Money,</hi> or <hi>Brotherhood-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and I cannot tell what. And now lastly, it seemeth, they would goe Back, to lay it, upon the <hi>Whites</hi>: And therefore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you <hi>Majesty,</hi> will any more rest, and build this great Wheel, of your <hi>Kingdom,</hi> upon these broken, and brittle, Pinns, and try Experiments further, upon the Health, and Body, of your <hi>State,</hi> I leave to your <hi>Princely Iudgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other <hi>Answer,</hi> of <hi>Repulse,</hi> is a kinde of Apposing them, what they will doe, after the three years, contracted for? Which is a point, hitherto, not much stirred, though Sir <hi>Lionell Cranfield,</hi> hath ever beaten upon it, in his Speech with me: For after the three years, they are not tyed, otherwayes, than as Trade shall give Encouragement; Of which Encouragement, your <hi>Majesty,</hi> hath a bitter Tast. And if they should hold on, according to the third years Proportion, and not rise on, by further gradation, your <hi>Majesty</hi> hath not your End. No, I fear, and have long fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that this Feeding of the Foreiner, may be dangerous: For as we may think, to hold up our Cloathing, by Vent of <hi>Whites,</hi> till we can dye, and dresse; So they, (I mean the <hi>Dutch,</hi>) will think to hold up, their Manufacture, of Dying, and Dressing, upon our <hi>Whites,</hi> till they can cloath: So as your <hi>Majesty,</hi> hath the greatest reason, in the World, to make the <hi>New Company,</hi> to come in, and strengthen that part, of their Contract; And they refusing, (as it is confidently beleeved they will,) to make their Default, more visible, to all Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:51170:192"/>For the second main part, of your <hi>Majesties</hi> Consultation; That is, what shall be done, supposing an absolute Breach; I have had some Speech, with Mr. <hi>Secretary Lake,</hi> and likewise with Sir <hi>Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell Cranfield</hi>; And, (as I conceive,) t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ere may be three wayes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into consideration. The first is, that the Old Company be restored, who, (no doubt,) are in Appetite, and (as I finde by Sir <hi>Lionell Cranfield,</hi>) not unprepared; And that the <hi>Licences</hi>; The <hi>one,</hi> that of 30000 <hi>Cloathes,</hi> which was the old <hi>Licence</hi>; The other, that of my Lord of <hi>Cumberlands,</hi> which is, without stint, (my Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi> receiving Satisfaction;) be compounded, into one entire <hi>Licence,</hi> without stint; And then, that they, amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, take order, for that profit, which hath been offered to your <hi>Majesty.</hi> This is a plain, and known way, wherein your <hi>Majesty,</hi> is not an Actour; onely it hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>his, that the Work, of Dying, and Dressing, <hi>Cloathes,</hi> which hath been so much glorifyed, seemeth to be wholly relinquished, if you leave there. The second is, that there be a free <hi>Trade,</hi> of <hi>Cloath,</hi> with this Difference; That the Dyed, and dressed, pay no <hi>Custome,</hi> and the Whites <hi>double Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,</hi> it being a Merchandize prohibited, and onely licentiate. This continueth in life, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ork</hi> desired, and will have a popular Applause. But I doe confess, I did ever think, that Trading, in <hi>Companies,</hi> is most agreeable to the <hi>English</hi> Nature, which wantet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>refore, I dare not advise, to adventure, this great Trade, of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> (which hath been so long, under Government,) in a free, or loose, Trade. The Third is, a Compounded Way of both, which is; To goe on, with the <hi>Trade,</hi> of <hi>Whites,</hi> by the <hi>Old Company restored</hi>; And that your <hi>Majesties</hi> Profit be raised, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der amongst Themselves; Rather than by <hi>double Custom,</hi> wherein you must be the Actour: And that, nevertheless, there be added a Privilege, to the same <hi>Company,</hi> to carry out <hi>Cloathes,</hi> Dyed, and Dressed, <hi>Custom-free</hi>; Which will still continue, as a glorious Beam, of your <hi>Majesties</hi> Royal Design. I hope, and Wish, at least, that this, which I have written, may be of some use, to your <hi>Majesty,</hi> to settle, by the Advice, of the <hi>Lords</hi> about you, this great Business. At the least, it is the Effect, of my Care, and poor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which, if in me be any, it is given me, to no other end, but faithfully, to serve your <hi>Majesty.

I never had great Thought, for my Self, further than to maintain, those great Thoughts, which, I confess, I have, for your Service. I know, what Honour is; And I know, what the Times are. But, I thank <hi>God,</hi> with me, my Service is the Principal; And it is farr from me, under Honourable Pretences, to cover base Desires; which I account then to be, when Men referr, too much to Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, especially serving such a <hi>King.</hi> I am afraid of Nothing,

but that the Master of the Horse, your Excellent Servant, and I, shall fall out, who shall hold your Stirrop best.

                  <p>
                     <hi>SIR,</hi> Because I am uncertain, whether his <hi>Majesty,</hi> will put to a point, some Resolutions, touching <hi>Ireland,</hi> now at <hi>Windsore</hi>; I thought it my duty, to attend his <hi>Majesty,</hi> by my <hi>Letter,</hi> and thereby to supply my Absence. For the Renewing, of some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Commissions,</hi> for <hi>Ireland</hi>; And the Framing, of a new <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> for the Wards, and the <hi>Alienation,</hi> (which appertain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to me, as his <hi>Majesties Atturney,</hi> and have been accordingly referred by the <hi>Lords</hi>;) I will undertake, that they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with a greater care, and better applications, to his <hi>Majesties</hi> Service in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> than heretofore they have been. And therefore of that I say no more. And for the <hi>Instructions,</hi> of the new <hi>Deputy,</hi> they have been set down, by the two <hi>Secretaries,</hi> and read to the <hi>Board</hi>; And being things, of an ordinary nature, I doe not see, but they may pass. But there have been three <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi> and <hi>Counsels,</hi> which have been stirred, which seem to me, of very great Importance; wherein, I think my Self bound, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> my <hi>Advice,</hi> and <hi>Opinion,</hi> if they should now come in <hi>Question.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first is, touching the <hi>Recusant Magistrates,</hi> of the <hi>Towns,</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Commonalties</hi> themselves, their Electours, what shall be done? Which Consultation ariseth, from the late Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements, of the two <hi>Lords Iustices,</hi> upon the Instance, of the two <hi>Towns, Limrick,</hi> and <hi>Kilkenny</hi>; In which Advertisements, they represent the Danger only, without giving any Light, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;

                     </gap>mselves, than agreeable to their Duties, and places.</p>
                  <p>In this point, I humbly pray his <hi>Majesty,</hi> to remember, that the Refusal is not, of the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> (which is not enacted in <hi>Ireland</hi>;) but of the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> which cutteth deep, into Matter of Conscience. Also, that his <hi>Majesty</hi> will, out of the dept<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, of his Excellent Wisdom, and Providence, think, and as it were, calculate with himself; Whether Time, will make more, for the Cause of Religion, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and be still more, and more, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious; Or whether Deferring Remedies, will not make the Case more difficult. For if <hi>Time,</hi> give his <hi>Majesty</hi> Advantage, what needeth precipitation, to extreme Remedies? But if <hi>Time,</hi> will make the case more desperate, then his <hi>Majesty,</hi> cannot begin, too soon. Now in my Opinion, Time will open, and facilitate Things, for <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> there; And not shut up, or lock out, the same. For first, the <hi>Plantations</hi> going on, and being, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, of <hi>Protestants,</hi> cannot but mate the other party, in Time: Also, his <hi>Majesties</hi> Care, in placing good <hi>Bishops,</hi> and good <hi>Divines</hi>; In amplifying the <hi>Colledge</hi> there; And in looking, to the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of <hi>Wards,</hi> and such like; As they are, the most Natural Means, so are they like, to be the most effectual, and happy, for the Weeding out of <hi>Popery,</hi> without using the <hi>Temporal Sword</hi>; So that, I think, I may truly conclude, that the Ripeness of <hi>Time,</hi> is not yet come.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ority, and Reputation, of the former <hi>Council,</hi> I would have somewhat done; which is, that there be a proceeding, to <hi>Seizu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> will be the Work of three, or four, <hi>Termes</hi>; By which time, the Matter will somewhat cool.</p>
                  <p>But I would not, (in any case,) that the Proceedings, should be with both <hi>Towns,</hi> which stand now in contempt, but with one of them, onely: choosing that, which shall be thought most fit. For if his <hi>Majesty,</hi> proceed with both, then all the <hi>Towns,</hi> that are in the like case, will think it a common Cause; And that it is, but their Case too day, and their own too morrow. But if his <hi>Majesty</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, but with one, the Apprehension, and Terrour, will not be so strong; For they will think, it may be their Case, to be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as well, as prosecuted; And this is the best Advice, that I can give to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> in this Streight; And of this Opinion, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med my <hi>Lord Chanceller,</hi> to be.</p>
                  <p>The Second <hi>Proposition</hi> is this: It may be, his <hi>Majesty</hi> will be moved, to reduce, the Number, of his <hi>Council,</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is now almost Fifty, to Twenty, or the like Number; In respect,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51170:197"/>
that the Greatness of the Number, doth both embase the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> and divulge the Business. Nevertheless, I hold this <hi>Proposition,</hi> to be rather specious, and solemn than need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, at this time; For certainly, it will fill the <hi>State,</hi> full of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment; which, in a Growing, and unsetled Estate, ought not to be.</p>
                  <p>This I could wish, that his <hi>Majesty,</hi> would appoint a select <hi>Number,</hi> of <hi>Counsellours</hi> there, which might deal, in the <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> of his <hi>Revenew</hi>; (Being a Thing not fit to pass, through too many Hands;) And the said selected <hi>Number,</hi> should have dayes of Sitting, by themselves. At which, the rest of the <hi>Council,</hi> should not be present; which being once setled, then other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Business of <hi>State,</hi> may be handled at those Sittings, and so the rest begin to be disused, and yet retain their Countenance, without Murmur, or Disgrace.</p>
                  <p>The Third <hi>Proposition,</hi> as it is moved, seemeth to be pretty, if it can keep promise: For it is thus. That a Means, may be found, to re-enforce his <hi>Majesties Army,</hi> by 500, or a 1000 Men; And that, without any Penny Encrease, of Charge. And the Means should be, that there should be a Commandement of a Local Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, and transferring some <hi>Companies,</hi> from one <hi>Province,</hi> to another: whereupon it is supposed, that many, that are planted, in House, and Lands, will rather leese their Entertainment, than remove; And thereby, new Men may have their Pay, and yet the old, be mingled in the <hi>Country,</hi> for the Strength ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>of.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Proposition,</hi> two things may be feared: The one, <hi>Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> of those, that shall be put off: The other, that the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies shall be stuffed with <hi>Novices,</hi> and <hi>Tyrones,</hi> instead of <hi>Veterani.</hi> I wish therefore, that this <hi>Proposition,</hi> be well debated, ere it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.

Therefore I have made it <hi>Viscount Villiers</hi>: And for your <hi>Baronry,</hi> I will keep it for an <hi>Earldom</hi>: For though the other, had been more orderly, yet that is as usual, and both alike good in <hi>Law.</hi>

                  <p>For <hi>Ropers</hi> place, I would have it, by all means, dispatched. And therefore, I marvail, it lingreth.

I am now gotten, into the <hi>Countrey,</hi> to my House, where I have some little Liberty, to think of that, I would think of, and not of that, which other Men, Hourly break my Head withall, as it was at <hi>London.</hi> Upon this, you may conclude, that most of my Thoughts, are of his <hi>Majesty</hi>; And then, you cannot be farr off. <hi>God</hi> ever keep you, and prosper you.

                     <hi>SIR,</hi> I have sent you, now, your Patent, of Creation, of <hi>Lord Blechley,</hi> of <hi>Blechly,</hi> and of <hi>Viscount Villiers. Blechley</hi> is your own; And I liked, the sound of the Name, better than <hi>Whaddon</hi>: But the Name, will be hid, for you will be called <hi>Viscount Villiers.</hi> I have put them both in a <hi>Patent,</hi> after the manner of the Patent of Arms, where <hi>Baronries</hi> are joyned. But the chief Reason was, because I would avoid double <hi>Prefaces</hi>; which had not been fit: Nevertheless <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>Roabing,</hi> and otherwise, must be double: And now, because I am in the <hi>Country,</hi> I will send you, some of my <hi>Country Fruits,</hi> which, with me, are good <hi>Meditations</hi>; which, when I am in the <hi>Citty,</hi> are choaked with Business.</p>

For assure your self, that <hi>Fortune,</hi> is of a womans Nature, that will sooner follow you by slighting, than by too much Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And in this Dedication, of your Self to the Publick, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend unto you, principally, that which I think, was never done, since I was born; And which not done, hath bred, almost, a Wilderness, and Solitude, in the <hi>Kings</hi> Service: which is, that you countenance, and encourage, and advance, able, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, in all Kindes, Degrees, and Professions. For in the time of some late great Counsellours, when they bare the Sway, able Men, were by design, and of purpose, suppressed: And though, now since, Choice goeth better, both in <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in places of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rather make Able and Honest Men, yours, than advance those, that are otherwise, because they are yours: As for Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Corrupt Men, you must, I know, sometimes use them, but keep them at a distance; And let it appear, that you make use of them, rather than that they lead you. Above all, depend wholly, (next to <hi>God,</hi>) upon the <hi>King</hi>; And be ruled, (as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you have been,) by his Instructions; For that's best for your Self. For the <hi>Kings</hi> Care, and Thoughts, concerning you, are according to the Thoughts, of a <hi>great King</hi>; whereas your Thoughts, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Summe is, that you think <hi>Goodness,</hi> the best part of <hi>Greatness</hi>; And that you remember, whence your Rising comes, and make return accordingly. <hi>God</hi> ever keep you.</p>

Lastly, I confesse, that I have, as vast <hi>Contemplative Ends,</hi> as I have moderate <hi>Civil</hi> Ends: For I have taken all Knowledge, to be my <hi>Province</hi>; And if I could purge, it of two sort of Rovers, whereof the one, with frivolous Disputations, Confutations, and Verbosities; The other, with blind Experiments, and Auricular Traditions, and Impostures; hath committed so many spoils; I hope, I should bring in, Industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Observations, grounded Conclusions, and profitable Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Discoveries, the best State of that <hi>Province.</hi> This, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Curiosity, or Vain-glory, or Nature, or, (if one take it favourably,) <hi>Philanthropia,</hi> is so fixed in my minde, as it cannot be removed. And I doe easily see, that <hi>Place</hi> of any <hi>Reasonable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> doth bring commandement, of more <hi>Wits,</hi> than of a Mans own; which is the Thing I greatly affect. And for your <hi>Lordship,</hi> perhaps you shall not finde more Strength, and less Encounter, in any other. And if your <hi>Lordship,</hi> shall finde now, or at any time, that I doe seek, or affect, any place, whereunto any that is nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer unto your <hi>Lordship,</hi> shall be concurrent, say then, that I am a most dishonest Man. And if your <hi>Lordship,</hi> will not carry me on, I will not doe as <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> did, who reduced himself, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, unto voluntary poverty; But this I will doe, I will sell the <hi>Inheritance,</hi> that I have, and purchase some <hi>Lease,</hi> of quick Revenew, or some <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Gain,</hi> that shall be executed by <hi>Deputy,</hi> and so give over, all Care of Service, and become some sorry <hi>Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,</hi> or a true <hi>Pioner,</hi> in that <hi>Mine of Truth,</hi> which (he said,) <hi>lay so deep.</hi> This which I have writ unto your <hi>Lordship,</hi> is rather Thoughts, than Words, being set down without all Art, Disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, or Reservation.

                     <p>YOur <hi>Lordships</hi> comfortable Relation, of her <hi>Majesties</hi> gracious Opinion, and Meaning towards me, though, at that time, your leisure gave me not leave, to shew how I was affected therewith; yet upon every Representation thereof, it entreth, and striketh, more deeply into me, as both my Nature, and Duty, presseth me, to return some Speach of Thankfulness. It must be, an exceeding Comfort, and Encouragement to me; setting forth, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my Self, in way, towards her <hi>Majesties</hi> service, to encounter with an Example, so private, and domestical, of her <hi>Majesties</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Goodness, and Benignity; Being made good, and verified, in my <hi>Father,</hi> so far forth, as it extendeth, to his <hi>Posterity</hi>; Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, as commended by his service, during the Nonage, (as I may term it,) of their own Deserts. I, for my part, am very well content, that I take least part, either of his Abilities of Minde, or of his Wordly Advancement; Both which he held, and received, the one of the Gift of <hi>God</hi> immediately, the other of her <hi>Majesties</hi> Gift: Yet, in the loyal, and earnest Affection, which he bare to her <hi>Majesties</hi> Service, I trust, my portion shall not be with the least, nor in proportion with the youngest Birth. For methinks, his Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, should be a silent charge, upon his Blessing, unto us all, in our Degrees, to follow him afar off, and to dedicate unto her <hi>Majesties</hi> Service, both the use, and spending, of our Lives. True it is, that I must needs acknowledge my self, prepared, and furnished thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, with nothing, but with a Multitude, of Lacks, &amp; Imperfections; But calling to mind, how diversely, and in what particular provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>God</hi> hath declared himself, to tender the State, of her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi> Affairs, I conceive, and gather hope, that those, whom he hath, in a manner, prest, for her <hi>Majesties</hi> Service, by working, and imprinting in them, a single, and zealous minde, to bestow their duties therein; He will see them, accordingly appointed, of Sufficiency convenient, for the Rank, and Standing, where they shall be employed: So as under this her <hi>Majesties</hi> Blessing, I trust, to receive, a larger allowance, of <hi>Gods</hi> Graces. And as I may hope for this, so I can assure, and promise, for my Endeavour, that it shall not be in fault: But what Diligence, can entitle me unto, that, I doubt not, to recover. And now seeing, it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her <hi>Majesty,</hi> to take knowledge, of this my Mind, and to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe, to appropriate me, unto her Service, preventing any desert of mine, with her Princely liberality; First, I am humbly, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech your <hi>Lordship,</hi> to present to her <hi>Majesty,</hi> my more than humble Thanks, for the same: And withall, having regard, to mine own unworthiness, to receive such Favour; And to the small possibility, in me, to satisfie, and answer, what her <hi>Majesty</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth;

But if it shall please <hi>God,</hi> to send forth an occasion, whereby my faithfull Affection, may be tryed, I trust, it shall save me labour, for ever making, more protestation of it hereafter. In the mean time, howsoever it be not made known to her <hi>Majesty,</hi> yet <hi>God</hi> knoweth it, through the daily sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherewith I address my self unto him, in unfeigned prayer, for the Multiplying, of her <hi>Majesties</hi> prosperities. To your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> also, whose Recommendation, I know right well, hath been material, to advance, her <hi>Majesties</hi> good opinion, of me, I can be but a bounden Servant.

                     <p>In my past Carriage, I will neither plead Merit, nor Excuse Imperfections: For whatsoever, I shall be able to do, I know, is lesse than I owe; And besides, my Faults, my very Faith, and Zeal, (which are the best things in me,) do make me commit Errours.

But though the Counsel be good for some <hi>States,</hi> and for ours, at some times, yet the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities ought to be watched, and it must appear, that this it is, which is now taken. The Opportunity, for such Service, I take to be, when either the Enemy, May receive the most hurt; Or when he is likeliest, to attempt against us, if he be not empeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Hurt, that our Estate should seek, to doe him, is; To intercept his Treasure, whereby we shall cut his Sinnews, and make Warr upon him, with his own Money; And to beat, or at least discontinew him, from the Sea, whereby her <hi>Majesty</hi> shall be, both secured from his Invasions, and become <hi>Mistris</hi> of the Sea; which is the Greatness, that the <hi>Queen</hi> of an <hi>Island,</hi> should most aspire unto. In matter of Profit, we may, this Journey, most hurt him, and benefit our Selves; Since he hath, (as is agreed on by all Men,) more <hi>Caracks,</hi> to come home now, than ever any year before. Besides many good Advantages, which will be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if we command the Coast. And to give him a Blow, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance him by Sea, now is the Time, when he hath declared his Ambition, to command the Seas; And yet, so divided his <hi>Fleets</hi>; Some appointed to be set out, and yet scant in readiness; others upon point of Comming home, and not fit to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if either they be met at Sea, or found in Harbour; And all so dispersed, in several places, as if at any time, we might doe good, that way, it is now. And whether he will make Warr up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, if we let him alone; Let his Sollicitations, Offers, and Gifts to the <hi>Rebells</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi>; His besieging, and winning of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi> and those parts of <hi>France,</hi> that front upon us; And his strengthening himself by Sea, by so many means; Let these things (I say,) tell us. So as, if we will, at any time, allow the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of prevention, to be reasonable, we must now confess it, to be opportune. But whatsoever the Counsel were, I am not to be charged with it, For as I was not the Contriver, nor Offerer, of the Project, so if I had refused to joyn with him, that did invite me to it, I should have been thought, both Incompatible, and Backward, in her <hi>Majesties</hi> Service. I say not this, for that I think the Action such, as it were Disadvantage, to be thought the Projector of it; But I say, and say truly, that my <hi>Lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> devised it, presented it to her <hi>Majesty,</hi> and had as well the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51170:210"/>
of her <hi>Majesty,</hi> and the Assent of such of your <hi>Lordships,</hi> as were acquainted with it, as my Promise to goe with him. One thing, (I confess,) I above all Men, am to be charged withall: That is; That when her <hi>Majesties,</hi> the Cities of <hi>London,</hi> and the States of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> charge was past, the Men levied, and marching, to the <hi>Rendez-vous</hi>; I could not see, how with her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi> Honour, and Safety, the Journey might be broken.

But farr be it from me, in an <hi>Action,</hi> of this importance, to weigh my Self, or my particular Fortunes. I must beseech your <hi>Lordships,</hi> to remember, that I was, from time to time, warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by all your opinions, delivered both amongst your selves, and to her <hi>Majesty</hi>: Which tieth you all, to allow the Counsel. And that being graunted, your <hi>Lordships,</hi> will call that Zeal, which maketh a Man constant, in a good Counsel, that would be Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, in an evil, or a doubtfull. I confess, her <hi>Majesty,</hi> offered us Recompence, for all our charges and losses. But, (my <hi>Lords,</hi>) I pray your <hi>Lordships</hi> consider, how many Things, I should have sold, at once, for money. I will leave mine own reputation as too small a Matter to be mentioned. But I should have sold; The Honour of her <hi>Majesty</hi>; The safety of the <hi>State</hi>; The Contentment of her <hi>Confederates</hi>; The Fortune and Hope, of many my poor <hi>Countrey-Men</hi>; And The Possibility, of giving a <hi>Blow,</hi> to that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,</hi> that ought ever to be hatefull, to all true <hi>English Hearts.</hi> I should have sold all this, for private profit. Therefore, though I ask pardon of her <hi>Majesty,</hi> and pray your <hi>Lordships,</hi> to mediate it for me, that I was carried by this Zeal so fast, that I forgat those Reverend Forms, which I should have used; yet I had rather, have my <hi>Heart,</hi> out of my Body, than this Zeal, out of my <hi>Heart.</hi> And now, as I have laid before your <hi>Lordships,</hi> my past carriage, and entring into this <hi>Action</hi>; So I beseech your <hi>Lordships,</hi> give me leave, to prepare you, to a favourable Construction, of that, which I shall doe hereafter. In which Sute, I am resolved, neither to plead the Hazarding of Life, nor spending of my Substance, in a Publick Service; To the end, that I might find your <hi>Lordships,</hi> (who are <hi>publick persons,</hi>) more favourable <hi>Iudges</hi>: But will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that I receive, so much Favour, and Honour, by this Trust, and Employment, as when I have done all I can, I shall still be behind hand. This Sute only I make, that your <hi>Lordships,</hi> will neither have too great an Expectation, of our Actions, nor too little; Lest all we doe, seem either Nothing, or to be done by Chance. I know, we must be tyed, to doe no more, than shall be

I am sure, I am as distrustfull of my Self, as they. And because I have more Sense of Duty, I shall be more Industrious. For <hi>Sea Service,</hi> the Judgement of my <hi>Honourable Companion,</hi> shall be my Compass. And for <hi>Land,</hi> his Assent, and the Advice of those her <hi>Majesty</hi> hath named, as <hi>Counsellors</hi> at Warr, shall be my Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It will be Honour to her <hi>Majesty,</hi> and a great Assurance to her State, if we either bring home wealth, or give the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> a blow by Sea. But to have made a continual Diversion, and to have left, as it were, a Thorn, sticking in his Foot, had been a Work worthy, of such a <hi>Queen,</hi> and of such a <hi>Preparation.</hi> For then, her <hi>Majesty,</hi> should have heard no more, of his Intentions for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Attempts upon the <hi>Coast</hi> of <hi>France</hi>; Or his drawing, of <hi>Ships,</hi> or <hi>Galley's,</hi> into these <hi>Narrow Seas</hi>; But should at once, have delivered all <hi>Christendom,</hi> from his fearfull <hi>Usurpation.</hi> Wherein, as She had been great in <hi>Fame,</hi> for such a general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; So she had been as great in <hi>Power,</hi> in making, all the Enemies of <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Christendom,</hi> to depend upon Her. She should be <hi>Head</hi> of the Party; She onely might be said, to make the <hi>Warrs</hi> with <hi>Spain,</hi> because she made them to purpose; And they all, but as her Assistants, and Dependants. And lastly, as the End of the <hi>Warrs</hi> is <hi>Peace</hi>; So she might have had <hi>Peace,</hi> when she would, and with what Conditions she would, and have included, or left out, whom she would. For she only, by this course, should force him, to wish for Peace, and she had the means in her hands, to make the Conditions. And as easie it had been, to have done this, as to have performed lesser Services. The Objections against this, will be, <hi>Hazard,</hi> and <hi>Charge. Hazard,</hi> to hold any Thing of his, that is so Mighty a <hi>King</hi>: And <hi>Charge,</hi> to send such Supplies, from time to time, as will be needfull. For <hi>Hazard,</hi> It is not the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> or the <hi>Whole,</hi> as are the <hi>Hazards,</hi> of a <hi>Defensive Warr,</hi> whensoever we are enforced to fight: But it is onely, a <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard</hi> of some few, and such <hi>Commanders,</hi> as shall be set out, for such a Service. And those also, that shall be so <hi>hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> shall be in lesse danger, than if they were put, into any Frontire Places, of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> or of the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> For they should not be left, in any part of the <hi>Main,</hi> or <hi>Continent</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Portugall,</hi> where the Enemy might bring an Army, to attempt them; (T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

quickly weary, of those Attempts;) But they should be so lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Seat, and Strength, of the place, should warrant their Safety; So that, to pull her <hi>Majesties</hi> Men, out of it, should be a harder Task, than to conquer any Countrey, that stands on firm land, by him: And to let <hi>English</hi> quietly possesse it, should so much prejudice him, as he were not able to endure it. And for <hi>Charge,</hi> there need not so much be expended, but that it might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be born. And the Place, being well chosen, and the <hi>Warr</hi> well conducted, in a short time, there would not onely arise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to pay the <hi>Charge</hi>; But great Profit to her <hi>Majesty,</hi> and wealth to our <hi>Countrey,</hi> would grow, from the <hi>place,</hi> that should be held.

But that, with your <hi>Lordships</hi> leave, shall be reserved till my Next. This is onely to beseech you, for our dear <hi>Sovereigns</hi> sake, for the Glory, and Wellfare, of Her, and her Estate, that you will think upon this generall Proposition. And if your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi> find it reasonable, that you will move it to the <hi>Queen</hi>: By whom if I be commanded, to set down the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> or to descend unto particulars, I will offer my <hi>Project,</hi> with this Condition, that if I advise any Thing, that the <hi>Counsell</hi> of <hi>Warr,</hi> shall think dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, it may be rejected: Or if my self be Actour in any Thing, belonging to this Project, wherein her <hi>Majesty</hi> receives dishonour, that I may answer it, with my Life. And yet your <hi>Lordships</hi> know, I am matched with those, in whom I have no particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest: But I must attribute, their Assenting to me, to my good happ, to take the better part.

Next, whereas I have noted you, to fly, and avoid, (in some respect justly,) the Resemblance, or Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of my Lord of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and my <hi>Lord Chanceller Hatton</hi>; yet I am perswaded, (howsoever I wish your <hi>Lordship,</hi> as distant, as you are, from them, in Points of <hi>Favour, Integrity, Magnanimity,</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi>;) That it will doe you much good, between the <hi>Queen,</hi> and you, to allege them, (as oft as you finde occasion,) for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, and Patterns. For I doe not know, a readier mean, to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51170:213"/>
make her <hi>Majesty</hi> think, you are in your right way. Thirdly, when at any time, your <hi>Lordship,</hi> upon occasion, happen in Speeches, to doe her <hi>Majesty</hi> right, (for there is no such Matter, as Flattery, amongst you all,) I fear, you handle it, <hi>Magis in speciem adorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis verbis, quam ut sentire videaris.</hi> So that a Man, may read For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, in your Countenance; Whereas your <hi>Lordship</hi> should doe it, familiarly, <hi>Et oratione fidà.</hi> Fourthly, your <hi>Lordship,</hi> should never be, without some Particulars afoot, which you should seem to pursue, with Earnestness, and Affection; And then let them fall, upon taking Knowledge, of her <hi>Majesties</hi> Opposition, and Dislike. Of which, the weightiest Sort may be, if your <hi>Lordship</hi> offer to labour, in the behalf of some, that you favour, for some of the Places, now voyd; Chusing such a Subject, as you think h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r <hi>Majesty,</hi> is like to oppose unto: And if you will say, that this is, <hi>Conjunctum cum alienâ Injurià</hi>; I will not answer; <hi>Haec non ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter constabunt</hi>; But I say; Commendation from so good a Mouth, doth not hurt a Man, though you prevail not. A less weighty Sort of Particulars, may be, the Pretence of some <hi>Iourneys,</hi> which, at her <hi>Majesties</hi> request, your <hi>Lordship</hi> mought relinquish; As if you would pretend a <hi>Iourney,</hi> to see your <hi>Living,</hi> and <hi>Estate,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Wales,</hi> or the like: For as for great Forein <hi>Iourneys,</hi> of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and Service, it standeth not with your Gravity, to play, or Stratageme, with them. And the lightest sort of particulars, which yet are not to be neglected, are, in your <hi>Habits, Apparel, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, Gestures,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Impression,</hi> of greatest prejudice, next, is that, of a <hi>Militar Dependance.</hi> VVherein, I cannot sufficiently wonder, at your <hi>Lordships</hi> course; That you say, the <hi>Warrs</hi> are your <hi>Occupation</hi>; And goe on, in that course: Whereas, if I mought have advised your <hi>Lordship,</hi> you should have left that <hi>Person,</hi> at <hi>Plimmouth</hi>; More than, when in <hi>Counsell,</hi> or in commending fit persons, for service for <hi>Warrs,</hi> it had been in season. And here, (my <hi>Lord,</hi>) I pray mistake me not. I am not to play now, the Part of a <hi>Gown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that would frame you best, to mine own turn. I know what I owe you. I am infinitely glad of this last <hi>Iourney,</hi> now it is past: The rather, because you may make, so Honourable a full Point, for a time. You have Property good enough, in that Greatness. There is none can, of many years, ascend, near you, in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. Besides, the Disposing of the Places, and Affairs, both, concerning the <hi>Warrs,</hi> (you encreasing in other Greatness,) will, of themselves, flow to you; which will preserve that <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> in full measure. It is a Thing, that of all Things, I would have you retain, the Times considered: And the Necessity of the Service, for other reason, I know none. But I say; Keep it in Substance, but abolish it in shewes, to the <hi>Queen.</hi> For her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty</hi> loveth <hi>Peace.</hi> Next she loveth not <hi>Charge.</hi> Thirdly, that kinde of <hi>Dependance,</hi> maketh a Suspected <hi>Greatness.</hi> Therefore,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51170:213"/>
                        <hi>Quod instat agamus.</hi> Let that be a sleeping Honour a while; And cure the <hi>Queens</hi> mind in that point. Therefore again, whereas I heard your <hi>Lordships</hi> designing to your self, the <hi>Earl Marshals</hi> place, or the place of <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Ordnance,</hi> I did not, in my mind, so well like of either; Because of their Affinity, with a <hi>Martiall Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> But of the <hi>Places,</hi> now void, in my Judgement, and discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I would name you, to the place, of <hi>Lord Privy Seal.</hi> For first, it is the Third Person, of the great <hi>Officers,</hi> of the <hi>Crown.</hi> Next, it hath a kind, of Super-Intendence, over the <hi>Secretary.</hi> It hath also an Affinity, with the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Wards,</hi> in regard of the <hi>Fees,</hi> from the <hi>Liveries.</hi> And it is a fine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, quiet place, and worth a Thousand pounds by year. And my <hi>Lord Admiralls Father,</hi> had it, who was a <hi>Martiall</hi> Man. And it fits a Favourite, to carry her <hi>Majesties Image</hi> in <hi>Seal,</hi> who beareth it best expressed in <hi>Heart.</hi> But my chief Reason is, that which I first alleged, to divert her <hi>Majesty,</hi> from this <hi>Impression,</hi> of a <hi>Martiall Greatnesse.</hi> In concurrence whereof, If your <hi>Lordship,</hi> shall remit any thing of your former diligence, at the <hi>Starr-chamber</hi>; If you shall continue, such Intelligences, as are worth the cherishing; If you shall pretend, to be as <hi>Bookish,</hi> and <hi>Contemplative,</hi> as ever you were; All these Courses, have both their Advantages, and uses in themselves otherwise, and serve exceeding aptly to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Whereunto, I add one Expedient more, stronger than all the rest; And for mine own confident Opinion, void of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, or danger of Diminution, of your <hi>Greatnesse</hi>; And that is, the Bringing in, of some <hi>Martiall</hi> Man, to be of the <hi>Councill</hi>; Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly with her <hi>Majesty</hi> in it, as for her Service, and your better assistance; Chusing neverthelesse some Person, that may be known, not to come in against you, by any former Division. I judge the fittest, to be, my <hi>Lord Mount-joy,</hi> or my Lord <hi>Willoughby.</hi> And if your <hi>Lordship,</hi> see deeplier into it, than I do, that you would not have it done, in effect; Yet in my Opinion, you may serve your turn, by the pretence of it, and stay it neverthelesse.</p>
                     <p>The Third <hi>Impression</hi> is, of a <hi>Popular Reputation</hi>; which, because it is a Thing, good in it self, being obtained as your <hi>Lordship</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth it, that is, <hi>Bonis artibus</hi>; And besides, Well governed, is one of the best Flowers, of your <hi>Greatnesse,</hi> both present, and to come; It would be handled tenderly. The onely way is, to quench it <hi>Verbis,</hi> and not <hi>Rebus.</hi> And therefore to take all Occasions, to the <hi>Queen,</hi> to speak against <hi>Popularity,</hi> and <hi>Popular Courses,</hi> vehemently; And to taxe it in all others: But, neverthelesse, to go on, in your Honourable <hi>Common-wealth Courses,</hi> as you do. And therefore, I will not advise you, to cure this, by dealing in <hi>Monopolies,</hi> or any <hi>Oppressions.</hi> Onely, if in <hi>Parliament,</hi> your <hi>Lordship</hi> be forward for <hi>Treasure,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Warrs,</hi> it becommeth your <hi>Person</hi> well. And if her <hi>Majesty</hi> object <hi>Popularity</hi> to you at any time, I would say to her; A <hi>Parliament</hi> will shew that; And so feed her with Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:51170:214"/>The Fourth <hi>Impression,</hi> of the Inequality, between your <hi>Estate</hi> of <hi>Meanes,</hi> and your <hi>Greatnesse</hi> of <hi>Respects,</hi> is not to be neglected. For believe it, (my <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rd,</hi>) that till her <hi>Majesty</hi> find you, carefull of your <hi>Estate,</hi> she will not onely think you, more like to continue, chargeable to her, but also have a Conceit, that you have higher Imaginations. The <hi>Remedies</hi> are; First, to professe it, in all speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to her. Next, in such Sutes, wherein both Honour, Gift, and Profit, may be taken, to communicate freely with her <hi>Majesty,</hi> by way of enducing her, to grant, that it will be this Benefit to you. Lastly, to be plain with your <hi>Lordship</hi>; (For the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> are such, as I am beholding to;) Nothing can make the <hi>Queen,</hi> or the <hi>World,</hi> think so much, that you are come, to a provident Care, of your Estate, as the Altering of some of your <hi>Officers</hi>: Who, though they be as true to you, as One Hand to the Other; Yet <hi>Opinio Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate major.</hi> But if, in respect of the <hi>Bonds,</hi> they may be entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for your <hi>Lordship,</hi> you cannot so well dismisse your self of them, this cannot be done, but with <hi>Time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Fifth,</hi> and Last, which is, of the Advantage of a <hi>Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>: As severed from the rest, it cannot hurt; So joyned with them, it maketh her <hi>Majesty,</hi> more fearfull, and shadowy, as not knowing her own strength. The onely Remedy to this, is; To give way, to some other <hi>Favourite,</hi> as in particular you shall find, her <hi>Majesty</hi> enclined; So as the Subject hath no ill, nor dangerous Aspect, towards your self. For otherwise, whosoever shall tell me, that you may not have singular use, of a <hi>Favourite,</hi> at your Devotion; I will say, he understandeth not the <hi>Queens Affection,</hi> nor your <hi>Lordships Condition.</hi> And so I rest.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That, at the first, the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> was not produced by <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> but was breathed immediately from <hi>God</hi>; So that the Wayes, and proceedings of <hi>God,</hi> with <hi>Spirits,</hi> are not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Nature</hi>; That is, in the <hi>Lawes,</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi>; But are reserved, to the <hi>Law,</hi> of his secret Will, and Grace; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>God</hi> worketh still, and resteth not, from the Work of <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as he resteth from the Work of <hi>Creation</hi>; But continueth working, till the end of the VVorld; What time, that <hi>Work</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, shall be accomplished, and an eternal <hi>Sabbath</hi> shall ensue. Likewise, that whensoever <hi>God</hi> doth transcend, the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> by <hi>Miracles,</hi> (which may ever seem as new <hi>Creations,</hi>) He never commeth, to that point, or pass, but in regard of the work of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi>; which is the greater, and whereto all <hi>Gods Signes, and Miracles,</hi> doe referr.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>God</hi> created <hi>Man</hi> in his own <hi>Image,</hi> in a <hi>Reasonable Soul,</hi> in <hi>Innocency,</hi> in <hi>Free-will,</hi> and in <hi>Soveraignty</hi>: That he gave him a <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Commandement,</hi> which was in his power to keep, but he kept it not: That <hi>Man</hi> made a total Defection from <hi>God,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming to imagine, that the Commandements, and Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>God,</hi> were not the <hi>Rules,</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi>; But that <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> had their own principles, and beginnings: And lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after the Knowledge, of those imagined Beginnings; To the end, to depend no more upon <hi>Gods</hi> will, revealed, but upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his own Light, as a <hi>God</hi>: Than the which, there could not be a <hi>Sinne,</hi> more opposite, to the whole <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> That yet, neverthelesse, this great <hi>Sinne,</hi> was not originally moved, by the Malice of <hi>Man,</hi> but was insinuated, by the Suggestion, and Instigation, of the Devil; who was the First <hi>Defected Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>; and fell of Malice, and not by Temptation.</p>
