            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was the great care of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Gospel to the Churches <hi>in its own sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,</hi> because, <hi>SO</hi> it is the Power of God unto Salvation to every one that believeth. And if it was <hi>his</hi> care <hi>so</hi> to deliver it to us, it should be <hi>ours</hi> to seek <hi>so</hi> to continue it: And the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Unaptness of the Minds even of the Saints themselves to retain it without commixture. For, to say nothing of the Projects of Hell, and of the cunning craftiness of some that lie in wait to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, even the Godly themselves, as they are dull of hearing, so much more dull in receiving, and holding fast the simplicity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: from their Sense, and Reason, and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and Darkness, arise many imaginations, and high thoughts which exalt themselves against the Knowledg of God, and the Obedience of Jesus Christ; wherefore they themselves have much ado to stand compleat in all the Will of God. And were they not concerned in electing love, by which they are bound up in the Bundle of Life, and blessed with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiment of Saving Grace, which enlightneth their
<pb facs="tcp:54303:3"/>
Souls, and maintaineth their Faith and Hope, they would not only be assaulted, and afflicted with their own Corruptions, but as others, overcome thereby.</p>
            <p>Alas! How ordinary a thing is it for Professors to fall from the Knowledg they have had of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gospel of the Blessed God, and to be turned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fables, Seducing-Spirits, and Doctrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils through the Intoxications of Delusions, and the Witchcrafts of false Preachers.</p>
            <p>Now this their swerving from the Gospel, ariseth:</p>
            <p>1. Either from their not-having, or (having) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retaining, the true Knowledg of the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ: Or,</p>
            <p>2. From their not believing the true Causes of his Coming into the World, with his Doing, and Suffering there. Upon one, or both these accounts, I say, it is that they everlastingly perish: for if they have not, and do not also retain the Knowledg of his Person, they want the <hi>HE,</hi> on whom if they believe not, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> die in their Sins: And if they know not the Reason of his Coming, Doing, and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are in the same condition also.</p>
            <p>Now those Professors that have had some Knowledg of these things, and yet have lost them, it hath come thus to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss with them; because they first lost the Knowledg of themselves, and of their Sins.</p>
            <p>They know not themselves to be such, <hi>nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones,</hi> as the Scripture reporteth them to be, nor their Sins to be so heinous as the Law hath concluded:
<pb facs="tcp:54303:3"/>
Therefore they either turn again with the Dog to his Vomit, or adhere to a few of the Rags of their own Fleshly Righteousness, <hi>and so become pure in their own Eyes, yet are not purged by Blood, from their Filthiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Person and Doings of Jesus Christ are only precious to them that get and retain the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of themselves, and the due Reward of their Sins by the Law: These are desolate, being driven out of all, these embrace the Rock instead of a Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the Sensible Sinner receiveth him joyfully.</p>
            <p>And because a miscarriage in this Great Truth, is the most dangerous and damning Miscarriage: therefore should Professors be the more fearful of swerving aside there-from. The Man that rejecteth the true Knowledg of the Person of the Lord Jesus, and the Causes of his Doing and Suffering in the World, takes the next way to be guilty of that Transgression, that is not to be purged with Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ever. That <hi>FEARFUL</hi> Transgression, for which is left <hi>NO</hi> Offering <hi>AT ALL,</hi> nor any thing to be expected by the Person transgressing, but fearful Judgment, and fiery Indignation which shall devour the Adversary.</p>
            <p>Now for their sakes that have not sinned this Sin, for their sakes that are in danger thereof, but yet not overcome; for their sakes have I written this little Book, wherein is largely, and yet with few words, discovered the Doctrine of the Person, and Doings and Sufferings of Christ with the true Cause thereof;
<pb facs="tcp:54303:4"/>
also a removal of those Objections that the crafty Children of darkness have framed against the same.</p>
            <p>And I have been the more plain and simple in my writing, because the Sin against the Holy Ghost is in these days, more common than formerly, and the Way unto it more beautified with colour, and pretence of Truth. I may say of the way to this Sin, it is, as was once the Way to Jerusalem, strewed with Boughs and Branches, and by some there is eried a kind of <hi>Hosanna</hi> to them that are treading these Steps to Hell. Oh the plausible Pretences, the golden Names, the feigned Holiness, the demure Behaviours mixt with damnable Hypocrisie, that attends the Persons that have forsaken the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that have despised his Person, trampled upon him, and counted the Blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was Sanctified, an Unholy thing! They have crucified him to themselves, and think that they can go to Heaven without him; yea, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they love him, when they hate him; pretend they have him, when they have cast him off; pretend they trust in him, when they bid defiance to his Undertakings for the World.</p>
            <p>Reader, let me beseech thee to hear me patiently; read, and consider, and judg. I have presented thee with that which I have received from God, and the Holy Men of God, who spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost do bear me witness. Thou will say, all pretend to this: Well, but give me the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, take me to the Bible, and let me find in thy
<pb facs="tcp:54303:4"/>
Heart no favour, if thou find me to swerve from the Standard.</p>
            <p>I say again, receive my Doctrine, I beseech thee in Christ's stead receive it; I know it to be the Way of Salvation. I have ventured my own Soul thereon with gladness, and if all the Souls in the World were mine as mine own Soul is, I would through God's Grace venture every one of them there. I have not writ at a venture, nor borrowed my Doctrine from Libraries. I depend upon the sayings of no man: I found it in the Scriptures of Truth, among the true sayings of God.</p>
            <p>I have done when I have exhorted thee to pray, and give heed to the Words of God as revealed in the Holy Writ. The Lord Jesus Christ himself give thee Light and Life by Faith in him; to whom with the Father and the good Spirit of Grace be Glory and Dominion now and for ever:</p>

               <p>He is God, and had Personal Being from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Worlds; therefore not such an one as took being when he was formed in the World; <hi>He is God's natural Son.</hi> The Eternal Son of his Begetting, and Love. <hi>God sent forth his Son;</hi> he was, and was his Son, before he was Revealed. <hi>What is his Name, and what is his Sons Name, if thou canst tell?</hi> Prov. 30. 4. Ezek. 21. 10. He hath an Eternal Generation, such as <hi>none can declare:</hi> not Man, not Angel, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 8. He was the delight of his Father before he had made either Mountain or Hill. <hi>While as yet he had not made the Earth, or the Fields, or the lightest part of the Dust of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all things were made by him, &amp; without him was not any thing made that was made, &amp; he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</hi> It is he with whom the Father consulted when he was about to make Man; when he intended to overthrow <hi>Babel,</hi> and when he sent <hi>Isaiah</hi> to harden the Hearts of <hi>Israel, Pro.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. and 11. 7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 8. This is the Person intended in the Text. Hence also he testifies of himself, that he came down from the Father; that he had Glory with him before the World was.

               </head>
               <p>To be of <hi>Davids Seed,</hi> is to spring from his Loins, to come of his Race according to the Flesh: and therefore as he is <hi>Davids</hi> God, so likewise is he <hi>Davids</hi> Son; the <hi>Root,</hi> and also the <hi>Off-spring of</hi> David: And this the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self acknowledgeth; saying, <hi>I am the Root,</hi> or God, <hi>and the Off-spring,</hi> and Son <hi>of</hi> David, <hi>and the Bright and Morning Star,</hi> Revel. 22. 16. This is indeed the great Mystery, the Mystery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>If</hi> David <hi>called him Lord, how is he then his Son?</hi> see Luk. 2. 4. Rom. 1. 3. 2 Tim. 2. 8. Matt. 22. 45.</p>
               <p>And hence it is that he is said <hi>to be wonderful,</hi> because he is both God and Man in one Person. <hi>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given, and the Government shall be upon his Shoulder, and his Name shall be called Wonderful,</hi> Isa. 9. 6. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful indeed! Wonderful God, Wonderful Man, Wonderful God-Man, and so a Wonderful Jesus &amp; Saviour.

                  <hi>Quest. 3. Thirdly,</hi> What it was for Jesus to be of this Mans Seed according to the Promise.</head>
               <p>1. This Word [Promise] doth sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the Promises which God made to our Fathers from the first Promise to the last; and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54303:7"/>
so the Holy Ghost doth call them. The Promise made unto the Fathers, God hath fulfilled the same to us their Children, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 32, 33.</p>
               <p>2. But the word Promise here, doth in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intend that which God made to <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>Men and Brethren,</hi> said Peter, <hi>let me freely speak unto you of the Patriarch</hi> David, <hi>that he is both dead and buried, and his Sepulcher is with us unto this day: therefore being a Prophet, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God had sworn with an Oath to him, that of the Fruit of his Loins according to the Flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his Throne; he seeing this before, spake of the Resurrection of Christ, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 2. 29, 30.</p>

                  <hi>Quest. Fourthly,</hi> What it was for Jesus to be raised thus up of God to <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Here we have two things to consider of.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Who <hi>Israel</hi> is.</item>
                  <item>2. What it was for Jesus to be raised up unto them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. <hi>Who</hi> Israel <hi>is.</hi> By <hi>Israel</hi> sometimes we should understand the whole Stock of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Natural Children of his Flesh; for that name they have of him; for he obtained it when he wrestled with the Angel and prevailed (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with his Seed in their Generations.</p>
               <p>2. By <hi>Israel</hi> we are to understand all those that God hath promised to Christ. The Children of <hi>the Promise are counted for the Seed,</hi> the elect Jews and Gentiles. These are called <hi>the Israel of God,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54303:8"/>
and the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom Jesus in special regarded in his undertaking the work of Mans Redemption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>2. What it was for Jesus to be raised up unto them.</p>
               <p>This word, <hi>raised up,</hi> is diversly taken in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>1. It is taken for <hi>sending,</hi> as when he saith, he raised them up Judges, Saviours, and Prophets; he means, he sent them such, (<hi>Judges</hi> 2. 16, 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 9, 15. <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 11.) and thus he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up Jesus; that is, <hi>he sent him. I came not,</hi> saith he, <hi>of my self, but he sent me. But the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which sent me gave me a commandment,</hi> Jo. 12.</p>
               <p>2. To be raised up intimateth one <hi>invested with power and authority.</hi> Thus he raised up <hi>David</hi> to be the King of <hi>Israel;</hi> he anointed him &amp; invested him with Kingly Power, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 22. And thus was Jesus Christ raised up: Hence he is called, <hi>the Horn of Salvation: He hath raised up for us an Horn of Salvation in the House of his Servant</hi> David, Luk. 2. 69.</p>
               <p>3. To be raised up intimateth quickning and strengthening, to oppose and overcome all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. Thus was Jesus raised up from under Sin, Death, the rage of the World, and Hell, that day that God raised him out of the Grave.</p>
               <p>Thus therefore was Jesus raised up to <hi>Israel;</hi> that is, he was sent, authorized, and strengthned
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54303:8"/>
to, and in the work of their Salvation, to the compleating of it.</p>
               <p>The words thus opened, do lay before us these two Observations.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That in all Ages God gave his People a Promise, and so ground for a believing remembrance that he would one day send them a Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That when Jesus was come into the World, then was that Promise of God fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To begin with the First, <hi>That in all Ages God gave his People a Promise, and so ground for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving remembrance, that he would one day send them a Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Zacharias</hi> testifies when he was filled with the Holy Ghost; for speaking of the Messias, or the Saviour, he saith, <hi>That God spake of him by the mouth of all the Prophets which have been since the World began:</hi> To which I will add that of <hi>Peter; Yea, and all the Prophets from</hi> Samuel, <hi>and these that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days,</hi> Luk. 2. 69, 70. Acts 3. 24.</p>
               <p>From these Texts it is evident that in every Generation or Age of the World, God did give his People a Promise, and so ground for a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-remembrance that he would one day send them a Saviour: for indeed the Promise is not only a ground for a remembrance, but for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving-remembrance: what God saith is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for Faith, because he is Truth and cannot lye or repent. But that is not all, his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54303:9"/>
Heart was engaged, yea all his Heart, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which he spoke, of sending us a Saviour.</p>
               <p>From this Observation I shall make inquiry into these three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>What it is to be a Saviour.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>How it appears that God in all Ages gave his People a Promise that he would one day send them a Saviour.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That this was ground for a believing remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that a Saviour should one day come.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>First, <hi>What it is to be a Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word Saviour is easie to be understood, it being all one with Deliverer, Redeemer, &amp;c. <hi>A Saviour, Jesus;</hi> both words are of the same signification, and are doubled, perhaps to teach us, that the Person mentioned in the Text, is not called <hi>Jesus</hi> only to distinguish him from other Men (for names are given to distinguish) but also, and especially to specifie his Office: his Name is Saviour, because it was to be his Work, his Office, his Business in the World. <hi>His Name shall be called Jesus, for he shall save his People from their sins,</hi> Matt. 1. 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This word <hi>Saviour</hi> is a word so large, that it hath place in all the undertakings of Christ; for whatever he doth in his Mediation, he doth as a Saviour. He interposeth between God and Man as a <hi>Saviour.</hi> He engageth against Sin, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Death, and Hell, <hi>as a Saviour,</hi> and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over them by himself as a <hi>Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54303:9"/>Thirdly, The word <hi>Saviour,</hi> as I said, is all one with Redeemer, Deliverer, Reconciler, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, or the like; for though there be variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the terms, yet <hi>Saviour</hi> is the intendment of them all. By <hi>Redeeming</hi> he becoms <hi>a Saviour,</hi> by <hi>Delivering</hi> he becomes <hi>a Saviour,</hi> by <hi>Reconciling</hi> he becomes a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and by <hi>making Peace</hi> he becometh a <hi>Saviour:</hi> But I pass this now, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to speak more to the same question afterwards.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How it appears that God in all Ages gave his People a Promise that he would one day send them a Saviour.</p>
               <p>It appears evidently, for so soon as man had sinned, God came to him with an heart full of Promise, and continued to renew, and renew, till the time of the promised Messias to be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was come.</p>
               <p>He promised him under the name of the Seed of the Woman, after our first Father had sinned: <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed, it shall break thy Head, and thou shalt bruise his Heel</hi> (Gen. 3. 15.) This the Apostle hath his eye upon when he saith, <hi>When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law, to Redeem them that were under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4. 4.</p>
               <p>2. God renewed this Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and there tells him Christ should be his Seed; saying,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54303:10"/>
                  <hi>In thy Seed shall all Families of the Earth be blessed,</hi> (Gen. 12. 3.) Now saith <hi>Paul; To</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>and his Seed was the Promise made; He saith not unto Seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy Seed, which is Christ,</hi> (Gal. 3. 16.)</p>
               <p>3. He was promised in the time of <hi>Moses</hi> under the name of a Prophet; <hi>I will raise them up</hi> (saith God to him) <hi>a Prophet of their Brethren like unto thee:</hi> This <hi>Peter</hi> expounds of Christ, for <hi>Moses</hi> truly said unto the Fathers: <hi>A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your Brethren like unto me, him shall you hear in all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he shall say unto you,</hi> Deut. 18. 18. Acts. 3. 22.</p>
               <p>4. He promised him to <hi>David</hi> under the Title of a Son; saying, <hi>I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son:</hi> For this the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the Saviour; saying, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee:</hi> and again, <hi>I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 14. Heb. 1. 5.</p>
               <p>5. He was promised in the days of <hi>Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. By the name of a Branch. <hi>In that day shall the Branch of the Lord be Beautiful and Glorious,</hi> Isa. 4. 2.</p>
               <p>2. Under the name of the Son of a Virgin. <hi>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a Sign; Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, &amp; thou shalt call his Name</hi> Emmanuel. This <hi>Matthew</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54303:10"/>
of Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Matt.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
               <p>3. He was promised under the name of a Rod. <hi>Then shall come forth a Rod out of the Stem of</hi> Jesse, <hi>and a Branch shall grow out of his Roots, and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.</hi> This answereth the Text, <hi>David</hi> was the Son of <hi>Jesse,</hi> and Christ the Son of <hi>David, Isa.</hi> 11. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>4. He is promised under the Title of a King. <hi>Behold, a King shall rule in righteousness; and a Man shall be for a hiding-place from the Wind, and a covert from the Tempest, as Rivers of Waters in a dry place, as the shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land,</hi> Isa. 32. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>5. He was promised under the name of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Servant. <hi>Behold, my Servant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him, he shall bring forth Judgment to the Gentiles: he shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the Streets; a bruised Reed shall he not break, and smoking Flax shall he not quench,</hi> Isa. 42. 1, 2, 3. Matt. 12. 18.</p>
               <p>6. He was promised to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> under the name of the Lord our Righteousness. <hi>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>a Righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper: he shall execute Judgment in the Earth, in his days</hi> Judah <hi>shall be saved, and</hi> Israel <hi>shall dwell safely, and this is the name wherewith he shall be called, The Lord, our Righteousness,</hi> Jer. 23. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54303:11"/>7. He was promised by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> under the name of <hi>David</hi> a Shepherd. <hi>And I will set one Shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my Servant</hi> David, <hi>he shall feed them: and he shall be their Shepherd, and I the Lord will be their God, and my Servant</hi> David <hi>a Prince among them, I the Lord have spoken it.</hi> Ezek. 34. 24. Joh. 10. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>8. He was promised by the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> under the name of Messias, or Christ, the most Holy. <hi>And after threescore and two weeks shall the Messiah be cut off, but not for himself.</hi> Dan. 9. 26.</p>
               <p>9. He was promised by the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Ruler of <hi>Israel. But thou</hi> Bethlehem Ephratah, <hi>though thou be little among the thousands of</hi> Judah, <hi>yet out of thee shall be come, that is to be Ruler in</hi> Israel, Mic. 5. 2. Matt. 2. 6.</p>
               <p>10. He was promised to <hi>Haggai</hi> as the desire of all Nations. <hi>I will shake all Nations, and the desire of all Nations shall come, and I will fill this house with Glory, saith the Lord of Hosts,</hi> Hag. 2. 7.</p>
               <p>11. He was promised by <hi>Zechariah</hi> under the name of Servant and Branch. <hi>For behold, I will bring forth my Servant the Branch:</hi> and again, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Man whose name is the Branch, he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the Glory,</hi> Zech. 3. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:54303:11"/>12. He was promised by <hi>Malachi</hi> under the name of the Lord, and the Messenger of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>Behold, I send my Messenger, and he shall prepare the way before thee, and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple; even the Messenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he shall come saith the Lord of Hosts,</hi> Malachi 3. 12.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Scriptures of the Old-Testament are filled with Promises of the Messias to come, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Promises, Typical Promises: For all the Types and shadows of the Saviour, are virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally so many Promises. Having therefore touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Prophetical, I will briefly touch the Typical Promises also; for as God spake at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times to the Fathers, so also in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Prophetically, Providentially, Typically, and all of the Messias, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
               <p>The Types of the Saviour were various.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Sometimes he was typed out by Men.</item>
                  <item>2. Sometimes by Beasts.</item>
                  <item>3. Sometimes by Insensible Creatures.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, <hi>He was typed forth sometimes by Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Adam</hi> was his Type in many things, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as he was the Head and Father of the first World. <hi>He was the Figure of him that was to come,</hi> Rom. 5. 14.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Moses</hi> was his Type as Mediator, and as Builder of the Tabernacle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:54303:12"/>
                  <hi>Aaron</hi> was his Type as he was High-Priest, and so was <hi>Melchisedec</hi> before him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 1, 21.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Sampson</hi> was his Type in the effects of his death: for as <hi>Sampson</hi> gave his life for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of <hi>Israel</hi> from the <hi>Philistins,</hi> Christ gave his Life to deliver us from Sin and Devils.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Joshuah</hi> was his Type in giving the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Israel,</hi> as Jesus will give the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven to the Elect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>David</hi> was his Type in many things, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his subduing of <hi>Israels</hi> Enemies, and feeding them; hence he is sometimes called Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>their King,</hi> and David <hi>their Shepherd,</hi> Ezek. 34. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Solomon</hi> was his Type in his building the Temple, and in his Peaceable Kingdom. Hence it is said, he shall build the Temple of the Lord; and again, Of his Government and Peace there shall be no end.</p>
               <p>Beasts were his Types. To instance some:</p>
               <p>First, The Paschal-Lamb was his Type, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>In its Spotlesness.</hi> Christ was a Lamb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemish and without spot, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>In its being Roasted.</hi> It was a Figure of the cursed Death of Christ, (for to be Roasted bespake one accursed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 22.) <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
               <p>3. In that it was to be eaten. <hi>He that eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, saith Christ, hath</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54303:12"/>
                  <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> John 6. 57.</p>
               <p>4. In that its Blood was to be sprinkled upon the doors of their houses for the destroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to look on: The Blood of Christ is sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the Elect for the Justice of God to look on, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>5. By eating the Paschal-Lamb, the People went out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> by feeding upon Christ by Faith, we come from under the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkness, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Satan, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Red Cow was his Type, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 2, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>1. In that she was to be without blemish.</p>
               <p>2. In that she was to be slain without the Camp. <hi>Jesus also that he might sanctifie the People with his own Blood, suffered without the Gate,</hi> Heb. 13. 12.</p>
               <p>3. In that her Flesh was to be burnt, a Type of the grievous Death of Christ.</p>
               <p>4. Her Ashes was to be carried into a clean place without the Camp; a Type of the clean Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher where the Body of Jesus was laid, <hi>John</hi> 19. 38, 39, 40, 41.</p>
               <p>There was also divers other Sacrifices, as Bulls, Goats and Birds; which were Types of him, which I here omit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Insensible Creatures were his Types.</p>
               <p>As first, The Mannah in the Wilderness, (<hi>Ex.</hi> 16.) and that,</p>
               <p>1. As it came down from Heaven; for so did
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54303:13"/>
Christ, <hi>I came down from Heaven,</hi> saith he: and again, <hi>I am the Living Bread which came down from Heaven,</hi> John 6. 51.</p>
               <p>2. The Mannah was to be eaten, so is Christ by Faith. <hi>If any man eat of this Bread, he shall live for ever, and the Bread that I will give is my Flesh, which I will give for the life of the World,</hi> John 6. 51.</p>
               <p>3. The Mannah was to be gathered daily, so is Christ to be daily eaten.</p>
               <p>4. The Mannah was all the Bread that <hi>Israel</hi> had in the Wilderness: Christ is all the Bread that Believers have in this Life for their Souls.</p>
               <p>5. The Mannah came not by <hi>Moses</hi> Law, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comes Christ by our Merits. <hi>Moses gave you not that Bread from Heaven, but my Father giveth you the true Bread from Heaven,</hi> John 6. 32.</p>
               <p>Again, The Rock that gave them out Water for their Thirst, was a Type of him, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 20.) <hi>They did all drink of the same Spiritual Drink, for they drank of that Spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ,</hi> 1 Cor 10. 4.</p>
               <p>This Rock was his Type in four<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things.</p>
               <p>1. It gave Drink to the People in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness when they were come out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Christ gives drink to them that forsake the World for him.</p>
               <p>2. The Rock yielded Water by being smitten by <hi>Moses's</hi> Rod: Christ giveth drink <hi>even his Blood,</hi> by being striken by <hi>Moses's</hi> Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. 11. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:54303:13"/>3. The water out of this Rock was given to the Thirsty. <hi>I will give to him that is a-thirst, saith Christ, of the Fountain of the water of Life freely,</hi> Revel. 21. 6.</p>
               <p>4. The Water of the Rock in the Wilderness ran after the People, <hi>They drank of that Rock that followed them, he opened the Rock and the Waters gushed out, they ran in dry places like a River.</hi> Christ also is said by that Type to follow us: They drank of that Rock that followed them, <hi>and that Rock was Christ,</hi> Psal. 105. 41. 1 Cor. 10. 4.</p>
               <p>Again, The Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> was his Type.</p>
               <p>1. That Mount stood in <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> Christ also stands in his Church.</p>
               <p>2. Upon that Rock was built the Temple. <hi>And upon this Rock,</hi> said Christ, <hi>will I build my Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it,</hi> 2 Chron. 3. 1. Mat. 16. 18.</p>
               <p>Other things might be urged, but these being virtually of the force of the Promise, and also as a Key to open them, therefore I thought good to place them here with the Promises; because, as they are standing with them, so they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to beget Faith in the same Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>I come now to the third thing, to wit, <hi>That these Promises were ground for a Believing Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that a Saviour should one day come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a Remembring, and a Believing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, or such a Remembring that begetteth, and maintaineth Faith in the Heart. <hi>Jacob</hi> had a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54303:14"/>
Believing Remembrance, when he said, <hi>I have waited for thy Salvation, O Lord,</hi> Gen. 49. 18. And so had <hi>David</hi> when he cried, <hi>O that the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of</hi> Israel <hi>was come out of</hi> Zion, Psalm 53. 6. These, with <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> had not a Remembrance only, but a Believing Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, <hi>that God would send them a Saviour.</hi> They had the Promise not in the Book only, but in their Hearts: This Gospel was mixed in them with Faith; therefore they with their Fellows remembred and believed, or made the Promise the Ground of their Believing that God would one day send them a Saviour.</p>
               <p>Let me make some use of this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Here we may see how much the Heart of God was set upon the Salvation of Sinners, he studied it, contrived it, set his Heart on it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and promised, and promised to compleat it by sending one day his Son for a Saviour, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 3. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>No marvel therefore, if when he treateth of the New-Covenant, in which the Lord Jesus is wrapped, and presented in a Word of Promise to the World, that he saith; <hi>I will do it assuredly with my whole Heart and with my whole Soul,</hi> Jer. 32. 41.</p>
               <p>Now this is of singular comfort to sensible Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; yea, what greater ground of consolation to such, than to hear that the God against whom they have sinned, should himself take care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide us a Saviour</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54303:14"/>There are some poor Sinners in the World, that have given such way to discouragement, from the sence of the greatness of their Sins, that they dare not think upon God, nor the Sins which they have committed: But the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are ignorant that God's Heart was wrapt up in this good work of providing and sending <hi>a Saviour.</hi> Let such hearken now to the Call of God; <hi>Return unto me, for I have redeemed thee,</hi> Isa. 44. 22. Ho! turn again, hearken; the Heart of God is much set upon Mercy, from the beginning of the World he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved and promised, ay, and sware we should have a Saviour.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Doct.</hi> I now proceed to the second Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That when Jesus was come into the World, then was the Promise of God fulfilled;</hi> namely, That he would one day send us a Saviour.</p>
               <p>Take three Texts for the Confirmation of this Point.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>This is of a truth that Prophet that should come into the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These words were spoken of them that were present at that Miracle of Jesus, when he sed Five Thousand with Five Barly Loaves which a Lad had about him in the Company: For these Men, when they had seen the Marvel, being amazed at it, made confession of him to be the Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:54303:15"/>2. <hi>Lord, I believe thou art the Christ the Son of God, which should come into the World,</hi> John 9. 27.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the World to save Sinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15.</p>
               <p>For the explaining of this Observation, I will briefly handle three questions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. How this Jesus is to be distinguished from <hi>others of that Name.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. What it was for <hi>this</hi> Jesus to come into the World.</item>
                  <item>3. What it was for him to come to be a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="question">
               <head>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. For the first, The Jesus in the Text, is distinguished from all others of that Name.</head>
               <p>1. By the manner of his Birth, he was born of a Virgin, a Virgin espoused to a Man whose Name was <hi>Joseph;</hi> but he knew her not till she had brought forth her First-born Son, <hi>and he called his name Jesus,</hi> Mat. 1. 25.</p>
               <p>2. He is distinguished from others of that Name, by the place of his Birth; to wit, <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> the City of <hi>David,</hi> there he must be Born, there he was Born, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 42. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>3. He is distinguished by his Linage, <hi>He came of the House and Linage of</hi> David, Luk. 2. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>4. He is distinguished by the time of his Birth, to wit, <hi>the Time that the Prophets prefixed,</hi> Gal. 4. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54303:15"/>5. But his common Distinction is, <hi>Jesus of Nazareth;</hi> by this Name he is distinguished <hi>one and twenty times</hi> in the New-Testament.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His Enemies called him <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> Mat. 26. 71. Mark. 14. 67. Joh. 18. 5.</item>
                  <item>2. His Disciples called him <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> Mat. 21. 11. Luk. 24. 19. Joh. 1. 45. Act. 2. 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The Angels called him <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> Mar. 16. 6.</item>
                  <item>4. And he calleth Himself <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> Acts 22. 8.</item>
                  <item>5. Yea, and he goeth also by the Name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus of Nazareth</hi> among the Devils, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 34.</item>
               </list>
               <p>He was called <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> because he dwelt there with his Mother <hi>Mary</hi> and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. <hi>Nazareth</hi> was his City <hi>where he had been brought up,</hi> whither for shelter <hi>Joseph</hi> carried him when he came up out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with him: in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> was his common Abode, <hi>until the time that</hi> John <hi>was cast into Prison,</hi> Luk. 4. 16. Mat. 2. 23. Chap. 4. 12, 13. Wherefore he might well say, <hi>I am Jesus of Nazareth:</hi> Yea, though he was now in Heaven; for Heaven shall not make us forget what Country-men we were when we lived in the World. Jesus, you see here, though Glorified in Heaven, yet forgets not what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-Man he was when he dwelt in the World. I am Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> saith he, I am the Jesus
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54303:16"/>
that thou hatest; and that thou mayest know I am he, I tell thee I dwelt once in the City <hi>Nazareth</hi> in <hi>Galilee: Joseph</hi> and my Mother <hi>Mary</hi> brought me up there, and there I dwelt with them many years. I am Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> whom thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutest.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="question">
               <head>Quest. 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What was it for Jesus to come into the World?</head>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Not his coming in, or by his Spirit in his People; for so he was never out of the World.</item>
                  <item>2. Neither is it his Appearance in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</item>
                  <item>3. Nor that coming of his by which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth Antichrist.</item>
                  <item>4. Nor his Appearing in his dreadful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences or Judgments.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But by the coming of Jesus, according to the Text, we are to understand <hi>that,</hi> or <hi>such</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby he was manifest to be God-Man in one Person, God in our Flesh without us, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct in his own Person by himself; Such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by which he was manifested to be in all points like as men are, Sin only excepted. Such a Coming, wherein, or by which, the Son of God became also the Son of Man.</p>
               <p>For the further clearing of this, you find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said, he was <hi>born into the World;</hi> Mary, <hi>of whom was born Jesus.</hi> Now when Jesus was <hi>born,</hi> it's said, Where is he that is <hi>born</hi> King of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54303:16"/>
Jews? <hi>Herod</hi> demanded of them where Christ should be <hi>born, Mat.</hi> 1. 16. Chap. 2. 1, 2, 4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 35. Chap. 2. 11.</p>
               <p>Now that this was fulfilled according to the very word of the Text, without any juggle, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or cunningly-devised Fable, consider:</p>
               <p>1. He is called the First-Born of this Woman, <hi>The Male Child that opened her Womb,</hi> Luk. 2. 7, 23.</p>
               <p>2. He was not born till nourished in her Womb the full time, according to the time of Life. <hi>And so it was that while they were at</hi> Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem, <hi>the days were accomplished that she should be delivered, and she brought forth her First-born Son, and wrapt him in swadling Clothes, and laid him in a Manger,</hi> Luk. 2. 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>3. She also continued in her Separation at the Birth of Jesus, as other women at the Birth of their Children, until the days of her Purification according to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> were accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
               <p>4. Himself also, as other <hi>Hebrew</hi> Children, was brought to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to present him unto the Lord; <hi>As it is written in the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>every Male that openeth the Womb shall be called Holy unto the Lord,</hi> Luk. 2. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>5. Thus Jesus also, as other <hi>Hebrew</hi>-Children, when the set Day was come, was Circumcised. <hi>And when eight days were accomplished for the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising of the Child, his Name was called</hi> Jesus,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54303:17"/>
                  <hi>which was so named of the Angel before he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Womb,</hi> Luk. 2. 21.</p>
               <p>6. After this, he is often called the Young-Child, the Child Jesus; and further it is said of him, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he grew, that he increased in Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Stature, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 20, 21. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 40, 52.</p>
               <p>Behold, with what diligence, even to a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, the Holy Ghost sets forth the Birth of the Lord Jesus, and all to convince the incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous World, of the true Manner of the coming of the Saviour into the World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Reality of the Manhood of this Lord Jesus, is yet further manifest, and that;</p>
               <p>First, By those natural Infirmities that attend Human Flesh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the Names the Prophets gave him in the Days of the Old-Testament and the New.</p>
               <p>First, By those natural Infirmities that attend Human Flesh.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>As 1. At his Birth he could not go, but as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by his Parents.</item>
                  <item>2. He was sensible of Hunger, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 2.</item>
                  <item>3. He was sensible of Thirst, John 19. 28.</item>
                  <item>4. He was sensible of Weariness, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 6.</item>
                  <item>5. He was nourished by Sleep, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. 34.</item>
                  <item>6. He was subject to Grief, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. 5.</item>
                  <item>7. He was subject to Anger, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. 5.</item>
                  <item>8. He was subject to Weep, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 35. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19, 41,</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:54303:17"/>9. He had Joy as a Man and rejoyced, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 21.</item>
               </list>
               <p>These things, I say, Jesus was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> subject to as a Man, as the Son of the Virgin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Reality of his Manhood is yet made manifest by the Names the Prophets gave him, both in the Old-Testament and in the New.</p>
               <p>As 1. He is called the <hi>Seed.</hi> The <hi>Seed</hi> of the Woman, the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> by which is meant he was to come of their Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.

               <p>2. Therefore it is added (where mention is made of the Fathers) <hi>of whom as concerning the Flesh</hi> Christ came. He was made of the Seed of <hi>David according to the Flesh:</hi> And hence again, he calleth himself the <hi>Off-spring</hi> of <hi>David;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I say, he is said to be of <hi>their Flesh, their</hi> Loins, and is called <hi>their</hi> Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. Chap. 9. 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 30. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 16.</p>
               <p>3. He <hi>therefore</hi> is frequently called <hi>a Man,</hi> and the Son of Man. <hi>Then shall you see the Son of man coming in the Clouds of Heaven. When the Son of man shall come in his Glory, and all the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with him. This Man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Priesthood.

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54303:18"/>4. What shall I say, Himself gave undeniable Demonstration of all this, when he said, he <hi>was</hi> dead; when he called to <hi>Thomas</hi> to put his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to, and behold his Hands, to reach to him his Hand and <hi>thrust it into his Side,</hi> and bid him he should not be faithless <hi>but believing.</hi> At another time when he stood in the midst of the Eleven, as they were troubled with the thoughts of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, he said, <hi>Behold my Hands and my Feet, that it is I my self, handle me, and see: for a Spirit bath not Flesh and Bones, as ye see me have,</hi> Joh. 20. 27. Luk. 24. 39.</p>
               <p>Thus have I shewed you what it was for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus to come into the World; namely, <hi>To be born of a Woman, to take flesh, and to become God-man in one Person.</hi>

               <head>Concerning Jesus, how he put himself upon the Test among his Adversaries.</head>
               <p>THe Lord Jesus also putteth himself upon the Test among his Adversaries divers ways.</p>
               <p>First, he urgeth the time of the appearing of the Messias, to be come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye and believe the Gospel,</hi> (Mar. 1. 15.)</p>
               <p>For this he had a three-fold proof.</p>
               <p>1. The Heathens had invaded and taken the Land, according to that of <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 9. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>2. The Scepter was departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Jacob,</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10.) to which also suited that Prophecy: <hi>Before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and chuse the good, the Land which thou abhorrest, shall be forsaken of both her Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor had not only subdued the Nation, and put down the Kingly Race of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54303:21"/>
the Jews; but had set up and established his own Power over them. <hi>In the fifteenth year of the Reign of</hi> Tiberius Cesar, Pontius Pilat <hi>was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of</hi> Judea, Herod <hi>was Tetrarch of</hi> Galilee, Philip <hi>Tetrarch of</hi> Iturea, <hi>and</hi> Lysanias <hi>Tetrarch of</hi> Abilene, <hi>all Heathens, and of</hi> Tyberius <hi>his making.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, The Kingly Race of <hi>Judah</hi> was at this time become so low by reason of the <hi>Roman</hi> oppression, that the chief of them were put to get their living by their own hands, even <hi>Joseph,</hi> the supposed Father of Jesus, was then become a Carpenter: Poor man! when Jesus was born, he was fain to thrust into a Stable, for there was in the <hi>Inn</hi> no room for such Guests as they. The Offering also which was brought unto God the time when Jesus was presented unto the Lord, <hi>was two Turtle-Doves, or two young Pigeons;</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice allowed only for them that were <hi>Poor</hi> and could provide no bigger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if she be not able to bring a Lamb, then she shall bring two Turtle-Doves or two young Pigeons, the one for a Burnt-Offring, the other for a Sin-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> Levit. 12. 8. Besides, Jesus himself saith, <hi>Foxes have Holes, and the Birds of the Air have Nests, but the Son of Man hath not whereon to lay his Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, I say, all these things were so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Jews, that they could not object; they felt the <hi>Romans</hi> were come, they knew the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54303:21"/>
Scepter was gone, they smarted under the <hi>Roman</hi> Tyranny, and knew the Kingly Race of <hi>Judea</hi> was over-thrown: How then could they object, that the time was not come for Christ to be born?</p>
               <p>Further, The People was generally convinced, <hi>that the time was come,</hi> and therefore, saith the Text; <hi>They were in expectation. And as all the People were in expectation, and all men mused in their Hearts of</hi> John, <hi>whether he was the Christ or not,</hi> Luk. 3. 15. The unbiassed People ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the face of things, could do no other but look for the Messias. And hence it is, that the Lord Jesus gives the Pharisees, those mortal E nemies of his, such sore rebukes; saying, <hi>O ye Hypocrites, ye can discern the Face of the Skie, but can you not discern the Signs of the Times? The Kingdom is lost,</hi> the Heathens are come, and the Scepter is departed from <hi>Judea. Ye Hypocrites, ye can discern the Face of the Skie, and of the Earth, but how is it that ye do not discern this Time?</hi> Mat. 16. 3. Luk. 12. 56.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He yet again puts himself upon the <hi>Test,</hi> by the Miracles which he wrought before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Believe me that I am in the Father and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in me, or else believe me for the very works sake,</hi> (John 14. 11.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:54303:22"/>
                  <hi>that the Father hath sent me,</hi> John 5. 36.</p>
               <p>This Proof they could not withstand, but granted that he did many Miracles while they did nothing. <hi>Then gathered the Chief-Priests and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees a Counsel, and said, what do we? for this Man doth many Miracles: if we let him alone all men will believe on him, and the</hi> Romans <hi>shall come and take away both our Place and Nation,</hi> John 11. 47, 48.</p>
               <p>Yea so did Jesus confound them, that by their own Records and Laws by which they were to prove persons clean or unclean; they in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Lectures, did justifie him and overthrow themselves.</p>
               <p>For instance, it was written in their Law; <hi>If he that hath an Issue spit upon him that is clean,</hi> that Spittle should make him unclean, (<hi>Levit.</hi> 15. 8.) Now Jesus whom they counted most unclean because he said he was the Son of God (as they thought speaking Blasphemy) he spits upon people and makes them whole; he spat and made clay with the Spittle and with that clay made a Blind Man see, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 6. Also he spit on the Eyes of another and made him see, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 23, 24, 25. Again he spit, and with his Spittle touched the Tongue of one that was Dumb, and made him speak immediatly, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 33, 34, 35. Thus he proved himself clear of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations, and maintained before them, that by their Law he was guiltless, and the Son of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54303:22"/>
God; for the Miracles which he wrought were to prove him so to be.</p>
               <p>Again, In their Law it was written, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so touched the Altar of Incense should be Holy, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 37.) A Woman with a Bloody Issue toucheth him, and is whole of her Plague. Yea, they brought to him many diseased Persons; <hi>and besought him that they might only touch the Hem of his Garment; and as many as touched, were made perfectly whole,</hi> Mar. 5. 28, 29. Mat. 14. 35, 36.</p>
               <p>Thus was he justified before them out of their own Law, and had his Glory manifest before their Faces, to their everlasting confusion and contempt.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the Jews did make one Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Jesus Christ, that seemed to them to have weight in it: and that was because he <hi>first began to appear and manifest his Glory in</hi> Canaan <hi>of</hi> Galilee. At this, I say, they stumbled, it was their sore temptation; for still as some affirmed him to be the Christ, others as fast objected, <hi>shall Christ come out of</hi> Galilee? <hi>art thou also of</hi> Galilee? <hi>search and look, for out of</hi> Galilee <hi>ariseth no Prophet,</hi> John 2. 1, 11. Chap. 7. 40, 41, 42.</p>
               <p>But this their stumble might arise either;</p>
               <p>1. From the cruelty of <hi>Herod:</hi> Or,</p>
               <p>2. From their own not observing and keeping in mind the Alarum that God gave them at his Birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:54303:23"/>1. It might arise or be occasioned through the Cruelty of <hi>Herod; for Jesus was born in</hi> Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem <hi>the City where</hi> David <hi>dwelt:</hi> But when <hi>Herod</hi> sent out to kill him, and for his sake killed all the young Children in <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> then was <hi>Joseph</hi> warned by an Angel of God, to take the young Child and his Mother and fly into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and so he did, and was there till the Death of <hi>Herod, Mat.</hi> 2. 1, 13, 16, 19, 20.) After this the Angel comes to them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and bids them take the young Child and return into the Land of <hi>Israel;</hi> wherefore they arose and went: but hearing that <hi>Herod</hi>'s Son that Tyrant ruled in the room of his Father, they were afraid to go to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but turned aside into the Parts of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> where they remained till the time of his shewing to <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This stumble of theirs might arise from their not observing and keeping in mind the Alarum that God gave them of his Birth.</p>
               <p>1. God began to give them the Alarum at the Birth of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> where was asserted that he was to go before the Face of the Lord Jesus, and to prepare his Ways. <hi>And fear came upon all that dwelt round about them; and all these say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were noised abroad throughout all the hill-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of</hi> Judea, Luk. 1. 65.</p>
               <p>2. Again, What a continuation of this Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum was there also at the Birth of Jesus, which was about three months after <hi>John Baptist</hi> was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54303:23"/>
born. Now come the Angels from Heaven, now comes a strange Star over the Countrey to lead the Men of the East to the Stable where Jesus was born; now was <hi>Herod,</hi> the Priests, the Scribes, and also the City <hi>Jerusalem</hi> awakened and sore troubled: for it was noised by the Wise-Men, that Christ the King and Saviour was born. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, The Shepherds, <hi>Simon,</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> gave notice of him to the People; they should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have retained the Memory of these things, and have followed God in all his dark Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, until his Son of Righteousness should arise among them with healing under his Wings.</p>
               <p>3. I may add another cause of their stumble. They did not understand the Prophecies that went before of him.</p>
               <p>1. He was to come to them out of <hi>Egypt. Out of</hi> Egypt <hi>have I called my Son,</hi> Mat. 2. 15.</p>
               <p>2. He turned aside into <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and dwelt in the City of, <hi>Nazareth; That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophets, he shall be called a</hi> Nazaren, Mat. 2. 23.</p>
               <p>3. That saying also was to be fulfilled. <hi>The Land of</hi> Zebulon, <hi>and the Land of</hi> Nepthaly, <hi>by the way of the Sea beyond Jordan,</hi> Galilee <hi>of the Gentiles, the People that sat in Darkness saw a great Light, and to them that sat in the region and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death, Light is sprung up,</hi> Mat. 4. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>At these things then they stumbled, and 'twas
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54303:24"/>
a great Judgment of God upon them.</p>
               <p>Besides, There seemed to be a Contradiction in the Prophecies of the Scriptures concerning his Coming. He was to be <hi>born</hi> in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and yet to <hi>come</hi> out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> How should he be <hi>the Christ,</hi> and <hi>yet</hi> come out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> out of <hi>which</hi> ariseth <hi>no</hi> Prophet?

               <p>Hence note, That though the Prophecies and Promises be full and plain <hi>as these were,</hi> that he should be born in <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> yet men's Sins may cause them to be fulfilled in such obscurity, that instead of having benefit thereby, they may stumble and split their Souls thereat.</p>
               <p>Take heed then, hunt not Christ from plain Promises with <hi>Herod,</hi> hunt him not from <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> lest he appear to your amazement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction from <hi>Egypt,</hi> or in the Land of <hi>Zebulon.</hi> But thus much to the Second Question; to wit, <hi>What it was for Jesus to come into the World.</hi>

                  <p>For the further handling of this Question I must shew:</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>To these three briefly.</p>
                  <p>First, What it is to be a Saviour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:54303:24"/>1. A Saviour supposeth some in misery, and himself one that is to deliver them.</p>
                  <p>2. A Saviour, is either such an one Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially, or Meritoriously.</p>
                  <p>Ministerially, is when one person engageth, or is engaged by virtue of respect or command from Superiours, to go and obtain by conquest or the Kings Redemption, the Captives or Persons griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Tyranny of an Enemy. And thus was <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshuah,</hi> and the Judges and Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> Saviours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou deliveredst them into the Land of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies who vexed them, and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from Heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them Saviours, who saved them out of the Hand of their Enemies,</hi> Nehem. 9. 27.</p>
                  <p>Thus was Jesus Christ a Saviour, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by virtue of respect and command from God, to obtain by conquest and redemption, the Captives or Persons grieved; <hi>God sent his Son to be the Saviour of the World,</hi> John 4. 14.</p>
                  <p>Meritoriously, is when the Person engaging, shall at his own proper cost and charge give a sufficient value or price for those he redeemeth.</p>
                  <p>Thus those under the Law were redeemed by the Mony called the Redemption-Mony. <hi>And</hi> Moses <hi>gave the Mony of them that were redeemed unto</hi> Aaron <hi>and to his Sons,</hi> Numb. 3. 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:54303:25"/>And thus was Jesus Christ a Saviour; he paid full price to Divine Justice for Sinners, even his own precious Blood. <hi>Forasmuch as you know that you were not redeemed from your vain Conversation, received by tradition from your Fathers, with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things, as Silver and Gold, but with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood of Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as in mans redemption, the Undertaker must have respect, not only to the paying of a price, but also to the getting of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; for there is not only Jesus to satisfy, but Death, Devil, Hell, and the Grave to conquer: therefore hath he also by himself gotten the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over these.</p>

               <p>I Come then in the next place to shew you HOW Jesus Christ addressed himself to the Work of mans Redemption.</p>
               <p>The Scripture saith, <hi>he became poor:</hi> That he made himself <hi>of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, that he humbled himself unto death, even the Death of the Cross.</hi> But particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He took upon him our Flesh.</item>
                  <item>2. He was made under the Law.</item>
                  <item>3. He took upon him our Sins.</item>
                  <item>4. He bore the Curse due to our Sins.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, <hi>He took upon him our Flesh.</hi> I shewed you before that he came in our Flesh, and now I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54303:27"/>
must shew you the <hi>Reason of it:</hi> namely, Because, <hi>That was the way to address himself to the Work of our Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, when the Apostle treated of the Incarnation of Christ, he addeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> withal the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to wit, <hi>That he might be capable to work out the Redemption of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three things to be considered in this 1st Head.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. that he took our Flesh; <hi>for this Reason,</hi> That he might be a Saviour.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>How he took flesh,</hi> that he might be our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That it was necessary</hi> that he should take our Flesh, if indeed he will be our Saviour.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the First, That he took our Flesh, for <hi>this Reason, That he might be a Saviour: For what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the Flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the Flesh,</hi> Rom. 8. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>The Sum of the Words is, forasmuch as the Law could do us no good, by reason of the inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that is in our flesh to do it (for the Law can do us no good until it be fulfilled) and because God had a desire that good should come to us, therefore did he send his Son <hi>in our likeness,</hi> cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with flesh, to destroy by his doing the Law, the tendency of the Sin that dwells in our flesh. He therefore took our flesh, that our Sin, with its
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54303:27"/>
effects, might by him be condemned and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
               <p>The Reason therefore why he took flesh, is, Because <hi>he would be our Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For asmuch then as the Children are Partakers of Flesh and blood, he also likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the Power of Death, that is the Devil, and deliver them, who through fear of death were all their life-time subject to bondage,</hi> Heb. 2. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>In these words it is asserted, that he took our flesh for certain Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. Because the Children, the Heirs of Heaven, are Partakers of Flesh and Blood. <hi>For asmuch then as the Children are Partakers of Flesh and Blood, he also himself took part of the same.</hi> Had the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Heirs, been without flesh, he himself had not taken it upon him: had the Children been Angels, he had taken upon him the Nature of Angels; but because the Children were Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Flesh, therefore, leaving Angels, or refusing to take hold of Angels, <hi>he took Flesh and Blood,</hi> the Nature of the Children; that he might put himself into a capacity to save and deliver the Children. Therefore it follows, <hi>That through death he might destroy him that had the Power of Death, that is the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This therefore was another Reason, that he might destroy the Devil.</p>
               <p>The Devil had bent himself against the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54303:28"/>
he is <hi>their Adversary,</hi> and goeth forth to make war with them. <hi>The Devil your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: And he went to make war with the Remnant of her Seed,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 8. Revel. 12. Now the Children could not destroy him, because he had already cast them into sin; defiled their Nature, and laid them under the Wrath of God, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ <hi>puts himself among the Children,</hi> and into the Nature of the Children; that he might, by means of his Dying in their Flesh, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Devil; that is, take away Sin, his Work, <hi>that he might destroy the Works of the Devil;</hi> for sin is the great Engine of Hell, by which he overthroweth all that perish: Now this did Christ destroy, by taking on him the similitude of Sinful Flesh; of which more anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he might destroy him that had the Power of Death, that is the Devil, and deliver them.</hi> This was the thing in chief intended, that he might deliver <hi>the Children,</hi> that he might deliver <hi>them</hi> from death, the Fruit of their Sin; and from Sin, the Sting of that Death. <hi>That he might deliver them, who through the Fear of Death, were all their Life-time subject to bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He took flesh therefore, because the Children had it; he took it that he might die for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he took it that he might deliver the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the Works of the Devil; <hi>that he might deliver them.</hi> No Deliverance had come to the Children if the Son of God had not taken their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54303:28"/>
Flesh and Blood. <hi>Therefore he took our Flesh that he might be our Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, In a Saviour there must be not only Merit, but Compassion and Sympathy; because the Children are yet to live by Faith, are not yet come to the Inheritance. <hi>It behoved him therefore in all things to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a Merciful and Faithful High-Priest in things pertaining to God, to make Reconciliation for the Sins of the People,</hi> Heb. 2. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Two Reasons are rendred in this Text, <hi>why he must take Flesh;</hi> namely, that he might be their Priest, to offer Sacrifice, to wit, <hi>his Body and Blood for them;</hi> and that he might be merciful and faithful, to pitty and preserve them unto the Kingdom appointed for them.</p>
               <p>Mark you therefore, how the Apostle, when he asserteth that the Lord Jesus took our Flesh, urgeth the reason why he took our Flesh. THAT he might destroy the Devil and Death, THAT he might deliver them. It behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren, THAT he might be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and faithful, THAT he might make Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for the Sins of the People. The Reason therefore why he took our Flesh is declared, to wit, <hi>That he might be our Saviour.</hi> And hence you find it so often recorded; <hi>He hath abolished in his Flesh the Enmity; He hath slain the Enmity by his Flesh; and you who were sometimes Aliens and Enemies in your Minds by wicked works: yet,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:54303:29"/>
                  <hi>now hath he reconciled, in the Body of his Flesh, through death, to present you holy and unblameable in his Sight,</hi> Ephes. 2. 15, 16. Col. 1. 21, 22.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>How he took Flesh.</head>
               <p>I Come now to the Second Question, to wit, <hi>How he took our Flesh.</hi> This must be inquired into, for his taking Flesh was not after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way, never any took man's Flesh upon him as he, since the Foundation of the World.</p>
               <p>1. He took not our flesh like <hi>Adam,</hi> who was formed out of the Ground. <hi>Who was made of the Dust of the Ground,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. Chap. 3. 19.</p>
               <p>2. He took not our flesh as we do by Carnal Generation. <hi>Joseph</hi> knew not his Wife, neither did <hi>Mary</hi> know any Man, <hi>till she had brought forth her First-horn Son,</hi> Luk. 1. 34. Mat. 1. 25.</p>
               <p>3. He took flesh then, <hi>by the immediate work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and over-shadowing of the Holy Ghost:</hi> And hence it is said expresly; <hi>She was found with Child of the Holy Ghost. Now the Birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When-as his Mother</hi> Mary <hi>was espoused to</hi> Joseph, (<hi>before they came together</hi>) <hi>she was found with Child of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Mat. 1. 18. And hence again, When <hi>Joseph</hi> doubted of her Honesty (for he perceived she was with Child and knew he had not touched her) the Angel of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54303:29"/>
God, himself comes down to resolve his doubt, and said, Joseph <hi>thou Son of</hi> David, <hi>Fear not, to take unto thee</hi> Mary <hi>thy Wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Mat. 1. 20.</p>
               <p>But again, Though the Holy Ghost was that by which the Child Jesus was formed in the Womb, so as to be without Carnal Generation; yet was he not formed in her without, but by her Conception. <hi>Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy Womb, and bring forth a Son, and shalt call his Name</hi> Jesus, Luk. 1. 31. Wherefore, he took flesh not only IN, but OF the Virgin. Hence he is called HER Son, the SEED of the Woman. And hence it is also that he is called the <hi>Seed</hi> OF <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> OF <hi>David;</hi> THEIR <hi>Seed according to the Flesh,</hi> Luk. 2. 7. Gen. 13. 15. Chap. 12. Chap. 22. Gal. 3. 16. Chap. 4. 4. Rom. 1. 3. Luk. 1. 32. Rom. 9. 5.</p>
               <p>And this the Work he undertook, required.</p>
               <p>1. It required that he should take <hi>our Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It required that he should take our Flesh <hi>without sin,</hi> which could not be, had he taken it by reason of a Carnal Generation; for so, all Children are conceived <hi>in,</hi> and polluted <hi>with</hi> sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. And the least pollution, either of flesh or spirit, had utterly disabled him for the Work, <hi>which to do,</hi> he came down from Heaven. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Such an High-Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from Sinners, and made higher than the Heavens,</hi> Heb. 7. 26.</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:54303:30"/>This Mystery of the Incarnation of the Son of God was thus compleated: I say, That he might be in all points like as we are, <hi>yet without sin;</hi> for sin in the Fesh disableth, and maketh incapable to do the Commandment. Therefore was he thus <hi>made,</hi> thus <hi>made of a Woman:</hi> And this the Angel assigneth as the Reason of this his Marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Incarnation: <hi>The Holy Ghost,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall come upon thee, and the Power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that Holy thing that shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God,</hi> Luk. 2. 35.</p>
               <p>The Overshadowing of the Holy Ghost, and the Power of the Highest; the Father, and the Holy Ghost, brought this Wonderful thing to pass; for Jesus is <hi>a Wonderful One,</hi> in his Conception and Birth. This Mystery is that, next to the Mystery of three Persons in one God. It is a great Mystery. <hi>Great is the Mystery of Godliness; God was manifested in the Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conclusion is, That Jesus Christ <hi>took</hi> our Flesh, that he might be our Saviour; and that he might be our Saviour <hi>indeed,</hi> he THUS took our Flesh.</p>

               <head>That it was necessary that he should take our Flesh, if he will be our Saviour.</head>
               <p>I Come now to the Third Thing, namely, That it was necessary that he should take our Flesh if he will be our Saviour.</p>
               <p>And that first, from <hi>the Nature of the Work;</hi> his Work was to save, to save man, sinking man: man that was going down to the Pit, <hi>Job</hi> 34. 24. Now he that will save him that is sinking, must take hold on him. And since he was not to save a <hi>Man,</hi> but <hi>Men;</hi> therefore it was necessary that he should take hold, not of one Person, but of the Common Nature, clothing himself with <hi>part of the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He took not hold of Angels, but took on him the Seed of</hi> Abraham. For THAT Flesh was the same with the whole Lump of the Children, to whom the Promise was made; and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it the Body of them that shall be saved, even as in <hi>Adam</hi> was comprehended the whole World at first, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Hence we are said to be <hi>chosen in him,</hi> to be gathered, <hi>being in him,</hi> to be dead <hi>by him,</hi> to be risen <hi>with him</hi> and to be <hi>set with him,</hi> or <hi>in him in Heavenly Places already,</hi> I phes. 1. 4, 10. Rom. 7. 4. Col. 3. 1, 2, 3. Chap. 2. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:54303:31"/>This then was the Wisdom of the great God, that the Eternal Son of his Love should take hold of, and so secure the sinking Souls of perishing Sinners by assuming their Flesh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Manner of his doing the Work of a Saviour,</hi> did call for his taking of our Flesh.</p>
               <p>He must do the Work <hi>by dying: Ought not Christ to have suffered? Christ must needs have suffered,</hi> Luk. 24. 26. Acts 17. 3. or else no glory follows. The Prophets testified before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand the Sufferings of Christ, <hi>and the Glory that should follow,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 11. Yea, they did it by the Spirit, even by the Spirit of Christ himself. This Spirit then did bid them tell the World, yea, testify that Christ must suffer, or no man be blest with Glory. For the threatning of death, and the Curse of the Law lay in the Way between Heaven-Gates and the Souls of the Children, for their Sins; wherefore he that will save them, <hi>must answer Divine Justice, or God must lye in saving them without inflicting the Punishment threatned.</hi> Christ then must needs have suffered, the Manner of the Work, laid a necessity upon him to take our Flesh upon him; <hi>he must die,</hi> he must die <hi>for us,</hi> he must die <hi>for our Sins.</hi> And this was effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally foretold by all the Bloody Sacrifices that were offered under the Law; The Blood of Bulls, the Blood of Lambs, the Blood of Rams, the Blood of Calves, and the Blood of Goats and Birds. These Bloody Sacrifices, what did they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54303:31"/>
signifie, what were they figures of, <hi>but of the bloody Sacrifice of the Body of Jesus Christ;</hi> their Blood being a Shadow of his Blood, and their Flesh being a Shadow of his Flesh?</p>
               <p>Therefore when God declared that he took no pleasure in them, because they could not make the Worshippers perfect as pertaining to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; <hi>then comes Jesus Christ</hi> to offer his Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Body and Soul for the Sin of the People: <hi>For it is not possible that the Blood of Bulls and Goats should take away sin: wherefore, when he cometh into the World, he saith, Sacrifices and Offerings thou wouldest not, but a Body hast thou prepared me; in Burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, to, I come, in the Volume of thy Book it is written of me to do thy good Will.</hi> Since Burnt-Offerings cannot do thy Will, my Body shall; since the Blood of Bulls and Goats cannot do thy Will, my Blood shall.</p>
               <p>Then follows, By the Will of God we are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified <hi>through the offering up of the Body of Jesus Christ once for all,</hi> Heb. 10. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The End of the Work</hi> required, That Christ, if he will be our Saviour, should take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him our Flesh.</p>
               <p>The End of our Salvation is, That we might enjoy God, and that he by us might be glorified for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>1. That we might enjoy God. <hi>I will dwell in them, and they shall be my People, and I will be</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:54303:32"/>
                  <hi>their God.</hi> This Indwelling of God, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our Enjoyment of him, begins first in its Eminency, by his Possessing our Flesh in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Jesus Christ. Hence his Name is called <hi>Emmanuel, God with us;</hi> and the Word was made Flesh and dwelt amongst us. The Flesh of Christ, is the Tabernacle which the Lord pitched, according to that saying: <hi>The Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his People, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God,</hi> Revel. 21. 3. Here God beginneth to discover his Glory, and to be desirable to the Sons of Men.</p>
               <p>God could not communicate himself to us, nor take us into the Enjoyment of himself, but with respect to that Flesh which his Son took of the Virgin, because sin stood betwixt. Now this Flesh, <hi>only, was the Holy Lump;</hi> in this Flesh God could dwell, and forasmuch as this Flesh is the same with ours, and was taken up with intent that what was done, in, and by that, should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to all the Children; therefore through that, doth God communicate of himself unto his People. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the World unto himself.</hi> And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>I am the Way,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>no man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Father but by me,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. Joh. 14. 6.</p>
               <p>That Passage to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is greatly to our purpose: <hi>We have boldness, Brethren, to enter into the Holiest, (the place where God is) by the Blood of Jesus, by a new and living Way which he</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:54303:32"/>
                  <hi>hath Consecrated for us through the Vail, that is to say, his Flesh,</hi> Heb. 10. 19, 20. Wherefore by the Flesh and Blood of Christ, we enter into the Holiest; through the Vail, saith he, <hi>that is to say, his Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. As the End of our Salvation, is, <hi>That we might enjoy God:</hi> so also it is that <hi>he</hi> by <hi>us</hi> might be Glorified for ever. <hi>That God in all things might be Glorified through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here indeed will the Mistery of his Grace, Wisdom, Justice, Power, Holiness, and Glory, <hi>inhabit Eternal praise,</hi> while we that are count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy of the Kingdom of God, shall admire at the Mistery, and see our selves, without our selves, even by the Flesh and Blood of Christ (through Faith therein) effectually, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally saved. O! This will be the burden of our Eternal Joy; <hi>God loved us, and gave his Son for us, Christ loved us, and gave his Flesh for our Life,</hi> and his Blood for our Eternal Redemption and Salvation.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>That Christ was made under the Law.</head>
               <p>BUt Secondly, <hi>Christ was made under the Law. When the fulness of the time was come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God sent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law,</hi> Gal. 4. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:54303:33"/>Of right, being found in flesh, he must needs be under the Law, for that there is not any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, above or without Law to God, (but this is not to the point in hand) Christ was not <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> under the Law because he was found in flesh, but he took flesh, and <hi>designedly</hi> put himself, or was made under the Law; wherefore 'tis added, he was made under the Law <hi>to Redeem,</hi> to redeem them that were under the Law. Wherefore here is a design, an Heavenly contrivance, and device on foot. Christ is made, that is, by design, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected under the Law, for the sake, and upon the account of others: <hi>To redeem them that were under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Made under the Law;</hi> that is, put himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Room of Sinners, into the Condition of Sinners; made himself subject to the same pains and penalties we were obnoxious to. We were under the Law, and it had dominion over us, bound us <hi>upon pain of Eternal Damnation</hi> to do compleatly all things written in the Law. This Condition Christ put himself into, <hi>that he might redeem:</hi> for assuredly we had else perished.</p>
               <p>The Law had dominion over us, and since we had sinned, of right it pronounced the Curse, and made all men subject to the Wrath of God. Christ therefore did not only come into our Flesh, <hi>but also into our Condition,</hi> into the Valley and Shadow of Death where we were, and where we are as we are Sinners. He that is under the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54303:33"/>
Law, is under the Edge of the Axe. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was to go visit his Brethren, and to save them from the Hand of <hi>Goliah,</hi> he was to look how his Brethren fared, <hi>and to take their Pledg,</hi> 1. Sam. 17. 18. This is true of Jesus Christ, when he came to save us from the Hand of Death and the Law; he looked how his Brethren fared, took to heart their deplorable Condition, and put himself into the same <hi>Plight,</hi> to wit, <hi>under the Law, that he might redeem them that were under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told you before, that he came sinless into the World, that he had a miraculous Conception, and wonderful Birth: And here you see a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for it, he was to be put, or made under the Law <hi>to redeem.</hi> He that will be made under the Law <hi>to redeem,</hi> had need be sinless, and spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less himself; for the Law findeth fault with the least, and condemneth man for the first beginning of Sin.</p>
               <p>Without this then there could not have been Redemption, nor any the Sons of God by Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; no Redemption, because the Sentence of Death had already past upon all; no Sons by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, because that's the Effect of Redemption. God sent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law to redeem them that were under the Law, <hi>That we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> Christ then by being made under the Law, hath recovered <hi>his</hi> from under the Law, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54303:34"/>
for them the Priviledg of the Adoption of Sons.</p>
               <p>For as I told you before, Christ stood a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Person, presenting in himself the whole Lump of the promised <hi>Seed,</hi> or the <hi>Children</hi> of the Promise; wherefore he comes under the Law <hi>for them,</hi> takes upon him to do what the Law required <hi>of them,</hi> takes upon him to do <hi>it for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He began therefore at the first Tittle of the Law, and going in mans Flesh, for man, through the Law, <hi>He becomes the End of the Law for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, for every one that believeth.</hi> The END of the Law, what is the End of the Law, but perfect and sinless Obedience? that is the End of the Law both with respect to its Nature, and the Cause of its being imposed. God gave the Law, that compleat Righteousness should by that be found upon men, but because sin was got into man's Flesh, therefore this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by us, could not be compleated: Now comes Christ the Lord into the World, clothes himself with the Children's Flesh, addresseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Work of their Redemption, is <hi>made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law;</hi> and going through every part of the Law without Sin, he becometh <hi>the End of the Law</hi> for Justifying Righteousness to every one that believeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. For he obeyed not the Law for himself, he needed no obedience thereto: 'Twas we that needed obedience, 'twas
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54303:34"/>
we that wanted to answer the Law, we wanted it but could not obtain it, because then the Law was weak through the Flesh; therefore God sent his own Son, and he did our duty for us, even to become the End of the Law to every one that believeth: In this therefore Christ laboured for us, he was made under the Law <hi>to redeem.</hi> Therefore, as I said before, It behoved him to be sinless, because the Law binds over to answer for sin at the Bar of the Judgment of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did his God-Head assume our humane Flesh, in a clean and spotless way that he might come under <hi>the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For consisting of two Natures, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality lieing in the God-Head, which gave va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and worth to all things done for us by the Man-hood, the Obedience takes denomination from thence, <hi>to be the Obedience of God.</hi> The Sons Righteousness, the Sons Blood; the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God, the Blood of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8, 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 16.</p>
               <p>Thus Jesus Christ came into the World under the Law to redeem; not simply as God, but God-Man, both natures making one Christ. The God-head therefore did influence and give value to the human Flesh of Christ in all its Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law; else there would have been wanting that Perfection of Righteousness which only could answer the Demands and Expectation
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54303:35"/>
of the Justice of God, to wit, <hi>Perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Second Person in the God-head, the Son, the Word, coming under the Law for men in their Flesh, and subjecting himself by that Flesh to every tittle, and demand of the Law; all, and every whit of what was acted, and done by Jesus Christ God-man for us, <hi>it was, and is the Righteousness of God:</hi> and since it was not done for himself, <hi>but for us</hi> (as he saith in the Text, <hi>to redeem.</hi>) The Righteousness by which we are set free from the Law, is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the Righteousness that alone resideth in the Person of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>And that it is absolutely necessary thus it should be, is evident, both with respect to God, and also with respect to Man.</p>
               <p>1. With respect to God. The Righteousness is demanded by God: therefore he that comes to redeem, must present before God a Righteousness absolutely perfect; this can be done by none but God.</p>
               <p>2. With respect to Man. Man was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this Righteousness to God, therefore must the Undertaker be man. Man for Man, and God for God, God-Man between God and Men. This Days-man can lay his Hand upon us both, and bring God and Man together in peace, <hi>Job.</hi> 9. 33.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But some may say, What need of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54303:35"/>
Righteousness of one that is naturally God? had <hi>Adam</hi> who was but a mean Man stood in his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and done his duty, he had saved himself and all his Posterity.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Had <hi>Adam</hi> stood he had so long secured himself (from the Wages of Sin) and Posterity so long as they were in him. But had <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, yea, although he had not defiled his Nature with filth, he could never after that have redeemed himself from the Curse of the Law; because he was not equal with God: for the Curse of the Law is the Curse of God, but no man can deliver himself from the Curse of God, having first transgressed. This is evident because Angels, for sin, lie bound in Chains, and can never deliver <hi>themselves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He therefore that redeemeth man from under the Law, must, not only do all the good that the Law requireth, but bear all the Penalty that is due by the Law for sin.</p>
                  <p>Should an Angel assume human Flesh, and in that Flesh do the Law, this Righteousness would not redeem a Sinner, it would be but the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of an Angel, and so, far short of such a Righteousness as can secure a Sinner from the Wrath of God. <hi>But thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Soul, with all thy Heart, with all thy Mind, with all thy Strength.</hi> If there was no more required of us, now to redeem our selves, it would be utterly impossible for us to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54303:36"/>
do it, because in the best there is sin, which will intermix it self with every duty of Man. This being so, <hi>all</hi> the Heart, <hi>all</hi> the Soul, <hi>all</hi> the Strength, and <hi>all</hi> the Mind, to the exact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement of the Justice of the Law, can never be found in a Natural Man.</p>
                  <p>Besides, For this Work there is required a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Memory, always to keep in mind the whole Duty of Man, the whole of every tittle of all the Law, <hi>lest sin come in by forgetfulness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. A perfect Knowledg and Judgment, <hi>lest sin come in by ignorance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. An everlasting Unweariedness in all, <hi>lest sin and continual Temptations tire the Soul,</hi> &amp; cause it to fail before the whole be done.</p>
                  <p>For the Accomplishing this last, he must have,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>A Perfect Willingness,</hi> without the least thought to the contrary.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Such an hatred of sin,</hi> as is not to be found, but in the Heart of God.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>A full delight in every Duty,</hi> and that in the midst of all temptations.</item>
                     <item>4. A continuing in all things to the well-pleasing of the Justice of God.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I say, should the penalty of the Law be taken off, should God forgive the Penalty and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to sins that are past, and only demand good works now, according to the Tenour of the Law, no man could be saved: there would not be found that Heart, that Soul, that Mind
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54303:36"/>
and that Strength any-where in the World.</p>
                  <p>This therefore must cease for ever unless the Son of God will put his Shoulder to the Work; but blessed be God he hath done it: <hi>When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that are under the Law.</hi>

               <p>BUt Thirdly, Christ our Saviour takes upon him our Sins. This is another step to the Work of our Redemption. <hi>He hath made him to be sin for us.</hi> Strange Doctrine! a Fool would think it blasphemy, but Truth hath said it. Truth, I say, hath said, not that he <hi>was</hi> made to be sin, but that GOD made him to be sin. <hi>He bath made him to be sin for us,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 21.</p>
               <p>This therefore sheweth us how effectually Christ Jesus undertook the Work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. <hi>He was made to be sin for us.</hi> Sin is the great block and bar to our happiness; sin is the Procurer of all miseries to men both here and for ever. Take away sin, and nothing can hurt us; for death Temporal, death Spiritual, and death Eternal is the Wages of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:54303:37"/>Sin then, and man for Sin, is the Object of the Wrath of God. If the Object of the Wrath of God, then is his Case most dreadful; for who can bear, who can grapple with the Wrath of God! Men cannot, Angels cannot, the whole World cannot. All therefore must sink under sin, but he who is made to be sin for us; he only can bear sins, <hi>he only can bear them away;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were they laid upon him. <hi>The Lord laid upon him the Iniquities of us all,</hi> Isa. 53.</p>
               <p>Mark therefore, and you shall find, that the Reason why God made him to be sin for us, was, <hi>That we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</hi> He took our Flesh, he was made under the Law, and was made to be sin for us; that the Devil might be destroyed, that the Captives might be redeemed, <hi>and made the Righteousness of God in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And forasmuch as he saith, that GOD <hi>hath made him to be sin,</hi> it declareth that the Design of God, and the Mistery of his Will and Grace was in it. <hi>He hath made him to be sin.</hi> God hath done it, that we might be made the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in him: there was no other way, the Wisdom of Heaven could find no other way, we could not by other means stand just before the Justice of God.</p>
               <p>Now what remains, but that we who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by Faith in his Blood, are quit, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and set free from the Law of Sin and</p>

               </p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But how was Jesus Christ made of God to be sin for us?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Even so as if himself had committed all our Sins; that is, they were as really charged upon him, as if himself had been the Actor and Committer of them all. <hi>He hath made him to be sin;</hi> not only as a Sinner, but as Sin it self. He was as the Sin of the World, that Day he stood before God in our steed. Some indeed will not have Jesus Christ our Lord to be made sin for us, their Wicked Reasons think this to be <hi>wrong Judgment in the Lord:</hi> it seems, supposing, that because they cannot imagine how it should be; therefore God, if he does it, <hi>must do it at his Peril,</hi> and must be charged with doing wrong Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so, things that become not his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Majesty: But against this Duncish Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, we set <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Isaiah,</hi> the one telling us still, <hi>The Lord laid on him the Iniquities of us all;</hi> and the other, <hi>That God made him to be sin for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But these Men, as I suppose, think it enough for Christ to <hi>die under that Notion only,</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor feeling the Burden of Sin, and the Wrath of God due thereto. These make him as sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in his Dicing and as much without reason, as a silly Sheep or Goat who also died for Sin, but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54303:38"/>
so as in name, in shew, and shadow only. They felt not the proper Weight, Guilt, and Judgment of God for Sin.</p>
                  <p>But thou, Sinner, who art so in thine own Eyes, and, who feelest guilt in thine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; Know then, that Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God in flesh, was made to be sin for thee, or stood sensibly guilty of all thy Sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and bare them in his own Body upon the Cross.</p>
                  <p>God charged our Sins upon Christ, and that in their guilt and burden; what remaineth, but that the Charge was real or feigned: if real, then he hath either perished under them, or carried them away from before God: if they were charged but feignedly, then did he but feignedly die for them, then shall we have but feigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by his Death, and but a feigned Salvation at last; not to say how this Cursed Doctrine chargeth God and Christ with Hypocrisy, the one in saying He made Christ to be sin, the other in saying He bare our sin; when indeed, and in truth, our guilt and burden never was really upon him.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="question">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But might not Christ die for our Sins, but he needs must bear their Guilt or Burden?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> He that can sever sin, and guilt, sin and the Burden, each from other, laying sin and no guilt, sin and no burden <hi>on the Person that dieth for Sin,</hi> must do it only in his own imaginary
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54303:38"/>
Head. No Scripture, nor Reason, nor Sense, saith, understandeth, or feeleth sin when charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without its guilt and burden.</p>
                  <p>And here we must distinguish between sin charged, and sin forgiven. Sin forgiven, may be seen without guilt or burden, though I think not <hi>without shame</hi> in this World: But sin charged, and that by the Justice of God, for so it was upon Christ; This cannot be, but guilt and the burthen, as inseparable companions, must unavoidably lye on that Person. Poor Sinner, be advised to take heed of such deluded Preachers, who with their Tongues smoother than Oil, would rob thee of that Excellent Doctrine, <hi>God hath made him to be sin for us:</hi> for such, as I said, do not only present thee with a feigned deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and forgiveness, with a feigned Heaven and Happiness, but charge God and the Lord Jesus as meer Impostors, who while they tell us that <hi>Christ was made of God to be sin for us,</hi> affirm, that it was not so REALLY, suggesting this Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Reason, <hi>no wrong Judgment comes from the Lord.</hi> I say again, this Wicked Doctrine is the next way to turn the Gospel in thy thoughts, to no more than a Cunningly-devised Fable, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. and to make Jesus Christ in his dying for our Sins, as brutish as the Paschal-Lamb in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, distressed Sinner, when thou find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est it recorded in the Word of Truth, that Christ
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54303:39"/>
                     <hi>died for our Sins, and that God hath made him to be sin for us:</hi> Then do thou consider of sin as it is a Transgression against the Law of God, and that, as such, it procureth the Judgment of God, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and afflicts the Mind with guilt, and bindeth over the Soul to answer it: sever not sin and guilt asunder, left thou be an Hypocrite like these wicked Men, and rob Christ of his true Sufferings. Besides, to see sin upon Christ but not its guilt, to see sin upon Christ, but not the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Punishment; what is this but to conclude, that either there is no guilt and punishment in sin, or that Christ bare our sin, but we the Punishment? for the Punishment must be born, because the Sentence is gone out from the Mouth of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin.</p>
                  <p>Do thou therefore, as I have said, consider of sin as a Transgression of the Law, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. and a Provoker of the Justice of God, which done, turn thine Eye to the Cross, and behold those Sins, in the Guilt and Punishment of them, stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Flesh of Christ. <hi>God condemned sin in the Flesh of Christ. He bare our Sins IN his own Body on the Tree,</hi> Rom. 8. 3. 1 Pet. 2. 24.</p>
                  <p>I would only give thee this Caution, not sin in the Nature of sin; Sin was not so in the Flesh of Christ, but sin in the Natural Punishment of it, to wit, Guilt, and the Chastising Hand of Justice. <hi>He was wounded for our Transgressions,</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:54303:39"/>
                     <hi>he was bruised for our Iniquities: The Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Peace were upon him, and by his Stripes we are healed,</hi> Isa. 53.</p>
                  <p>Look then upon Christ crucified to be as the sin of the World, as if He only had broken the Law; which done, behold him perfectly innocent in himself, and so conclude, that for the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of God's People he was stricken: That when the Lord made him to be sin, He made him to be sin FOR US.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>He was made a Curse for us,</head>
               <p>FOurthly, As he, was made Flesh under the Law, and also Sin; so he was made a Curse for us. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the Cross of the Law, being made a Curse for us; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a Tree.</hi> This Sentence is taken out of <hi>Moses</hi> being passed there upon them that for Sin are worthy of death. <hi>And if a Man have committed a Sin worthy of death, and thou hang him on a Tree, his Body shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main all night upon the Tree, but thou shalt in any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise bury him that Day, for he that is hanged is accursed of God.</hi> By this Sentence <hi>Paul</hi> conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Jesus Christ was Justly hanged, because sin worthy of Death was upon him. Sin, not of his own but ours. Since then he took our
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54303:40"/>
Sins, he must be cursed of God; for sin is sin where-ever it lies, and justice is justice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it finds it: wherefore since Jesus Christ will bear our Sin, he must be <hi>numbred with the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors,</hi> and counted worthy to die the Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that committeth sin is worthy of death:</hi> This, though Christ did not personally do, his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, his Body, which is his Church, did: and since he would undertake for them with God, and stand in their Sins before the Eyes of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; He must die the Death by the Law.</p>
               <p>Sin and the Curse cannot be severed. Sin must be followed with the Curse of God: Sin therefore being removed from us to the Back of Christ, thither goes also the Curse; for if sin be found upon him, he is the Person worthy to die, worthy <hi>by our Sins.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> here set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth Christ clothed with our Sins; and so taking from us the Guilt and Punishment. What punishment, but the Wrath and Displeasure of God. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this word [Curse] are two things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized.</p>
               <p>1. The Reality of Sin, for there can be no Curse where there is no Sin; either of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons own, or made to be his by his own Consent or the Imputation of Divine Justice. And since Sins are made to be Christ's by Imputation, they are his, though not <hi>naturally,</hi> yet <hi>really,</hi> and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54303:40"/>
consequently the Wages due: He hath made him to be sin; he was made a Curse for us.</p>
               <p>2. This word Curse comprizeth therefore the Punishment of Sin, that Punishment properly due to sin from the Hand of God's Justice, which punishment standeth in three things.</p>
               <p>1. In charging sin upon the Body and Soul of the Person concerned: and hence we read that both the Body and Soul of Christ, <hi>were made an Offering for Sin,</hi> Isa. 53. 10. Heb. 10. 10.</p>
               <p>2. The Punishment standeth in Gods inflicting of the Just merits of sin upon him that standeth charged therewith, and that is Death in its own nature and strength; to wit, Death with the Sting thereof: <hi>The Sting of Death is sin.</hi> This Death did Christ die, because he died for our Sins.</p>
               <p>3. The Sorrows and Pains of this Death there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be under-gone by Jesus Christ. Now there are divers Sorrows in Death.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Such Sorrows as Brutes are subject to.</item>
                  <item>2. Such Sorrows as Persons are subjects to, that stand in sin before God.</item>
                  <item>3. Such Sorrows as those undergo who are swallowed up of the Curse and Wrath of God for ever.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now so much of all kind of Sorrow as the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our Sin, could justly bring from the Hand of Divine Justice, so much of it he had.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. He had Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:54303:41"/>2. He had the Sting of Death, which is Sin.</p>
               <p>3. He was forsaken of God, but could not by any means have those Sorrows which they have that are everlastingly swallowed up of them. <hi>It was not possible that he should be holden of it,</hi> Act. 2. 24.</p>
               <p>For where Sin is charged and born, there must of necessity follow the Wrath and Curse of God: Now where the Wrath and Curse of God is, there must of necessity follow the Effects, the <hi>Natural Effects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say, the <hi>Natural Effects:</hi> to wit, the Sence, the Sorrowful Sence of the Displeasure of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majesty, and his Chastisements for the Sin that hath provoked him.</p>
               <p>There are Effects <hi>natural,</hi> and Effects <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental;</hi> those Accidental, are such as flow from our weakness, whilst we wrestle with the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; to wit, hellish fear, despair, rage, blasphemy, and the like: These were not inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Jesus Christ, he being in his own Person every way perfect. Neither did he alwayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Natural Effects; his Merits relieved, and delivered him. God loosed the Pains of death, <hi>because it was not possible he should be holden of it,</hi> Acts 2. 24.</p>
               <p>Christ then was made a Curse for us, for he did bear our sin; the Punishment therefore, from the Revenging Hand of God must needs fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54303:41"/>Wherefore, <hi>by these four things,</hi> we see how Christ became our Saviour, he took hold of our Nature, was born under the Law, was made to be sin, and the Accursed of God for us. And observe it; all this, as I said before, was the Handy-Work of God. <hi>God made him Flesh, made him under the Law, God made him to be Sin, and also a Curse for us.</hi> The Lord bruised him, the Lord put him to grief, the Lord made his Soul an Offering for Sin, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. Not for that he hated him, considering him in his own harmless, innocent, and blessed Person; for he was daily hid Delight; but by an act of grace to usward, were our Iniquities laid upon him, and he in our stead, bruised and chastised for them. God loved us, <hi>and made him a Curse for us.</hi> He was made a Curse for us, <hi>That the Blessing of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>might come on the Gentiles, through Faith in Jesus Christ,</hi> Gal. 3. 13, 14, 15.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Further Demonstration of this Truth.</head>
               <p>BEfore I pass <hi>this Truth,</hi> I will present thee (Courteous Reader) with two or three De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations for its further confirmation.</p>
               <p>First, That Christ did bear our Sin and Curse, is clear <hi>because he died,</hi> and that without a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:54303:42"/>1. He died, <hi>Death is the Wages of Sin,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. Now if death be the Wages of sin, and that be true, <hi>that Christ did die and not sin,</hi> either the Course of Justice is perverted, or else he died for our Sins; <hi>there was no cause of death in him,</hi> yet he died <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 28. He did no Evil, Guile was not found in his Mouth, yet he received the Wages of Sin. Sin therefore, though not of his own, was found upon him, and laid to his Charge, <hi>because he died. Christ died for our Sins, Christ gave himself for our Sins,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 1, 2, 3. Gal. 1. 4. 1 Pet. 2. 22.</p>
               <p>He then that will conclude that Christ did not bear our Sin, chargeth God foolishly, for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering him up to death: for laying on him the Wages, when in no sence he deserved the same. Yea he overthroweth the whole Gospel, for that hangeth on THIS hinge; <hi>Christ died for our Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="objection">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But all that die, do not bear the Curse of God for Sin.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But all that die without a Mediator do: Angels died the Cursed Death, because Christ took not hold of them; and they for whom Christ never prayeth, they die the Cursed Death, for they perish everlastingly in the unutterable Torments of Hell. <hi>Christ too died,</hi> that Death which is the Proper Wages of Sin, for he had none to stand for him. <hi>I looked,</hi> saith he, <hi>and there was none to help, and I wondred that there was</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:54303:42"/>
                     <hi>none to uphold: therefore mine own Arm brought Salvation unto me. And he saw that there was no man: and he wondered that there was no Intercessor, therefore his Arm brought Salvation unto him, and his Righteousness sustained him,</hi> Isa. 63. 5. Isa. 59. 16.</p>
                  <p>Christ then died, or endured the Wages of Sin, and that without an Intercessor, without one between God and he: He grappled immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly with the Eternal Justice of God, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him <hi>Death,</hi> the Wages of Sin: there was no man to hold off the Hand of God; Justice had his full blow at him, and made him a Curse for Sin. He died for sin without a Mediator, he died the Cursed Death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A Second thing that Demonstrateth that Christ died the Cursed Death for Sin: <hi>It is the Frame of Spirit that he was in at the time that he was to be taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never was poor mortal so beset with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of approaching death as was this Lord Jesus Christ; <hi>Amazement beyond measu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, Sorrow that exceeded</hi> seized upon his Soul. <hi>My Soul,</hi> saith he, <hi>is exceeding sorrowful even unto Death. And he began,</hi> saith Mark, <hi>to be sore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, and to be very heavy,</hi> Mat. 26. 38. Mar. 14. 33.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, That Jesus Christ was better able to grapple with death, even better able to do it alone, than the whole World joyn'd altogether.</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54303:43"/>
                     <item>1. He was anointed with the Spirit without Measure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34.</item>
                     <item>2. He had all Grace perfect in him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 16.</item>
                     <item>3. Never none so soaked in the Bosom of his Fathers Love as himself, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 23, 30.</item>
                     <item>4. Never none so harmless, and without sin as he, and consequently never man had so good a Conscience as he, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26.</item>
                     <item>5. Never none prepared such a stock of good Works to bear him company at the Hour of Death as he.</item>
                     <item>6. Never none had greater assurance of being with the Father Eternally in the Heavens than he. And yet behold, when HE comes to die, how weak is he, how amazed at death, how heavy, how exceeding sorrowful; and I say, no cause assigned but the Approach of Death.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Alas! How often is it seen, that we Poor Sinners can laugh at destruction when it cometh: yea, <hi>and rejoice exceedingly when we find the Grave,</hi> Job. 3. 22. looking upon death as a part of our Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yea, as that which will be a means of our present relief and help, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                  <p>This Jesus Christ couldnot do, considered as dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Sin, but the nearer death, the more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, &amp; oppressed with the thoughts of the Reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand of God. Wherefore he falls into an Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Sweats; not after the common rate, as we do when death is severing Body and Soul. <hi>His</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:54303:43"/>
                     <hi>Sweat was as it were great drops</hi> (Clodders) <hi>of Blood, falling down to the Ground,</hi> Luk. 22. 44.</p>
                  <p>What, I say, should be the Reason, but that <hi>death assaulted him with his Sting.</hi> If Jesus Christ had been to die for his Vertues only, doubtless he would have born it lightly, and so he did as he died, bearing witness to the Truth, <hi>He endured the Cross, and despised the Shame,</hi> Heb. 12. 1, 2, How have the Martyrs despised death, and as it were, not been careful of that, having peace with God by Jesus Christ, scorning the most Cruel Torments that Hell and Men could devise and invent; but Jesus Christ could not do so, <hi>as he was a Sacrifice for sin,</hi> he died for sin, he was made a Curse for us. O my Brethren, Christ died many deaths at once, he made his Grave with the Wicked, <hi>and with the Rich in his Deaths.</hi> Look how many thousands shall be saved, so many deaths did Jesus die; yet it was but once he died. He died thy death, and my death, and so many deaths as all our Sins deserved, who shall be saved from the Wrath to come.</p>
                  <p>Now to feign that these Sorrows, and this Bloody Agony was not real, but in shew only; What greater Condemnation can be passed upon Jesus Christ, who loved to do all things in the most feigned Simplicity? It was therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of sin; the Sin that was put into the Death he died, and the Curse of God that was due to Sin; That, That made death so bitter to Jesus
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54303:44"/>
Christ; <hi>'tis Christ that died.</hi> The Apostle speaks as if never any died but Christ, nor indeed did there, <hi>so wonderful a Death as he,</hi> Rom. 8. Death considered simply, as it is a deprivation of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life could not have these Effects in a Person, personally more Righteous than an Angel. Yea, even Carnal Wicked Men not awakened in their Conscience how securely can they die. It must therefore also be concluded, that <hi>the Sorrows, and Agony of Jesus Christ came from a higher cause,</hi> even from the Guilt of sin, and from the Curse of God that was now approaching for that Sin.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be attributed to the Fear of Men, their Terrour could not make him afraid; that was contrary to his Doctrine, and did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Dignity of his Person; it was sin, sin, sin, and the Curse due to sin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is evident that Christ did bear and die the Cursed Death for sin; <hi>from the Carriage and Dispensation of God towards him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, from the Carriage of God. God now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as an Enemy to him.</p>
                  <p>1. He forsakes him. <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Yea, the Sence of the Loss of God's comfortable Presence abode with him even till he gave up the Ghost.</p>
                  <p>2. He dealeth with him as with one that hath sinned, he chastiseth him, he bruiseth him, he striketh and smiteth him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. and was pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54303:44"/>
that is, his Justice was satisfied, in so doing. <hi>It pleased the Lord to bruise him, he hath put him to grief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things could not he, had he only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered him in his own Personal standing, (<hi>where was the Righteous forsaken.</hi>) Without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of Sin, he doth not willingly afflict, nor grieve the Children of Men; that is, not out of pleasure, or without sufficient cause.</p>
                  <p>Jesus Christ then, since he is under this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, chastising, bruising, and afflicting Displeasure of God, he is all that time under sin, under our sins, and therefore thus accursed of God, his God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Not only the Carriage of God, but his Dispensations, his visible Dispensations, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare that he stood before God in our Sins, <hi>Vengeance suffered him not to live.</hi> Wherefore God delivered him up. <hi>He spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,</hi> Rom. 8. 32.</p>

                  <p>Now he is sent to the Governor, defaced with Blows and Blood; who delivereth him into the Hand of his Souldiers; they Whip him, Crown him with Thorns, and stick the Points of the Thorns fast in his Temples, by a Blow with a Staff in their Hand: Now is he made a Spectacle to the People, and then sent away to <hi>Herod,</hi> who with his Men of War set him at naught; no God appearing for his Help.</p>
                  <p>In fine, they at last condemn him to Death, <hi>even to the Death of the Cross,</hi> where they hang him up by Wounds made through his Hands and his Feet, between the Earth and the Heavens, where he hanged for the space of Six Hours, to wit, from Nine in the Morning, till Three in the Afternoon.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54303:45"/>
No God yet appears for his help, while he hangs there; some rail at him, others wagg their Heads, others tauntingly say, <hi>He saved others, himself he cannot save;</hi> some divide his Raiment, casting lots for his Garments before his Face, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mockingly bid him come down from the Cross, and when he desireth succour, they give him Vinegar to drink. <hi>No God yet appears for his help.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Earth quakes, the Rocks are rent, the Sun becomes black, and Jesus still cries out that he was forsaken of God; and presently bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Head and dies: read <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Chap.</hi> 27. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. <hi>John</hi> 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>And for all this there is no cause assigned from God, <hi>but Sin. He was wounded for our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, he was bruised for our Iniquities, and the chastisement of our Peace was upon him, and by his Stripes we are healed,</hi> Isa. 53.</p>
                  <p>The Sum then is, That Jesus Christ the Lord by taking part of our Flesh, became a Publick Person, not doing, nor dying in a private Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, but in the room and stead of Sinners, whose Sin deserved Death and the Curse of God: all which Jesus Christ bare in his own Body upon the Tree. I conclude then, that my Sin is already crucified, and accursed in the Death and Curse Christ under-went.</p>

            <div type="objections">
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:54303:46"/>
               <head>I come now to some Objections.</head>
               <div n="1" type="objection">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Objection First.</hi> CHrist never was a Sinner, God never supposed him to be a Sinner, neither did our Sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come really his, God never reputed him so to have been; therefore hate or punish him as a Sinner he could not; for no false judgment can belong to the Lord.</head>
                  <p>1. <hi>Ans.</hi> That Christ was not a Sinner <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> by acts, or doings of his own, is granted, and in this sense 'tis true, that God did never suppose him to be a Sinner, nor punished him as such a Sinner, nor did he really (if by really you understand naturally) become our Sin, nor did God ever repute him so.</p>
                  <p>2. But that Christ stood before God in <hi>our</hi> Sins, and that God did not only suppose him so to stand, but set him in them, put them upon him, and count them as his own, is so true, that he cannot at present be a Christian that denies it. <hi>The Lord hath laid upon him the Iniquities of us all,</hi> Isa. 53. 1 Pet. 2. 22.</p>
                  <p>3. So then, though God did not punish him for sin of his own committing, yet he punished him for sin of our committing. <hi>The Just suffered for the unjust,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:54303:46"/>4. Therefore it is true, That though Christ did never really become sin of his own, he did really become our Sin, did really become our Curse for sin: If this be denyed, it follows that he became our Sin <hi>but feignedly,</hi> that he was made our Curse, or a Curse for us, <hi>but in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> shew, or in dissimulation; but no such action or work can proceed of the Lord. He did then really lay our Sin, and his Curse upon him for our Sin.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="objection">
                  <head>
                     <hi>2. Object.</hi> But if Christ indeed hath suffered for our Sins, and endured for them that Curse, that of justice is due thereto: then hath he also endured for us the proper torments of Hell, for they are the Wages of our Sins.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Many things might be said in answer to this Objection. But briefly;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What God chargeth upon the Soul for sin, is one thing, and what followeth upon that Charge, is another.</item>
                     <item>2. A difference in the Person suffering, may make a difference in the Consequences that follow upon the Charge.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Let us then consider of both these things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Charge is <hi>Sin,</hi> God charged him with our Sins.</item>
                     <item>2. the Person then stands guilty before the Judgment of God.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The Consequences are:</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:54303:47"/>
                     <item>1. The Person charged sustains, or suffereth the Wrath of God.</item>
                     <item>2. This Wrath of God is expressed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, on Body and Soul.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The Consequences are:</p>
                  <p>1. God forsaketh the Person charged, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left, if he cannot stand, he falleth under the Power of guilt and horror of the same.</p>
                  <p>If the Person utterly fall under this Charge, as not being able to wrestle with, and overcome this Wrath of God, then despair, horror of Hell, rage, blasphemy, darkness, and damnable anguish immediately swallow him up, and he lieth for ever and ever in the Pains of Hell, a Monument of Eternal Vengeance.</p>
                  <p>Now that Christ under-went the Wrath of God 'tis evident, because he bare our Curse; That God forsook him, he did with strong crying and tears acknowledg; and therefore that he was under the Soul-afflicting sence of the loss of God's Favor, and under the sence of his Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure must needs flow from the Premises.</p>
                  <p>But now, because Christ Jesus the Lord, was a Person infinitly differing from all others that fall under the Wrath of God: therefore those things that flow from damned Sinners, could not flow from him.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Despair could not rise in his Heart, for his Flesh did rest in hope;</hi> and said even when he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell,</hi> Acts 2. 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54303:47"/>2. The Everlastingness of the Punishment therefore, nor the Terrors that accompany such, could not fasten upon him; for he knew at last that God would Justifie him, or approve of his Works that they were Meritorious.</p>
                  <p>And mark, Everlasting Punishment is not the proper Wages of sin, but under a supposition that the Person suffering be not able to pay the Debt. <hi>Thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last Mite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The difference then of the Persons suffering may make a difference, though not in the Nature of the Punishment; yet in the Duration, and Consequences of it.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Christ under the Sentence, was as to his own Personal Acts only, altogether innocent; the Damned, only altogether Sinners.</item>
                     <item>2. Christ had in him, even then the utmost Perfection of all graces and vertues; but the Damned, the Perfection of Sin and Vileness.</item>
                     <item>3. Christ's Humanity had still Union with his God-head; the Damned, Union only with Sin.</item>
                     <item>4. Now an Innocent Person, perfect in all graces, as really God, as Man, can better wrestle with the Curse for sin, than either sinful Men or Angels.</item>
                  </list>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. While they despair, Christ hopes.</item>
                     <item>2. While they blaspheme, Christ submits.</item>
                     <item>3. While they rage, Christ justifies God.</item>
                     <item>4. While they sink under the burden of Sin
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54303:48"/>
and Wrath, Christ recovereth by vertue of his Worthiness. Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, <hi>neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy one to see cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi> He was Gods Holy one, and his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness prevailed.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>So that it follows not, That because Christ did undergo the Curse due to our Sins, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must have those accidental Consequences which are found to accompany damned Souls.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="objection">
                  <head>
                     <hi>3. Object.</hi> But the Scripture saith, That the Wages of Sin is everlasting punishment. <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Mat. 25.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This Objection is partly answered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, in the Answer to that fore-going. But further;</p>
                  <p>1. Consider, The Wages of Sin is Death, and punishment under the Wrath of God. <hi>Till those that die the Death for Sin, have paid the utmost Farthing,</hi> Mat. 5. 25. Luk. 12. 58, 59.</p>
                  <p>2. So then the everlastingness of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lieth here; If the Person suffering be not able to make amends to justice for the Sins for which he suffereth; else justice neither would, nor could, <hi>because 'tis just,</hi> keep such still under punishment.</p>
                  <p>3. The Reason then why fallen Angels, and damned Souls have an everlastingness of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment allotted them, is because, by what they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: <hi>they cannot satisfy the Justice of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:54303:48"/>4. The Conclusion then is, though the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of God for Sin by death and punishment after, be the Rebukes of Eternal Vengeance; yet the Eternity of that Punishment, is for want of merit: could the Damned merit their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, <hi>Justice would let them go.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. It is one thing therefore to suffer for sin, by the stroke of Eternal Justice, and another thing to abide for ever a Sufferer there: Christ did the First, the Damned do the Second.</p>
                  <p>6. His Rising therefore from the Dead the third Day doth nothing invalid his Sufferings, but rather sheweth the Power of his Merit. And here I would ask a Question, Had Christ Jesus been more the Object of Faith, if weakness and endless infirmity had kept him under the Curse, than by rising again from the Dead, want of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit causing the one, sufficience thereof causing the other?</p>
                  <p>7. If men will not believe that Christ hath remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Curse, because he is risen again; they would much more strongly have doubted it, had he been still in the Grave. But O amazing darkness! to make that an Argument, that his Sufferings wanted merit, which to God himself is sufficient proof that he hath purged our Sins for ever. <hi>For this Man after he had offered up one sacrifice for Sins for ever, sat down on the Right Hand of God,</hi> Heb. 10. 12.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="objection">

                  <head>
                     <hi>4. Object.</hi> But the Scripture saith, Christ is our Example and that in his very death, <hi>1 Pet. 2. 21.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Christ in his Sufferings, and Death, is <hi>both Sacrifice and Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. A Sacrifice. <hi>Christ our Passeover is Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for us.</hi> And again, <hi>He gave himself for us, an Offering, and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet-smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Savor.</hi> And thus he made Reconciliation for Iniquity, and brought in Everlasting Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 1, 2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 2.</p>
                  <p>2dly. He was also in his Sufferings <hi>Exemplary,</hi> and that in several particulars.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In his meek Deportment, while he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 7.</item>
                     <item>2. In doing them good that sought his Life, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 50, 51.</item>
                     <item>3. In his Praying for his Enemies, when they were in their Out-rage, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 34.</item>
                     <item>4. <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he suffered he threatned not, but committed himself to him that judgeth Righteously,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 23.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>In these respects, I say, <hi>he was Exemplary,</hi> and brought honour to his Profession by his good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour: And O how beautiful would Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be in the Eyes of Men, if the Disciples of our Lord would more imitate him therein!</p>
                  <p>But what? Because Christ is our <hi>Pattern,</hi> is he not our <hi>Passeover?</hi> or, because we should in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54303:49"/>
                     <hi>these</hi> things follow his Steps, <hi>died</hi> he not for our Sins? Thus to conclude, would not only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thee very erroneous, but such a Conclusion would overthrow the Gospel; it being none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but a great flight of Satan, to shut out the whole by a Part, and to make us Blasphemers, while we plead for Holiness.</p>
                  <p>Look then upon the Death of Christ under a double Consideration.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. As he suffered from the Hand of God.</item>
                     <item>2. As he suffered from the Hand of Men.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Now as he suffered by God's Hand, so he suffered for sin; but as he suffered from Men, so he suffered for righteousness sake.</p>
                  <p>Observe then, That as he suffered for sin, so no <hi>MAN</hi> took away his Life; but as he suffered for righteousness, so THEY slew him by wicked hands: What is it then? Christ must needs have suffered, and the Wisdom of God had so ordained. <hi>That those things which God before had shewed by the Mouth of all his Prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled,</hi> Acts 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>Thus therefore we ought to distinguish of the Causes, and Ends of the Death of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Again, As Christ suffered for sin, so he would neither be taken at mans pleasure, nor die at mans time.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Not at mans pleasure,</hi> and hence it was that they so often sought his Life in vain, <hi>for his Hour was not yet come;</hi> to wit, the Hour in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54303:50"/>
which he was to be made a Sacrifice for our Sin, <hi>John</hi> 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 1, 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Not at their Time;</hi> but contrary to all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, when the <hi>due</hi> time was come, he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Head and gave up the Ghost, <hi>John</hi> 19. 30.</p>
                  <p>And for this last work he had power given him of God, that is, power to die when he would. <hi>I have power,</hi> said he, <hi>to lay down my Life, and I have power to take it again;</hi> This Power never man had before. This made the Centurion wonder, and made <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel: And indeed well they might, for it was as great a Miracle as any he wrought in his Life. It demonstrated him to be the Son of God, <hi>Mar.</hi> 15. 38, 39. The Centurion knowing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature he might have lived longer, concluded therefore that his dying at that instant was not, but miraculously. And when <hi>he saw that he so cried out, and gave up the Ghost,</hi> he said, <hi>Truly this Man was the Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Reason why he had power to die, was, That he might offer his Offering willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and at the Season.</p>
                  <p>1. Willingly. <hi>If his Offering be a Burnt-Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Lord, let him offer a Male without blemish, he shall offer it of his own voluntary Will, at the Door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,</hi> Levit. 1. 3.</p>
                  <p>2. He must offer it at the Season. <hi>Thou shalt</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:54303:50"/>
                     <hi>keep this Ordinance</hi> (the Passeover) <hi>in his Season,</hi> Exod. 13. 10.</p>
                  <p>Now both these Offerings having immediate respect to the Offering of the Body of Christ for sin (for he came in the room of all burnt-Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,) the Passeover also was a Type of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 3, 4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7, 8. Therefore, he being now the Priest as well as Sacrifice, must have Power and Will to offer his Sacrifice with acceptation; and this the Scripture testifieth he did where it saith, <hi>In due time Christ died for the Ungodly,</hi> Rom. 5. 8, 9. In due time, that is at the time appointed, at the acceptable time.</p>
                  <p>Thou must therefore, unless thou art willing to be deceived, look upon the Sufferings of Christ, under a double Consideration, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between his Sufferings <hi>as our Example,</hi> and his Suffering <hi>for our Sins.</hi> And know, that as he suffered <hi>as our Example,</hi> so he suffered <hi>only</hi> for righteousness sake from the Hands of wicked Men; but as he suffered <hi>for our Sins,</hi> so he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered (as being by God reputed wicked) the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment that was due to sin even the dreadful Curse of God: Not that Christ died two deaths one after another, but he died at the same time upon a double account; for his Righteousness sake from Men; for our sins, from the Hand of God. And, as I said before, had he only suffered for righteousness sake, death had not so amazed him, nor had he been so exceeding heavy in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54303:51"/>
Thoughts of it; that had never put him into an Agony, nor made him Sweat, as it were, great drops of Blood. Besides, When men suffer only for righteousness sake, God doth not use to hide his Face from them, to forsake them, and make them accursed; But <hi>Christ hath delivered us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.</hi>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> But if indeed Christ hath paid the full price for us by his Death, in suffering the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we should have done: wherefore is the Scripture so silent, as not to declare, that by his Death he hath made satisfaction?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> No Man may teach God Knowledg, he knoweth best how to deliver his Mind in such words and terms as best agree with his Eternal Wisdom, and the Consciences of these that are truly desirous of Salvation, being over-burdened with the guilt of Sin. Perhaps the Word <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> will hardly be found in the Bible; and where is it said in so many words, <hi>God is dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with our Sins?</hi> Yet 'tis sufficiently manifest, that there is nothing that God hateth but sin, and Sinners for the Sake of sin. What meant he by turning <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradise, by drowning the Old World, by burning up <hi>Sodom</hi> with Fire and Brimstone from Heaven? What meant he by drowning of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> by causing the Ground to swallow up <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company, and by his destroying <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness, if not to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54303:51"/>
shew that he was dissatisfied with Sin? That God is also satisfied, yea, more than satisfied by Christ's Sufferings for our Sins, <hi>is apparent:</hi> For granting that he died for them, as these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures declare, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 18. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>1. It is apparent, because it is said; <hi>That God smelled in that Offering of the Body of Christ for our Sins, a Sweet-smelling Savor. He gave himself for us an Offering, and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling Savor,</hi> Ephes. 5. 2.</p>
                  <p>2. It is apparent, because it is said expresly, <hi>That God for Christ's Sake</hi> doth now forgive. <hi>Be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's Sake bath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you,</hi> Ephes. 4. 32.</p>
                  <p>3. It is apparent that God is satisfied with Christ's Blood for our Sins, because he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he can justifie those that believe in, or rely upon that Blood for Life, in a way of Justice and Righteousness. <hi>Being justified freely by his Grace through the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ; whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation through faith in his Blood, to declare his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness for the Remission of sins, that are past through the forbearance of God. To declare, I say, at this time his Righteousness, that he might be just, and</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:54303:52"/>
                     <hi>the Justifier of him that believeth in Jesus,</hi> Rom. 3. 24, 25, 26.</p>
                  <p>Now, I say, to object against such plain Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, what is it, but</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To deny that Christ died for Sin; or to conclude,</item>
                     <item>2. That having so done, he is still in the Grave: Or,</item>
                     <item>3. That there is no such thing as Sin: Or,</item>
                     <item>4. No such thing as Revenging Justice in God against it: Or,</item>
                     <item>5. That we must die our selves for our Sins: Or,</item>
                     <item>6. That sin may be pardoned without a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: Or,</item>
                     <item>7. That every man may merit his own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>But without shedding of Blood there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22.</p>
                  <p>To avoid therefore these cursed Absurdities, it must be granted that Jesus Christ by his Death did make satisfaction for sin.</p>
                  <p>But the word <hi>Satisfaction</hi> may not be used by the Holy Ghost, perhaps, for that it is too short and scanty a Word to express the Blessedness that comes to Sinners by the Blood of Christ.</p>
                  <p>1. To make satisfaction amounts to no more than compleatly to answer a legal Demand for harms and injuries done. Now this when done to the full, leaveth the Offender there where he was
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54303:52"/>
before he committed the Injury. Now if Christ had done no more than this, he had only paid our debt, <hi>but had not obtained eternal redemption for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. For a full Satisfaction given by this Man for harms done by another, may neither obtain the Love of the Person offended, nor the smallest Gift which the Person <hi>offending</hi> hath not deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Suppose I owe to this Man ten thousand Talents, and another should pay him every Farthing, there remaineth over and above, by that compleat Satisfaction, not one single half-Penny for me. Christ hath therefore done more than to make satisfaction for sin by his Blood. <hi>He hath also made us Kings and Priests to God and his Father, and we shall reign with him for ever and ever,</hi> Revel. 1. 5, 6. Chap. 22. 5.</p>
                  <p>But take a few more Scriptures for the Proof of the Doctrine before asserted.</p>

                  <p>Now if we be redeemed, washed, purged, made nigh to God, have peace with God, if we stand just before God, are saved, reconciled, sanctified, admitted into the Holiest; if we have eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by his Blood, and if his Blood will be the burden of our Song for ever: then hath Christ paid the full price for us by his Death; then hath he done more than made satisfaction for our Sins.</p>

               <p>ANd First, I begin with his Resurrection: THAT God that delivered him up unto death, and that made him a Curse for Sin; THAT God raised him up from the dead. <hi>But God raised him from the Dead,</hi> Act. 3. 15. Chap. 13. 30.

upon the <hi>Tree,</hi> (for he had them in his Body on the Tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24.) he had left him there as he left him upon the Tree: yea, he had as surely <hi>rotted</hi> in the Grave, as ever he <hi>died</hi> on the Tree. But when he visited Christ in the Grave, he found him <hi>a Holy, Harmless, Undefiled, and Spotless Christ,</hi> and therefore he raised him up from the Dead. <hi>He raised him up from the dead, having loosed the Pains of Death; because it was not possible that he should be helden of it,</hi> Act. 2. 24.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 'Tis said he TOOK them away: <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the World;</hi> 'Tis said he PUT them away. <hi>Now once in the End of the World hath he appeared to put away sin by the Sacrifice of himself,</hi> Joh. 1. 29. Heb. 9. 26.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54303:55"/>
That is, by the <hi>Merit</hi> of his undertaking he brought into the World, and set before the Face of God <hi>such</hi> a Righteousness, that out-weigheth, and goeth far beyond that Sin; and so did hide sin from the Sight of God: Hence, he that is justified, is said, to have his Sins HID, and covered. <hi>Blessed is the Man whose Transgressions are forgiven, and whose Sin is covered,</hi> Rom. 4. 7. covered with the Righteousness of Christ. <hi>I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy Nakedness,</hi> thy Sins, Ezek. 16. 8. Christ Jesus therefore, having by the Infiniteness of his Merit, taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, put away, or hidden our Sins from the Face of God; therefore he raised him up from the Dead.</p>
                  <p>You find in that 16th of <hi>Leviticus</hi> mention made of two Goats, one was to be <hi>slain</hi> for a Sin-Offering, the other to be left <hi>alive:</hi> The Goat that was <hi>slain,</hi> was a Type of Christ in his Death, the Goat that was not <hi>slain,</hi> was a Type of Christ in his Merit. Now this living Goat, HE car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the Sins of the People into the Land of forgetfulness. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>shall lay both his Hands upon the head of the Live-Goat, and confess over him all the Iniquities of the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>and all their Transgressions, in all their Sins, putting them upon the Head of the Goat, and shall send him away by the Hands of a fit Man into the Wilderness, and the Goat shall bear upon him all their Iniquities unto a Land not inhabited,</hi> Levit. 16. Thus did Jesus Christ
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54303:55"/>
bear away by the Merit of his Death, the Sins and Iniquities of them that Believe; wherefore, when God came to him in the Grave, he found him, Holy and Undefiled, and <hi>raised him up from the Dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And observe it, As his Death was for our Sin, so his Rising again was for our Discharge: for both in his Death and Resurrection he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respected our Benefits; <hi>he died for us,</hi> he rose from the Dead for us. <hi>He was delivered for our Offences, and was raised again for our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Rom 4. 25. By his Death he carried away our Sins, by his Rising, he brought to us Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Righteousness.</p>
                  <p>There are five Circumstances also attending his Resurrection, that shew us how well-pleased God was with his Death.</p>
                  <p>1. It must be solemnized with the Company, Attendance and Testimony of Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>John</hi> 20. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>2dly. At, or just upon his Resurrection, the Graves, where many of the Saints, for whom he died, lay asleep, did open, and they followed their Lord in full Triumph over Death. <hi>The Graves were opened, and many Bodies of Saints which slept arose, and came out of their Graves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Resurrection, and went into the Holy City, and appeared unto many,</hi> Mat. 27. 52.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:54303:56"/>These Saints coming out of their Graves after him; what a Testimony is it, that he, for them, had taken away Sin, and destroyed him that had the Power of Death: yea, what a Testimony was it that he had made amends to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who granted him at his Resurrection, to have presently out of the Grave, <hi>Of the Price of his Blood, even the Body of many of the Saints which slept. He was declared to be the Son of God with Power by the Spirit of Holiness, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the Dead,</hi> Rom. 1. 4. It saith not, by <hi>his</hi> Resurrection, though that be true; But by <hi>the Resurrection,</hi> meaning the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bodies of the Saints which slept, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they rose by vertue of his Blood; and by that he was with power declared to be the Son of God. They I say, were part of his Purchase, some of them for whom Christ died: Now for God to raise them, and that upon, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Resurrection; what is it, but an open Declaration from Heaven, that Christ by his Death hath made amends for us, and obtained Eternal Redemption for us?</p>
                  <p>3thly. When he was risen from the Dead, God, to confirm his Disciples in the Faith of the Redemption that Christ had obtained by his Blood, <hi>brings him to the Church,</hi> presents him to them alive, shews him <hi>openly,</hi> sometimes to two or three, sometimes to eleven or twelve, and once to above five hundred Brethren at once, <hi>Acts</hi>

Hell and Death are the Effects and Fruits of Sin. <hi>The Wicked shall be turned into Hell,</hi> and the Wages of Sin is Death. But what then are Sinners the better for the Death and Blood of Christ? O! They that dare venture upon him are much the better, for they shall not perish unless the Saviour will damn them; for he hath the Keys of Hell and of Death. <hi>Fear not, saith he, I am the First and the Last, I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and have the Keys of Hell and Death.</hi> These were given him at his Resurrection; as if God had said, My Son thou hast spilt thy Blood for Sinners, I am pleased with it, I am delighted in thy Merits, &amp; in the Redemption which thou hast wrought; in token hereof, I give thee the Keys of Hell and of Death: I give thee all Power in Heaven and Earth, save who thou wilt, deliver who thou wilt, bring to Heaven who thou wilt.</p>
                  <p>5thly. At Christ's Resurrection, <hi>God bids him ask the Heathen of him, with a Promise to give him the uttermost parts of the Earth for his Possession.</hi> This Sentence is in the second Psalm, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Paul</hi>'s Interpretation of the Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to be spoken to Christ at his Resurrection
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54303:57"/>
                     <hi>Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee.</hi> I have begotten thee, that is, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> from the Dead.</p>
                  <p>He hath raised up Jesus again, as it is also written in the Second Psalm. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> Act. 13. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. Now mark at his Raising him from the Dead, he bids him <hi>ask, ASK</hi> of me, and that the Heathen: As if God had said, <hi>My Son,</hi> thy Blood hath pacified, and appeased my Justice; I can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This is then the First Demonstration to prove that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for the Souls of Sinners, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Eternal Redemption for them; namely, his being Raised again from the Dead.</p>

               <head>The Second Demonstration.</head>
               <p>SEcondly. A Second thing that demonstrateth this Truth, is, <hi>That he Ascended, and was received up into Heaven. So after the Lord had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them, he was received up into Heaven,</hi> Mar. 16. 19.</p>
               <p>This Demonstration consisteth of two parts.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:54303:57"/>
                  <item>1. Of his Ascending.</item>
                  <item>2. Of his being Received.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, For his Ascending. <hi>He is ascended on High,</hi> Ephes. 4. 8.</p>
               <p>This Act of Ascending answereth to the High-Priest under the Law, who, after they had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sacrifice, he was to bring the Blood into the most Holy Place, to wit, the inner-Temple, the Way to which, was ascending or going up, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Now consider the <hi>Circumstances</hi> that attended his Ascending, when he went to carry his Blood to present it before the Mercy-Seat: and you will find, they all say amends is made to God for us.</p>
               <p>1. At this, He is again attended, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Angels, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>2. He ascendeth with a <hi>shout,</hi> &amp; with the sound of a Trumpet, with sing Praises, sing Praises, sing Praises, <hi>Psal.</hi> 47. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>3. The Enemies of mans Salvation are now tied to his Chariot-wheels. <hi>When he ascended on High, he led captivity captive,</hi> Ephes. 4. that is, he led Death, Devils, and Hell, and the Grave, and the Curse, captive, for these things were our Captivity. And thus did <hi>Deborah</hi> prophecy of him, when she cried, <hi>Arise</hi> Barak <hi>and lead thy Captivity captive, thou Son of</hi> Abinoam. This <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> also fore-saw when he said, <hi>Thou hast ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:54303:58"/>
                  <hi>on high, thou hast led Captivity captive,</hi> Judges 5. 12. Psal. 68. 18.</p>
               <p>4. The Apostles must be the Beholders of his going up, and must see the Cloud receive him out of their Sight, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>The Consideration of these things strongly inforceth this Conclusion, <hi>That he hath spoiled what would have spoiled us, had he not by his Bloodshed taken them away:</hi> And I say, for God to adorn him with all this Glory in his Ascension; THUS to make him ride Conqueror up into the Clouds; THUS to go up with found of Trumpet, with shout of Angels, and with Songs of Praises; and let me add, to be accompanied also with those that rose from the Dead after his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who were the very Price of his Blood. This doth greatly demonstrate, <hi>That Jesus Christ by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for the Souls of Sinners, and obtained Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for them;</hi> he had not else rid thus in Triumph to Heaven.</p>
               <p>2. I come now to his being Received: <hi>He was received up into Heaven.</hi> The High-Priest under the Law, when he ascended into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest, he was, <hi>there to offer the Blood;</hi> which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest was the Type of Heaven, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. But because the Sacrifices under the Law could not make them that did the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice perfect as pertaining to the Conscience; therefore they were to stand, not sit, to come out
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54303:58"/>
again, not tarry there. <hi>For it is not possible that the Blood of Bulls and Goats, should take away sin; wherefore, when he cometh into the World, he saith, Sacrifice and Offerings thou wouldest not, but a Body hast thou prepared me. In Burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said he, lo, I come (in the Volume of thy Book it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of me) to do thy will, O God,</hi> Heb. 10. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Christ therefore in his entering into Heaven, did it, as High-Priest of the Church of God: Therefore neither did he go in without Blood. <hi>Wherefore, when he came to be an High-Priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this Building, neither by the Blood of Bulls and Goats, but by his own Blood, he entered in once into the Holy Place, having obtained Eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>He entered in having obtained, or because he obtained Eternal Redemption for us: but to pass that,</p>
               <p>Consider ye now also those Glorious Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances that accompany his Approach to the Gates of the Everlasting Habitation.</p>
               <p>1. The Everlasting Gates are set, yea, bid stand open. <hi>Be ye open ye Everlasting Doors, and the King of Glory shall come in. This King of Glory,</hi> is Jesus Christ, and the Words are a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of his Glorious Ascending into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54303:59"/>
when he went up as the High-Priest of the Church, to carry the Price of his Blood into the Holiest of all. <hi>Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, even lift them up, ye Everlasting Doors, and the King of Glory shall come in,</hi> Psalm 24. 7, 9.</p>
               <p>2dly. At his Enterance, he was <hi>received,</hi> and the Price accepted which he paid for our Souls. Hence it is said, He entered in <hi>by his Blood;</hi> that is, by the Merit of it. <hi>To Receive,</hi> is an Act of Complacency and Delight, and includeth Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasedness <hi>in the Person Receiving,</hi> who is God the Father: And considering that this Jesus, <hi>now received,</hi> is to be received upon our account, or as undertaking the Salvation of <hi>Sinners:</hi> (for he entered into the Heavens <hi>for us</hi>) it is apparent that he entered thither by vertue of his Infinite Righteousness, which he accomplished for us upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>3dly. At his Reception, <hi>he received Glory,</hi> and that also for <hi>our</hi> Encouragement. <hi>God raised him up, and gave him Glory, that our Faith and Hope might be in him,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>He gave him Glory, as a Testimony, that his undertaking the Work of our Redemption was accepted of him.</p>
               <p>1. He gave Glory; first <hi>to his Person,</hi> in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to sit at his own Right Hand, and this he had, I say, for, or upon the account of the Work he accomplished for us in the World; <hi>When he had offered up one Sacrifice for Sins, for</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:54303:59"/>
                  <hi>ever, he sat down on the Right Hand of God,</hi> Heb. 10. 12, 13. and this by God's appointment. <hi>Sit thou at my Right Hand.</hi> This Glory is the Highest; it is above all Kings, Princes, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates in this World; it is above all Angels, Principalities, and Powers in Heaven. <hi>He is gone into Heaven, and is on the Right Hand of God; Angels, and Authorities, and Powers being made Subject unto him,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 22.</p>
               <p>2. He gave Glory to his Name, to his Name, JESUS; that Name being exalted above every Name. <hi>He hath given him a Name above every Name, that at the Name of Jesus, every Knee should bow, of things in Heaven, and things on Earth, and things under the Earth, and that every Tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father,</hi> Phil. 2.</p>
               <p>This Name is said (in another place) to be a Name above every Name that is Named, <hi>not only in this World, but in that also which is to come,</hi> Ephes. 1. 21.</p>
               <p>But should [JESUS] have been such a Name, since he undertook for Sinners; had this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker failed in his Work, if his Work had not been accepted with God, even the Work of our Redemption by his Blood? No verily, it would have stunk in both the Nostrils of God and Man, it would have been the most abhorred Name: but JESUS is the <hi>Name;</hi> JESUS, he was called, in order to his Work. <hi>His Name shall be called JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS,</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:54303:60"/>
                  <hi>for he shall save;</hi> He was so named of the Angels, <hi>before he was conceived in the Womb;</hi> and he goeth by that Name now he is in Heaven: By the Name Jesus, <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> because he once dwelt there. This Name, I say, is the Highest <hi>Name,</hi> the Everlasting Name; the Name that he is to go by, to be known by, to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by, and to be glorified by; yea the <hi>Name</hi> by which also most Glory shall redound to God the Father. Now what is the Signification of this <hi>Name,</hi> but SAVIOUR? This <hi>Name</hi> he hath therefore, <hi>for his Works Sake;</hi> and because God delighted in his Undertaking, and was pleased with the Price he had paid for us; therefore the Divine Majesty hath given him it, hath made it High, and hath commanded all Angels to bow unto it. Yea, it is the <hi>Name</hi> in which he resteth, and by which he hath magnified all his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>This is the Name</hi> by which Sinners should go to God the Father.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>This is the Name</hi> through which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain forgiveness of Sins, <hi>and</hi> ANY <hi>thing. If you ask anything in my Name I will do it,</hi> John 14.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>This is the Name</hi> through which our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Services and Sacrifices are accepted, and by which an Answer of Peace is returned into our Bosoms, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. But more of this anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:54303:60"/>3. <hi>At this Name</hi> Devils tremble, at THIS Name Angels bow the Head, at THIS Name God's Heart openeth, at THIS Name the Godly Man's Heart is comforted: THIS Name none but Devils hate it, and none but those that must be damned despise it, <hi>No man speaking by the Holy Ghost calls Jesus accursed,</hi> or accounteth him still dead, and his Blood ineffectual to save the World.</p>
               <p>3dly. He hath also given him the Glory of Office.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>He is there a Priest for ever,</hi> intercepting betwixt the Divine Presence, and all that hate us, by his Blood; Sin, Satan, Death, Hell, the Law, the Grave, or the like, cannot be heard, if his Blood be presented to God, as the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us: This is called the Blood of Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>which speaks better things than the Blood of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> Heb. 12. 24. By this Blood he entered into Heaven, by this Blood he secureth from wrath, <hi>all that come unto God by him:</hi> but should his Blood have had a Voice in Heaven <hi>to save</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, had it not merited first, even in the Shedding of it, the Ransom, and Redemption of Souls. 'Tis true, a Man whose Blood cannot save, may with <hi>Abels,</hi> cry out for Vengeance and Wrath on the Head of him that shed it, <hi>but</hi> THIS <hi>Blood speaks for better things,</hi> this Blood speaks <hi>for</hi> Souls, for Sinners, for Pardon. <hi>Having obtained Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Redemption for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:54303:61"/>2. He is there a Fore-runner <hi>for us. Whither the Fore-runner is for us entered, even Jesus,</hi> Heb. 6. 20. This Office of Harbinger, is distinct from, though it comes by vertue of, his Priestly Office: therefore they are both mentioned in the Text, <hi>Whither the Fore-runner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an High-Priest for ever, after the Order of</hi> Melchisedec. He is therefore our Fore-runner by vertue of his Priesthood, his Blood giving worth to all he does.</p>
               <p>In this Office of Harbinger, or Fore-runner; he prepareth for Believers their dwelling-Places in the Heavens; their dwelling-Places, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Place, State, Calling, Service, or Work, in his Body the Church. <hi>In my Fathers House,</hi> saith he, <hi>are many Mansions, if it were not so I would have told you, I go to prepare a Place for you,</hi> Joh. 14.</p>
               <p>This is that is mentioned in the <hi>47th</hi> Psalm. <hi>He shall chuse our Inheritance for us, the Excellency of</hi> Jacob <hi>whom he loved.</hi> But should he have had Power to chuse our Inheritance for us, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for us our dwelling-Places; should he have Power to give even Heaven itself to a Company of Poor Men, had he not in the first Place ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by his Blood the Deliverance of our Soul from Death.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>He is there a Prophet for us,</hi> by which Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his, he hath received to communicate the whole Will of the Eternal God, so far as is fit
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54303:61"/>
for us to know in this World, or in that which is to come. Hence he is called the Prophet of the Church. The Lord shall raise you up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>and this is, of a truth, that Prophet that should come into the World:</hi> But this Office he hath also now in Heaven, by vertue of the Blood he shed for us upon Earth. Hence the New-Testament is called, <hi>The New-Testament in his Blood,</hi> and his Blood is said to be <hi>The Blood of the Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant,</hi> or Testament: Yea such vertue doth his Blood give to the New-Testament or Covenant of Grace, as that severed from that it is nothing worth; <hi>for a Testament is of force after men are dead, otherwise it is of no strength at all, while the Testator liveth,</hi> Heb. 9. 16, 17. So that every Word of <hi>God,</hi> which he hath by Christ given to us, for our Everlasting Consolation, is dipt in blood, is founded in blood, and stands good to Sinners purely (I mean with respect to merit) upon the account of Blood, or because his Blood that was shed for us on the Cross, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us for the Remission of our Sins. Let no man think to receive any benefit by Christs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office; by any of the good Words of Grace, and forgiveness of Sins that are sprinkled up and down in the New-Testament; <hi>That look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not for that good to come to him for the Sake of that Blood by which this Testament is established:</hi> For neither was the First Testament dedicated without Blood; for when <hi>Moses</hi> had spoken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54303:62"/>
Precept to all the People according to the Law; <hi>He took the Blood of Calves, and of Goats with Water, and scarlet Wool, and Hissop and sprinkled both the Book and all the People, saying, This is the Blood of the Testament, which God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned unto you,</hi> Heb. 9. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>The Prophetical Office of Christ standeth of two parts: First in Promises of Grace; Secondly, in Directions of Worship; but neither is this last, to wit, the Doctrine of Worship, or our subjection to that Worship, of any value, any further than as sprinkled also with his Blood: For as in the first Testament, the Tabernacle and all the Vessels of the Ministry were sprinkled with Blood, (and it was necessary that so it should be) so the Heavenly Things themselves, must be also purified with Sacrifices, but yet <hi>with better Sacrifice than these;</hi> for now, not <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>Christ,</hi> doth sprinkle, not with Blood of Calves, but with his own Blood; neither as entered into places made with Hands, <hi>but from Heaven doth Jesus sprinkle</hi> all that Doctrine of Worship, &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of his Saints thereto, which is of his own instituting, and commanding, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 23, 24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>4. He hath received there the Office of a King, by which he ruleth in the Church, and over all things for her sake. The Government is laid upon his Shoulders; the Lord God hath given him the Throne of his Father <hi>David.</hi> Hence it is that he saith, <hi>All Power is given me in Heaven</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:54303:62"/>
                  <hi>and Earth;</hi> but now this Kingly Office, he hath it by his Blood, <hi>because he humbled himself to death, therefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him the Highest Name.</hi> And hence again he is called a LAMB upon the Throne. <hi>In the midst of the Throne &amp; of the four Beasts, and in the midst of the Elders stood a Lamb as it had been slain, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seven horns;</hi> a Demonstration of Kingly Power. But mark, he was a Lamb upon the Throne, he had his Horns as a <hi>Lamb.</hi> Now by LAMB, we are to understand, not only his meek and sweet Disposition, but his Sacrifice; for he was as a <hi>Lamb</hi> to be slain, and Sacrificed; and so his having a Throne and seven Horns as a Lamb, giveth us to understand, that he obtained this Dignity of King, by his Blood. <hi>When he had by himself purged our Sins, he sat down on the Right Hand of the Majesty in the Heavens. When he had offered up one Sacrifice for Sins for ever, he sat down on the Right Hand of God,</hi> Revel. 5. Heb. 4. Chap. 10.</p>
               <p>Now put all these together, to wit, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the Dead, his Ascension, and Exaltation to Office, and remember also that the Person thus Exalted, is the same Jesus of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> that sometime was made accursed of God for Sin, and also that he obtained this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by vertue of the Blood that was shed for us, and it must unavoidably follow, <hi>That Jesus Christ by what he hath done, hath paid full price</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:54303:63"/>
                  <hi>to God for Sinners, and obtained Eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them.</hi>

               <head>The Third Demonstration.</head>
               <p>BUt to proceed; A Third Demonstration, That Jesus Christ by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for Sinners, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Eternal Redemption for them, is, <hi>because he hath received for them the Holy Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Jesus hath God raised up, whereof, said <hi>Peter,</hi> we are all Witnesses. <hi>Therefore being by the Right Hand of God exalted, and having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Father the Promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth that which ye now see and hear,</hi> Act. 2. 32, 33.</p>
               <p>The receiving of the Holy Ghost at the Hand of the Father, who had bruised him before for the Transgressions of his People. The receiving of it, I say, upon his Resurrection, and that to give them for whom (just before) he had spilt his Blood to make an Atonement for their Souls; argueth that the Divine Majesty found rest and content in that Precious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>And if you consider the necessity of the giving of this good spirit to Men, and the benefit that they receive by his coming upon them, you will

see yet more into the Truth now contended for.</p>
               <p>First, Then of the Necessity of giving this good Spirit.</p>
               <p>2. And then of the Benefit which we receive at his coming.</p>
               <p>First, Of the Necessity of its being given.</p>
               <p>1. Otherwise Jesus could never have been proved to be the Saviour; for the Promise was, that Messias should have the Spirit given him; given him to communicate. <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them,</hi> (saith the Lord,) <hi>my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is upon thee, and my Words which I have put in thy Mouth (meaning the Redeemer,</hi> ver, 20.) <hi>shall not depart out of thy Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seeds. Seed, from henceforth and for ever,</hi> Isa. 59. 21.</p>
               <p>Here is the Promise of the Spirit to be given to Christ, and by him to his Seed for ever.

               <p>This Spirit Jesus promised to send unto his, at his Exaltation on the Right Hand of God; The Spirit, I say, in the plentiful <hi>Pourings</hi> of it out. True, the Church in all Ages had something of it by vertue of the Suretyship of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus; but <hi>this</hi> in comparison of what was to come into the Church after his Resurrection, is not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54303:64"/>
reckoned a <hi>Pouring</hi> forth, therefore <hi>Pourings</hi> forth thereof are reserved to the time of the Ascension, and Exaltation of this Jesus. <hi>I will pour out of my Spirit in</hi> THOSE <hi>Days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence Jesus reserves it till his going away, and 'tis expresly said; <hi>The Holy Ghost was not yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, because Jesus was not yet Glorified.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did the Apostles wait after his Resurrection for the pouring forth of the Holy Ghost, and at the set time did receive it, by the giving of which, he declared himself to be the son of God and Saviour of the World, <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 26. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 4. 5. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 16, 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>2. Without the giving of the Holy Ghost, there had wanted a Testimony that his Gospel was the Gospel of Messias. <hi>Moses</hi> his Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was confirmed by Signs and Wonders and mighty Deeds, both in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Wilderness, and at the Red-Sea; wherefore 'twas necessary that the Doctrine of Redemption by Blood, which is the Doctrine of the Gospel of this Jesus, should be also <hi>confirmed with signs following.</hi> Hence both himself, and Apostles did as frequently work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and do mighty Deeds, as his Ministers now do preach: which Signs and Miracles, and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, confirmed their Doctrine, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, both Master and Scholar was (in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the most considerable) mean: yea, they by the means of the Holy Ghost, have so ratified,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54303:64"/>
confirmed, and setled the Gospel in the World, that no Philosopher, Tyrant, or Devil hath been able hitherto, to move it out of its place. <hi>He confirmed the Word with Signs following,</hi> Mar. 16. 20. Heb. 2. 4.</p>
               <p>3. As the giving of the Holy Ghost was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary thus; so was it necessary also to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them that were intrusted with his Gospel.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To preach it effectually.</item>
                  <item>2. To stand to it boldly.</item>
                  <item>3. And to justifie it to be the Doctrine of Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias incontroulably.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. To preach it effectually; <hi>in demonstration of the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4. 2 Cor. 6. 4, 5, 6. Joh. 16. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>2. To stand to it boldly; Then <hi>Peter</hi> filled with the Holy Ghost, said: <hi>And they saw the Boldness of Peter and John,</hi> Act. 8. 13.</p>
               <p>3. To justify the Doctrine incontroulably. <hi>I will give you a Mouth and Wisdom which all your Adversaries shall not be able to resist or gain say. And they were not able to resist the Wisdom and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by which he spake,</hi> Luk. 21. 15. Act. 6. 10.</p>
               <p>Now, I say, that God should give the Holy Ghost to Jesus, to confirm this Gospel, <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from sin by his Blood;</hi> what is it, but that by his Blood he hath paid full price to God for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and obtained Eternal Redemption for them?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:54303:65"/>But again, the Benefit which we receive at the Coming of the Holy Ghost, doth more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate this Truth; hath Christ purchased Sinners, and are they the Price of his Blood? Yes. But how doth that appear? Why, because by the Holy Ghost which he hath received to give us, we are fitted for the Inheritance which by his Blood is prepared for us.</p>
               <p>1. By the Spirit of God we are quickned, and raised from a state of Sin, but that we could not be, were it not that an Atonement is made for us; first, by the Blood of Christ our Saviour. This is true; for they that are quickned by the Holy Ghost, are quickned by it through the Word of the Gospel which offereth Justification to Sinners through Faith in his Blood: yea, we are said to be quickned together with him, dead and risen with him: yet so as by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>2. We are not only quickned by the Holy Ghost, but possessed therewith; it is given to dwell in our Hearts. <hi>Because ye are Sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5, 6. which Spirit is also our earnest for Heaven, until the Redemption of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased Possession; that is, until our Body which is the purchased Possession, be redeemed also out of the Grave, by the Power of the same mighty Spirit of God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:54303:65"/>3. By this Holy Spirit we are made to believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13.</p>
               <p>4. By this Holy Spirit, we are helped to pray and call God Father.</p>
               <p>5. By this Holy Spirit we are helped to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand and apply the Promises.</p>
               <p>6. By this Holy Spirit the Joy of Heaven, and the Love of God is shed abroad in the Heart of the Saved.</p>
               <p>7. By this Holy Spirit we are made to wait for the hope of Righteousness by Faith, that is, to stand fast through our Lord Jesus in the day when he shall judg the World.</p>
               <p>And all this is the Fruit of Redemption by Blood; of Redemption by the Blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>This is yet further evident:</p>
               <p>1. Because the Work of the Spirit is to lead us into the sayings of Christ; which, as to our Redemption from death, are such as these: <hi>I lay down my Life, that you may have Life. I give my Life a Ransom for many; And the Bread which I will give is my Flesh, which I will give for the Life of the World,</hi> Joh. 6.</p>
               <p>2. Because, IF the Spirit in the Wisdom of Heaven, is not counted a sufficient Testimony on Earth, but as joyned with the Blood of Christ. <hi>There are three that bear witness on Earth, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Water, and the Blood.</hi> These are the Witness of God. The Spirit, because it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; the Blood, because it hath merited; and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54303:66"/>
the Watter, to wit, the Word, because by that, <hi>we are clean,</hi> as to life and conversation, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 9.</p>
               <p>3. Because, as by the Spirit, so we are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith in the Blood of Jesus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 12.</p>
               <p>4. Because when most full of the Spirit, &amp; when that doth work most mightly in us, we are then most in the belief, and admiring apprehensions of our deliverance from death by the Blood of Jesus, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
               <p>5. The Holy Ghost breaheth, no-where, so as in the Ministry of this Doctrine; this Doctrine is sent WITH the Holy Ghost from Heaven; yea, as I have hinted, one of the Great Works of the Holy Ghost under the Old-Testament, was to testifie <hi>of the Sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Put all these things together and see, if Jesus Christ by what he hath done, hath not paid full price to God for Sinners; <hi>if he hath not obtained Eternal Redemption for them.</hi>

               <head>The Fourth Demonstration.</head>
               <p>THat Jesus Christ <hi>by what he hath done,</hi> hath paid full price to God for Sinners, <hi>and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Eternal Redemption for them,</hi> is evident, if you consider how the preaching thereof hath been from that time to this, <hi>a mighty Conquerer over all kind of Sinners.</hi> What Nation, what People, what kind of Sinners have not been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by the preaching of a Crucified Christ. He upon the White Horse with his Bow and his Crown hath conquered, doth conquer, <hi>and goeth forth yet conquering and to conquer,</hi> Revel. 6. 2. <hi>And I, saith he, if I be lifted up from the Earth, will draw all men unto me:</hi> but what was it to be lifted up from the Earth? Why, it may be expounded by that saying; <hi>As Moses lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him might not perish but have everlasting life,</hi> Joh. 12. 32. Chap. 3. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>He was <hi>then</hi> lifted up, when he was hanged upon a Tree between the Heavens and the Earth as the Accursed of God for us. The Revelation of this, it conquers all Nations, Tongues and People. <hi>And they sang a new Song, saying, thou art worthy to take the Book and to open the Seals</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:54303:67"/>
                  <hi>thereof, for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation,</hi> Revel. 5. 9. Hence the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> chose, above all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, to preach up a Crucified Christ, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved so to do: <hi>For I determined,</hi> saith he, <hi>not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>1. The Doctrine of Forgiveness of Sin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered his very Murderers. They could not withstand the Grace, them bloody ones, that would kill him what-ever it cost them, could stand no longer, but received his Doctrine, fell into his Bosom, and obtained the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus. <hi>They shall look upon him whom they have pierced and mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only Son, &amp; they shall be in bitterness for him, as one is in bitterness for his first-born,</hi> Zech. 12. 10. Now was this Scripture emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently fulfilled, when the Kindness of a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Christ, broke to pieces the Hearts of them that had before been his Betrayers and Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Now was there a <hi>great mourning in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi> now was there wailing and lamentation, mixed with joy and rejoycing.</p>
               <p>2. Though <hi>Paul</hi> was mad, exceeding mad against Jesus Christ of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> yea, though he was his avowed Enemy, seeking to put out his Name from under Heaven: yet the Voice from Heaven [<hi>I am Jesus, &amp;c.</hi>] <hi>I am the Saviour;</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:54303:67"/>
how did it conquer him, make him throw down his Arms, fall down at his Feet, and accept of the forgiveness of Sins freely by grace, through Redemption by Faith in his Blood.</p>
               <p>3. They at <hi>Samaria,</hi> though before <hi>Philip</hi> preached to them, worshipped and admired the Devil in <hi>Magus,</hi> yet when they believed <hi>Philip's</hi> preaching of Christ unto them, and forgiveness of sins through Faith in his Name, great joy was amongst them, and they were baptized both Men and Women, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. He preached, saith the Text, <hi>the things concerning the Kingdom of God, and the Name of Jesus Christ;</hi> that is, all the Blessings of Life, through the Name of Jesus Christ; for he is the Mediator, and without his Blood come no spiritual blessings to men.</p>
               <p>4. How was the sturdy Jailer overcome by a Promise of forgiveness of sins by Faith in Jesus Christ. It stopt his Hand of self-murder, it eas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of the gnawings of a guilty Conscience, and fears of Hell-Fire, and filled his Soul with rejoicing in God, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 30, 31, 32, 33.</p>
               <p>5. How were those that used curious arts, that were next to, if not, Witches indeed; I say, how were they prevailed upon, and overcome by the Word of God; which is, the Gospel of good Tidings through Faith in the Blood of Christ? <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>6. How were the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> who sometimes were <hi>far</hi> from God, how, I say, were they made
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54303:68"/>
                  <hi>nigh</hi> by the Blood of Christ! <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p>7. The <hi>Colossians,</hi> though sometimes dead in their Sins, yet how were they quickned by God, through the Forgiveness <hi>of all their Trespasses,</hi> and they had that through his Blood, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>What shall I say, no man could as yet stand before, and not fall under the Revelation of the Forgiveness of Sins through a Crucified Christ; as hanged, as dying, as accursed for Sinners; he draws all men unto him, men of all sorts, of all degrees.</p>
               <p>Shall I add, how have men broken through the Pricks to Jesus, when he hath been discovered to them! neither Lyons nor Fires, nor Sword, nor Famine, nor Nakedness, nor Peril; neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor Height, nor Depth, nor any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, shall be able to separate us from the Love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39.</p>

               <head>The Fifth Demonstration.</head>
               <p>THat Jesus Christ by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for Sinners, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Eternal Redemption for them is evident,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54303:68"/>
                  <hi>by the Peace and Holiness, that by that Doctrine possesseth mens Souls; The Souls of Men awakned, and that continue so.</hi> By awakened men I mean, such as through the Revelation of their Sin and Misery, groan under the want of Jesus to save them, and that continue sensible that they needs must perish if his benefits be not bestowed upon them.</p>
               <p>For otherwise the Gospel ministreth neither Peace nor Holiness to any of the Souls of the Sons of Men; that is to say, not Saving Peace and Holiness. ☞ The Gospel of Grace and Salvation, is above all Doctrines, the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, if in word only it be received by graceless men: if it be not attended with a Revelation of Men's need of a Saviour: if it be not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied in the Soul by the Power of the Holy Ghost. For such Men as have only the notions of it, are of all Men liable to the greatest Sins, because there <hi>wanteth</hi> in their notions, <hi>the Power of Love,</hi> which alone can constrain them to love Jesus Christ. And this is the Reason of these Scriptures. <hi>They turn the Grace of God into wantonness; They turn the Grace of our God into lasciviousness,</hi> Jude 4.</p>
               <p>For some when they hear of the Riches of Grace, <hi>through Christ,</hi> that hearing, not being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Faith &amp; Love which is in Christ Jesus; those Men receive the notions of this good Doctrine, only to cloak their wickedness, and to harden themselves in their Villanies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:54303:69"/>Others when they hear, being leavened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the Leaven of some other Doctrine, some Doctrine of the Righteousness of the World, or Doctrine of Devils; forthwith make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, and speak evil of the blessed Doctrine; and because some that profess it, are not cleansed from their filthiness of flesh and spirit, and do not perfect Holiness in the Fear of God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others conclude that all that profess it are such, and that the Doctrine it self, tendeth to encourage, or at least, to tolerate licentiousness, as they imagined and affirmed of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he should say, <hi>Let us do evil that good may come,</hi> Rom. 3. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>The ground of that wicked Conclusion of theirs, was, because he by the Allowance of God affirmed, <hi>That as sin had reigned unto death, so grace reigned unto life in a way of Righteousness by Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Nay then, says the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, we may be as unholy as we will, and that by the Doctrine you preach: for, if where sin abounds, grace abounds more, the consequence of a wicked life, is but the hightening, advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and magnifying of Grace. But what saith the Apostle? my conclusions are true, <hi>That grace doth reign above sin;</hi> but to say, <hi>let us therefore sin,</hi> that Man's Damnation is just; because such an one abuseth, and maketh the most devilish use of the Blessedest Doctrine that ever was heard of in the World amongst Men. Besides, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54303:69"/>
that such know not the Power thereof; nor have felt or savored its blessedness; for where this Gospel cometh in truth, <hi>it naturally produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Peace and Holiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Peace.</hi> He is our Peace, he is the Prince of Peace, he giveth peace in his High Places.</p>
               <p>This word <hi>Peace</hi> hath in it a double respect.</p>
               <p>1. It respecteth God: <hi>He hath made peace by the Blood of his Cross;</hi> that is, he hath made peace for us with God, having appeased the rigor of his Law, and satisfied justice for us. Hence it is said: <hi>The Peace of God which passeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, shall keep your Hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus,</hi> Col. 1. 20. Phil. 4. 7. <hi>The Peace of God, that is,</hi> the Doctrine of Reconciliation by Christ's being made to be sin for us, THAT <hi>shall keep the Heart,</hi> that is, from despair or fainting under apprehensions of weakness and justice: But yet, this Peace of God, cannot be apprehended nor be of any comfort to the Heart, but as the Man looks for it <hi>through Christ Jesus.</hi> Therefore that clause is added, <hi>through Christ Jesus:</hi> for he is Peace-maker, 'tis he that recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileth us to God <hi>in the Body of his Flesh through death;</hi> for by his doing and suffering he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented God with Everlasting Righteousness, with Everlasting Righteousness for Sinners: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this we have Peace with God. Hence Christ is called King of Righteousness FIRST; <hi>first being by interpretation King of Righteousness, and after</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:54303:70"/>
                  <hi>that also King of Salem, which is King of Peace,</hi> Heb. 7. 1, 2. For he could not make peace with God, 'twixt us and him, but by being first the Lord of Righteousness, the Lord <hi>our</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: but having first compleated Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, he then came and preached Peace, and commanded his Ambassadors to make Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to the World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 21. For 'twas want of Righteousness, that caused want of Peace: now then righteousness being brought in, it followeth that he hath made peace. <hi>For he is our Peace who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle-Wall of Partition between us. Having abolished in his Flesh the Enmity, even the Law of Commandments, contained in Ordinances, for to make in himself of twain one new Man, so making Peace, and that he might reconcile both unto God, in one Body by the Cross, having slain the Enmity thereby; and came and preached Peace to you that were afar off, and to them that were nigh; for through him we both have access, by one spirit unto the Father,</hi> Ephes. 2. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>2dly. This word Peace respecteth our inward quietness of heart which we obtain, by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Reconciliation made by Christ, with God, for us. <hi>Being justified by Faith, we have Peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. The God of Peace fill you with all joy and peace in believing.</hi> Rom. 5. 1, 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:54303:70"/>This Peace is expressed diversly:</p>
               <p>1. Sometimes it is called QUIETNESS; for it calms the Soul from those troublous Fears of damning, because of sin. <hi>And the work of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness shall be Peace, and the Effect of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Quietness and Assurance for ever,</hi> Isa. 32. 17.</p>
               <p>2. Sometimes it is called BOLDNESS; for by the Blood of Christ a Man hath encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to approach unto God. <hi>Having, brethren, Boldness to enter into the Holiest by the Blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the Vail, that is to say, his Flesh,</hi> Heb. 10. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>3. It is sometimes called CONFIDENCE; because by Jesus Christ we have not only encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to come to God, but confidence; that if we ask any thing according to his Will, he not only heareth, but granteth the Request which we put up to him. <hi>In whom we have boldness and access, with confidence, by the Faith of Jesus,</hi> Ephes. 3. 12. 1 John 5. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>4. Sometimes this Peace is expressed by REST, because a Man having found a sufficient Fulness to answer all his Wants, he sitteth down, and looks no further for satisfaction. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,</hi> Mat. 11. 28.</p>
               <p>5. It is also expressed by SINGING, because the Peace of God when it is received into the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54303:71"/>
Soul by Faith, putteth the Conscience into a Heavenly and Melodious Frame. <hi>And the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed of the Lord shall return, and come to</hi> Zion <hi>with Songs, and Everlasting Joy upon their Heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall fly away,</hi> Isa. 35. 10.</p>
               <p>6. Sometimes it is expressed, or discovered by an Heavenly glorying and boasting in Jesus Christ, because this Peace causeth the Soul to set its Face upon its Enemies with Faith of a Victory over them for ever by its Lord Jesus. <hi>Let him that glorieth glory in the Lord;</hi> and, <hi>My Soul shall make her boasts in the Lord, the Humble shall hear thereof, and be glad,</hi> Jer. 9. 23, 24. Psalm 34. 2.</p>
               <p>7. Sometimes it is expressed, or discovered by <hi>Joy, Joy unspeakable;</hi> because the Soul having seen it self reconciled to God, hath not only qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness, but such apprehensions do now possess it of the unspeakable Benefits it receiveth by Christ with respect to the World to come, that it is swallowed up with them. <hi>Whom having not seen, ye love, in whom though now ye see him not, yet believing ye rejoice, with joy unspeakable, and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8.</p>
               <p>8. Lastly: It is expressed, or discovered by <hi>the Triumph</hi> that ariseth sometimes in the Hearts of the Believers; for they at times are able to see Death, Sin, the Devil, and Hell, and all Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity conquered by, and tied as Captives at the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54303:71"/>
Chariot-Wheels of Jesus Christ: Taken captive, I say, and overthrown for ever. <hi>Thanks be to God who causeth us always to triumph in Christ. O clap your Hands, O ye People, sing unto God with the voice of Triumph,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 14. Psalm 47. 1.</p>
               <p>Now that all this should be a <hi>cheat,</hi> is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that is, it is impossible that Believers should thus have Peace with God through the Blood of his Cross; he having not paid full price to God for them; especially if you consider that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this Peace, are all the three in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and that upon a double account.</p>
               <p>1. In that they have given us a Gospel <hi>of Peace,</hi> Rom. 10. 15. or a New-Testament which propoundeth Peace with God through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Christ. Now as this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Gospel of Peace; so 1. It is called, <hi>The Gospel of God,</hi> 1 Thes. 2. 9. 2 Thes. 1. 8. 2. The Gospel of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 19. 3. A Gospel indited by the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>I say therefore, that Redemption and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being that throw Christ, and the Truth thereof proclaimed by the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, in the Word of the Truth of the Gospel, it must needs be that we who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, shall be saved, if we hold the confidence and the rejoicing firm unto the End.</p>
               <p>2. As the three in the God-head are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this Peace, by inditing for us the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54303:72"/>
of Peace, or the good Tidings of Salvation by Jesus Christ: <hi>So they are the Authors of our Peace, by working with that word of the Gospel in our Hearts.</hi> And hence 1. the Father is called the God of Peace; now <hi>the God of Peace be with you all: And the very God of Peace sanctifie you,</hi> Rom. 15. 33. 1 Thes. 5. 23. And because he is the God of Peace, therefore he filleth those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Christ, <hi>with joy and peace through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,</hi> Rom. 15. 13.</p>
               <p>2. Again, Christ is called the Prince of Peace; therefore the Prayer is, <hi>Grace be with you and Peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>3. The Holy Ghost also is the Author of this Peace, this inward Peace; <hi>Even righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. 14. 17.</p>
               <p>And, I say, as I also have already said, the procuring or meritorious Cause of this Peace, is the doings and sufferings of Christ. <hi>Therefore by his Doings and Sufferings he paid full price to God for Sinners, and obtained Eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them:</hi> else God would never have indit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Proclamation of Peace for them, and the Tenour of that Proclamation to be the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness of the Lord Jesus: yea, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have wrought with that Word in the Heart of them that believe, to create in them Peace, Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:54303:72"/>Secondly, As peace with God is an Evidence, (the Blood of Christ being the Cause thereof) that Christ hath by it paid full price to God for Sinners; so Holiness in their Hearts taking its beginning from this Doctrine, makes this fist Demonstration of double strength.</p>
               <p>1. That Holiness, true gospel Holiness, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth our hearts by this Doctrine, 'tis evident; <hi>because the ground of Holiness, which is the Spirit of God in us, is ministred to us by this Doctrine.</hi> When the Apostle had insinuated that the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> were bewitched because they had turned from the Doctrine of Christ Crucified, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of them, <hi>Whether they received the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. That is, whether the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit took possession of their Souls by their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ten Commandments; or by their giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing credit to the Doctrine of the forgiveness of their Sins, by Faith in this Crucified Christ: strongly concluding not by the Law, but by the hearing, or preaching of Faith; that is, of the Lord Jesus as Crucified, who is the Object of Faith.</p>
               <p>2. As this Doctrine conveyeth the ground, or ground-Work which is the Spirit; so also it worketh in the Heart those three Graces, Faith, Hope, Love; all which as naturally purifie the Heart from wickedness, as Sope, or Niter, cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Cloath. <hi>He purified their Hearts by Faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:54303:73"/>
by Faith in Christ's Blood. <hi>And everyone that hath this Hope in him, purifieth himself even as he is pure.</hi> And also Love, you shall see what that doth, if you look into the Text, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Now I say, <hi>this Faith</hi> groundeth it self in the Blood of Christ; Hope waiteth for the full enjoyments of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of it, <hi>in another world:</hi> and love is begot, and worketh, by the Love that Christ hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by his Death, and by the Kindness he presenteth us with in his Heart-Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
               <p>Besides, what arguments so prevailing, as such as are purely Gospel? To instance a few:</p>
               <p>1. What stronger, <hi>than a free forgiveness of Sins. A certain Man had two Debtors, the one owed him five Hundred Pence, and the other Fifty, and when they had nothing to pay, he frankly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave them both, tell me therefore which of them will love him most?</hi> Luk. 7. 41, 42, 47.</p>
               <p>2. What stronger argument to holiness, than to see, that though forgiveness comes free to us, <hi>yet it cost Christ Jesus Heart-Blood to obtain it for us. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our Sins.</hi> And this Love of God in giving his Christ and of Christ, in dying for us, there is no argument stronger to prevail with a sensible and awakened Sinner to judg, <hi>he should</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:54303:73"/>
                  <hi>live to him that died for him, and rose again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14.</p>
               <p>3. What stronger argument to holiness than this; <hi>If any man sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1, 2. Unsanctified and graceless wretches, know not how to use these Words of God; the Hypocrites also fly in our faces, because we thus urge them; but a Heart that is possessed with Gospel-ingenuity, or to speak more properly, that is possessed with Gospel-Grace, and with Divine Considerations, cries; if it be thus, O let me never sin against God! <hi>for the Love of Christ constrains me,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14.</p>
               <p>4. What greater argument to holiness, than to see the Holy Scriptures so furnished with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Grace and Salvation by Christ, that a Man can hardly cast his Eye into the Bible, but he espieth one, or another of them? who would not live in such an House, or be servant to such a Prince, who, besides his exceeding in good Conditions, hath Gold and Silver as common in his Palace, as stones are by the High-way side? <hi>Having therefore these Promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the Fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1.</p>
               <p>5. What greater argument to holiness, than to have our Performances, though weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54303:74"/>
from us; yet accepted of God in Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>6. What greater argument to holiness, than to have our Soul, our Body, our Life hid, and secured with Christ in God? <hi>Mortifie therefore your Members that are upon the Earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness which is idolatry,</hi> Col. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>What greater argument to holiness, than to be made the Members of the Body, of the Flesh, and of the Bones of Jesus Christ? <hi>Shall I take the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, and make them the Members of an harlot, God forbid,</hi> Ephes. 5. 30. 1 Cor. 6. 15.</p>
               <p>Now all these, and five times as many more, having their foundation in the Love, Blood and Righteousness of Christ, and operating in the Soul by Faith, are the great Argument unto that Holiness, to which is annexed eternal Life. 'Tis worth our observing, that in <hi>Act.</hi> 26, at the 18. The Inheritance belongs <hi>to them, that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith in Jesus Christ:</hi> For all other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to holiness, they are but a stollen semblance of that which is true and acceptable; though 'tis common for even that which is counterfeit to be called by the deluded, the True; and to be reckoned to be in them that are utter strangers to Faith, and the Holiness that comes by Faith. <hi>But whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:54303:74"/>
                  <hi>putteth any of it upon a stranger; shall even be cut off from his People,</hi> Exod. 30. 33. God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth which is holiness that comes by Faith in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of Sins, and acceptance with God, through Christ: and God knows which is only such feignedly; and accordingly will he deal with Sinners in that great Day of God Almighty.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="demonstration">
               <head>The Sixth Demonstration.</head>
               <p>THat Jesus Christ by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for Sinners, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Eternal Redemption for them, is evident; <hi>because Prayers are accepted of God only upon the account and for the sake of the Name of Jesus Christ: Verily, verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you,</hi> Joh. 16. 23. In my Name, in the Name of Jesus Christ of <hi>Nazareth:</hi> in the Name of him that came into the World to save Sinners, by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them a grievous bloody Death; in his Name that hath by himself put away sin, and brought unto God acceptable Righteousness for Sinners; in his Name; why in his Name, if he be not accepted of God? why in his Name, if his undertakings for us are not well-pleasing to God? But, by these Words, <hi>in my Name,</hi> are insinuated that his Person, and performances, as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54303:75"/>
our undertaker, is accepted by the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. We may not go in our own names, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>we</hi> are Sinners; not in the Name of one another, because <hi>all</hi> are Sinners; but why not in the Name of an Angel? Because they are not those that did undertake for us, or had they, they could not have done our work for us. <hi>He put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no trust in his Saints, yea the Heavens are not clean in his Sight,</hi> Job. 4. 18. Chap. 15. 15. It may further be objected:</p>
               <p>Since Jesus Christ is God equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so hath naturally the same Power to give as the Father, why should the Father rather than the Son, be the great Giver to the Sinners of the World? and why may we not go to Christ in the Name of the Father, as well as to the Father in the Name of Christ? I say, how can these things be salved, but by considering that sin and justice put a NECESSITY upon it, that thus must our Salvation be obtained. <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> could not reconcile, nor could a means be found out to bring the Sinner and an Holy God together, but by the Intercepting of the Son, who must take upon him to answer Justice, and that by taking our Sins from before the Face of God by bloody Sacrifice, not by Blood of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as the High-Priests under the Law. <hi>For, as every High-Priest is ordained to offer Gifts and Sacrifices, it is of necessity that this Man have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what also to offer,</hi> Heb. 8. 3. which Offering
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54303:75"/>
and Sacrifice of his being able to perfect for ever them that are sanctified and set apart for Eternal Life: <hi>Therefore the name of the Person that offered</hi> (even Jesus made of God an High-Priest) is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table with God; yea therefore is he made for ever, by his doing for us, the Appeaser of the Justice of God, and the Reconciler of Sinners to him. Hence it is, that HIS <hi>Name</hi> is that which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth us to mention when we come before God, for what God hath determined in his Counsels of Grace to bestow upon Sinners; because, for his <hi>Name sake</hi> he forgiveth them. <hi>I write to you little Children, because your Sins are forgiven you for his Name sake. To him give all the Prephets witness, that through his Name, whosoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him, shall receive Remission of Sins,</hi> 1. Joh. 2. 14. Act. 10. 43.</p>
               <p>They therefore that would obtain the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sins, must ask it of God through the Name of Jesus; and he that shall sensibly and unteignedly do it, he shall receive the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of them. <hi>Whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you.</hi> Hence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he hath not only paid full price to God for them, but also obtained Eternal Redemption for them.</p>
               <p>And it is observable, the Lord Jesus would have his Disciples make a <hi>Proof</hi> of this, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth, that if they do, they shall experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally find it so. <hi>Hitherto,</hi> saith he, <hi>ye have asked</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:54303:76"/>
                  <hi>nothing in my</hi> NAME, <hi>ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full,</hi> Joh. 16. 24. As who should say, O my Disciples, you have heard what I have promised to you, even that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall do for you, whatsoever ye shall <hi>ask him in my Name.</hi> Ask now therefore, and prove me, if I shall not make my Words good: Ask, I say, what you need, and see if you do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to the Joying of your Hearts. <hi>At that day ye shall ask in my Name, and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you.</hi> I do not bid you ask in my Name, as if the Father was yet hard to be reconciled, or unwilling to accept you to mercy: my Coming into the World was the Design of my Father, and the Effect of his Love to Sinners; but there is sin in you, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in God; therefore that you to him might be reconciled, I am made of my Father Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, wherefore <hi>ask</hi> in my Name; for, <hi>there is none other name given under the Heavens among Men whereby they must be saved,</hi> Act. 4. 12. Ask in my Name, love is let out to you through me, it is let out to you by me in a way of Justice, which is the only secure way for you. Ask in my Name, and my Father will love you. <hi>The Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God,</hi> Joh. 16. 27. My Fathers Love is set first upon me, for my Name is chief in his Heart, and all
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54303:76"/>
that love me are beloved of my Father, and shall have what they need if ye ask in my Name.</p>
               <p>But, I say, what cause would there be to ask in <hi>his</hi> Name more than in the Name of <hi>some other?</hi> since justice was provoked by our Sin; if he had not undertook to make up the difference that by Sin was made betwixt justice and us. For though there be in this Jesus infinite worth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite righteousness, infinite merit; yet if he make not with these, interest for us, we get no more benefit thereby than if there were no Mediator: But this Worth and Merit, is in him <hi>for us;</hi> for he undertook to reconcile us to God, it is <hi>therefore</hi> that his Name is with God so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing for us poor Sinners: and therefore that we ought to go to God in his Name. Hence therefore it is evident, that Jesus Christ hath paid full price to God for Sinners, and obtained Eternal Redemption for them.</p>

            <div n="7" type="demonstration">
               <head>The Seventh Demonstration.</head>
               <p>THat Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for Sinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is evident, because we are commanded also to give God thanks in his Name. By him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us offer the Sacrifice of Praise continually, that is, the Fruit of our Lips, giving thanks in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54303:77"/>
his Name, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 15.</p>
               <p>By him therefore; wherefore? because he also, that he might <hi>sanctifie us with his own Blood suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the Gate,</hi> ver. 12.</p>
               <p>He sanctified us with his Blood, but why should the Father have thanks for this? even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Father gave him for us, that he might die to sanctifie us with his Blood. <hi>Giving thanks to the Father which hath made us meet to be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, who hath delivered us from the Power of Darkness, and hath translated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son, in whom we have redemption through his Blood, even the forgiveness of Sins,</hi> Col. 1. 12, 13, 14. The Father is to be thanked, for the contrivance was also his, but the Blood, the Righteousness, or that worthiness, for the Sake of which we are accepted of God, is the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness of his own dear Son; as it is meet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God should have thanks, so it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that he have it in his Name for whose sake we indeed are accepted of him.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore by him offer Praise.</p>
               <p>First, For the Gift of his Son, and for that we stand quit through him in his Sight; and that in despite of all inward weakness, and that in despite of all outward enemies.</p>
               <p>When the Apostle had taken such a view of himself as to put himself into a maze, with an out-cry also, <hi>who shall deliver me?</hi> he quiets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54303:77"/>
with this sweet conclusion, <hi>I thank God through Jesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 7. 24. He found more in the Blood of Christ to save him, than he found in his own Corruptions to damn him; but that could not be, had he not paid full price for him, had he not obtained Eternal Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him. And can an Holy and Just God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that we give thanks to him in his Name, if it was not effectually done for us by him?</p>
               <p>Further, when the Apostle looks upon Death, and the Grave, and strengtheneth them by add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them Sin and the Law, saying, <hi>The Sting of Death is sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law:</hi> he presently addeth, <hi>but thanks</hi> be to God which giveth us the Victory through Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. The Victory over Sin, Death, and the Law, the Victory over these through our Lord Jesus Christ; but God hath given us the Victory: but it is through our Lord Jesus Christ, through his fulfilling the Law, through his destroying Death, and through his bringing in Everlasting Righteousness. <hi>Elisha</hi> said to the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> that <hi>had it not been that he regarded the Person of</hi> Jehoshaphat, <hi>he would not look to him, nor regard him,</hi> 2 Kin. 3. 14. nor would God at all have looked to, or regarded thee, but that he respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Person of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let the Peace of God therefore rule in your Hearts, to the which also you are called in one body, and be you thankful,</hi> Col. 3. 15. The Peace of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54303:78"/>
God, of that we have spoken before; but how should this rule in our Hearts? he by the next words directs you; <hi>Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly;</hi> that is, the Word that makes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Death and Blood of Christ, and of the Peace that is made with God for you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giving thanks always for all things unto God &amp; the Father in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> Ephes. 5. 20. For all things: for all things come to us through this Name Jesus; Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Translation, the Kingdom, Salvation, with all the good things wherewith we are blessed.</p>
               <p>These are the Works of God, he gave his Son, and he brings us to him, and puts us into his Kingdom; that is, his true Body, which <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> calleth, <hi>a putting among the Children, and a giving us a Godly heritage of the Host of Nations,</hi> Joh. 6. Jer. 3. 19.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Now thanks be to God, which causeth us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to triumph in Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>See here our cause of triumph is through Christ Jesus, and God causeth us through him to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph: First and chiefly, because Christ Jesus hath done our work for us, hath pleased God for our Sins, hath spoiled the powers of Darkness. God gave Jesus Christ to undertake our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Christ did undertake it, did engage our Enemies, and spoiled them. <hi>He spoiled princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and powers, and made a shew of them openly,</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:54303:78"/>
                  <hi>triumphing over them upon the Cross,</hi> Col. 2. 14, 15. Therefore, it is evident that he paid full price to God for Sinners with his Blood, because God commands us, to give thanks to him <hi>in his Name;</hi> through his Name. <hi>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks unto God, and the Father, by him,</hi> Col. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>Take this Conclusion from the whole, no thanks are accepted of God, that come not to him in the Name of his Son; his Son must have the Glory of conveying our thanks to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was he that by his Blood conveyeth his Grace to us.</p>

               <p>IN the next place; That Jesus Christ by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for Sinners, and obtained Eternal Redemption for them, is evident; <hi>Because we are exhorted to wait for, and to expect the full and glorious Enjoyment of that Eternal Redemption, at the second Coming of the Lord from Heaven: Let your loins be girded about, and your Lights burning, and you your selves like unto men that wait for their Lord, that when he cometh and knocketh, ye may open unto him immediately,</hi> Luk. 12. 35, 36.</p>

               <p>These latter words intend the Ascension of Jesus Christ: His Ascension, when he had upon the Cross made reconciliation for iniquity; his Ascension into the Heavens to prepare our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Glory for us. For, our Inheritance is in the Heavens; our House, our Hope, our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion-House, and our incorruptible and undefiled Inheritance is in Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. Col. 1. 5, 6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>This is called the Eternal Inheritance, of which we that are called, have received the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise already, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>This Inheritance, I say, he is gone to chuse for us in the Heavens, because by his Blood he obtained it for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. and this we are commanded to wait for: but how ridiculous, yea, how great a cheat would this be, had he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54303:79"/>
not by his Blood obtained it for us.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>We wait for his Son from Heaven, whom he raised from the dead even Jesus Christ, which deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the Wrath to come,</hi> 1 Thes. 1. 10. He delivered us by his Blood, and obtained the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven for us, and hath promised that he would go and prepare our places, and come again and fetch us thither. <hi>And if I go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am there ye may be also,</hi> Joh. 14. 3. This then is the Cause that we wait for him, we look for the reward of the Inheritance at his Coming, who have served the Lord Christ in this World.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>For our conversation is in Heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> Phil. 3. 20. We look for him to come, yet as a Saviour; a Saviour he was at his first Coming, and a Saviour he will be at his second Coming. At his first Coming, he bought and paid for us; at his Second Coming, he will fetch us to himself. At his first Coming, he gave us promise of the Kingdom; at his second Coming, he will give us possession of the Kingdom. At his first Coming, he also shewed us how we should be, by his own Transfiguration; at his second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>he will change our vile Body that it may be fashioned like unto his Glorious Body,</hi> Phil. 3. 21.</p>
               <p>4. Hence therefore it is, that his Coming is called, our <hi>blessed Hope. Looking for the Blessed</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:54303:80"/>
                  <hi>Hope, and glorious Appearing of the Great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> Tit. 2. 13. A Blessed Hope indeed, if he hath bought our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with his Blood, and an Eternal Inheritance <hi>for us</hi> in the Heavens: A blessed Hope indeed, if also at his Coming we be certainly carried thither. No marvel then if Saints be bid to wait for it, and if Saints themselves long for it. But what a disappointment would these waiting Believers have, should all their expectations be rewarded with a Fable? and the result of their Blessed Hope can amount to no more, if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the Lord Jesus Christ, either denieth to come, or coming, bringeth not with him the HOPE, the blessed HOPE that is laid up for us in Heaven: <hi>Whereof we have certainly been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Word of the Truth of the Gospel,</hi> Col. 1. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>For Christ was once offered to bear the Sin of many, and unto them that look for him, shall he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the second Time, without sin unto Salvation,</hi> Heb. 9. 28. Here we have it promised that he shall come, that he shall appear the second time, but not with sin, as he did before, to wit, with, and in the Sin of his People when he bare them in his own Body; but <hi>now</hi> without sin, for he <hi>before</hi> did <hi>put them away by the Sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> Now then let the Saints look for him, not to die for the purchasing of their persons by Blood, but to bring to THEM, and to bring
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54303:80"/>
them also to that Salvation, that before, when he died, he obtained of God for them by his Death.</p>
               <p>These things are to be expected therefore, by them that believe in, and love Jesus Christ, and that from faith and love serve him in this world; they are to be expected by them, being obtained <hi>for</hi> them by Jesus Christ: And he shall give the Crown, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> not only to me, but to them that love his Appearing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Now forasmuch as this Inheritance in the Heavens is the Price, Purchase, and Reward of his Blood; how evidently doth it appear, that he hath paid full price to God for Sinners? Would God else have given him the Heaven to dispose of to us that believe, and would he else have told us so! Yea, and what comfort could we have to look for his Coming, and Kingdom, and Glory, as the Fruits of his Death; if his Death had not for that purpose been sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly efficacious. <hi>O! the Sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that shall follow,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 11.</p>

               <head>The Ninth Demonstration.</head>
               <p>THat Jesus Christ by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for Sinners, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Eternal Redemption for Sinners is evident,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54303:81"/>
                  <hi>Because of the Threatnings wherewith God hath threatned, and the Punishments wherewith he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished those that shall refuse to be saved by Christ, or seek to make insignificant the Doctrine of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by Faith in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Demonstration consisteth of three parts.</p>
               <p>1. It suggesteth that some refuse to be justified or saved by Christ, and also seek to make insignificant the Doctrine of Righteousness by Faith in him.</p>
               <p>2. That God doth threaten these.</p>
               <p>3. That God will punish these.</p>
               <p>That some refuse to be saved by Christ is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from many Texts. He is the Stone which the Builders have rejected: He is also disallowed of Men: The Jews stumble at him, and to the Greeks he is foolishness; both saying this Man shall not rule over us, or how can this man save us? <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 42. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 14.</p>
               <p>The Causes of mens refusing Christ are many.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Their Love to sin.</item>
                  <item>2. Their Ignorance of his Excellency.</item>
                  <item>3. Their Unbelief.</item>
                  <item>4. Their Deferring to come to him in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Time.</item>

                  <item>6. Their entertaining Damnable Doctrines.</item>
                  <item>7. Their loving the praise of Men.</item>
                  <item>8. The meanness of his Ways, his People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>9. The just Judgment of God upon them.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:54303:81"/>10. The Kingdom is given to others.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now these, as they all refuse him, so they seek more or less, some practically, others in practice and judgment also, to make insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant the Doctrine of Righteousness by Faith in him.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. One does it by preferring his Sins before him.</item>
                  <item>2. Another does it by preferring his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness before him.</item>
                  <item>3. Another does it by preferring his Delusions before him.</item>
                  <item>4. Another does it by preferring the World before him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now these God threatneth, these God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth.</p>
               <p>First, God threatneth them. <hi>Whosoever shall not receive that Prophet, shall be cut off from amongst his People,</hi> Acts 3. 23. The Prophet is Jesus Christ; the Doctrine that he preached was that he would lay down his Life for us, that he would give us his Flesh to eat, and his Blood to drink by Faith: and promised, that if we did eat his Flesh, and drink his Blood, <hi>we should have Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi> He therefore that seeth not, or that is afraid to venture his Soul for Salvation on the Flesh and Blood of Christ by Faith, he refuseth this Prophet, he heareth not this Prophet; and him God hath purposed to cut off. But would God thus have threatned, if Christ by his Blood
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54303:82"/>
and the Merits of the same, had not paid full price to God for Sinners, and obtained Eternal Redemption for them.</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>Sit thou on my Right Hand until I make thine Enemies thy Foot-stool,</hi> Psal. 110. 1. Mat. 22. 44. Heb. 1. 13. The Honour of sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at God's Right Hand, was given him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he died, and offered his Body once for all. <hi>This Man when he had offered up one Sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the Right Hand of God, from henceforth expecting till his Enemies be made his Foot-stool,</hi> Heb. 10. 11, 12, 13. Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, since God accepted his Offering, that those that refused him should be trodden under foot, that is, sunk by him into, and under endless &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable vengeance. But would God have given the World such an account of his Sufferings, that by one Offering he did perfect for ever them that are sanctified? yea, and would he have threatned to make those foes his Foot stool, that shall refuse to venture themselves upon his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering (for they are indeed his Foes) had not his Eternal Majesty been well pleased with the Price he paid to God for Sinners; had he not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eternal Redemption for them?</p>
               <p>Thirdly. <hi>He shall come from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming-fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Here he expresly telleth us wherefore they shall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54303:82"/>
be punished: Because they know not God, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, where also is notably intimated that he that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Gospel of Christ, knoweth not God, neither in his Justice or Mercy. But what is the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, but good tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of good things; to wit, Forgiveness of Sins by Faith in his Blood, an Inheritance in Heaven by Faith in his Blood, as the whole of all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going discourse hath manifested? Now, I say, can it be imagined that God would threaten to come upon the World with this Flaming-Fiery-Vengeance to punish them for their Non-subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Sons Gospel, if there had not been by himself paid to God full price for the Souls of Sinners; if he had not obtained Eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his Blood for Sinners?</p>
               <p>Fourthly. <hi>And</hi> Enoch, <hi>the seventh from</hi> Adam <hi>also prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly among them of all their ungodly Deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard Speeches which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him,</hi> Jude 14. 15.</p>
               <p>The LORD that is here said to come with ten thousands of his Saints, is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself: and they that come with him are called <hi>his Saints,</hi> because given to him by the Father, for the Sake of the shedding of his Blood. Now in that he is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54303:83"/>
said to come to execute judgment upon all, and especially those that speak hard Speches against him; 'tis evident that the Father tendereth his <hi>Name</hi> which is, Jesus, a Saviour, and his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking for our Redemption; and as evident that the hard Speeches, intended by the Text, are such as vilify him, <hi>as Saviour,</hi> counting the Blood of the Covenant, <hi>unholy,</hi> and trampling him, that is Prince of the Covenant under the Feet of their reproachful Language; this is counted a putting of him to open shame, and a despising the riches of his Goodness, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. Time would fail to give you a view of the revilings, despiteful sayings, and of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Speeches which these abominable Children of Hell, let fall in their Pamplets, Doctrines, and Discourses, against this Lord the King. But the threatning is, He shall execute judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for all their ungodly Deeds, and for all their hard Speeches that ungodly Sinners have spoken against him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly. <hi>Take heed therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the Prophets: Behold, ye Despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a Work in your days, a Work which you shall in no wise believe, though a Man declare it unto you,</hi> Act. 13. 40, 41.</p>
               <p>This Work is the same we have been all this while treating of, to wit, Redemption by the Blood of Christ for Sinners, or that Christ hath
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54303:83"/>
paid full price to God for Sinners, and obtained Eternal Redemption for them. This is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest from <hi>ver.</hi> 23 to <hi>ver.</hi> 29. of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now, observe, there are, and will be Despis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this Doctrine, and they are threatned with the Wrath of God. <hi>Behold, ye Despisers, and wonder, and perish:</hi> But would God so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have cautioned Sinners to take heed of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising this Blessed Doctrine,</hi> and have backed his Caution with <hi>a threatming that they shall perish,</hi> if they persist, had not himself received by the Blood of Christ full price for the Souls of Sinners?</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>As God threatneth, so he punisheth those that refuse his Son, or that seek to vilify or make insignificant, the Doctrine of Righteousness by Faith in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. He punisheth them with the abidings of his Wrath. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Joh. 3. 36.</p>
               <p>The Wrath of God for men; for sin stands already condemned by the Law; &amp; the Judgment is, that <hi>they who refuse the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> shall have this Wrath of God for ever lie, and abide upon them: For they want a Sacrifice to pacific wrath for the Sin they have committed, having resisted, and refused the Sacrifice of the Body of Christ. Therefore it cannot be that they should get from under their present condition who have refused to accept of the undertaking of Christ for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:54303:84"/>Besides, God to shew that he taketh it ill at the Hands of Sinners, that they should refuse the Sacrifice of Christ, hath resolved that <hi>there shall be no more Sacrifice for sin. If therefore we sin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully after we have received the Knowledg of the Truth; there remaineth no more Sacrifice for sin,</hi> Heb. 10. 26. God doth neither appoint ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither will he accept another who-ever brings it. And here those sayings are of their own natural force; <hi>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great Salvation!</hi> And again, <hi>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh, for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on Earth,</hi> (Moses) <hi>How shall we escape if we turn away from him</hi> (Christ) <hi>that speaketh from Heaven!</hi> Heb. 2. 3. Chap. 12. 25.</p>
               <p>This therefore is a mighty Demonstration that Christ by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for the Souls of Sinners, because God so severely threatneth, and also punisheth them that refuse to be justified by his Blood: he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as you have heard, and punisheth by leaving such men in their Sins, under his heavy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable Vengeance here.</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>He that believeth not shall be damned,</hi> Mar. 16. 16. damned in Hell-Fire. He that believeth not, but what should he believe? Why!</p>
               <p>1. That Jesus is the Saviour. <hi>If,</hi> saith he, <hi>ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:54303:84"/>2. He that believeth not that he hath undertaken and compleatly perfected Righteousness for us, shall die in his Sins, shall be damned and perish in Hell-fire: For such have no cloak for their Sin, but must stand naked to the shew of their Shame before the Judgment of God, that fearful Judgment. Therefore, after he had said, there remains for such, no more sacrifice for sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he adds, <hi>But a certain fearful looking for of judgment;</hi> there is for them left nothing <hi>but the Judgment of God,</hi> and his fiery Indignation which shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Adversaries. <hi>He that despised</hi> Moses's <hi>Law died without mercy under two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted the Blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an Unholy thing, and done despite to the Spirit of Grace?</hi> Heb. 10. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>See here, if fury comes not up now into the Face of God: now is mention made of his <hi>fearful</hi> Judgment and <hi>fiery</hi> Indignation. Now, I say, is mention made thereof, when it is suggested that some have light thoughts of him, count his Blood unholy, and trample his Sacrificed Body under the Feet of their Reproaches: <hi>Now is he a Consuming fire,</hi> and will burn to the lowest Hell. <hi>For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto me, I will recompence, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judg his People,</hi> Heb.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54303:85"/>
10. 28, 29, 30. These words are urged by the Holy Ghost, on purpose, to beget in the Hearts of the Rebellious, reverend thoughts, and an high esteem of the Sacrifice which our Lord Jesus offered once for all upon Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> unto God the Father for our Sins; for that is the very argument of the whole Epistle.</p>
               <p>It is said to this purpose in one of <hi>Paul</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> That because men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the Love of the Truth, that they might be saved; <hi>For this cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they should believe a ly and be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 2 Thes. 2.</p>
               <p>The Truth mentioned in the Place, <hi>is Jesus Christ. I am the Truth,</hi> saith he, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. The Love of the Truth, is none else but the Love and Compassion of Jesus Christ, in shedding his Blood for Mans Redemption. <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that a Man lay down his Life for his Friends,</hi> Joh. 15. 13. This then is the Love of the Truth (of Jesus) that he hath laid down his Life for us. Now that the rejectors of this Love, should by this their rejecting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure such wrath of God against them, that rather than they shall miss of damnation, himself will chuse their Delusions for them, and also give them up to the effectual Working of these Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: what doth this manifest, but that God is displeased with them that accept not of Jesus Christ for Righteousness, and will certainly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54303:85"/>
that their end shall be everlasting Damnation; therefore Jesus Christ hath paid full price to God for Sinners, and obtained Eternal Redemption for them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>I come now to make some use of, and to apply this Blessed Doctrine of the Undertaking of Jesus Christ; and of his paying full Price to God for Sinners, and of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Eternal Redemption for them.</p>

                  <head>The first Use.</head>
                  <p>BY this Doctrine, <hi>we come to understand many things which otherwise abide obscure and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unknown,</hi> because this Doctrine is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Holy Ghost, that Revealer of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and Searcher of the deep things of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. The Holy Ghost comes down with this Doctrine, as that in which it alone delighteth: therefore is it called <hi>The Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Jesus Christ. He giveth also the Light of the Knowledg of the Glory of God in the Face of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6. Little of God is known
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54303:86"/>
in the World where the Gospel is rejected: the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Jew, and the Wise Gentile may see more of God in a Crucified Christ, than in Heaven and Earth besides: For <hi>in him are hid all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Wisdom and knowledg:</hi> not only in his Person, as God, but also in his Undertakings as Mediator. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, <hi>That he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to know any thing among the</hi> Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>but Jesus Christ and him Crucified,</hi> Col. 2. 2, 3. 1 Cor. 2. 2, 3. I say more of God is revealed in this Doctrine to us, than we can see of him in Heaven and Earth without it.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Here</hi> is more of <hi>his</hi> WISDOM seen, than in his making, and upholding all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>His Wisdom,</hi> I say, in <hi>devising means</hi> to reconcile Sinners to an Holy and Infinite Majesty, to be a <hi>Just God,</hi> and YET <hi>a Saviour;</hi> to be <hi>just</hi> to his Law, <hi>just</hi> to his Threatning, <hi>just</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and yet save Sinners, can no-way be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood till thou understandest why Jesus Christ did hang on the Tree; for here only is the Riddle unfolded, <hi>Christ died for our Sins,</hi> and therefore can God in justice save us, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 21. And hence is Christ called The Wisdom of God, not only because he is so essentially, but because by him is the greatest Revelation of his Wisdom towards man. In Redemption therefore, by the Blood of Christ, God is said <hi>to abound towards us in all wisdom,</hi> Ephes. 1. 7, 8. Here we see the highest Contradictions reconciled, here Justice
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54303:86"/>
kisseth the Sinner, here a Man stands just in the Sight of God, while confounded at his own Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; and here he that hath done no good, hath yet a sufficient Righteousness; even the Righteousness of God which is by Faith of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The</hi> JUSTICE <hi>of God,</hi> is <hi>here</hi> more seen, than in punishing all the Damned. <hi>He spared not his own Son,</hi> is a Sentence which more revealeth the Nature of the Justice of God, than if it had said <hi>he spared not all the World.</hi> True, he cast Angels from Heaven, and drowned the Old World; he turned <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> into Ashes, with many more of like nature, but what were all these to the Cursing of his Son? yea, what were ten thousand such manifestations of his Ireful Indignation against Sin, to that of strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, afflicting, chastising, and making the darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Bosom the Object of his Wrath and Judgment. Here it is seen he respecteth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but, judgeth sin, and condemneth him on whom it is found; yea although on Jesus Christ his well-Beloved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Mystery of God's</hi> WILL, is <hi>here</hi> more seen, than in hanging the Earth upon nothing; while he condemneth Christ though Righteous, and justifieth us though Sinners: while he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to be sin for us, and us the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:54303:87"/>Fourthly, <hi>The</hi> POWER <hi>of God,</hi> is <hi>here</hi> more seen, than in making of Heaven and Earth; for, for one to bear, and get the Victory over Sin, when charged by the Justice of an Infinite Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, in so doing, he sheweth the Height of the Highest Power: For where sin by the Law is charged, and that by God immediatly, there an Infinite Majesty opposeth, and that with the whole of his Justice, Holiness, and Power: So then, he that is thus charged, and engaged for the Sin of the World, must not only be equal with God, but shew it, by over-coming that Curse and Judgment that by Infinite Justice is charged upon him for Sin.</p>
                  <p>When Angels and Men had sinned, how did they fall and crumble before the Anger of God! they had not power to withstand the terrour, nor could there be worth found in their Persons, or Doings, to appease displeased Justice. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here stands the Son of God before him in the Sin of the World, his Father finding him there, curseth, and condemns him to death: but he by the Power of his God-head, and the Worthiness of his Person and Doings, vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sin, satisfieth God's Justice, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Saviour of the World. Here then is Power seen: Sin is a Mighty thing, it crusheth all in pieces, save him whose Spirit is Eternal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. Set Christ, and his Sufferings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and you neither see the Evil of Sin, nor the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54303:87"/>
Displeasure of God against it; you see them not in their utmost. Had'st thou a view of all the Legions that are now in the pains of Hell, yea, couldest thou hear their shreeks, and groans to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at once, and feel the whole of all their burden: much of the evil of Sin, and of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God against it, would be yet unknown by thee; for thou wouldest want power to feel, and bear the utmost! A Giant shews not his Power, by killing of a little Child, nor yet is his might seen by the resistance that such a little one makes, but then he sheweth his power when he dealeth with one like himself: yea, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er also of the other is then made manifest in sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself from being swallowed up with his Wrath. Jesus Christ also made manifest his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power and God-head, more, by bearing and over-coming our Sins; than in making, or upholding the whole World: Hence Christ Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, is called <hi>the Power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The LOVE <hi>and</hi> MERCY <hi>of God,</hi> is more seen in, and by this Doctrine, than any other way. Mercy and Love are seen in that God gives us Rain and fruitful Seasons, and in that he filleth our Hearts with food and gladness; from that bounty he bestoweth upon us as men, as his Creatures. Oh! but herein is Love made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest <hi>in that Christ laid down his Life for us:</hi> And God commended his Love towards us, <hi>in that</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:54303:88"/>
                     <hi>while we were yet Sinners Christ died for us;</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 16. Chap. 4. 10 Rom. 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>Never Love like this, nor did God ever give such discovery of his Love from the beginning to this Day. <hi>Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is Love, that God sent his Son! his Darling! his Son that never offended! his Son, that was always his delight! Herein is Love that be sent him to save Sinners! to save them by bearing their Sins! by bearing their Curse! by dying their Death! and by carrying their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows! Here is Love in that while we were yet Enemies, Christ died for us! yea, here is Love, <hi>in that while we were yet without strength, Christ died for the Ungodly,</hi> Rom. 5.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="application">
                  <head>The second Use.</head>
                  <p>But Secondly, as this Doctrine giveth us the best discovery of God; so also it giveth us the best discovery of our selves, and our own things.</p>
                  <p>First, It giveth us the best discovery of our selves: Wouldest thou know Sinner, what thou art; <hi>look up to the Cross,</hi> and behold a Weeping, Bleeding, Dying Jesus: nothing could do but that, nothing could save thee but his Blood; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels could not, Saints could not, <hi>God could not,</hi> because he could not ly, because he could not deny himself. What a thing is Sin, that it should
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54303:88"/>
sink all that bear its burden, yea it sunk the Son of God himself into death and the Grave, and had also sunk him into Hell-fire for ever, had he not been the Son of God; had he not been able to take it on his Back, <hi>and bear it away.</hi> O! This Lamb of God. Sinners were going to Hell, Christ was the Delight of his Father, and had a whole Heaven to himself; but that did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him, Heaven could not hold him. <hi>He must come into the World to save Sinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. Ay, and had he not come, thy Sins had sunk thee, thy Sins had provoked the Wrath of God against thee; to thy perdition and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for ever. There is no Man, but is a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, there is no Sin but would damn an Angel, should God lay it to his charge. Sinner, the Doctrine of Christ crucified crieth, therefore, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud unto thee, <hi>that sin hath made thy Condition dreadful:</hi> See your selves, your Sin, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Condition that your Souls are in, by the Death and Blood of Christ; Christs Death giveth us the most clear discovery of the dreadful Nature of our Sins. I say again, if sin be so dreadful a thing as to break the Heart of the Son of God (for so he saith it did) how shall a Poor, Wretched, Impenitent, damned Sinner, wrestle with the Wrath of God. Awake Sinners, you are lost, you are undone, you perish, you are damned, Hell-fire is your Portion for ever, if you abide in your Sins, and be found without
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54303:89"/>
a Saviour in the dreadful Day of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For your good Deeds cannot help you, the Blood of Christ tells you so: For by this Doctrine, <hi>Christ died for our Sins,</hi> God damneth to death and hell, the Righteousness of the World. Christ must die, or Man be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: where is now any room for the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Men? room, I say, for Man's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as to his Acceptance and Justification. Bring then thy Righteousness to the Cross of Jesus Christ, and in his Blood behold the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Justice; behold them, I say, in the Cries, and Tears, in the Blood and Death of Jesus Christ. Look again, and behold the Person dying; such an one as <hi>never</hi> sinned, nor offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>any</hi> time, <hi>yet he dies.</hi> Could an Holy Life, an Innocent, Harmless Conversation have saved one from death, <hi>Jesus had not died.</hi> But he must die, Sin was charged, therfore Christ must die.</p>
                  <p>Men therefore need to go no further to prove the Worth of their own Righteousness, than to the Death of Christ: They need not be to seek in that Matter till they stand before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat.</p>
                  <div type="question">
                     <head>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> But how should I prove the Goodness of mine own Righteousness, by the Death and Blood of Christ?</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Thus: If Christ must die for Sin, then all thy Righteousness cannot save thee. <hi>If Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness comes by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain,</hi> Gal. 2. 21. By this Text 'tis manifest,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54303:89"/>
that either Christ died in vain, or thy Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is vain. If thy Righteousness can save thee, then Christ died in vain. If nothing below, or besides the Death of Christ could save thee, then thy Righteousness is in vain; one of the two must be cast away, either Christ's, or thine. Christ Crucified to save the World, discovereth two great evils in Man's own Righteousness: I mean when brought for Justification and Life.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. It opposeth the Righteousness of Christ.</item>
                        <item>2. It condemneth God of Foolishness.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. It opposeth the Righteousness of Christ; in that it seeketh it self to stand, where should the Righteousness of Christ; to wit, in God's affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the Justification of thy Person, and this is one of the highest affronts to Christ, that poor man is capable to give him: Right worthily therefore, doth the Doctrine of the Gospel damn the Righteousness of Men, and promiseth the Kingdom of God to Publicans and Harlots ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>2. It condemneth God of Foolishness: For if Works of Righteousness which we can do, can justifie from the Curse of the Law in the Sight of God, then is not all the Treasures of Wisdom found in the Heart of God and Christ: For this Dolt-headed Sinner, hath now found out a Way of his own, unawares to God, to secure his Soul from Wrath and Vengeance. I say, unawares to God; for he never imagined that such a thing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54303:90"/>
could be, for had he, he would never have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed before the World began, to send his Son to die for Sinners. Christ is the Wisdom of God, as you have heard, and that as he is our Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteousness. God was manifest in the Flesh to save us, is the great Mystery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But wherein lyeth the depth of this Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in our Salvation, <hi>if Man's Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand can save him?</hi> Job 40. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>Yea, wherefore hath God also given it out, that there is none other Name given to Men, under Heaven whereby we must be saved: I say again, why is it affirmed, without shedding of Blood is no Remission, if Mans good Deeds can save him?</p>
                     <p>This Doctrine therefore of the Righteousness of Christ, being rightly preached, and truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, arraigneth and condemneth Man's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to Hell: It casteth it out, as <hi>Abraham</hi> cast out <hi>Ismael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BLOOD! BLOOD, the sound of <hi>Blood,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baseth all the Glory of it. When Men have said all, and shewed us what they can, they have no Blood to present God's Justice with; yet 'tis <hi>Blood that maketh an Atonement for the Soul,</hi> and nothing but <hi>Blood</hi> can wash us from our Sins, <hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>Justice calls for <hi>Blood,</hi> Sins call for <hi>Blood,</hi> the Righteous Law calls for <hi>Blood;</hi> yea the Devil
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54303:90"/>
himself must be overcome by <hi>Blood:</hi> Sinner where is now thy Righteousness? Bring it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Consuming Fire; [for our God is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming Fire] Bring it before the Justice of the Law: yea try if ought but the Blood of Christ can save thee from thy Sins, and Devils; try it, I say, by this Doctrine; go not one step further before thou hast tried it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By this Doctrine we are made to see, <hi>the worth of Souls:</hi> it cannot be but that the Soul is of Wonderful Price, when the Son of God will not stick to spill his Blood for it. O Sinners, you that will venture your Souls for a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, surely you know not the worth of your Souls. Now if you would know what your Souls are worth, and the Price which God sets them at, read that Price by the Blood of Christ. The Blood of Christ was spilt to save Souls. <hi>For ye are bought with a Price,</hi> and that Price none other than the Blood of Christ; wherefore glorify God in your Bodies and in your Spirits which are Gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. Sinners, you have Souls, can you behold a Crucified Christ and not Bleed, and not Mourn, and not fall in Love with him?</p>

                  <p>By this Doctrine Sinners, as Sinners, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to come to God for mercy, for the Curse due to Sin is taken out of the way. I speak
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54303:91"/>
now to Sinners that are awake, and see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Sinners.</p>
                  <p>There are two things in special when Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be awakened, that kill their thoughts of being saved.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. A Sense of sin.</item>
                     <item>2. The Wages due thereto.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>These kill the Heart, for who can bear up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of Sin? <hi>If our Sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how can we</hi> THEN <hi>live?</hi> Ezek. 33. 10. How indeed! it is impossible. So neither can Man grapple with the Justice of God. <hi>Can thine Heart endure, or can thine Hands be strong?</hi> they cannot. <hi>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> Men cannot, Angels cannot: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if now Christ be hid, and the blessing of Faith in his Blood denied, wo be to them: such go after <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> one to the Sword, and the other to the Halter, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 14. and so miserably end their days; for come to God they dare not, the thoughts of that Eternal Majesty strikes them through.</p>
                  <p>But now present such Poor dejected Sinners with a Crucified Christ, and perswade them that the Sins under which they shake and tremble, was long ago laid upon the Back of Christ, and the <hi>Noise,</hi> and <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> of damning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to cease, depart, and fly away: Dolours, and Terrours fade, and vanish, and that Soul conceiveth hopes of Life. For thus the Soul
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54303:91"/>
argueth, is this indeed the Truth of God, that Christ was made to be Sin for me! was made the Curse of God for me! Hath he indeed born all my Sins, and spilt his Blood for my Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? O blessed Tidings, O welcome Grace! <hi>Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me bless his Holy Name.</hi> Now is peace come, now the Face of Heaven is altered: <hi>Behold all things are become new.</hi> Now the Sinner can abide Gods Presence, yea sees unutterable Glory and Beauty in him: For here he sees Justice smite. While <hi>Jacob</hi> was afraid of <hi>Esau,</hi> how heavily did he drive, even towards the Promised Land? but when <hi>killing</hi> thoughts were turned into <hi>kissing,</hi> and the fears of the Swords Point turned into Brotherly Embraces, what says he, <hi>I have seen thy Face, as though it had been the Face of God, and thou wast pleased with me?</hi> Gen. 33. 10.</p>
                  <p>So, and far better is it, with a poor distressed Sinner at the Revelation of the Grace of God through Jesus Christ. <hi>God was in Christ recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the World unto himself not imputing their Trespasses to them:</hi> O! what work will such a word make upon a wounded Conscience, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the next words follow. <hi>For he hath made him to be Sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Soul sees qualifications able to set him <hi>quit</hi> in the Sight of God: Qualifications <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared already.</hi> Prepared I say <hi>already,</hi> and that by
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54303:92"/>
God through Christ; even such as can perfectly answer the Law. What doth the Law require? If Obedience, <hi>here it is;</hi> if Bloody Sacrifice, <hi>here it is;</hi> if infinite Righteousness, <hi>here it is.</hi> Now then the Law condemns him that Believes, <hi>before God,</hi> no more; for all its Demands are answered, all its Curses are swallowed up in the Death and Curse Christ underwent.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> True, Reason saith so, and so doth the Law it self, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. but God, we know, is above them both, and he in the Covenant of Grace, saith otherwise: to wit, <hi>That if thou shalt confess with thy Mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in thine Heart that God hath raised him from the Dead, thou shalt be saved,</hi> Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                     <p>Let Reason then hold his tongue, yea let the Law with all his Wisdom subject it self to him that made it; let it look for sin where God hath laid it; let it <hi>approve</hi> the Righteousness which <hi>God approveth:</hi> yea though it be not <hi>that</hi> of the Law, <hi>but that by Faith of Jesus Christ.</hi>

                  <head>The fourth use.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>By this Doctrine sufficiency of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ministred to the tempted, to withstand, thereby, the assaults of the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Souls begin to seek after the Lord Jesus, then Satan begins to afflict and distress, as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> did the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> for making Peace with Jehoshuah, <hi>Jos.</hi> 10. 1, 6.</p>
                  <p>There are three things that do usually afflict the Soul that is earnestly looking after Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Dreadful accusations from Satan.</item>
                     <item>2. Grievous defiling and infectious thoughts.</item>
                     <item>3. A strange readiness in our Nature to fall in with both.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>By the first of these the Heart is made continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to tremble. Hence his Temptations are compared to the roaring of a Lyon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. For as the Lyon by roaring killeth the Heart of his Prey, so doth Satan, kill the Spirit of these that hearken to him: For when he tempteth, especially by way of accusation, he doth to us, as <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> did to the Jews: <hi>He speaks to us in our own Language.</hi> He speaks our Sin at every word, our guilty Conscience knows it, he speaks our Death at every word, our doubting Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence feels it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Besides this, there doth now arise
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54303:93"/>
even in the Heart such defiling, and soul infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious thoughts, that putteth the Tempted to their wits end: for now it seems to the Soul that the very flood-Gates of the Flesh are opened, and that to sin there is no stop at all; now the Air seems to be covered with darkness, and the Man is as if he was changed into the nature of a Devil: Now if ignorance and unbelief prevail, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth that he is reprobate, made to be taken and destroyed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Now also he feeleth in him a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to fall in with every temptation; a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I say, continually present, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21. This throws all down, now despair begins to swallow it up; now it can neither pray, nor read, nor hear, nor meditate on <hi>God,</hi> but Fire and Smoke continually bursteth forth of the Heart against <hi>him;</hi> now sin and great confusion puts forth it self in all: yea, the more the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner desireth to do a duty sincerely, the further off it always finds it self: For by how much the Soul struggleth under these distresses, by so much the more doth Satan put forth himself to resist, still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing more poison, that if possible it might never struggle more (for strugglings are also us poison to Satan.) The Fly in the Spider's Webb, is an emblem of the Soul in such a condition; the Fly is entangled in the Webb, at this the Spider shews himself; if the Fly stir again, down comes the Spider to her, and claps a Foot upon her, if
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54303:93"/>
yet the Fly makes a noise, then with poisoned Mouth the Spider lays hold upon her; if the Fly struggle still, then he poisons her more and more; what shall the Fly do now? why she dies, if some-body does not quickly release her. <hi>This is the case of the Tempted, they are entangled in the Webb,</hi> (their Feet and Wings are entangled) <hi>now Satan shews himself, if the Soul now struggleth, Satan laboureth to hold it down; if it now shall make a noise, then be bites with blasphemous Mouth,</hi> (more poisonous than the Gall of a Serpent.) <hi>If it struggle again, then he poisoneth more and more:</hi> infomuch that it needs at last must die in the Net, <hi>if the Man, the Lord Jesus, helps not out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The afflicted Couscience understands my words.</p>
                  <p>Further, though the Fly in the Webb, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uncapable of looking for relief, yet this awakened tempted Christian is not; what must he do therefore? how should he contain hopes of life? If he looks to his Heart there is Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; if he looks to his duties, there is Sin; if he strives to mourn and lament, perhaps he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, unbelief and hardness hinder: shall this Man lie down in despair? No: shall he trust to his duties? No: shall he stay from Christ till his Heart is better? No: What then? Let him NOW look to Jesus Christ Crucified, then shall he see his Sins answered for, then shall he see Death a-dying, then shall he see <hi>Guilt</hi> born by
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54303:94"/>
another, and there shall he see the Devil overcome. This sight destroys the Power of the first Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; purifies the Heart and inclines the Mind to all good things.</p>
                  <p>And to encourage thee, tempted Creature, to this most Gospel-Duty: Consider, that when Jesus Christ read his Commission upon the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Ministry, he proclaimed: <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the Poor, he hath sent me to heal the broken-Hearted, to preach deliverance to the Captives, and recovering of sight to the Blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable Year of the Lord,</hi> Luk. 4. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>These things therefore should the Tempted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but believing is now sweating-work; for Satan will hold as long as possible, and only sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast Faith can make him fly: But O! the Toyl of a truly gracious Heart in this Combate, if Faith be weak, he can scarce get higher than his Knees; Lord help, Lord save, and then down again, till an Arm from Heaven takes him up; until Jesus Christ be evidently set forth Crucified for him, and Cursed for his Sin: for then (and not till then) the Temptation rightly ceaseth, at leastwise for a Season. Now the Soul can tend to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and thus consider with it self: If Christ hath bora my Sin and Curse, then 'tis taken away from me, and seeing thus to take away sin, was the Contrivance of the God of Heaven, I will bless
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54303:94"/>
his Name, hope in his Mercy, and look upon Death and Hell with Comfort. <hi>Thine Heart shall meditate terrour, thou shalt see the Land that is very far off,</hi> Isa. 33. 16, 17, 18.</p>

                  <p>1. How he did deliver me, 'twas with his Life, his Blood; it cost him Tears, Groans, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, Separation from God; to do it he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Fathers Wrath, bare his Fathers Curse,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54303:95"/>
and died thousands of deaths at once.</p>
                  <p>2. He did this, while I was his Enemy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my desires, without my knowledg, without my deserts, he did it unawares to me.</p>
                  <p>3. He did it freely, cheerfully, yea he longed to die for me; yea, Heaven would not hold him for the Love he had to my Salvation, which also he hath effectually accomplished for me at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> Honourable Jesus! precious Jesus! loving Jesus! <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Kindness captivated <hi>David,</hi> and made him precious in his Eyes for ever. <hi>I am distressed for thee my Brother</hi> Jonathan (said he) <hi>very pleasant hast thou been to me; thy Love to me was wonderful, passing the Love of Women,</hi> 2 Sam. 1. 26. Why, what had <hi>Jonathan</hi> done? O! He had <hi>delivered</hi> David <hi>from the Wrath of</hi> Saul. But how much more should he be precious to me, who hath saved me from Death and Hell! who hath delivered me from the Wrath of God! <hi>The Love of Christ constraineth us.</hi> Nothing will so edge the Spirit of a Christian as, <hi>Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy Blood:</hi> This makes the Heavens themselves ring with joy and shouting. Mark the Words, <hi>Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God with thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation, and and hast made us unto our God, Kings, and Priests, and we shall reign on the Earth.</hi> What follows now? <hi>And I beheld, and heard the Voice of many Angels round about the Throne, and the Beasts, and</hi>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:54303:95"/>
                     <hi>the Elders, and the Number of them was ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud Voice, Worthy is the</hi> Lamb <hi>that was slain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Blessing; and every Creature which is in Heaven, and on the Earth, and such as are in the Sea, and all that are therein heard I, saying, Blessing, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Glory, and Power, be unto him that sitteth upon the Throne, and to the</hi> LAMB <hi>for ever and and ever,</hi> Revel. 5. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>Thus also is the Song, that New-Song, that is said to be sung by the Hundred fourty and four thousand which stand with the LAMB upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> with his Fathers Name written in their Fore-heads. These are also called Harpers, Harping with their Harps. <hi>And they sang as it were a new Song before the Throne, and before the four Beasts, and the Elders; and none could learn that Song but the Hundred and fourty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the Earth,</hi> Revel. 14. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>But why could they not learn that Song? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not redeemed; none can sing of this Song but the Redeemed: they can give Glory to the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain, and that redeemed them to God by his Blood. 'Tis Faith in his Blood on Earth, that will make us sing this Song in Heaven. These Shoutings,

and Heavenly Songs must needs come from Love put into a Flame by the Sufferings of Christ.</p>
