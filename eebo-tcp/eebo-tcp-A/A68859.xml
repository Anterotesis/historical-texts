            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The first thinge that a worldly Prince doth, intendinge to make warre againste his enemye, is to muster and choose out his souldiours, and to take their names, and to apparel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his liuerye and badge, that they may be knowen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the souldiours of his aduersary. Euen so Christ our chefe captaine by Baptisme hath called and chosen out of all the people of this world whiche he hath holly redemed, certeine to be his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to fight against his enemy the deuil, which soldiours thus called, haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their names to Christ their kinge, &amp; haue renounced the seruice of their old maister the deuil, who was a tyrant
<pb facs="tcp:114:7"/>
deliting onely in theyr death, and haue promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to serue onely Christ like true souldiours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the deuill, and by this sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme are pardoned and washed from theyr olde spots of originall synne, and haue receyued the whyte lyuerye of innocencye, and the badge of Christ by the impression of the holy crosse in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers partes of theyr bodyes, and so are knowen throughout the holle worlde, to be the soldiours of Christ theyr Lord and Capitayne.</p>
            <p>The second thing that a worldly prince doth in his warre, is to prouyde that euery souldiour be able to fyght, and haue harnes and weapons mete for his body, both to beare of the assaultes of his enemies, and also to inuade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as cause shall requyre: Euen so Christe oure heauenlye Prince hath ordeyned the sacrament of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to make vs strong &amp; able to fyght wyth our ghostly enemyes, and hath armed vs wyth a seuen fold harnes, that is to say, with the seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giftes of the holy gost, whereby we be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preserued, defended, and encouraged our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and also able to helpe and comfort oure fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low soldiours which by chaunce shall come into any distresse or daunger of theyr enemies.</p>
            <p>The thyrd thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a worldly prince doth in his war, is to forese &amp; prouide that his hole army be wel victualled &amp; furnished with ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty of holsom meate and drinke, lest for hunger their strength decay, and they in processe famish and die: Euen so Christ our spirituall capitaine hath prouided victual for vs his soldiours, both good &amp; plenty
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:114:7"/>
of it, not meate that will perish and be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed with once eating, but meate that will remayne and nourishe to euerlasting lyfe, that is to saye, his owne natural fleshe and bloud, which he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to his soldiours in a Sacrament vnder the formes of corporal breade and wyne, condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge therin to our infirmitie, and by that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and most holsome and precious foode, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payreth all our decayes in grace and spirituall strength, he openeth our eyes to see the traynes of oure enemies, he swageth the rage of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enemie the fleshe, &amp; preserueth our bodies and soules from famine and eternall death.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing that a worldly Prince doth in his warre, is to ordeyne ouer his holle army one chiefe lieuetenaunt (if he be absent hym selfe from the fielde) and vnder him officers and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, some of moo, some of fewer, such men as be experte in warre, who can instruct the rest in all feates of warre, howe to fight and ouercome theyr enemies, &amp; can set the holle armye in good araye, and also can by the lawe martiall correct and punish all traytours and offendours. Euen so Christ our Lord and king, after he hath hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ouercommed all his enemies in hys owne person, and is nowe triumphinge with God the father in heauen, and yet hathe his Churche in battayle and conflicte wyth theyr enemies in earth, being absent by his visible presence, and inuisibly and spiritually present amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs, hath ordeined the Sacrament of Order, and by that Sacrament hath elected and chosen out certein
<pb facs="tcp:114:8"/>
expert and connyng men, to whom by impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of handes of Priesthoode, he hath geuen au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorite and commaundement to instruct his sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours in all feates of spirituall warre, agaynst the deuil, and to admit other into the roumes of them that dye or depart, and to comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them that be in conflict, and by vnitie of fayth, charitie, and obedience, to cause the holle army to keepe good araye, and to punishe by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, suche as by apostasie, heresye, or scisme, breake the peace and good order, and by the discipline of this warre of the church, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all other offenders, and to receyue them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne that will amende. And of these men there be certeine degrees and orders, one chefe Lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt of the holle army which was S. Peter, and now is his lawfull successour in the chayre of Christ, gouerning the holle army of Christes Church here in earth, and vnder hym there be in euery Prouince one Archebishoppe, and in euery Citye one Bishoppe, and in euerye Parishe one Priest or Curate to feede, order, encourage, and to gouerne the holle army and euery soldiour of Christes church in euery place.</p>
            <p>The fift thing that a worldly Prince doth in his warre, is when his armye is assembled, wel armed, well victualled, and well ordred and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by good captaines, then to merche forward, &amp; to ioyne in battail with his enemies, in which conflicte, if anye of hys soldiours chaunce to be hurt and wounded, then to cause a Surgean to searche his woundes, and to lay playsters and
<pb n="iiii" facs="tcp:114:8"/>
medicines vnto them, that he beyng made hole, myght enter into his place agayne and fyght a freshe agaynst hys enenemyes.<note place="margin">

               </note> Euen so doth our Sauiour Christ wyth vs, when al we be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into one Churche and spirituall armye by Baptisme, and bee well harnessed wyth Gods graces, and the giftes of the holy Ghost by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and be well vyctualled wyth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious foodes of his owne bodye and blood in the Sacrament of the Aultare, and be set in good araye, and well instructed and encouraged by the rulers and ministers of his churche, hauyng authoritie so to doo by the sacrament of Ordre: then we be ledde by Gods spirite into the wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes of some good purpose or woorke, there to be tempted and assaulted of the deuill. For they that haue the spirit of God, be not idle but occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in some good worke, which the deuill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth and fighteth againste, as muche as he is able to do.

<pb facs="tcp:114:9"/>
vs to our perfit health, maketh vs able to enter the feelde agayne, and to fighte a freshe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste our enemies.</p>
            <p>The sixt thing that a worldly Prince doth in his warre, is when any of his soldiours waxeth aged &amp; feble, and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fight no more, then specially to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort him, &amp; to set a watch, that his enemies steale not priuely vpon him &amp; kil him, when he is not able to defend him selfe. And if the same sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour hath lightly offended in any small matter, and hath not at all times bene so vigilant as the lawes of warre required, yet than gentlye to forgeue him, and to shewe hym that honour at his death, that he shalbe of al the army accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue bene a faythfull soldyoure, and to haue dyed in his princes fauour: Euen so Christ our Lord doth wyth vs his souldiours, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vs waxeth aged or feable by sicknes, and is in daunger of bodelye death, whiche deathe is the escapinge of al daungers, the ende of all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the entry to the possession of eternall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce in heauen, whiche God promysed to all his faythfull soldiours, and knowinge that our enemye the deuyll is moost busye and fearce than craftelye to assault his soldiour in his laste conflicte, when he is lest able to resiste, because the body that corrupteth and dieth, dothe make heauye the soule: than I saye our sauiour Christ by the sacrament of extreme Unction, dothe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlye anoynte the sycke soldiour, whereby he doth replenishe him with grace, comforte, and strength of the holy Ghoste, againste the many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:114:9"/>
and violent tentations of the deuyll, and doth releue his hart with spirituall ioy agaynste the horrour of death, and if he hath lightly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in any venyall synne, he pardoneth him, and if he thinke it so expedient to his soule health, he doth also sometime releue his corporall dissease, and if not, yet he sheweth him that honour, that he doth and woulde the holle church shoulde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt him as a faythful soldiour, and if he hath not refused the benefite of his other Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, to haue departed this transitorye life in hys moste gracious fauoure, and to haue chaunged the short and light afflictions of thys tyme with the weighty and euerlasting glorye in the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen.</p>
            <p>The seuenth and laste thinge that a worldlye prince doth, is if the tyme of hys warre be prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and further continued, and many of his sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours be slaine or departed, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to prouide that his armye be fullye restored agayne wyth some new and fresh souldiours, and to vse them as he did the other before: Euen so doth our Sauiour Christ, because all the tyme of this worlde is the time of our battayle and conflicte of oure ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemies, in which tyme a great numbre of the souldiours of Christ departe out of thys transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie life, some in the fauour of their prince, and so be rewarded, and some in his displeasure, such as haue fled traiterously to the deuyll their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, &amp; haue turned their face against Christ their prince: therfore he hath ordeyned the sacrament of Matrimonie, speciallye for thys cause, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store

By thys example &amp; similitude of warre, I haue declared vnto you (good people) bothe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of the Sacramentes of Christes Catholyke church which be seuen, and also generally the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes and vertues of them all, and what fruit and benefite we take thereby.</p>

The outwarde visible thing is the element or matter of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the inwarde inuisyble and spyrituall thynge is the grace and vertue of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The inwarde grace is signified, conteined and geuen, by the outwarde part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The graces of the Sacramentes be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and ordeyned of God to heale the sinnes of the soule of man, and because man principally dyd synne by the consent of hys reason, and yet tooke occasion to sinne of the sensualitie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre of his fleshe: therefore hath God tempered the medicine of hys Sacramentes accordynge to mans disease, that the chiefe parte whyche is

            <p>Firste it is to be knowen that oure Sauiour Christ did institute and ordeine this sacrament, when after his resurrection appearynge to hys disciples he sayde to them: <hi>All power in heauen and in earthe is geuen vnto me,</hi>

And also wee learne that the forme and maner of baptisynge, is to do as he commaunded, and in so doyng, to saye these wordes: <hi>I baptise the in the name of the father, and of the sonne, and of the holy ghost.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:114:13"/>
And we learne also that Christ doth by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse assist the doyng of his minister, and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the same effectes by Baptisme, when it is duely ministred of a man, as if he did minister it himself. And last of al we learne that Baptisme is not an ydle ceremonie, but that euerye person which is baptised, and beyng of age and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion oughte to bee taughte before the faythe of Christe, and to beleue the same, and than after Baptisme, ought dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to obserue and keepe all thinges whych Christe hathe commaunded.

            <p>Secondarilye it is to be vnderstanded that Baptisme oughte to be ministred in water, as Christ hath ordeined, and in no other licour, and that is, because Baptisme is a sacrament of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, and water is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon element through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, and therfore it is ordeined to be ministred in water, that no man might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse hymselfe for lacke of matter, and so come in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of dampnation for lack of Baptisme.

As in baptisme a man lying in sinne was set vp vpon his feete, and made able to walke in the wayes of god, which be mercy and trueth: so in Confirmation he is staied from fallynge, and made able to indure the paines of the iourney, &amp; to passe through the straites and daungers that may chaunce.

meate of Christ, whiche is to do the wyll of hys father, and also with that drinke which causeth a fountayne of water to be in theym, springinge vp to euerlastinge lyfe: if at anye tyme we lacke these vertues, or be slacke in vsynge of theym, than lette vs praye that oure daylye breade may be geuen vnto vs thys daye, by vertue whereof we beyng susteyned and made stronge, myghte come to that perfyt fulnesse and satietie whyche shall admitte no hunger or thyrst any more euer after.</p>
            <p>The fyft darte of the deuyll is couetousnesse, for when he perceyueth a man encouraged to do good, and serue God, by the gift of fortitude and strength, he laboureth al he canne to turne that his constancie and strengthe to a wronge ende, that is to saye, from the fulfillinge of Gods law and mainteyninge of his truthe, to the greedye and vnsatiable appetyte of fulfilling the desyres of the worlde, and to the mayntenaunce of vyce and errour, and tempteth him further to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate and stony harted in vnmercyfulnes, and so in processe for hope of gayne not to regarde crafte, deceipte, violence or treason.</p>
            <p>Againste this darte of Couetousnesse, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Ghoste armeth vs with the gift of counsell, that oure courage and strengthe maye be stayed and dyrected to the right ende, that is to saye, to the contempte and despisinge of the vanitye of thys worlde,<note place="margin">

               </note> and not to truste in the vncertayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of riches, but to trust in the liuing God, and to do good to all we can, and to be riche in good

woorkes, beinge readye to geue parte of that God hathe sent, and to store vp a good treasure in the nexte worlde, to the attayninge of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge lyfe. And by thys gyfte of counsell we bee armed not to leane to oure owne strength, nor to the power of anye multitude, nor to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie of minde, but to the helpe of God, and for the glorye of hys name. So that thys gifte of fortytude, woorketh the vertue of merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, whereby a man vseth the worlde, not as the deuyll tempteth hym, to fulfyll hys greedy appetite, which like dropsye wyll neuer be sati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, but to the reliefe of the poore, the defence of the innocent, the forgeuinge of the offendour, and the mayntenaunce of the truthe. For suche a man is happye, and shall receyue greater mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie at Gods hand. And therefore when we lacke this gifte, or doe not vse it, let vs fyrste forgeue them that haue offended vs, and than pray that our debtes may likewise be forgeuen vnto vs, and that is the verye practyse of thys gyfte of counsell, and the direction of oure spirytuall strength and fortitude.</p>
            <p>The syxte darte of the deuell is gluttonye, for when he hathe mooued a man to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and ioye in these outwarde and worldlye thynges, he tempteth hym speciallye to followe that pleasure that is most naturall to his fleshe, and not to be content with that the necessitye of nature requireth, but to lette pleasure haue hys wyll, eyther in excedynge measure, or in to
<pb facs="tcp:114:39"/>
much delicatenes, and preparation for the same, wherupon foloweth the decaye of healthe, and subuersion of reason. For commonly wher there is a full belly, there is also a dull witte, for that cause the holye Ghoste hath armed vs wyth the gift of vnderstandinge, out of whiche procedeth the vertue of clennes of hart, that our spirituall eyes maye be simple, and refuse to be made dull with the stuffing of our bellies, and our hartes maye be cleane and pure from the corruption of the flesh, not loden with surfeting and dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to thintent we might escape the sayde vyce of glotonie, and be promoted to so greate happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as to see God, whiche no man can do except the mist of ignoraunce, errour, and vncleane ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge be taken from his eyes by faythe and the gift of vnderstanding. And therfore least these tentations of the fleshe specially concerninge the nourishing and pamperinge of the same, do hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs from true vnderstanding, and the syghte of God which he hath promised to all them that be simple and cleane of hart: let vs dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly pray that he suffer vs not to be led into temptation.</p>
            <p>Finally the last of the deuils dartes is lechery which is the vylest kind of sinne of al other, &amp; the sonest is a man tempted vnto it, if the deuil haue any enteraunce before, eyther by ydlenesse, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse or dronkennesse.

This olde trueth the Churche learneth of Christes owne woordes. For where as it was but one thinge or substance which our Sauiour Christ gaue out of his hand to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to eate, whiche one thinge he saied plainly was his body which shoulde be geuen for them, and in saying so, made it so to be by hys almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie word, for that cause the holy church beleueth that it is not breade but his very bodye in dede.

If the word of Helyas was able to bringe fyre from heauen, shall not the worde of Christ be able to chaunge the substaunce of breade? therefore vppon thys grounde of gods almightye power, we submitte our reason to our fayth, and aboue the reache of

For as he that is cleane, may come euerye daye, so he that is vnclene, and is not penitent for hys synne, he may not come at those dayes, which by the Churche be appointed.

If any man haue an enemye by whom he is hurt or offended, let him dissolue his enmitie, and refrayne his hote affection and swelling of minde, that his soule be quiet wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble or tumult. For by thys blessed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion thou shalte receiue the kynge into thy soule, and when the kynge entreth, there ought to be greate quietnes, silence, and peace. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thyne hurt or iniury shewed by thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be very gret, yet thou must remit it. Because thine enemy hath hurt thee, wilt thou therefore hurt thy selfe more? whatsoeuer he hath done, it can not be so great harme to the, as thou doest to thy self, if thou be not reconciled vnto him.

For he that is iudge and ruler of hys owne wyll, when he commeth to Baptisme, he can not beginne a new life, except he take repentaunce for hys old, and he must haue hope and loue to be made that he was not, and hate that he was.

But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth of Gods woorde doth define the nature of God to be vnpassible, we must vnderstand that nowe although God doth punish and afflict vs, yet he doth it not with passible anger, but wyth moste vnspeakeable clemencie, with thaffection of him that healeth, and not of him that punisheth, and for that cause he verye gladlye receyueth the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, seyng that God doth not punish for hym selfe sake (as I sayde before) as it were auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hys owne quarell and iniurye agaynst the synner for Gods nature receyueth no such pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into it self) but he doth al for our profit. For our profytte and correction he doth punishe, not to reuenge hymselfe, but to amende vs. He that abydeth styll in the hardnesse of his hart, is lyke to a man that turneth hys eyes from the lyghte whyche dothe no harme to the lyghte, but bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth hym selfe into darkenesse: Euen so he that throughe an vnpatient harte thynketh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the power of God, hurteth in God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge, but secludeth hymselfe from all healthe and saluation.</p>
            <p>If a Phisician suffer a lytle iniurye of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient vexed wyth a phrensye, or distempered in hys brayne, yet is he not greued wyth the same, nor yet angrye, but dothe all thynges that his
<pb facs="tcp:114:97"/>
arte of Phisicke requyreth, althoughe hys pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient seemeth too bee greeued wyth hys medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, whyche greefe is not auengynge of the Phisitians iniurye, but a curynge of the patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes maladye. And if the sycke man begynne a lytle to amende in hys health, ye shall see by and by the Phisitian reioyce, and wyth more glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doo the rest of hys cure, not remembrynge the iniurye he suffered before, but procuring the patientes healthe more and more. Howe muche more almyghtye GOD, when we fall into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme madnesse of the soule, is not moued wyth the affection of vengeaunce for the offences we haue done agaynste hym, but is desyrous too heale the olde rotten sores of synne that are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted wythin vs, for the whyche he saythe and dothe all thynges, as onelye tenderynge oure health, not delited wyth our payne. Such is the goodnes of God towardes man, he neuer refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth penaunce, if it be symplye and purelye offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto hym. Althoughe a man were come to the heyght of synne, and yet from thence would returne agayne to the waye of vertue, he recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth hym, hee moste fatherlye embraceth hym, and dothe all thynges to reuoke hym to his first state agayne, and also whyche is greater and more excellent than all thys, althoughe a man coulde not fulfyll all the order of satisfaction, yet he refuseth not hys penaunce howe small, howe shorte so euer it bee done, but accepteth the same, and suffereth hym not to loose the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of hys conuersion, be it neuer so lytle.

For whiche cause we often see that manye whiche began laste, are by their faithful endeuour made formest. It is not so euil to take a fal, as it is to lye styl after the fall, and not to rise againe, and with a certeine pleasure &amp; determination of mind to walter styl in sinne, &amp; at last to cloke and couer his noughty purpose of sinning still vnder the wordes of desperation.

But when we come to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the thinge, and beginne to goe throughe a lytle of the laboure, than is all the feare of the gryefe dryuen cleane awaye.

The gates of this citie desperation hath shutte, but hope shall open theym, and sure confydence

shall make the entree large and brode. When the soule begynneth to despayre of saluation, it regardeth not then after what sorte, or into what vice it caste it selfe, it feareth to dooe or to speake nothinge that maye be contrarye to her saluation. And as we see often in theim that bee madde, when they haue once loste the staye of theyr ryghte mynde, then they feare nothynge, nor bee ashamed of nothinge, but are bolde to speake, and doe whatsoeuer they liste, thoughe they shoulde fall into the fyre, or into a depe pyt, they stick not nor pull not back theyr foote: euen so they that be taken with desperation, are made intollerable, and runne throughe the wayes of iniquitie, neither shame, nor feare letteth theym, neyther presente miserye dothe stoppe them, nor payne to come dothe affraye them, onelye deathe whiche they can not auoyde, endeth the execucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theyr malice.

               </note> that sinners put on and are clad with incorruption, that is to saye, not to the honour of lyfe, but to the eternitie of paine. The violence of thys payne and the power of thys fyre no tonge can expresse. For in corruptible thinges, there is nothinge like that can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to thynges incorruptible, whether it bee good or euyll. Yet let vs imagyne at least some image of that fyre and paine. Remember when a man is inflamed with the vehemente heate of a burnynge ague, what anguyshe, what torment is bothe in the bodye and soule? Nowe of thys temporall payne, measure howe greate the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes be whyche that eternall fyre dothe cause, which the fyerye floude that runneth before the horryble iudgement seate of Christe dothe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowe with his flambye waues. What shall we do there? What maye we aunswere? There shall nothing be there but gnashing of teeth, but hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and weping and late repentaunce, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> help shall cease, and paines increase on euery syde, nor there is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte any where, no man shal come to our sight, but onelye the ministers of paynes, and the vggelye faces of the tormentours, and that is mooste greuous of all, there shall bee no comforte of the ayre and lyghte. For rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the places of paynes shall bee outewarde

darknesse, and that flambynge fyre which as it hathe the nature not to consume and destroye, so it hath not to geue light, but it is a dark fyre, and a blacke flambe, to theym that remayne therein. What horrible trembling, what resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as it were a meltinge of his bodye and bowelles, what rentinge of hys fleshe and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, what and howe greate affliction is in all sences, no speache can expresse. There be dyuers and sondry facions of paynes, and in euerye man and woman according to the number and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of synnes, are multiplied the paines. And yf thou woulde saye, howe can a body suffice to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure so great paynes, whyche knoweth no ende of tyme: Consider what chaunceth some tymes in this life, and of a lytle, coniecture the greate. Howe sometymes we see some wasted wyth a longe disease, and yet can fynde no ende of their wretched and hatefull lyfe. But althoughe the body is sometyme dissolued by death, yet the soul is not consumed. Wherupon it foloweth, that when the bodye likewise shall receiue immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, neyther than the soule nor the bodye canne with any paine be vtterly destroyed. For in thys present lyfe it can not chaunce that the payne of the body shoulde be bothe vehement and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, but the one geueth place to the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the frailtye of the bodye can not sustayne bothe. But when bothe are made incorruptible then maye the payne rage at wyll, and fynde no ende. Let vs not thinke that the extremytye of oure torment shall make an ende of our sorowe,
<pb n="xcvii" facs="tcp:114:105"/>
but as we sayed, oure sinnes shall kindle oure payne, and incorruption of bodye and soule shall without end continue the same. And if it were so that equall time and all one space were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the pleasure here and for the payne there, shoulde there be any man so folishe and so madde, that woulde chose for one daye of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to suffer one daye of payne, when as the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe of one houre and euery torment of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, is wonte to make vs forgette all tyme paste in pleasure before? But now, where as it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in a shorte time, yf we conuert to God, to escape all these tormentes of paines, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne eternall ioye: why doe wee lynger, why do we tarye, and do not vse the largenesse and free gyfte of GOD? The vnspeakeable and infinite goodnesse of God, hathe alreadye prouided, not to extend the tyme of our laboures and conflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, nor to make it longe or eternall, but shorte, and as I might say, a moment of an houre. This is euen the life present, yf it be compared to the lyfe eternall. The goodnesse of God hath therefore prouided that in thys lytle shorte lyfe shoulde be oure conflictes and labours, and in that whyche is eternall shoulde be the crowne and rewarde of oure merytes, that oure labours shoulde soone be ended, and the rewarde of oure merites should endure for euer. But this, like as it reioyseth them that through pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of labour receiue the crowne: So it tormenteth and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them in tyme to come, that see them selues for a short time of pleasure, to haue lost eternall

                  <hi>ii. Cor. vi.</hi>
               </note> nowe is the daye of repentaunce. But if we neglect oure lyfe, there remaineth for vs not onelye those euils whyche we shall suffer in hell, but an euill more greuous then all that. To be excluded from all goodnes, and to be depriued of suche ioyes as be ordeyned for sayntes, doth engender such a griefe, suche a sorowe, that if no other did otherwyse vexe vs, that alone might suffyce. The lacke of the glorye whiche we had in our power to enioy, passeth all the tormentes that be in hell. For when the holle vniuersall worlde shall come to iudgemente, to be iudged of that iudge, that nedeth no witnes, that seketh no proues, that admytteth no ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, but all these set aparte, he himselfe disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth and sheweth abrode both dedes, wordes, and thoughtes, and euery thing as it were pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in certeine tables, he layeth open before the eyes of them that did them, &amp; of them that stand by: How shall not euery creature then shake and stand in great feare? And if then the floud of fyre did not ouerflow the worlde, nor the terrible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels assist God, and if there were no face &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible sight of tormentes, but onely this, that yf men were called forth before the kinge and some should be accompted worthye prayse and honor, and other wyth shame, rebuke, and confusyon, abiected out of syght.

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E haue learned (good people) by the woordes of holye scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and by the publicke and vniforme teaching of Chrystes vniuersall church, that penance is the onely medicine after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tysme to heale the dyseases of our synnefull soules, and the onelye meane or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned of Chryste to reconcile vs againe to the fauour of almighty god, whom by our sinne and the transgression of his lawe we had greuouslye offended. And to thintent that euery man might vse thys holsome medicine after the true sorte, and in suche wyse as it maye bee acceptable to God and profitable to his health and saluation: I shall (by Goddes grace) declare vnto you at this time, whiche be the partes of penaunce, and than principally rest in the declaringe of the first parte.<note place="margin">

               </note> Penaunce whiche is perfite and fruitfull hath three partes, Contrition in hart, Confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mouthe, Humilitie, or satisfaction in woorke.

<pb facs="tcp:114:110"/>
whiche presupposeth the sorowe we take for oure offences, and contrarye to the maner of all worldlye courtes, because wee dooe not stande in defence of oure owne dedes, but plead giltie before GOD, who hathe promysed to pardone al them that conuerte and humble them selues before him, therefore sentence of absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and free pardone is graunted to vs by hym that wylleth not the deathe of a synner, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his conuersion and life. Whiche sentence is putte in execucion when the party gylty submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him selfe voluntarilye to the correction and discipline of his mercyefull Iudge, or of hys mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in his name. And by thys wee maye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that of this Sacrament there be the three partes we spake of before.</p>
            <p>Nowe concernynge the fyrste parte, (it is to bee knowen) that Contrition is an inwarde so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe and repentaunce whiche a sinner wylling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye taketh for hys synnes for the loue of GOD: whome he hathe so vnkindelye offended, for the whiche he fully purposeth to sinne no more, but to kepe Christes commaundementes truely, and to make restitution, and to confesse his offences, and to doo satisfaction for theim, as he shall bee enioyned. This is the Contrition and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce that euerye synner muste take for hys synnes, and (for better knowledge of the same) lette euery manne marke well euerye point and parte of it.</p>
            <p>Firste that is an inwarde sorowe whiche is taken, not for any naturall inclination, as for
<pb n="cii" facs="tcp:114:110"/>
that sinne of it selfe is dishoneste, or bringeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy and slaunder to the doer, for suche sorowe is not true contrition, because it proceadeth not from faith which is the foundation of penaunce,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug. de fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ad Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum. cap. xxxi.</hi>
               </note> whyche no man can do except GOD with hys grace preuent hym, and freelye by hys mercye conuerte him: nor yet onely procedeth from feare of punishement eyther temporall or eternall, for that declareth that the sinner dothe not nor woulde not forsake his sinne,<note place="margin">

               </note> if he knewe that he myghte continue in the same styll wythoute anye payne or punishemente, but it proceadeth from the loue of GOD, whose maiestye wee haue offended, and therefore are angry with our selues and hate that oure noughtye sinne wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we did offend, &amp; had rather suffer any paine be it neuer so greate than to offende him againe. This is the true sorow of Contrition whiche is taken for our sinnes, principally for this respect, that we haue offended our most merciful father, whiche contrition he wyll neuer despise, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue to mercye all those that with so pure an harte doe turne to him. Blessed Saincte Peter in the repentaunce that hee tooke for hys synne, left an example howe we might haue true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, whiche is to dooe as he dydde.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat. xxvi.</hi>
               </note> For hee was verye sorye and wepte bytterlye for hys of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence alone by him selfe: And yet he did not so for any bodely hurt, that he had for denyinge of hys master our sauior Christ, nor for any losse that he had of worldlye goodes, nor for any rebuke that
<pb facs="tcp:114:111"/>
was geuen hym for hys denyall, nor yet for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye feare that the Iewes woulde haue put hym to shame because he had denyed his maister, for he knewe they woulde neyther hurte hym nor blame him, but rather fauoure him for it. But these thynges caused him to be sory and to wepe for his sinne. First he did remember and consider the great perfection, holynes and goodnes of his maister, and howe he was the verye sonne of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and also he remembred how he had taken him and made him his disciple, and howe great fauour &amp; singuler kindnesse he had shewed him, for the which he considered how feruentlye he loued Christe and how greatly he was boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den so to doe. And than he remembred the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse he hadde made vnto him, and how vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful he was in breaking that promise, and vnkind in denyinge and forsakinge his mayster. And thus the remembringe and consideringe of these thynges, caused Sayncte Peter to bee contryte and to wepe for hys synne, and to wyshe that he had not denied Christ, and further to wyll that he woulde neuer offende agayne nor breake hys promyse anye more, but euer keepe and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyll iustelye all that euer his maister our Sauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure Chryste didde commaunde hym to do. And so Sainte Peter dyd. After this maner shoulde we consider our sinnes and be sory &amp; contrite for them. Surely if we sinners did call diligently to our reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce the gret goodnes of our sauior Christ euer shewed vnto vs, as how he redemed
<pb n="ciii" facs="tcp:114:111"/>
vs with his moste precious bloud and painefull deathe, and hathe chosen vs to his disciples and made vs inherytours vnto heauen, and howe mercyfull and gratious he is alwayes vnto vs, and howe holye iust, reasonable, laudable, and howe easye a lawe he hath geuen vs, and than consider further particularly and more in specy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hys goodnesse and that he hathe done and doth dayly for vs, we shoulde than see that wee ought to loue, laude, and honour him aboue all creatures and fulfyll hys commaundementes whyche wee haue vowed and promysed to dooe. And than yf we did consyder the vylenesse and noughtinesse of our sinnes, and howe muche we did againste naturall reason and honestie in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge of them, and howe greatlye we dyd offende God in presuminge to doe so euill in his presence and fighte againste his lawe, and in breakinge our solemne promisse of kepinge his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, and than if wee dyd consider that in doinge of our sinnes we did not regarde his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious goodnes and fauour, nor feare his power and most dreadfull punishement, if we did well consider these thinges, &amp; were fullye perswaded of Goddes mercye whiche he is readye to shewe to all that vnfeynedlye wyll forsake theyr for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer noughtye wayes and turne to hym: wee shoulde than take this contrition, and see that wee oughte to be more sorye for oure synnes, than Saynt Peter ought to haue bene for hys. For oure Sauioure Chryste hadde shewed vs more kyndenesse and hadde doone more for vs
<pb facs="tcp:114:112"/>
than he hadde done for Saincte Peter at that tyme. For he dyed afterwarde for oure sakes and redemed vs, and delyuered vs oute of the handes of the Deuyll. And againe our sinnes bee moo, and wee haue oftener broken oure promyse than Sayncte Peter didde, for hee brake it but once and that was for feare, and wee haue synned often tymes wythoute anye feare or compulsion, but rather wyllynglye, yea, and dyuers tymes wee haue desyred to synne and studyed howe and where wee myghte fullfyll our vngracious lustes and desyres. And thus ye maye see that we oughte to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryte and sorye for oure offences than Sayncte Peter oughte to haue bene for his. By thys ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ye maye knowe for what cause and by what meane ye maye haue contrition. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the synner that dothe well weye and consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this that I haue spoken, shall be sorye that euer he synned and didde againste the wyll and commaundemente of oure Sauioure Chryste, whiche is so good and gratious, and he shal wil that hee hadde neuer offended, and hee shall hate synne, and purpose and atende to lyue well and to make amendes and restytutyon of that he hathe wrongfullye taken or done, and shall humble hymselfe by knowledginge and confessynge hys faultes, and submytte hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hollye to the correctyon and dyscyplyne of GOD and hys holye Churche, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge but that hee shalbe receyued to grace and
<pb n="ciiii" facs="tcp:114:112"/>
mercy and remission of all his sinnes.</p>
            <p>Furthermore it is to be noted that the sorow and repentaunce whiche a theefe taketh for hys thefte whan hee shall suffer deathe for it, and the repentaunce that a myslyuynge manne or woman taketh for their mislyuinge when they shal bee brought to any open shame or shal gette anye painefull dysease thereby, is not that true Contrition that wee speake of, nor yet any other lyke sorowe that men maye haue and take for theyr offences in other lyke cases. Because such synners and offendours bee not sorye, for that they didde againste Gods lawe and offende him, but they bee sorye for the deathe, or shame, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pain which they shal suffer for their nough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye liuinge.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstandinge these other paynes whereunto they come by order of lawe, they maye also bee sorye for their synnes, specyallye and mooste principallye because they didde of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende GOD in despysinge him in doynge their synnes, more thanne for anye shame or payne that they shall suffer here for theym, and yf they so dooe hauynge the mynde and wyll to synne no more but to make restitutyon and to confesse and make satisfactyon for the same than they haue true contrition, and maye bee sure of mercye and bee saued yf they dye in that minde.</p>
            <p>And althoughe a manne is not truelye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryte whan he is sorye onelye for the feare of
<pb facs="tcp:114:113"/>
payne be it corporall paine or euerlastinge paine: yet the feare of paine is an introduction prepai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe the waye for true contrition.<note place="margin">

               </note> For charitie withoute the whiche no man lyueth in soule by grace, is builded vpon feare of Goddes iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when a man is glad to be loued of GOD whom he feareth and dare be bolde to loue hym agayne, and is afrayde to displease hym whome he loueth althoughe he mighte dooe it withoute punishement. For no man commeth to GOD that is not smytten with some feare. For whiche cause Saint Iohn Baptiste, preparing the way for Chryste and remission of sinne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat. iii.</hi>
               </note> bette into the peoples heades the horrour of their sinnes, and the feare of Goddes iudgement. And S. Peter in his firste Sermon after that he had broughte the Iewes in feare of Gods anger by declaringe vnto theim howe they had crucifyed and kylled Iesus whom god had made Christ their Lorde,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Actes. ii.</hi>
               </note> and so had smitten their hartes with feare: than he taught theim to do penaunce and to take true contricion for their sinnes. Thus when a sinner loking vppon gods lawe eyther wrytten in the booke or written in his owne harte, whereby he seeth as in a glasse what pleaseth or dyspleaseth almighty God, and seeth also by faith that God threatneth damnation and euerlastinge deathe to all synners, and than is accused secretlye by his owne conscience that he hath broken that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal lawe of god not onely in thought but also in dede, and perceiueth the vylenesse and greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his owne synne how often he hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="cv" facs="tcp:114:113"/>
and into what misery he hath brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and of what great graces and ioyes he hath depriued him selfe thereby, beyng than separate from the spiritual communion of Christes chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and giltie of eternall dampnation: than yf there be any sparkle of grace left in that man, if he be not obdurate and cleane forsaken of God he will begin to feare and tremble, which feare wyll breake the hardnesse of his harte, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the waye for wisedome and grace to enter in. Without the which feare, no man can receyue remission of synnes and bee made ryghtewyse. Which feare of hell is not in charitie, but prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a place for charitie, and as charitie encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in a mans harte,<note place="margin">

               </note> so it decreaseth tyl perfyte charitie possesse the holle. After this feare a syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner begynneth to hate and abhorre hys synne, whereby he was brought into so great daunger and miserye, and so procedeth to lament and be sory for his offences. And as in the doyng of hys sinnes, there were twoo thinges, the noughtye dede, and the carnall pleasure that was ioyned with the same: so in the forsaking of his sinnes there must be two thinges, ceasing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dede, and sorow for the sinne past. For so the Prophet cryeth, <hi>Quiescite peruerse agere,</hi> Cease to do euil. He that continueth styll in his noughtye doyng,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay. i,</hi>
               </note> is farre from al kinde of true penaunce. For how can he turne to God, that is not turned from his synne? nor he can not be sorye that stil is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing for the which he is sorye. And it is to be vnderstand that this sorow of Contrition
<pb facs="tcp:114:114"/>
is inwarde in the harte, and not fained, onelye pretended in the outward behauiour. Which the verye woorde Contrition dothe signifye. For that is called contrite, that is brused and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into small peeces or powder: euen so when the hardnesse of a mans harte is mollified wyth sorowe and teares for that he hath by sinne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased God, than is his hart contrite.

            <p>And thys Contrition is the Crosse of Christ, which euerie Christen man and woman that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth Christe in this worlde, beareth volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilye vpon his owne backe, and so sheweth the vertue of Christes crosse in his owne flesh, euer carying about the mortification of Iesus Christ in his body,<note place="margin">

Wherefore it is to be feared that manye, yea, and all those whyche shortlye after confession turne to theyr synnes agayne, did not will and intende to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake all synne before they were confessed, for if they had so intended, eyther they would haue so continued, or if it had chaunced them sometyme to haue fallen, they would haue rysen againe by and by and forsaken theyr vice.

               </note> Therefore wee oughte fyrste to forsake oure sinne, whereof we haue begonne to make Confession, and than to haue good hope of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenesse.

            <p>Manye of these beastelye menne and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye vnchaste women call theym selues syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and myschieuous persones, but they do

it not for thys intent, that they desyre to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and therefore this is not to be called a Confession, for it commeth not foorthe of a contrite harte, and in the bitternesse of teares, nor yet wyth that affection, as men that hate that whyche they blame, and haue a wyll ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to doo it anye more, nor yet to heare of it, but the thynge is onelye in woordes, and in woordes from the lyppes outwarde, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the inwarde sorowe of the harte, so that some tymes they requyre to bee praysed for that as they were men that woulde not lye, but althoughe it were agaynste them selues, yet woulde they saye truthe: as who saye, the crime seemed not to men so greuous, when that it is spoken of hym that dydde it, as when it is reproued of an other.

Why woulde GOD haue a manne alwayes to remember hys synne? That hys mercye shoulde bee to the synner more thankefull, and that he shoulde perceyue the better what God hathe forgeuen him.

            <p>Suche were the holye men in olde tyme, they dydde not cal to theyr remembraunce theyr ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues but theyr synnes, and dydde not as menne doo nowe, forgette theyr synnes, beynge desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to hyde theym and keepe them close, and shewe foorthe to all menne theyr good dedes yf they haue done anye, and boaste them selues of them. But if thou haste done anye good, keepe it secrete that thy Lord may see it and prayse thee for it. For if thou boast thy self of any good dede, thou haste receyued glorye of men. If thou hast done euyll, remember it, that GOD myghte forgette it: yf thou shall tell thy faultes, thou haste made theym lesse, but yf GOD shall tell theym and laye theym to thy charge, hee shall encrease theym. If thou bee ashamed

to tell thy synnes to thy neyghboure, then tell them daylye inwardlye in thy harte, I doo not bydde thee tell them to thy neyghboure and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe seruaunt, to the intent he shoulde vpbrayd thee with them, and vtter theym agayne to thy confusion, but tell theym to thy Lorde GOD that shall not vpbrayde thee wyth theym, but heale them and take them cleane away. Not for that GOD dothe not knowe theym, seynge he knoweth all thing, and was present when thou dyddest theym, and knewe theym before they were done, but for that hee woulde haue thee to knowe theym, and by confessynge of theym to recognyse the greatnesse of Goddes mercye in pardonynge of them, and so alwayes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde warelye to auoide them, and humblye to thanke hym.</p>

            <p>See the excellent mercye of this Iudge.

Lyke as the soores of the bodye bee not opened to euerye one but to suche as can skyll to heale theim: euen so ought the confession of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to bee made to theym that can heale theym whiche after what sorte it is done ye haue heard it declared from the mouthe of oure Sauyoure Chryste, who promised to allow and accepte as forgeuen what so euer hys minister in hys name shall forgeue, and also denyeth it to bee remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whiche by hys minister is reteyned and not remitted.

And furthermore, that I haue saied concerninge the confession of all a mannes synnes, is also to be vnderstande of the circumstances of the same sinnes, suche as doe aggrauate the cryme &amp; make it more heynous, and increase the contempt of GOD in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge them.

               </note> If a man were the iudge, who mighte be deceyued, to purge the fault with some craft, and to excuse it, mighte seeme to be profitable for a time: but wher God is the iudge that can not be deceiued, a man may not falsly excuse or defend his sinne, but truely and playnly confesse his sinne. There be some men also, that where they can not, nor do not denye the fact, yet they will lay the faulte and blame vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some other thing or person from them selues, as vpon youth, ignoraunce, sorow, or euill counsell, or the tentation of the deuill, or the inordinate desire of theyr bodies, or vpon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinye, as though by the mouyng and powers of
<pb facs="tcp:114:133"/>
the starres and heauens aboue, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled and inforced to do euil, and some pestilent and abhominable heretiks there be, that for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing of them selues, do accuse almighty God, and impute their mischeuous dedes to gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, and would perswade that God who is the fountaine of all goodnes, were the author of al mischief, not onely suffering men to do euill by their own wyls, but also inforcing their wils to the same euill, and working the same euyll in them. Which woordes (good people) be not the wordes of malice onely, wherof I spake before, but rather the wordes of blasphemy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wil not nowe spend this litle time in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing their pestilent and deuilish sayinges. For it is better to abhorre them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to confute them. Onely at this time know you (good people) that these and al other such like excuses and sayinges be false. For euerye Christen man and woman hath so great strength in his soule,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bernardus de lib. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrio.</hi>
               </note> and hath hys will so in his own power, that neither the deuyl nor the flesh, nor euil cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel, nor any other thing can cause a man to do any sinne, excepte he wyll himself grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto it. And it is alwaies in the persones free choyse that is tempted by the deuil or by the flesh, or by euil counsell, or any other thing, to consent vnto the euill, or to refuse it and not to consent vnto it. For if a man wyll not consent to doo synne, there can no creature cause him or compel him to do any, and therfore when a man hath done anye synne, he can not in any wyse iustly excuse him selfe for the doyng of
<pb n="cxxv" facs="tcp:114:133"/>
it, for he himselfe was the very causer and doer, and might haue left it vndone if he had lyst. And so you may see (good people) that he which laieth any excuse for his sinne in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession, doth wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully excuse himselfe, and accuseth other falsely, in saying that they were the causes why he syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in so doyng besyde hys former offences he committeth a new synne, and thereby stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the influence of Gods grace, and is voide of all remission. Furthermore ye shall vnderstand, that there be some persones that although they playnelye and truelye confesse theyr faultes, yet they wil otherwise excuse the same, by iustifying theyr noughtye doinges in comparison of other that dyd woorse, as he that oppresseth hys sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes or tenauntes, or will take more than hys duty is for his laboures or paynes, and than in excusyng of hmselfe, sayth, that other that were before him in like authoritie or office were more extreme men, or tooke more for theyr laboures then he. And also sellers of wares that deceyue the simple byers, wyll say that they were decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them selues, and must nedes vtter the same agayne for as much as they can.</p>
            <p>Therefore let euery man take good hede that he do not excuse hys owne faulte, because he can tell of other that haue done woorse, but rather let hym accuse hym selfe that he hathe not done so well as other that haue done better, settynge the vertue of good men as an example before his eyes to folow, and not the vyce of euill men. Last of all a synner ought to put awaye all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discrete

and false accusing of him selfe, that is to saye, he maye not accuse him selfe of moo synnes then he hath done, neither in special nor in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. In special, as when a man hath red in bokes the diuision of sinne, how many partes &amp; braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches it hath, and then according to suche bookes will confesse him selfe to be an offendour in the same, rehersing euery braunche particularlye, in so doing he lyeth vpon him self by confessing mo sinnes then euer he did, &amp; in that synneth against God, and therefore this maner of confession is nought, and ought of euerye man to be refused. Likewise a synner ought not to accuse himselfe wrongfully in generall, as saying that he hathe bene the most shamefullest liuer and the greatest sinner that euer was, or that can be, or any other like sayings, for they be nought and false.

            <p>First I wold exhorte euery man and woman to thanke God highly for his mercyful kindnes
<pb n="cxxvii" facs="tcp:114:135"/>
shewed vnto him in hys creation, in his rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and in his regeneration. In his creation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth gods kindnesse, in that he mighte haue made him a meane creature sensible or vnsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whiche he did not, but rather of his goodnes made him one of the most excellente creatures of al other vnder heauen, to his own image &amp; simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude &amp; to be inheritour of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; also made al other creatures to helpe hym and to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ue him here in this present life, to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he might the better serue god. Also a man is bounden to thanke god for the benefite of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, in that Christ by his painefull passion redemed him from the possession of the deuil, and made him mete by the merites of the same passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be brought to the state of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the fruition of eternal lyfe And also for the benefite of regeneration, that is to saye, when he was chrystened and receiued the holy Sacrament of Baptisme. For althoughe Christe had redemed him with his most precious bloude, yet might he haue remained still an infidele, as many do, and so should haue bene damned, yf Christe had not called hym and caused hym to be chrystened, by which baptisme he made him actually an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour vnto euerlasting life. And here also a man is bounden to thanke God for that he hathe not onely set him in the hye waye to heauen, but also hath sente one of his blessed aungels to be wyth him here &amp; to kepe him, to help him, to admonish him &amp; to defende him against his mighty &amp; most vigilant enemy. On the other side a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to
<pb facs="tcp:114:136"/>
consider and confesse his great vnkindnes, how that afterwarde when he came to the yeares of discretion he did not obeye God nor loue, laude, nor honor him according to his mooste bounden duety &amp; promise made at his baptisme, but brake his most holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp; so dispised and dishonored god, for the which he ought to require his most merciful forgeuenes. And this a man may do perticularely perusing al the x. commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, considering in euery one and in euery braunche where and how he hath offended.</p>
            <p>Secondly a man ought to thanke god highlye for his greate kindnes, in geuinge vnto him the special giftes of his soule, of his body, and of his worldlye goodes. The giftes of his soule be free wil, remembraunce, &amp; reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lightned with faith, by which he may clerely perceiue that gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes be very iust and good, and very easye to fulfil &amp; kepe, and that he shal haue gods gratious fauour and be saued by keping of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And also he may see, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to liue accordinge to gods law is the most laudable, ioyfull and most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt lyfe that any man can haue in this world, because God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded nothing but that is very laudable and good, &amp; againe he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden nothing but that is euil &amp; greatly against reason, and yet to thintent a man should auoyde and farsake any such euil, God hath forbidden it vnder paine of damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Likewise a man maie consider the special giftes of his body, as ryghte shappe, beautie, good proportion, strength &amp; such other, &amp; also the external giftes of this world, as
<pb n="cxxviii" facs="tcp:114:136"/>
riches, landes or patrimony, estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; such other, &amp; yet ouer &amp; besides al these how it hath pleased almyghtie God to promise him a reward in heauen for occupying and bestowinge these giftes wel. And here on the other side, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to acknowledge and confesse hys greate vnkyndnes vnto almghity God, for that he hath bestowed the rehersed giftes noughtilye, vnto Gods dishonoure. Because he hath often tymes with his reason vnderstande and with hys me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory remembred what God hath commaunded and the goodnes of it, and yet he hathe refused and would not do his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ought and might haue done them. Likewise he hath vnderstand and reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred what God hathe forbidden, and the euil and noughtines of it, and that he should loose Gods gratious fauour, and come in daunger of damnation if he dyd it, and yet hath done that euil dede willinglye. Also let him consider how he hath occupied hys remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce &amp; witte in study and casting wher &amp; how he might do euill, &amp; how he hath mispent dyuerse times, and waies the giftes of his bodye, &amp; also the giftes of the world by gready and vnsatiable desires in procuring and getting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by wronge, iniury, oppression, vsury, ambition and other vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lawful meanes, and in vnmerciful keping of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by mistruste of Gods goodnes, and not helpinge his neadye neighbours, and also in ryotous and vnthriftie spending of them for mainteininge of his fleshely lust, worldly vanity, and pride of life, wherin he hath shewed gret vnkindnes, &amp; ought
<pb facs="tcp:114:137"/>
to be inwardly sorye, and to beseke God of hys mercyfull pardone and forgeuenesse.</p>
            <p>Thirdly a man ought to thanke God hyghlye for his mercyfull kindnesse shewed vnto hym in hys reconciliation, that is to say, alwayes when he came to shrifte and confessed hys synnes. For althoughe it be so that a man hathe broken hys promise made to almighty god at the font stone, and hath misused and misspent Gods foresayed gyftes, and so greatly offended hym that he had deserued iustly to haue bene caste into the pytte of hell: yet almightye God, as a good Lorde of his aboundant mercy is euermore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done &amp; forgeue him when he confesseth with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite &amp; humble hart his offences vnto his ghostly father gods delegate iudge &amp; commissioner. For than is he there mercyfully absolued, and all hys trespaces be clerely forgeuen. And this merciful kindnes is god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to shew, not once or twisse, but at al times, &amp; as often as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and doth also beare him agayne hys grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fauour, &amp; geueth him grace to lyue well and to do good workes and meritorious deedes for hys saluation. In thys appeareth the excedyng goodnes of almighty god, in ordeining this most holesome &amp; present remedy of penaunce, wherby euery sinner may be deliuered alwaies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of hel, &amp; be set againe in gods fauour &amp; state of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the which euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is most bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to render thankes to the vttermoste of hys power. And on the other side he is likewise bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to acknowledge and with sorow to confesse
<pb n="cxxxix" facs="tcp:114:137"/>
his manifolde vnkindnes in that behalfe, for as muche as he hath diuers times after his shrifte and reconciliation, turned from God, and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously synned againe, and so hath greatly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by breakinge his promyse whiche hee made when he was shriuen, for the whiche he ought to be sory, and to beseche almighty God of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull pardon and forgeuenes.</p>
            <p>Fourthlye, a man oughte to thanke God for his great kindenes shewed vnto him, in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him from many synnes whiche he myghte haue done, and also in letting him from doynge of dyuers which he was in mynde to haue done, and would haue done them. For euery man may consider and remember with hym selfe, that he might oftentimes haue synned whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did not, which I thinke he should haue done, if he hadde not bene preserued and kept from doing of them by Gods speciall goodnes. Also seldome it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth but that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d how he hath bene in minde and wyll to haue synned dyuers tymes, and yet he hathe been let and coulde not fulfill his euill purpose and desire, as sometime he hath been lette by shame, sometime by feare, and sometime otherwyse, whiche lets (no doubt of it) God did cause him to haue, for he is so mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cifull that he will not suffer sinners alwaies to synne so greatlye, nor to runne so deepelye into the handes of the deuill and damnation, as they should do, if they might euermore without stop or let do so muche euill and sinne in dede, as thei be willing to do in their hartes. And here a syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:114:138"/>
maye graunt and confesse, that he hathe not considered this great kyndenes of God shewed vnto hym in these twoo rehersed poyntes, but hath shewed great vnkyndnes agayne, because that when he hath remembred the oportunitie and the meete time and occasion that hee had to synne in tyme past, and myght haue done diuers synnes without let or stop, yet he hath not geuen to God due prayse and thankes for his preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation from synne, but rather he hathe repented hym &amp; been sory that he had not doen suche euyl deedes as he might haue doen. Likewyse when he hath remembred, howe he hath been let, and could not do suche euill as he was in mynde and wyllynge to dooe, he hathe not than geuen God thankes because he was let, but rather he hathe been discontent and sory that he was let, for the whiche thinges he ought nowe to bee sorye, and humbly beseche GOD of his mercyfull forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenes.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, a synner ought to geue God moste hie thankes for his syngulare kindnes shewed vnto hym many tymes when he hath been and lyen in deadly sinne, for that almighty God (notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing this maner of rebellion and obstinacie of the synner in remayning in sinne, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting him) yet dyd of his great goodnes and mercye come vnto the synners soule, and there dyd stande and knocke, that the synner shoulde haue letten him in, that is to say, God gaue him remorse of conscience, the whiche did grudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the sinne that he hath doone and was in,
<pb n="cxl" facs="tcp:114:138"/>
and by that grudge of conscience he perceiued or myght haue perceyued, that if hee woulde not leaue and forsake his sinne, he shoulde be damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And if he didde forsake and turne to God, and intende to lyue well and iustlye, and to kepe his commaundementes, that than God woulde pardone him, and enter into his soule, and there continue and take it at his departynge hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better lyfe in heauen.</p>
            <p>This mercifull offer God did alwaies make to the synner, vppon the foresayde condition, if hee woulde forsake hys synnes, and keepe hys lawe. And to the intent he shoulde so dooe, God gaue hym grudge in his conscience agaynste his synne, that he shoulde leaue it, and hate it, and take his moste mercifull offer. And if he did not or woulde not heare GOD by this knockynge, that is to saye, if he dyd not forsake his synne by the remorse of his conscience, yet God would not vtterly departe and go his waye, but stande styll and knocke agayne, that is to witte, GOD caused him to haue good counsell, sometyme of learned men, and sometyme of his other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and familiare friendes, and sometyme in hearynge of Godlye Sermons, by the whiche he was exhorted to forsake vyce and synne, and so to lette God come into his soule. And if hee dydde not or woulde not heare hym at this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond knockyng, that is, if he woulde not doo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and followe suche good counsel as God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hym to haue: yet he would not leaue him so,
<pb facs="tcp:114:139"/>
but did knocke yet once agayne, that is to saye: God didde suffer hym to fall in some worldlye trouble or aduersitie, or into some bodely disease that he should then reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre hym and his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; forsake them, and to cal to God for mercy, and so to open the dore of his soule &amp; let him in. Thus God in his comming and knockyng, hath shewed to man great and mercifull kindenesse, and yet man hath bene very vnkinde and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended againe. For often times he woulde not heare God, nor let him come in, but rather with pleasure and desire whiche he had in sinne, he stopped his eares, and woulde not suffer hys conscience to grudge, nor shewe him his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor he would not do after good counsell and exhortacions, nor woulde not esteme the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie that came vnto him as a messenger, and the knocking of Gods hande, but rather fast barred the dore of his soule with frowarde and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate purpose to continue and tary styll in synne, and so did keepe God out. But when the deuyll came and knocked, and did moue him but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to let in pryde, enuy, and malice, he was then contented to open the doore of his soule, and to let them and many moo other vices come in. And when the worlde came and knocked, and moued him to get and gather goodes, not regar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding how, and to kepe them couetously, then he opened the doore, whiche is the consent of hys free wyll, and consented to let couetousnes come in.

            <p>He that is thus affected, and vseth this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament after this maner, lyke as hee oughte stedfastlye withoute anye doubtynge to beleue the effecte of euery Sacrament, (whiche by the vertue of Christes passion, and the operation of the holy Ghoste, dooeth euermore woorke in the woorthy receyuour, that grace it signyfieth,) so hee maye bee assured that hee hathe recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued remyssyon of all his synnes, (euen as the woordes of absolution dooe purporte)

            <p>The reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation of one brother to another, is a sweete sacrifice to me, and therfore he sayde not, after thou hast offered, but before thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est offer, not commaundinge him altogether to make no Sacrifice or offerynge, but to preferre the reconcilynge of his brother before his offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge, declaryng by this that he honoureth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie aboue all thynges, and accompteth it to be the moste acceptable Sacrifice of all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sacrifices, without the whiche he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no other Sacrifice, and also declarynge the necessitie of this reconciliation, whiche in no wyse may be omitted and left vndone, seinge no other Sacrifice, neither outward nor inwarde in the harte of man canne bee perfite so longe as the enemitie and displeasure betwene hym &amp; his neighboure is not ended and dissolued.</p>
            <p>And therfore oure Sauioure Christe in these woordes speaketh meruailous preciselye, bothe to affraye a man, and also to comforte hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.

               </note> When they intende to offer to GOD their offrynges, whiche be the Sacrifice of a contrite harte, the Sacrifices of prayer, of almes, and of thankes geuyng.

               </note> For whiche cause when a man is about to offer his praier to God, and shall remember the offence he hath dooen to his brother, it were better to differre his prayer, and firste to gooe and reconcile his brother, and than co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently to offer his praier in peace and brotherly loue. For the whiche peace and loue Christe didde al thinges that he did here in earth, to knitte vs al together in vnitie, that before were diuided by enemitie.</p>
            <p>And where as our Sauioure sayeth not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concyle thy brother to thee, but be thou reconcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to thy brother, hee myghte seeme rather to speake of hym that is offended and suffereth wronge, than of hym that dooeth the wronge.
<pb facs="tcp:114:143"/>
And althoughe it be sufficient for hym that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered wrong to forgeue him freely in his harte, euen as he would haue God to forgeue hym, yet it shoulde declare the perfection of his charitye, if he didde gooe to his aduersary and not onely dydde forgeue hym that wronge whiche he had done, but also with gentle speche did mytigate his anger, and perswaded hym euer after to beare towardes hym a good affection. Nowe if the perfection of charitie dooeth requyre that the sufferer shoulde goe and reconcile hym that dydde hym the wrong: how muche more is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for hym that of a malicious stomacke doeth the wronge, to goe and humble him selfe to his neyghbour, whom he hath hurt in woorde or deede, and to confesse his fault vnto him, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him selfe to make what amendes shall be thought reasonable, and so to be fully recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled and made friendes agayne? For whiche cause Saynte Iames exhorteth all Christen men and women,<note place="margin">

            <p>Howe great a faulte it is to doo iniury to his neyghboure, euery manne maye well perceyue that vnderstandeth the lawe of GOD, whiche commaundeth a man vpon payne of dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to loue his neighbour as him selfe, yea, and to loue his enemy also,<note place="margin">

            <p>The remedy to auoyde all this heape of euils, is humbly without malice or excuse to confesse his fault to his neighbour offended, and to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him to whom he gaue great cause to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and to make reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence so farre as he maye: If he haue offended hym in thought, let hym re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile hym in thoughte,<note place="margin">

No world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughtes ought to let this brotherly confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as to think that thou shalt thus be dispised of other worldly men, or that it is against thynge honour or worship to submit thy self to thy infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, or that it shoulde bee shame for thee so to doe. These corrupt affections of the worlde and the fleshe, be the cheynes of the deuill, to keepe a mans soule styl in bondage of sinne, &amp; the lets of Gods grace, which shuld set him at libertie.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auynge declared vnto you heretofore (good people) the first two partes of penaunce whiche be Contrition &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>And firste of all it is to be knowen that when a Christen man or woman hath by consent of mynde, or by worde or deede done any thyng that is deadly sinne, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath he set him selfe in the state of dampnation, &amp; is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to suffer euerlasting payne in hell: because the rewarde or hyer of synne is eternall deathe, vnder whiche payne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom. vi.</hi>
               </note> God in the beginnyng, and alwayes dydde forbidde sinne. Likewise when a synner chaungeth his mynde, forsakynge hys synne, and taketh true repentaunce for the same, and commeth to confession to a Priest (if he may confesse and haue a Priest) after that sorte and intent as is declared before: than almighty God doth mercyfully forgeue him al the paines &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment that he had deserued, and shoulde haue had in hell for his offences, and setteth the syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner agayne in the state of saluation. And this doth almyghtye God euermore, after the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes confession ordinarylye, although he take not so muche and so great repentaunce for hys
<pb n="cxl" facs="tcp:114:148"/>
synne, as he had pleasure in it, nor althoughe he be not so long sory, as he lay &amp; continued in sinne before. For God hath not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners shall take as muche repentaunce, and be as longe sorye for their synnes, as they tooke plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and continued in theyr synne. For if he had done so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the penitent synner could not haue been sure that he had had mercy and forgiuenes after his confession, but shoulde rather haue been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in doubt and feare of forgeuenes, because he coulde not alwayes certaynly knowe that he had taken so muche and so long repentaunce, as he had pleasure and taryed in his synne: whiche feare and doubte of forgeuenes, no synner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng vnfeynedly to this sacrament, maye haue at any tyme, but when so euer a synner dooeth forsake his synnes and taketh repentaunce for it, be it litle or muche, and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: than he knoweth &amp; is in suretie that he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes, and is set againe in the state of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And although it be true that any quantitie of Contrition is sufficient to haue forgeuenesse of the paynes of hell due for synne, yet the more he taketh, the better he doeth. And this forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of synne, and eternall payne due for synne, commeth by the vertue of Christes passion, who hath made satisfaction vpon the crosse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed vs by his death from all iniquitie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Titus. ii.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:114:149"/>Therefore this is to bee surelye beleued, that onely our Sauiour Christe by his painfull pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vpon the crosse, is that satisfaction whiche deserueth remission of our sinnes, and the aboly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyng of eternal death and dampnation, whiche remission and deliuery no man is able to deserue by any thyng that he can do, but onely the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and humanitie of GOD our Sauioure in Christ,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>August. in Psal. l.lviii.</hi>
               </note> forgeueth synne, and yet of his iustice and truthe, he leaueth not the sinnes of them whom he forgeueth, vnpunished. But all synnes of all men and women he puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth either eternally in hell,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob. xxiiii.</hi>
               </note> or temporally for a tyme, that as in forgeuing, appeareth his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, so in correcting or auenging myght appeare his iustice. For whiche cause, consyderynge that God by the merites of Christe forgeueth to all that be truelye penitent and confessed all their synnes, and also the paynes of hell due for the same: and yet leaueth no synne vnpunyshed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be remitted, we may thereby certeinly know that euery synner, although he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued absolution and remission, eyther hath suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or remayneth yet styll bounden to suffer cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein temporall payne, accordynge to the nature and quantitie of his former faulte, for that hee presumed to doe against Gods lawe, and brake his promyse and professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in baptisme. And this temporall payne is oure debte whyche we are
<pb n="cxli" facs="tcp:114:149"/>
bounden to paye to God. For as we are debters to almyghtie God for his manifolde benefytes bestowed vpon vs, and so are bounden alwayes to thanke him, to honoure hym, and to offer to him the sacrifice of prayse: so are we debters to hym also for oure manifolde sinnes done against him, and so are wee bounden to satisfye the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God, by suffering paine for the same, both whiche debtes when we could not, and were not able to paye our selues, Christ our Lorde being the mediatoure betwene God and man by hys paynful death, hath paied it for vs, and hath ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled the obligation of our debt and fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied God for the synne of the worlde, and hathe taken away eternal death due for the same, and so hath made vs nowe able by him, and in hym, both to offer that sacrifice of prayse, which for al his benefites we were bounden to make, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to satisfie the iustice of God for that te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall payne whiche remayneth for vs to suffer, after that the giltines of oure synnes, and the paynes of hell be remitted through the satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made vpon the crosse, the benefite whereof is applyed to vs by true faythe &amp; contrition, not that we be able of our selues by oure woorkes or suffering to make woorthye satisfaction for the same, as Christ hath done, but that we are made able by Christ, and in hym to dooe or suffer that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God is contented and satisfied and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth as a satisfaction.</p>
            <p>By this ye shall vnderstande (good people) that the satisfaction of penaunce, which I haue
<pb facs="tcp:114:150"/>
to declare vnto you at this tyme, is punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or affliction which a synner taketh vpon him to suffer, by the assignement of his ghostlye father, after the remission of his synnes, to the intent he might thereby cut away the cause and sequele of his sinnes whiche remayne, and also eyther clerely redeme, or at lest mitigate the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall paynes due for the same synnes, by doing of suche penall woorkes as bee contrarye to the synnes committed.</p>
            <p>This doctrine of Satisfaction standeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these two groundes. First, that when the sinne is remitted, and the sinner receyued into grace and fauour with GOD againe, yet oftentymes there remayneth temporall payne to be suffered for the same sinne, eyther in this worlde or in the nexte. And secondlye that this temporall payne may be mitigated or redemed and taken awaye by penitential satisfaction &amp; the worthy fruites of penaunce. To this doctrine beareth wytnesse the trade and processe of the holle Scriptures. When the people of Israell in the wyldernesse grudged against Moyses and Aaron,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Num. iiiii.</hi>
               </note> and wold haue gone backe into Egipt againe, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked God to vengeaunce, Moyses prayed for the people very feruently, at whose prayer God did forgeue the people their sinne, &amp; yet not with standing that forgeuenes he said that he would punishe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after this sort, that neuer one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that came out of Egipt &amp; had not obeyed him in the wildernes, should see or enter into the lande which he promised the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherby we learne that
<pb n="cxlii" facs="tcp:114:150"/>
after the synne remitted, many times there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth a punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t temporall to be suffred for the same.<note place="margin">

And yet when the Prophet had said that his yong sonne begotten by Barsabee should dye, trustyng that his humble penaunce should chaunge Gods sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in punishinge of him by the deathe of his sonne, he fell to fasting, weeping, praying, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and lying vpon the grounde, by the space of seuen dayes, and although he dydde not than obtayne the release of that punishement whiche was appointed by Goddes immutable decree: yet in an other lyke offence he obteyned the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of his temporall payne.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:114:151"/>
whiche might as soone fall vpon him the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, as vpon the people, he did so punyshe and afflicte him selfe, that God in respecte of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, was satisfied and content with the plage of one day, and did remit the rest.

               </note> and almes, whiche be specially commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the gospell of Christe.

So that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting is a medicine to heale perfitly those sinnes which we haue done by concupiscence and desire of the fleshe against our selues and our own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And almes is likewyse a medicine to heale perfitely those synnes whiche we committed by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiscence of the eyes, whiche is couetousnes, deceyte, oppression, and vniuste dealyng againe our neyghbours.

<pb n="cxlvii" facs="tcp:114:153"/>
God, be healed perfitely by instant, humble, and deuoute prayers. And the holye scriptures doo playnly shew how that synners may here in this lyfe satisfie and content almighty God for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall payne with these three woorkes, as the booke of Danyell sheweth, where the Prophet Daniel exhorteth the king Nabuchodonosor to redeme his sinnes with almes, that is to say, the seuen yeares of paine which he shoulde suffer for his sinnes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Toby. iiii.</hi>
               </note> And old Toby taught his sonne that almes deliuereth from sinne, in which two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the word (sinne) is vnderstanded the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall paine due for sinne. For by the merites of our sauiour Christ, which be applied to vs in the Sacramentes of Baptisme and Penaunce, the giltynes of our sinne, and the eternall paynes of hell be taken away, and our afflictions whereby we suffer with Christe, and are made lyke to the Image of Christe, taking their vertue of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes passion, and wrought in vs by his grace and holy spirite, not of their owne worthynes, but by Gods mercyfull acceptation, are meanes ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God to satisfie hym, and to turne awaye his anger and displeasure for our sinnes, and to purchase hys further grace. And that fastynge and prayer be of the same effect for this purpose that almes is, is plaine by the exaumple of the Niniuites, who after the preaching and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Ionas the Prophet, beyng contrite and sorye for their offences,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:114:154"/>
and feruent prayer, and by that meane reuoked the sentence of God whiche was spoken by the mouth of Ionas. But the scripture alwaies for the moste parte ioyneth these three together,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay. xviii</hi>
               </note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause fasting without mercye to a mans neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the lifting vp of his minde to God by prayer, is vnfruitful and litle regarded of God. And almes ioyned with surfeting and the gredy cares of the world, and lacking the felowship of fasting and prayer, is not meritorious. And the prayer of him that will not bridle the desires of his fleshe by abstinence, and shutteth his mercye and compassion from his neighboure, that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, is not hearde of GOD. But these three ioyned in a faythfull man together, be of greate vertue and reache to heauen, and there do turne away the face of God from his synnes, and doo purchase gods grace for such thinges as he hath neede of, as Toby saith: praier with fasting and almes is good,<note place="margin">

            <p>A man may also make satisfaction for his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with repentaunce and sorowe for his synne, so that God will forgeue hym all the temporall paine whiche he deserued to haue had, as God forgaue Saynte Peter the sayde payne for hys great repentaunce and bitter weeping,<note place="margin">

And this power is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in scripture by the name of the keyes of the kingdome of heauen.

               </note> that by matrimonye a man shoulde leaue his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother and adhere and cleaue vnto hys wyfe, and that they should be two in one fleshe: So our sauiour Christe did so leaue his father, that beynge in the forme of God thoughte it no robberye to be equall with God but abased hym selfe and was made man, and also lefte the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoge the mother of the Iewes whiche altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaned carnally to the olde Testament, and dyd adhere vnto hys wyfe the holye Churche to the intent they mighte be two in one fleshe in the peace of the new testament.</p>
            <p>And as a man and his wyfe haue conformitie and do agre in one nature of mankynd: so Christ did conforme him selfe to his Churche by his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie. And as at the publike celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the frendes of the parties so maried be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, and a feast is made amonge theim, to declare their common ioye and gratulatyon for the celebratinge of this Sacrament: euen so to the mariage betwene our sauiour Christ and his spouse the holy Church, are called al nations and people, and from euery part of the world the frendes and seruauntes of God by lyuelye fayth dooe resorte thyther with vnspeakable gladnes and ioye in the holy ghost.</p>
            <p>And as ther is no worldly loue greater tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
<pb facs="tcp:114:177"/>
loue betwene ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and wife, who be one hart and one mind, euen so the holy church loueth Christ, and Christ loueth his spouse the Church, so that he hath geuen him selfe to the death for her, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme and washe her from all her spottes and wrincles. And as the wife by duetie is subiecte and obedient to her husbande as being her head: so is the Churche to Christe her head &amp; sauiour.</p>
            <p>And as the husbande anorneth and decketh his wyfe, and when case requireth doth also cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styse her, to the intent she might continew in her duetie and obedience: euen so Christ dothe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifye and set forth hys wife the Churche wyth spirituall giftes and ornamentes, and some ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes by trybulation and aduersitie dothe chastise her, aswell for to exercise her in rightwisnes as for correction of her disobedience. Thys ye maye perceiue (good people) by these comparysones howe matrimonye betwene man and wyfe is a great Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, resemblinge vnto vs and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into our reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce that heauenly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which is betwene Christ our Sauiour and hys spouse the holy church, which is the greatest grace and benefite that god hath geuen to man, wherupon mans saluation doth holly depend.</p>
            <p>And as this grace is but onely signified by the Sacrament of Matrimonye, so God doth both signifye and also worke effectually other special and singulare graces in them that lawfullye in the faith of Christ receiue the same Sacrament of matrimony. Which thinge shall appeare, yf ye wyll consider the wordes of our sauiour Christe
<pb n="clxix" facs="tcp:114:177"/>
whereby Matrimonye as a Sacramente of the newe Testamente is stablished and sanctifyed, where hee sayeth in the gospell of Sainte Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew after thys sorte: <hi>those persones whom God hath ioyned, man may not lose.</hi> By which wordes is declared vnto vs, that who so euer bee ioyned in lawfull maryage in the name of God, to the intent to lyue Godly in the religion of Christ, in that state of lyfe: they be ioyned, not vainelye by contract of man onely, but by God himself, who is inuisibly present at the making of that mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and doth assist the parties, &amp; is the authour and worker of the knot of matrimonie betwene them. And by the same woordes also is declared the strengthe of the knotte of Matrimony to be such, as ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be broken &amp; dissolued afterwarde, but by the natural death of one of the parties so maryed. For yf God dothe so couple and ioyne man and wyfe together, that no man hathe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to separate them a sender afterwarde: than is it certeine that he geueth to the parties so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed his speciall grace to lyue together in godlye and chaste loue in this perpetuall bond and knot of Matrimonie, without breach of the same, and so to cheryshe and loue one an other, as Chryste loueth his Churche, and shall neuer be separate and diuorsed from the same. So that this indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble bond and knot of Matrimonye betwene the two parties maried, which no man can loose and breake, during the lyues of both the parties so maryed, is that special grace and effect, which is wrought by almighty God in this sacrament,
<pb facs="tcp:114:178"/>
and is also signified by such mutuall woordes of consent, as the two parties did contract Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony together. Which perpetual bond although it be made specially for thintent to haue childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet when that cause dothe cease by age or baren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, it maye in no wyse bee broken or dissolued. And also although for fornication of the woman or of the man, there maye be made agaynste the will of the party offending, a diuorce or separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from bed &amp; borde betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyl they may be reconcyled together agayne by the penaunce and submission of the partie offendinge, yet the bond and knot of Matrimonie which God hath once made,<note place="margin">

               </note>And this cause or condition of Matrimonye betwene husbande and wyfe, is not amonge the Heathen or vnchristen people, where Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye is no Sacrament of Christes religion, but onely in the Citie of God which is the catholyke church. Moreouer besyde this inuiolable bonde which god knitteth by his grace in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by mutuall loue which he poureth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hartes, and dothe nourishe and preserue the same, there is also an other singulare grace and benefite of God alwayes ioyned thereunto, whereby (as S.

                  <hi>Hebr. xiii.</hi>
               </note> For where as by Gods institution in this sacrament of Matrimony, there is power geuen to man to vse his wife for procreation of children: we must

conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly vnderstand that there is also grace geuen, whereby he may do that thing conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the contentation and pleasure of God. For they that worthely in the faith of Christ, and in the feare of God, with a right intent, for the end to haue fruite of their bodies to serue God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Matrimonie together, to such I say is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the helpe of Gods grace against the vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful desire &amp; concupiscence of the flesh, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede no further, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the honesty of maryage doth require. So that the carnall act and copulatyon which otherwise were sinful and dishonest, is by the goodnes of Matrimonie, lawfullye contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as I haue said before) not onely excused and defended from sinne, as S. Paul saith: <hi>yf thou hast taken a wyfe, thou hast not sinned,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>and if a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn doo marrye, she synneth not</hi>: but also is made honest &amp; meritorious &amp; acceptable to almightye god, who also by his special grace doth aid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties so married, to kepe stedfastly that faith and promise whiche they haue made one to an other, by which the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the power &amp; vse of his body onely to his wife, &amp; likewise the wife to her husband onely, &amp; so to auoide adulterie &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with any other person during their lyues natural. Which promise to kepe is very harde, or in a maner impossible, withoute the ayd of gods grace geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For wher the corrupt nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s flesh &amp; his inordinate con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cupiscence moueth &amp; inclineth him to desire other women beside his owne wife, yet by the grace of matrimonie his vnlawful desire is restreined, so
<pb facs="tcp:114:179"/>
that he maye be content with his owne wyfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and auoyde fornication. And where as also mans corrupt nature seeketh rather the satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of his carnall luste, than the generatyon of children: yet in this sacrament of Matrimony he receiueth grace to know his wife, rather for the intent to haue children, than to fulfyll his fleshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desyre. And also to communicate with her, all that chaunce to him good or bad, and to brynge vp together theyr chyldren in the religion and feare of God. And lykewyse, where as a man by his corrupte nature, after carnall copulation, is wont and disposed to thinke lothsome, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to abhorre that woman whiche he hathe kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen carnally, and so refuseth her, and seeketh an other, yet in Matrimonye is geuen grace &amp; aide, not to disdaine the company of hys wife, but to remayne with her continually, without separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or deuorce.</p>
            <p>Al these singulare graces and aydes almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye God ceaseth not of his mercyful goodnes for his partye to geue and graunte to his faithfull people in this sacrament of Matrimony, if they them selues doo not wyllfullye stoppe at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynning, or afterward refuse the same by theyr vngracious life and wicked intent. For as God is author and gyuer of all grace and goodnes, so he forceth and compelleth no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue good against his wyll.</p>
            <p>Therfore good people, ye may euidentlye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the i nfinite and vnspeakeable clemencye of almightye God oure Sauioure, that by suche a
<pb n="clxxi" facs="tcp:114:179"/>
sacrament hathe so mercifullye prouided for our carnall concupiscence and desires. He knoweth very well how frayle mans flesh is, and how ful of corruption and wickednes. &amp; therefore mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hathe ordeined lawfull Matrimonye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streine mans vnlawfull desyre, for whiche cause maried persones may haue boldnes and quyete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a good conscience, wherby althoughe they haue by the vse of Matrimony tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fleshe many waies, yet they be certeinlye assured that their matrimonial life honestly bego<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne and vertuously co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued, hath alwaies the assistau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Gods grace, and is blessed of him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore profitable and meritorious to the saluation of the parties. Wherunto Saint Paul beareth witnes, writing thus to Timothy,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>i. Tim. ii.</hi>
               </note> that the wife shall be saued by procreation and bringing forth of children, if the same doe continue in faithe and loue towardes God, and in holynes and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in their deedes.</p>
            <p>Finally euery man and woman ought mooste stedfastlye too beleue that maryage is a good thinge,<note place="margin">

               </note> and ordeyned and blessed of almyghtye God, and also that it is a better thinge to lyue chastely without maryage, to thintent a man or woman might more fully and freely thinke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suche thynges as be godly, and howe to please God, and yet to them that haue not vowed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, either in virginity or widowhed, we ought to beleue that it is no sinne to marry and to take an husband or wyfe. And that not onely the first maryage is ordeyned of God, but also that the
<pb facs="tcp:114:180"/>
seconde and third maryage is graunted as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the infirmitie of suche as can not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse lyue continentlye, but to theym that haue vowed chastitie and continent lyfe to almyghtie God, we oughte to thinke, that according to the doctrine of Sainte Paule, it is dampnable, not onely to defile them selues with the deadly sinne of fornication, but also to haue a wil to marry a wyfe, or to take an husbande, because he or shee that so dothe, hathe broken and made voyde his fyrste fayth and promyse, which by his vowe he made to almighty God.</p>
            <p>Therefore hee that shall well consyder wyth hym selfe the goodnes of thys sacramente, as I haue rehersed, and the singulare and manyfolde graces whyche God geueth to them that be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly &amp; for a good intent married in our sauiour Christ, shall bothe edifye his owne conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him selfe, and increase hys chast loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes hys wife, and by that laudable state of liuing highly please almighty God toward the atteining of his own saluation, which God of hys great mercy graunt to vs by the merytes of his deere sonne our Sauiour Christe, to whom with the father and the holy ghost be al honour &amp; glory for euermore.

            <head>¶Of the maner how to minister and contract Matrimonye. Ser. xxviii.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is to be considered (good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) that although the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of Matrimonye, and the benediction of the parties mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, is made and geuen in the face of the Churche by a Priest the publik minister of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: yet the contract of Matrymonye, wherein this Sacrament consisteth, may be and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made by the lay man and woman whiche be marryed together. And because for lacke of knowledge howe suche contractes oughte to bee duely made, and for omittinge of suche thinges as be necessarye to the same, it chaunceth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that the parties chaunge theyr myndes, and wyll not keepe that promyse of marryage which seemed to haue passed betwene theym be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherupon commeth and groweth betwene suche persones and theyr frendes great grudge and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atred, and greate sute in the lawe: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I intende at thys tyme by Gods grace to declare vnto you whyche bee the verye woordes whereby thys Sacramente of Matrymonye is contracted, and to open certayne cases there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon dependynge, too the intente that suche contention, as commonlye is wonte to aryse
<pb facs="tcp:114:181"/>
vpon the ignoraunce or not obseruing the same, maye the better be auoyded, and the parties so contracting, maye without scruple or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uyll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for so muche lyue together in Godlye and chaste Matrimonye, to the good wyll and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of almighty God.</p>
            <p>First, whosoeuer intendeth to take vppon him thys Sacrament of Matrimony, hys duetye is not headyly or rashlye and with blynde affection to enter so weyghtye a matter, but oughte wyth discretion and deliberation to choose vnto hym or her suche a make and felowe, with whom he or she shall verelye beleue and truste to lyue god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and vertuouslye, without breach of the bond of Matrimonie in any case duringe their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lyues, and to beware that he enter not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryage with any such person, as the lawe of God expressed by the instinct of nature in euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s harte, and the booke of Leuiticus, and also the holye and auncient Canons of the Churche doo prohibite and forbydde. Which prohibition now extendeth to the fourthe degree of consanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and affinitie, and also taketh place in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall kynred, whiche is betwene the partye that is baptised or confirmed, and hys Godfathers or Godmothers, and their chyldren and wyfe or husband, before suche baptisme or confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and also betwene the Godfather or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, and the parentes of the chylde so bapty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or confirmed.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, he ought to beware and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
<pb n="clxxiii" facs="tcp:114:181"/>
that he or she be in no errour of the persone, nor of the condition and quality of the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with whom hee or shee intendeth to marrye. And if any scruple or doubt shall appeare vnto hym or her, concerning the degrees or other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedimentes whiche maye lawfullye stoppe the contractinge of suche maryage: than hys dutye is to resorte to know the iudgement of hys Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. And in case his Curate hathe not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde knowledge, as to resolue him in all suche doubtes, then oughte he or she further to resorte to his Ordinarye or Byshoppe to be resolued, to whom onelye the custome of the churche of olde tyme, not wythout great cause dydde speciallye reserue the hearinge and iudgement in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses matrimoniall.</p>
            <p>And further ye shall vnderstande (good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) that the maner to mynyster thys Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Matrimonye is thus to be vsed. Firste lette the man aske the woman if she bee content to be hys wyfe, and if she agree thereunto, then lette the woman aske the man lykewyse if he bee content to be her husbande, and if he saye yea, so that the mutuall consent of them bothe bee kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, wythout the whyche no maryage is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made before God, then maye the partyes proceede too the woordes whyche doo expresse this their mutual and voluntary consent, whych bee the formall woordes of the Sacrament, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner.</p>
            <p>Let the man taking the woman by the ryght
<pb facs="tcp:114:182"/>
hand, and naminge her by her name, as Marye, Iane, or as her name is, say these wordes: Iane here I take thee to my wyfe, and lykewyse lette the woman take the man by the right hand, and name him by his name, as Thomas, or as hys name is, saying thus: Thomas, here I take thee to my husbande. Nowe, when the two parties which marry together haue done this, and haue sayde these woordes, then be they ensured and iustlye marryed together, and be man and wyfe before God, and they can not breake thys mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in any wyse afterwarde, as the man can not marry an other woman, nor the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other man, so long as they be bothe alyue. And yf the two persones haue sufficient recorde and wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to testyfye what they haue done and sayde, then bee they manne and wyfe in the face of the world, and so both before god and man.</p>
            <p>Thys maner and fourme of woordes not onelye the parties that intende iustelye to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye together, but also suche other as shalbe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to bee present at the insurynge of other, as wytnesses of the same, ought dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to marke and obserue, and to see that the parties whiche shall be insured, saye the fore rehersed woordes, for they be the very woordes, whiche ioyne the man and the woman together, and make theym husband and wyfe.</p>
            <p>The neglectinge or omitting of these formall woordes or the lyke in effecte and sentence, is oftentimes the cause of greate contentyon, and
<pb n="clxxiiii" facs="tcp:114:182"/>
also maye cause that the externall iudgemente of the Churche shall varye and dysagree from the inwarde iudgement of God. For example: Yf a man obteynynge in woordes the womans consent to marriage, and she hys lykewyse, shall saye these woordes: Iane, here I geue to thee my faythe and truthe and I promyse thee by it that I wyll marrye thee to my wyfe, and shee promyseth and sayth to the man the verye same, yea althoughe eche partye byndeth him selfe by an othe of a booke too performe that promyse wythin twoo monethes more or lesse: yet for all thys, these twoo persones bee not insured, and made man and wife by these woordes, although they haue sufficient recordes to testify the same, because these woordes be not the formall woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the sacrament of Matrimonye, nor make man and woman husbande and wyfe. Yet these persones that make suche promise, bee bounden to marry accordinge vnto their promise, vnder payne of settynge theym selues in the state of dampnation: And yet notwythstandynge if the man shall marrye an other women after thys promyse, he is than the seconde womans hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, and not the fyrste, thoughe the fyrste he styll alyue.</p>
            <p>And the like case is, yf the woman marrye an other man after her promyse made before, she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is than the seconde mannes wyfe, and not the fyrste, because the partyes at that present tyme
<pb facs="tcp:114:183"/>
when the one promised faith and trouth to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye the other, dyd not contract Matrimonye by the formall woordes of the presente tyme, by whiche they bee knyt together in maryage, but sayde other woordes sygnifyenge promyse and tyme to come, and so afterward chaunged their myndes contrarye to theyr promise, whereupon followeth many times grudge, hatred, and sute betwene the parties and their frendes, &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also it followeth that the partyes so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysing maryage one to an other, doo lyue in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and deadlye synne wyth the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which they maried afterward.</p>
            <p>And for the further openinge of this matter, ye shall vnderstande (good people) that if a man and woman doo consent in theyr hartes too bee man and wyfe, and doo wyll and intende so to make theim selues by the woordes whyche they shall expresse and saye one to an other, and than vpon thys consent and agrement, the man saith vnto the woman thus: Iane, I promyse thee by my faythe that I wyll take thee to my wyfe. And the woman saythe likewyse to the man, or els some other suche wordes of promyse to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye in tyme to come, thinkinge and beleuing that by those woordes they bee iustelye insured and made man and wyfe: Nowe in thys case these two persons be man and wyfe before God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they wylled and intended so to bee in their hartes, and also intended so too make theym selues in deede by their wordes.</p>

               <pb n="clxxv" facs="tcp:114:183"/>And yet they bee not man and wyfe before man, and by the iudgement of the church, though they haue sufficient record of that they did &amp; saied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did not say the formall wordes of the present time wherby Matrimony is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted, without sayinge of whiche woordes (if they can speake) they be not insured and made husbande and wyfe before man and by the iudgemente of the churche, what so euer they intended in theyr hartes, for the church must take the wordes iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and iudge what they signifye after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speaking and vnderstandinge of them, and that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may know, and not after the myndes and intentes that persones may speake, for that can no man know but the speakers them selues. And therefore in this case when the woordes of these two persones so insuringe them selues, be brought before a Iudge to be examined: it muste bee determined that those two persones bee not husbande and wyfe, and yet if eyther of theim do marry, as the man an other woman, or the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man an other man, then do they commit adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, and lyue in deadly synne, so long as they be with those whom they haue maried. And that is because they made them selues ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and wyfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the syght of God, who sawe theyr willes and hartes, and what they intended, &amp; dyd then before him, and therefore that maryage whiche they made than, they maye neuer breake after. And in case the man shall forsake that mariage whyche hee made before God, and shall openlye ioyne himselfe in mariage with an other woman
<pb facs="tcp:114:184"/>
afterward, then shall he synne deadlye, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the same, so long as he is with that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom he last openly married, because they be not married before god. Yet dothe not the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter woman synne, to vse the carnall companye of that man, because shee beleueth he is her law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful husbande, nor she is not bounde to beleue the contrary though he tell her the contrarye, and so she may alwaies vse him as her husbande, yf he vse her as his wife. And the lyke case is if the woman breake from the first ensuring, &amp; marry an other man, then dothe not he sinne to knowe her as his wife, but she sinneth, because she kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that he is not her husbande.</p>
            <p>But nowe what remedye for a man whyche hath insured and married him selfe to a woman before God, with a full minde and consent in his hart, and yet forsaketh her afterward, and wyll not solemnize that mariage, but marrieth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openlye, howe maye he saue him selfe from deadly synne and dampnation, seynge hys Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late by the iudgement of the churche wyl compel him to continue with the second woman who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he married openlye, and will not suffer hym to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake her? Surely the remedy is very paynfull &amp; daungerous worldlye, howe be it, it is better to fall into the handes of man, than into the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of God. And for so muche as I can learne, the remedye which that man maye haue is thys: he muste leaue and forsake the seconde woman, and go if he can, and so thynke it good, where he maye escape the paynes of the lawe: And if he be
<pb n="clxxvi" facs="tcp:114:184"/>
excommunicate, because hee wyll not bee wyth her, and for goyng from her then he muste suffer it, and so he muste suffer anye other punyshment that he shall chaunce to haue therefore, rather then to vse carnall companye with that woman agayne, so longe as the other woman is a lyue, for he knoweth she is not hys wyfe before God, and therefore he shoulde doo against Gods law, if he shoulde kepe her companye as her husband, and rather than to doo so and offende almyghty God, he muste suffer anye maner of payne, that the lawe of man maye cause him to haue. And so muste a woman doo if she fall into the lyke case, for thys is the remedye, and there is none other that I knowe.</p>
            <p>And for so muche as I haue spoken some parte of the Prelates doynge herein: ye shal fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowe, that if a Prelate dooe by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and censure of the Church, excommunicate or curse a man or woman for leauinge or forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge the seconde maryage, he doth it iustly and lawefullye, because the Churche oughte to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the best and the most likeliest, that is to say, that he whiche marryeth openlye, beyng a Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten man, would not so haue done, if he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him selfe to an other woman before god, nor haue done so greatlye againste his owne conscy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Gods lawe.</p>
            <p>And also the Church ought to suppose thys seconde marryage good, because it canne not haue a due prooffe of the fyrste Marryage,
<pb facs="tcp:114:185"/>
which the man saythe hee made before God, but ought to iudge and determine the seconde mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to be lawful, &amp; may iustly exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate him that doth forsake it. And moreouer the Churche may not beleue the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which saith that hee was maryed before, &amp; that this second woman is not his wyfe. For besyde that, bee graunteth that he hath broken the promise and mariage whiche he made before almighty God, he also confesseth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly before the church that he is vntrue in hys <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eedes and woordes, and not worthye to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and beleued, and therfore the churche ought not to allow his saying, nor to beleue it as true, concerning the first mariage, but rather to iudge it to be false, and that he sayeth so nowe because he loueth not this woman, but hateth her, or els so he sayth for some other euyll purpose.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I shall exhorte in the name of our sauiour Christ euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or woman diligently to loke vpon them selues &amp; their own consciences, and discretly to consider what they wyll and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende in theyr hartes when they make anye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and promise of maryage openly or secretly. For by their owne consciences and intentes they shall be iudged before God, and be condempned if they do the contrary, althoughe they may with wordes and excuses doo agaynst it, and defend theyr so doyng here in the face of the worlde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man. The surest waye that euerye man and woman may take in making of these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tractes, is to marry alwaies in dede here before man, as they dyd wyll to do in theyr hartes, at the tyme
<pb n="clxxvii" facs="tcp:114:185"/>
of their ensuring, what wordes so euer they said than, for so maye they alwaies discharge theyr conscience and put awaye all doubtes, and lyue iustly together husbande and wyfe in the seruice of almightye God. Moreouer the like doubte or ambyguitie maye chaunce vpon the other syde, that is, if a man and woman come together to insure them selues, and do saye the very formall wordes of the Sacrament before sufficiente re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, and yet the man doth not consent in hys harte to take that woman to his wyfe but saieth the wordes for feare of displeasing his parentes or frendes, or els for some other noughtye pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and likewise of the woman. Nowe these two persones be husbande and wyfe by the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of the Churche and before man, and yf any of them would forsake the other and be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried againe, they maye not so doo, thoughe they both graunt that they did neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent to be man and wife when they were insured, no nor though they do both agree to forsake other, and yet they be not husband and wyfe nor maried before god, and that is because they did not wyll and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in their hartes so to be when they sayde the wordes of matrymonie. And therefore yf these two persones do vse carnal companye together, then the partie which did not consent doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myt fornication and sinneth deadly in so doynge the duetie of mariage, as longe as he continueth in the same wyll and mynd that he had when he was insured, be it the man or the woman. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let euerye man and woman take good hede
<pb facs="tcp:114:186"/>
when they be insured and speake the wordes of this sacrament, that they thinke and will then in their hartes the same thinge, whiche they doe expresse in their wordes, or els lette them neuer speake those wordes neyther for father or fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, or for any other cause. Nowe the remedy in this case is easyer than in the other before, whiche is this, that the man must chaunge his minde and consent in his harte to take that woman to hys wife as he saied before that he did, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man likewise: And this done, then be they man and wife before GOD, and their matrymoniall knowledge together is no lenger sinne but law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good afterwarde. This is the remedy in this case and there is none other.</p>
            <p>Many moo cases and difficulties in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Matrimony I might reherse whiche the Churche of God hath fullye debated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, but I thinke these few to be sufficient to the laye man for vnderstandinge howe mariage ought to be ministred and contracted. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge that the man and woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentinge to bee man and wife, and sayinge the wordes of the Sacrament, be perfitely maryed together: yet the marienge of them in the face of the Churche afterwarde by the ministration of the Prieste is not superfluouse, but muche expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for sondrye causes, firste to thintent that this Sacramente shoulde haue that solemnitie and reuerence whiche is due to so holye a thinge instituted by our sauiour Christe him selfe, for that coniunction whiche the Prieste as Gods
<pb n="clxxviii" facs="tcp:114:186"/>
minister dothe vs to vnderstande, that Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monye is made by the assystaunce and working of almightye God.</p>
            <p>Secondlye that the persones whiche be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried may receiue &amp; haue the fruite of the praiers and suffrages whiche be saide for them in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryfyce of the church, and also may be partakers of the blessinge of God which is made ouer them by the priest, wherby we knowe that the state of lyuing in mariage is blessed of almightie God.</p>
            <p>And thirdlye it is solemnized in the Churche, that it might haue the more recorde and be more allowed and fortyfied by the solemnization, and that all doubtes whiche mighte be imagined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste it, shoulde be put awaye. Further I shal not nede to alledge vnto you at this tyme, but onelye shall exhorte you to haue alwaies God &amp; his true religion before your eyes, in entringe to this state of life by matrimonye whiche can not be dissolued or auoyded at the wyl and affection of man, but must be kept and obserued till death departe the same. For as we see by experience how vpon noughty &amp; affectionate beginninges there commeth seldome good successe: so yf the beginninge of these contractes in maryage bee vsed with discretion and Godlye intent in suche forme as I haue declared vnto you where the harte and worde do ioyne together, and the dede performeth that was promised and sayd before, then shal these manyfold contentions &amp; breache of charitie cease, &amp; the parties loue one an other in chaste loue as Chryste loued hys Churche,
<pb facs="tcp:114:187"/>
and shal labour to bringe vp their children in the feare of God and knowledge of true religion, which shalbe a great helpe and furtherance to their saluation by the mercy and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of our sauiour Christe, to whome wyth the father and the holy ghost be all honoure and prayse for euermore.

For whyche cause I intend God wyllinge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you at thys tyme, whyche causes bee nought and reproueable, and whyche be honeste and Godlye. For yf the intent and cause why men and women dooe marrye be not good and Godly, than shall not there lyfe be acceptable to almightie God, nor yet longe pleasaunte vnto them selues, as experience doth many times eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently shewe. A great number of folkes do mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye for one of these two causes and intentes or for bothe: eyther to haue the luste and vnclenlye desire of the fleshe fulfylled, or els to get world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye goodes and riches therby. Both these causes if they be chefely and principally intended by the parties which marry, be very euil and vngodly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114:188"/>Many yonge men and women doo vse to say in rebuke of other that they wyll not marrye for ryches and goodes, but for good loue, and yet that good loue is mooste principallye for to haue their sensuall appetyte and carnall desyre fulfylled. Whiche maner of loue doth neuer long endure betwene them that so marrye, but it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth and goeth shortly away. And than suche persones beginne to mislyke one an others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and to waxe werye one of an other, and after continuaunce and increace of that wery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it groweth to bee so paineful and greuous, that the parties wyshe them selues vnmaryed againe, yea and many tymes they wyshe them selues buried, and no merueyle. For an euyl tree suche as is carnall concupiscence and fleshely loue, can bring forth no good fruyte but such as I haue rehersed.</p>
            <p>I nede not to shewe and iudge for what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent goodlye younge women marrye poore and miserable persones when they haue done amisse. For they be but a smal numbre, and yet they vse more vyce vnder the cloke and couer of mariage, than they durst do before whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were syngle. Now againste these persones whiche after such sort and with such inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t do enterprise to marry, that they do exclude God from them selues and from their mindes,<note place="margin">

               </note> and do applie and geue them selues to satisfye their lustes and pleasure, as horses and moyles do, whiche haue no reason or vnderstandinge: againste all suche persones (as

the Aungell Raphaell taught the good younge Tobye) the deuill hath power to preuayle.</p>
            <p>And althoughe almightye God of his greate mercye doth not nowe suffer the deuyl to vse his malyce againste the bodies of suche offendours as he vsed in the time of Tobye agaynste the seuen wicked husbandes of Sara the doughter of Raguell:<note place="margin">

               </note> yet no doubte of it their noughtye eye doth make darke their hole bodie, that is to saye, their wicked and lecherouse intente dothe corrupte their soules, whereby they come to the snare of the deuyll, who spirituallye preuayleth againste them.</p>
            <p>Moreouer the greater parte of the other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dothe marrye for the other cause, that is, for goodes and ryches. And for this purpose man and woman doo not onelye marrye them selues, but they doo also studye and labour to marrye their children and kinsfolkes to gleane and get ryches. So that nowe commonlye there is no other vertuouse lyuinge, honestye, good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wisdome, stocke, lynnage, personage, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, youth nor any thinge els so greatly regarded and considered as is worldlye goodes and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions. For if the man be voyde of vertue and discretion, and lette him haue deformitie, and be without personage and so forthe, yet yf hee haue greate lande and goodes, there shall be no faute nor lacke founde in him, but shal haue su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnto him for their doughters &amp; kinswome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And on the other syde, yf a woman haue greate
<pb facs="tcp:114:189"/>
substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and goodes and many good Lordships and Manours, although she haue neuer one or fewe good conditions or vertues she shal be sure to haue suters to marry with her, both of great men and other, be she faire or foule, yong or old, beautiful or deformed: but the miserable life and sorowful paine that suche persones many times haue of their mariage, they them selues can tell, and yet they be not able to expresse wyth theyr tonges, all that they fele &amp; suffer in their hartes. And then they curse their goodes and the daye in the whiche they were maryed. Yea and more ouer we see daylye that great men doo sell theyr children as thoughe they were bondes &amp; slaues, and do nothinge studye or labour to marry their sonnes to good wyues, nor their doughters to good husbandes, but their principall care is to sell them where they haue moste monye. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse the buyers doo not care for the good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of those they buye, but loke more vpon the landes and rentes whyche those shall haue and enioye, and therfore oftentimes both the buyers and sellers of suche wardes and other, marrye their children to great misery and endlesse paine. And thus for goodes and riches they be vnkind, vnnaturall, and cruel Fathers vnto theyr chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and cruel frendes vnto theyr kynsfolke, in geuing and procuring to theim so painefull and sorowfull a lyfe. And manye tymes they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye their owne families and auncyent houses thereby, for that their sonnes noughtly brought
<pb n="cxxxi" facs="tcp:114:189"/>
vp, or els their sonnes in lawe euyll chosen, for lacke of grace, and the rather also for suche dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrement as chaunceth betwene them and their wyues maried principallye for possessions sake, dooe waste and consume in small tyme all that their parentes and auncetours wyth all theyr wyttes, longe seruice, and painefull industrye, and labour, haue gotten together in many yeres before.</p>
            <p>And here ye shall vnderstande good people, that I doo not prohybyte and forbydde men to looke for no maner of goodes when they wyll marrye: For reason doth graunt that bothe men and women shoulde before they marrye wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder, what crafte, occupation, habilitye, and what goodes they haue them selues to lyue with all if they marry. And reason doth admytte that they shoulde likewise looke what habylitye and substaunce they be of, wyth whome they wyll marrye, and wey and caste howe suche charges as maye growe vnto theym by chyldren and otherwise when they bee maried maye be borne and susteined.</p>
            <p>These thinges men and women whyche wyll marrye oughte well to remember and consyder, and therefore I speake not agaynste suche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations and lookinge for goodes, but I saye almyghtye GOD and reason dothe reproue and condempne all them whiche do marrye most principallye for goodes and ryches. For that intent and purpose is noughte and contrarye to
<pb facs="tcp:114:190"/>
Gods ordinaunce in that behalfe. And it is also euident that goodes and monye, Lordshippes, ryche apparell, delycate fare and so forthe can doo no pleasure or profyte vnto the hartes of maried persones, excepte they haue together faythful love kyndenesse, &amp; ioye, one of an other, and godly and comfortable agrement.</p>
            <p>Nowe that I haue shewed vnto you suche causes of mariage as be vngodlye, it is lykewise requisyte to declare the other causes whyche al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD and his holye word doth allow, whiche be the verye same wherfore GOD did institute and ordeyne thys Sacrament of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonye, that is to saye, the loue and desire of children and posteritie, by whom GOD should be more honoured, and the hatred of fornication and vnclene life.</p>
            <p>The first cause is set forth in the boke of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen. i.</hi>
               </note> where God blessed our firste parentes and bad them increace and multiplye and fulfyll the earthe. Tobye the yonger shewed that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed onely for thys firste cause, sayinge vnto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightye GOD thus. O Lorde thou knowest that I take thys woman to my wyfe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tob. viii.</hi>
               </note> not for cause of lecherye or to satisfye and fulfyl my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal lust and desire: but I take her onely to haue posteritie and chyldren, to the intent that thou mayest be alwayes here blessed, lauded, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. And for thys intent Christen men shoulde mooste principallye marrye and brynge
<pb n="clxxxii" facs="tcp:114:190"/>
vp their children in vertuouse lyuinge that they maye iustely lyue, laude and honour almightye GOD, and when God sendeth them chyldren, to teache them to doo the same. The vnchry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened and heathen men doo marrye to haue chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to encreace their people, but not to haue almightye GOD lauded and honoured, whose honour and glorye good men shoulde spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye seeke to set foorth and encreace bothe in them selues and in their children.</p>
            <p>The other cause is that men and women might by this Sacrament haue a iust and good remedye agaynste the sensuall appetyte of the fleshe, &amp; to auoyde the sinne of fornication, when they feared that they coulde not lyue otherwyse chastelye, whereof Saint Paule wrote to the Corynthians thus. It is good for a manne not to touche hys wyfe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>i. Cor. vii.</hi>
               </note> yet for auoydinge of fornication, lette euerye man haue or vse hys owne wyfe, and lette euerye wyfe haue or vse her owne husbande, and lette the man paye hys debte to hys wyfe, and lykewyse the wyfe to her husbande. For the wyfe hathe not nowe power of her owne bodye but her husbande, and lykewyse the husbande hathe not power of hys bodye but the wyfe: dooe not defraude one an other, excepte it bee for a tyme by mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to the intent ye myghte geue and applye your selues more freely to prayer, &amp; so forth. So that these two intentes, that is to saye, the loue
<pb facs="tcp:114:191"/>
to haue children, and the hatred or auoydinge of fornication, as they be the principall causes why this Sacrament of Matrimony was ordeyned of God: so they ought to be the principall causes why men and women shoulde marrye together. For so shall they receiue the graces whiche God geueth in mariage, &amp; shall beautifye his church, and haue greate helpe and furtherance towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des their saluation. And contrarye they that with couetouse and lecherouse affections dooe ioyne theym selues in mariage, they loose the grace of the Sacrament whyche they mighte haue hadde, they dishonour thys holye Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in making it a cloke and a defence for their noughty and vicious intentes, and they brynge them selues vnder the power of the deuyll, who than is permitted to preuayle againste them.</p>
            <p>Moreouer good people, it is expedient when a man wil marry for the causes before rehersed, that he diligentlye remember and consider the lawe of Matrimonye. That is to saye, howe he shall bynde him self to loue his wife as his owne bodye,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephes. v.</hi>
               </note> and better than any other man, woman or chylde, in suche sorte as Christe loueth hys Churche, and did geue him selfe to the death for it, to make it holy and without spotte. And also the man ought not to be bitter &amp; fell against hys wife in vsing brawlinges, chyding, or fightinge with her.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coloss. iii.</hi>
               </note> And that he muste kepe iustely matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial chastitie, &amp; that he must forsake to dwell with his father &amp; mother and al other persones,
<pb n="cxciii" facs="tcp:114:191"/>
for to bee and dwell wyth his wife, and that he ought also to cherishe, helpe, and comforte her, as he would do his owne persone. For when he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, he and his wife be made one bodye.

Which thing the holye Apostle Saynte Iames also deliuering that to the people, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had receyued of Christ, setteth foorth more at large, writing thus: <hi>Yf any person be sycke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges you, let him call the Priestes of the church to be brought in,</hi>

            <p>Fyrst he telleth to whom it ought to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, that is to say, to Christen men or women such as haue receyued the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme before, and not to euery one of them, but to such as be than visited by the hand of God with some great sycknes of the bodye, and be in some perill of death, by reason of the sayde syckenes, and not by any other outward violence of warre or execution, and not to yong infantes that haue no neede of it, nor to suche, as eyther for younge age, or for phrenesie lack the vse of theyr reason, but to such as haue knowledge and haue domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ouer theyr own willes, and being in venial synne do requyre the same either than or before, as it may be presumed by theyr former will. So that it is euery Christen mans dutie to requyre this Sacrament with humble request and with perfite hope to atteyn the grace and effect which
<pb n="clxxxvii" facs="tcp:114:195"/>
is geuen by the same.</p>
            <p>Secondly, saint Iames expresseth to whom it apperteyneth by offyce and dutye to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of this Sacrament, in that he wylleth the sycke man to call for the Priestes of the church. For onely Priestes be appointed to be ministers thereof, not as in theyr owne name and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but in the name and authoritie of our Lorde Iesus Christ, so that the Priest in that doynge dothe beare and represent the person of Christe and hys holy Church, who besyde hys prayers, doth minister the outward Sacrament of auei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and Christ inwardly worketh the inuisible grace of the same in the soule of the party auey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, like as he vseth to do in al other sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</p>
            <p>Thyrdly, Saynt Iames expresseth both the matter or outward element of this sacrament, and also the maner howe to vse it. The matter wherein it is ministred is oyle, which is a thing most conuenient to declare the effectes and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces geuen by the same. The maner howe to vse it, is by prayer ouer the sycke persone, and by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting him in such places of his body, as wer occasions, or as it wer windowes, wherby sinne is chiefely committed, as the places of our fyue wittes or senses. For by the eyes concupiscence, couetousnes, and manye other vyces enter into the soule: by the eares detraction, false reportes, and thereupon folowing anger and enuye, and suche like infect the soule: by the nose, delitious lyfe, and muche other occasion of synne is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred: by the mouthe both in tastyng, and also in
<pb facs="tcp:114:196"/>
speakinge that is agaynste God and hys neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, a man often tymes doth offend by the rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and other partes therunto adioyninge, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall desyres and concupiscence of the flesh is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to corrupt the soule, and finally by the handes and feete is practysed muche vyce, the particulers whereof I neede not to reherse. For these causes the sycke person is anoynted in the sayd places, at which tyme the Priest and they that do than assist hym, with sure faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in almighty God, putting away all my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust and doubt, make theyr most humble pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to his maiestie, that it would please the same, throughe that vnction as a spirituall medicyne and hys most mercyfull goodnes to pardon and remit what so euer the sycke person hathe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his sight, or hearing or anye other part of hys bodye aboue mentioned, with manye other godlye and holsome prayers thereunto annexed and vsed to be said and frequented in the church of Christ. And thus to praye ouer the sycke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone and to aueyle him, is not the inuention of man, deuised by mans wytte, but accordynge to Gods ordynaunce is done in the name and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of our Lord, who is the authour of thys sacrament, as he is lykewyse of al the other, by whose assistaunce, and secrete operation this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament woorketh hys spirituall and inwarde effect, which effect Saynte Iames last of al de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, saying: <hi>The prayer of fayth shal saue the sycke, and God shall relieue and lyft hym vp, and if he be in synne, they shall be forgyuen vnto hym.</hi>
               <pb n="clxxxviii" facs="tcp:114:196"/>
Which effect is double or twoo wayes, the one chiefe and principall is in purging and makyng cleane the soule from daylye and veniall synne, whych neuer fayleth, if the sycke partye doo not stoppe the influence of Gods grace, whyche hee maye doo by remayninge then in deadlye synne, neglectinge to procure that to be forgyuen vnto him before, by the sacrament of Penaunce, or by mistrusting to receyue that grace of God whiche is signifyed and promised by that holy vnction. Therefore ought euerye man and woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng sycke, fyrst to confesse hym selfe and receyue the Sacrament of Absolution, then to receyue the blessed foode of immortalitie in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Aultare, for the perfection of Gods influence, and the increase of all hys former gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and than afterwarde wyth sure faythe and confidence in God, requyre to be aneyled of the Priestes of Christes Churche. And in so doyng besyde the perfyte purgynge of hys soule, hee shall (no doubte of it) feele inwardly great ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agaynst the paynes and horrour of death, great strength and comforte of the spirit, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by lyke a good warriour and stoute Champion of Christe, he is then made more able to wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the vyolent tentations of the deuyll, and fynallye greate ioye and gladnesse in hym selfe, great staye and increase of fayth and hope towardes God, and great desyre to be deliuered from the myseryes of thys transitorye worlde, and to be called to the eternall Cytie of God in the kyngdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114:197"/>The other effecte is the healyng of the bodye from corporal diseases, or at lest the mitigation of the same. Which effect is not principall, and doth not alwaies follow: partly for the smalnes of faythe in the sycke person (for great and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fayth is requyred to haue Gods power to woorke such corporall health in men,) partly for that God our most mercyfull father, accordynge to his heauenly wisdome, thinketh it best for vs other wyse to dispose of vs as he knoweth to be most expedient for the saluation of our soules, or the commoditie of his elect people, whose bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of corporall health, if it had bene then besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon vs, perchaunce the malice of our wyll would haue abused it to the offence of God, and the daunger of dampnation to our soules.</p>
            <p>Therefore in all such indifferent thynges, as be sycknes or health of body, euery Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man ought to commit and referre it to the good wyll and pleasure of almighty God, and to think and esteeme that to bee best, what so euer God shall worke by vs, although it seeme to be hurtfull to vs, or to be contrarie to oure desyres and petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which in all thinges (as he taught himself) ought to be directed and submitted to hys wyll and pleasure, who alwayes of his godlye proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence disposeth all thinges swetelye and mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But how so euer God shall worke concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our corporall healthe, we ought surelye to trust, that god for his part (if there be no stoppe in vs) fayleth not to woorke inwardlye in oure soules the spirituall effectes whiche I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersed
<pb n="clxxxix" facs="tcp:114:197"/>
before. And because there be two thinges whiche let the soule freelye to haue recourse to God, and to delyte altogether in him, the one is that weaknes and feablenes which is left in the soule of man after the wounde of deadlye synne, althoughe the gylte of the same be remytred by true penaunce, the other is, the daylye heapynge vp of many venial synnes, into which a man fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth by fraylnes of nature, by sodeyne motions, by imperfection or coldnes of charitie, by vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agonies of sicknes, or by negligence in not taking heede to himselfe, his actes, and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For that cause to remoue these twoo euils, God hath ordeyned this Sacrament of extreme Unction to bee ministred, whereby the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the soule is strengthened, and all venyall synne remitted, if it be well and deuoutly recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And seyng a man must needes once departe hence, and ende the iourney of this troublesome lyfe, for so much as the soule is by the flesh lode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, drawen backe, infected, disquyeted, and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: therefore it hath neede of a newe strengthe and spirituall medicyne, specially at the passage hence by deathe, that it neyther fall, gyue ouer, or dispayre, but that it be relieued, disburdened, pacified, comforted, &amp; made able by the strength of the holy ghost to abyde wyth God, and by his ayde to passe through the miseries and trauails of this lyfe, and to exchaunge the shorte &amp; lyght affections of thys tyme, wyth the eternall and weyghty ioyes in the kyngdome of heauen. All whych graces, as I sayd before, the soule of the

sycke person receyueth and is indued withall, by the worthye and deuout receipt of thys holy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ordeyned of almighty God for the same purpose. Thus haue ye heard good people the meaning &amp; effect of the doctrine of s. Iames con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this sacrament how it ought to be vsed, what grace and vertue is geuen to vs thereby, which to neglect and to defraude or depriue our selues of the benefites thereof wylfullye: were great folye. For althoughe it be not absolutelye necessarie to saluation, as is Baptisme, without the which no man ordinarylye can be saued, yet if it be dispised and of contempte not regarded, when it may be had, it is a let and stoppe to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Wherefore I shall exhorte you all in the name of God, that when God by syckenes shall visite any of you, ye folow the counsel of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghost, vttered and expressed by the writing of this holy Apostle Saint Iames, that ye call for the priestes of the Churche, I meane the great vniuersall Church of Christe, which is knowen through out the world, in the communion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as members of the same church, (to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye saluation is promised and prepared) see that ye requyre the sayd Priests or Priest (if there be but one) to praye ouer you, and to aueyle you in the name of the blessed Trinitie. And doo not differre this till the vehemencie of your sickenes decaye your speache and memorie, as it is done amonges many which peruersely vse the Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes of the church as they vse theyr corporal phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, neuer sendinge for theym, but in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes

when they can doo them leste good. But seyng Sainte Iames willeth the sicke persone to call or send for the priest, let him doo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his will, his senses, his memorie and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing doo faile him, when he is able to ioyne with the priest in prayer, and to protest the faith and trust he hath in atteining the grace &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
