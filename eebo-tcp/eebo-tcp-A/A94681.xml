            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To the Right Honourable Thomas Adams, Lord
Major of the famous Citie London, the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull
the Sheriffs, Maſter Thomas Foote, and Maſter
John Kendrick, with the reſt of the Aldermen their Brethren:</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe are to give your Honour and Worſhips to underſtand: That your Petitioners
have taken notice, of many worthy actions done for the honour of God, the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the King and Kingdom, the preſervation of the Goſpel and true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
amongſt us, and eſpecially by the ſtrict Keeping of the Lords-day: as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the river of Thames, by Watermens not labouring on the Sabbath-day:
and it is an honourable act of them that have done it, which we aſcribe
to no other but the Parliament: and ſome of your petitioners have been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for Trifles, not worth the nominating: like thoſe Phariſees in the Goſpel,
which rebuked our Saviour Chriſt Ieſus his Diſciples for pulling the ears of corne
on the Sabbath-day (yet they themſelves ride on the Sabbath-day in Coaches) as if God ſaw not
that ſinne, by ſetting Men and Horſe at worke, as Hackney Coach-men (which is their trade) why
not Water-men or any other Tradeſ-men, if they be ſuffered? But your Petitioners having experience of
many worthy actions which you have already done, for King, Church, and State, your loyaltie to your King,
your piety in deſiring an eſtabliſhed Church-Government, and for your fidelitie to the Parliament (which
they themſelves cannot deny) to the wonder of the world, and to the everlaſting Fame of this Honourable
Citie London, that ſo great a City, ſo populous, which may, and (as we have read) hath been compared to a
petty world, for the ſtatelines of its Governours, and Corporations therein.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, that to everlaſting Fame you may be Eternized, that you all (as one man) will be pleaſed to
move the Honourable Houſes of Parliament, that as they have reformed the ancient river Thames, That
they would be pleaſed to reform, the almoſt as ancient renowned City London, of Coaches travelling about
the City on the Lords-day, which is a higher breach of the fourth Commandment then that which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
have reformed; by ſetting the Beaſts to work on that day, which ought (by the law of God) to reſt
as well as man, and he that doth but reſt, little differeth from a Beaſt.</p>
            <p>And to take notice how many Churches in London are annoyed by their paſſing by in Sermon time, to
the great diſhonour of God, and to the hindrance of the hearers of the Word, which is the onely means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God of our ſalvation; And if not ſpeedily Reformed, it will breed a great ſcandall on the Parliaments
Reformation, which may be ſuch like words as theſe, That they could ſee to reform Boats; but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
or will not reform Coaches.</p>
