            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>HEre is no stout Dedication to any <hi>Illustrissimo</hi> for a Protector, who beyond all peradventure knows nothing at all of the matter; and tho' you should flatter him with all the <hi>hyperbole's</hi> of his Family or Ancestors, and of his great Endowments and heroick Virtues, yet he would think himself not paid in full, for lending of his Name to adorn your Frontispiece. The motive of publishing this Tract, is not the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Friends; for none of 'em ever had the view of any part of it. Neither would I be so unfortunate to please many of the <hi>Faculty;</hi> for that must infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly draw upon me the Envy and Hatred of Ten times the number, besides Calumnies and Reflections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The chief inducement proceeds from an inclination to Mankind, to instruct them, to preserve and prolong their Lives; thereby to prevent them from using fraudulent Quack Medicines, (which are now become so Universally vendible among them) or advising with such as are wholly Ignorant, and consequently ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bold. I do in no wise pretend in these following Sheets, to make a Lecture to the Learned; tho' I should think my self sufficiently rewarded for my pains, if I could arrive to the point of advancing the Art of Physick, by offering to them my Observations on the pretended and fallacious <hi>Methodus medendi,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon false <hi>Indications</hi> (received for true) abstracted from Diseases and their Causes, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the trials I have made of the best and most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Remedies, which upon diligent inquiry in my thoughts I could not find to have contributed any thing towards the curing of Diseases, and tho' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb facs="tcp:49498:4"/>
upon the use of 'em, I am certain ought to be ascribed only to time and strenght of Nature, and to be term'd <hi>Curing Diseases by Expectation.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, I hope by making so great a number of Doubts, and moving as many Difficulties, to have done some Service to the <hi>Art,</hi> in giving learned Men the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to remove them, and to take seriously into their consideration, whether all, or most part, and indeed any part of what the Ancients have transmitted to us concerning Diseases, and their pretended Remedies recited in their Books, and by others afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled into <hi>Dispensatories,</hi> ought to be received by us with an implicite Faith, so as to doubt less of the truth of them, than of those fine Histories of an <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> or a <hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all, I must tell you, a Self-interest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd very much with me in the printing of this, which is, that writing an ill hand, and being puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled sometimes to read it, and the Matter not diges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into any sort of order, I might have a more easie recourse to my own Thoughts and Sentiments, being expressed in Characters more legible, and so disposed, that I could then more readily turn to them.</p>
            <p>I do also think my self obliged to take notice, that in the following Discourse I have very much receded from those Opinions written by me in former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, whereinto the almost universally received Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Authors, and my neglect of examining of them rationally and experimentally, had led me, as you may more particularly observe hereafter, for all which <hi>Terence</hi> in <hi>Adelphis, Act. v.

               <pb facs="tcp:49498:4"/>The Sense in English is; That no Man ever made so exact a Caculation of matters in his life time, but either the occasion of things, or length of Years, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, doth offer something that's new; and gives you to understand, that what you thought you knew very well, you do not know at all; and causes you by making trials to reject that, which before you did most approve of. This I must own to have found true in my self, and particularly in reference to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual putrid Fevers, which are most common in <hi>France,</hi> and malignant Fevers most frequent in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> very few of the former being observed here. I did as near I could imitate the generality of Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers in curing of them; I advised Bleeding as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as others, tho' nothing near so frequently as now they do, which is a far greater Error in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fevers (as most of ours are) than in those, commonly call'd Continual Putrid Fevers; not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting cooling Apozems and Iuleps, that allay the heat, and abate Thirst; sweating Iuleps and Pouders to drive out the Heat, that is, those nitrosulphureous and bituminous Particles that might occasion that heat, as I then thought, and not negl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have bad very lately occasion to make observation upon a sort of malign Fever, that was popular about us. They were generally taken with Coughs, Drowsiness, moveable Ioint-pains, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed Rheumatic Pains; some did spit Blood, and afterwards Matter; they were for the greatest part free fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They generally said they ayled no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they were not sick, but they had gotten a great Cold, tho' they were suddenly reduced to the greatest weakness. Those that upon their own heads, were blooded after the fourth day, or were Blooded more than onc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Difficulty is easily remov'd: That sort of Stinking Breath, which is here instanc'd, doth not proceed from the least Putrefaction of the Lungs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for very oft those Persons so affected have very sound Lungs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> breathe well and free, live to a great Age, and digest their Victuals very well; which is a sign also t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, tho' it must be granted, that a stinking Breath may for a time be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd by Steams, arising from a foul Slyme in the Stomach, corrupting there, and relaxing the upper Orifice so, as it doth not close so exactly as it ought: But this is soon cured, by clearing the Stomach by a Vomit, or Purge. You are therefore to apprehend, that the Cause of a perennal Stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Breath in those healthful Persons, is to be imputed to Slyme ousing daily and hourly out of the Glanduls of the Throat, and harbour'd in some deep small hollowness or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice near the Tonsils, and sometimes on the back-side of the <hi>Uvula,</hi> either towards the Right or Left Tonsil, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept long, and constantly meeting there with a putrid Slyme that was left there before, doth corrupt and putrefie the Slyme that ouseth thither every Moment: The Breath of the Lungs passing by, carrieth those putrid Steems with it, and so causeth that Stinking Breath, which is but very little amended by sweet perfum'd Lozenges, chawing of Orange-peel, Spices, or sweet Confects. The only Palliative Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is, to use a strong abstersive penetrating Gargarism four or five times in a Day, especially in the Morning soon after rising, and at other times after eating and drinking, made of a good quantity of Wormwood-tops, Century-flowers, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range-peel and Iuniper-berries, boil'd in Vinegar, or White-wine, sharpen'd with Spirit of Sulphur. This, by piercing into that Crevice, or Hollowness, and wiping off the putrid Slyme, removes the Cause, and renders the Breath very tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for a considerable Interval, and by chance may in time wholly cure it, tho' commonly it is incurable.</p>

Three such Locks being broke open by a Notorious Thief, Stole thence a Hundred Pounds in Moneys numbered, and a Book of manuscript Receipts finely covered. The party injured condoled the loss of his Remedy-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript to such a degree, that it wholly drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49498:7"/>
the loss of his Money-bag, which he would readily have compounded for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of the Book, which the blank paper in it excepted, would have been overvalued at Two-Pence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next recital coming within my knowledge, will give you a farther taste of this sort of foolish Credulity. The Servant of a Linnen-Draper had so great an Interest in her Mistress, as to borrow out of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Closet a Book of scribled Receipts, which through a Communicative kindness to one of my Maid-Servants, was entrusted with her to be Transcribed; but the Master daily conversing in his Closet, soon missed what he so frequently eyed, and valued above all what was in it; upon a strict enquiry after the matter, his Wife as soon qualified his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness, by acqainting him where this valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treatise was to be found, who not long after accosted my Maid several days, being delayed for want of an opportunity of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing. The person being tired by unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory answers, resolved to disclose to me the cause of his so frequent Conferences with this Menial of mine; and promising to use my Authority with her, I did not doubt, but I should oblige him with the return of his Book next Morning at a certain Hour, at which time precisely he came, when I did not fail to discharge my promise, in repossessing him with his Book, which he received from me with all the respectful Reverence, that Hands and Knees could express. You will not judge
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49498:8"/>
it improbable, that my Curiosity should lead me to inspect these Papers, which to the best of my Memory contain'd an excellent way to Stew a Calves-Head with Oysters, another to make Fritters, and some other pieces of Cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; also a Salve for Chilblains, a Plaister for all sort of Swellings, an infallible Drink for the Stone, a most certain Remedy against a Consumption, and all sorts of Coughs of the Lungs, being a Syrup jumbled of most strange Materials. Varieties of other Infallibilities of Remedies equally foolish I pass by, and shall only remark the immensity of this Man's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, by his Mournful Countenance, whilst his Book of Secrets was absent from him, and to what serenity he was restored upon his rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statement.</p>

Suppose one of these Medicines were to be taken out of this Magazine of Health, and to be applied against a Consumption, Stone, or any thing else, the failure he would most certaintly attribute to the want of some of the Ingredients, their too long being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, too much or too little being boyled, or to a hundred other Miscarriages, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that it would not give the least shock to the stability of his belief, which might not be singular in this person, but general in thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands.</p>

his Money, as the value of knowing the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and vertues of so many hundreds, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thousands of Plants doth amount to: And indeed the Bargain of that Plant-Book would prove extraordinary Cheap, did what is contain'd in the hundredth part of it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Truth in matter of Fact, which gives me occasion to make this Inference; that Herbals are sitter for Gardiners than Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in furnishing the former with a Scheme of Figures of so many thousand Weeds there described, and consequently to throw them out of their Manures, as Absorbers of the juice of the Earth, that should give Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their Esculents. However, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent contradicting the Old Phrase, <hi>Natura nihil facit frustra,</hi> it may not untruly be affirmed, that the generality of Herbs growing in Fields, Meadows, and Hills, Nature seemed chiefly design'd to bestow upon Beasts. It would therefore be an Employment sitter for Boys, that love Rambling and santring about Fields, and Hedges, to go upon Simpling, (as our Botanists do term it,) than for Men, to make such needless, and not unchargeable Journeys, to the remotest Hills, and Woods, only to be acquainted with some New faces of Plants, and take the Portrait of 'em, to be placed together in some bulky Volume, whose immensurable industry doth no more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual those, that have taken the pains to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract the Pictures of variety of Beasts, Fishes, Birds, Flies, and other Insects, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> and his Mimicks, who in

               <p n="2">2. What is all this but <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> namely, general Notions drawn from all particular Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? A Natural Body doth consist of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, that is, extension into length, breadth, and depth, mensurability, or divisibility into Particles, (it's much as one in the Original,) of motion, or rest, of figure, and position or scituation.

               <p n="4">4. It is to the Spittle many Physicians of good Fame do attribute the chief, or rather sole power of dissolving the Victuals into Chyle, by raising a Fermentation in the Meat and Drink, that's swallowed down into the Stomach; for being chawed, crush'd, rowl'd, and turn'd about in the Mouth, it's mixed with such a proportion of Spittle, which by its Spirits and salive Particles, assisted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what by the native and ambient hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if you consider the nature and use of Spittle, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly this matter may appear otherwise. Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cannot properly be called an Excrement, which is of no use, and ought to be thrown out and expelled; but a Recrement, which is of use and ought not to be expelled, unless it be abounding, and after it hath performed what its int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The use of it to me appears, to moisten the several parts of the Mouth, Gullet, and Windpipe, and to keep them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly glib, smooth, and soft; for otherwise the Tongue and Jaws by their frequent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the steems that continually pass out of the Lungs in the expiration, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those parts so dry, stiff, rough, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable, that they would b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Windpipe would be so corrugated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, that it would put a stop to the respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the Gullet would likewise through want of Spittle suffer such a streightning and roughness, that it would be utterly incapable to give passage to the Victuals. Touching the nature of Spittle, it is in no wise different from <hi>Lympha,</hi> which is contained in other <hi>Lymphae-ducts,</hi> the <hi>Ductus Salivales</hi> being no other, and as long as it continues in the said <hi>Ductus,</hi> its much fuller of volatile saline Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which renders it limpid, fluid, and thin; but being come to the Mouth and the other parts, out of the said <hi>Ductus,</hi> those volatile saline Spirits do soon evaporate, and fly away, whereby the Spittle becomes thick, mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous, and oft frothy, by the admixture of extraneous Air, and other slimy Particles, it meets about the Mouth and Throat. So that if Spittle be of this nature, it must rather hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49498:15"/>
fermentation, and consequently the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended solution into Chyle, which that it doth, is manifest in those Melancholians, that are commonly termed Spitters, who generally have a very bad Digestion. But suppose a Man that abounds with Spittle, should spit a quantity of it warm out of his Mouth into a warm bolt head hermetically closed, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a small bit of Meat, that had been well grinded in a warm Mortar, and then this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being put into a warm sand Bath, do you believe, here would happen either a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, ebullition, or solution into Chyle, though it were to continue there six Weeks? Or, suppose a Man should swallow several great lumps of Flesh without chawing of it, or mixing it with his Spittle, do you not think, he would digest it into a Chyle, though it might take up some longer time, than if his Meat was chawed? What Spittle doth a <hi>Shar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. That the <hi>Lympha</hi> in all the <hi>Lymphae-ducts,</hi> (and the Spittle also though more sparingly) is perfused with some remaining proportion of volatile saline (that is Animal) Spirits, appears to me by the similitude of Argument, for establishing the circulation of the Blood out of the Arteries into the Veins, and thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Arteries again. The chief motive to me being, that the Heart throwing at every
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49498:15"/>
Pulsation such proportions of Blood into the Arteries, these must of necessity swell to an extremity and burst, were there not other Vessels, namely, the Veins, ready to receive and unload the Arteries; as for the swelling of the Arteries on the side towards the Trunc, and of the Veins towards the extremities of the Body, upon a Ligature made on any of the Joynts; or the Arterial Blood upon Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotomy slowing from the Trunc, and the Venal Blood upon Phlebotomy flowing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Trunc, would scarce be persuasive enough to me to receive that Doctrine, since other Reasons might be given for those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Intumescencies upon a Ligature, or the different issuing out of the Blood out of the Arteries and Veins. In like manner I do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that the <hi>Nervous Lympha,</hi> which is the Vehicle, and containing Liquor of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, is always flowing or dripping from the Brain, and <hi>Medulla Spinalis</hi> to most parts of the Body through the Nerves; and cannot be supposed to return back again naturally, which therefore must of necessity extreamly swell, and stiffen the Nerves, unless received and disburden'd by some other Vessels, which in all probability must be <hi>Lymphae-ducts,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in substance, tenuity, clearness, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrative vertue, and other qualities, a <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> not unlike the gleet, that distills from a wounded nerve. Moreover, considering the valves in the said <hi>Lymphae-ducts,</hi> opening to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Trunc, and shutting towards the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, doth add to the apparency of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49498:16"/>
forementioned supposition, implying there is a circulation of the Animal Spirits and <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha.</hi> The foresaid <hi>Lympha</hi> being received by the <hi>Lymphae-ducts,</hi> must necessarily be much impoverish'd in its volatile saline Spirits, and consequently have lost its power of appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of motion and sense, though otherwise of very great use.</p>

Neither can I conceive, that the Stomach is capable to contain any Acid juice powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to dissolve Bones, Grissels, Sinews, Skin, and all sorts of Flesh without hurt, and danger of perforating its membranes, being much softer and easier to be dissolved, than Bones or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news.

Those recited, and the like edibles, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fermentative spirit in them, seldom fail in fermenting, during which, as it suspends, or at least retards the Concoction, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they seem matters so easily digestible, and incomparatively less difficult than Beef, Pork, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet the solution cannot, or is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom perform'd with vigour, until the for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said fermentation ceases, which is perceived by the subsiding and relaxing of their drum bellies. Hence it is, that many do find, they cannot digest so easily upon drinking bitter or sower Small-beer, or strong Ale, Beer, or Wine, as a small alish smooth Beer, Water, or Wine and Water, because the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such a large proportion of fermentative spirits. And it is upon the same considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that new Drink not being sufficiently clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of its yist, and other feculencies, proves so offensive to digestion.</p>

In the same manner I do conceive, that all sorts of Victuals, be they hard or soft, are as easily and readily digested in strong and sound Constitutions, by the most subtil saline particles of the Body, (which are the Animal spirits) steaming in clouds out of those large Nerves of the sixth pair, that are inserted into the Stomach, and their numerous branches that are disseminated through its tunics, which forcing into the pores of the alimentary substances, rare them asunder, divide, and dissolve them into the minutest particuls, and being mixt with the moisture of your Drink, are converted into that juice we call Chyle, Hereunto the warmth of the Stomach derived from the Arteries, and cirrounding Bowels, is very assistent, though it hath been oft observed, that some whose Stomach hath been commonly felt very cold by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore, where change of Drink shall be judged necessary, from the continual use of strong Beer, or Wine, you may descend to small Beer, Barley-Water, clarified Whey, a weak Mead, thin Grewel, or the like.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of the passing of the Chyle into the Guts, and its depuration there.</head>
               <p n="1">1 FRom what is here incidently discoursed, I return to a farther explication of the Digesture of the Stomach, where the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als being dissolved, and by continuance of Concoction smoothed, and brought to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation, the Chyle doth then require depura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a separation of the thiner and finer parts from the groser and feculent, by a Fermentative juyce, which I suppose to be an Acid, joyn'd to igneous Spirits, by an <hi>interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of some glutinous emplastic Particles, as may be discovered in Yest, or Levain. This Fermentation (I will only suppose) happens at the close of the Digestion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to rarefie and huff up the Chyle in the Stomach, whereby the lighter and thiner parts become rising and swelling, and gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally work over the <hi>Pylorus</hi> into the small Guts, the Stomach in the same proportion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it self into a lesser and shallower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, as it is emptying and growing less full, and distended, by which means the trajecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chyle is facilitated, until there is nothing left, but a gross and feculent acid juyce, serving to assist as a dissolvent to digest what may remain more difficult, be it some grisly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49498:19"/>
or sinewy, or other tough hard part of the Victuals, Pye-crust, or any thing else that is more difficult to digest, than what is already wrought over the <hi>Pylorus</hi> into the small Guts; which being performed, the same acid juyce by its sharpness pricks and stimulates the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the Stomach, (contracting it self into a very narrow Volumn) throws that also, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with what it hath dissolved, over the <hi>Pylorus.</hi> Whence I do give my self a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reason, why the latter part of the digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is always acid, and why at that time we are subject to four belches, and how it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the fulness and distention of the Stomach, which most are sensible of at the end of their Meals, doth gradually lessen, and as soon as the sour appears is quite allay'd, and the digestion finish'd. And if I attribute not too much to fancy, I do observe, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Persons towards the end of Concoction, do perceive an uneasiness of heat all over, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their Faces, extremities of their Hands and Feet, but particularly those that are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Hypochondriacks and Hystericks, who about that time, and a good while after, are subject to have flushings in their Faces, and their symptoms (as faintnesses, palpitations, roaring Winds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) set into motion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon the dripping of the Chyle into the small Guts, the Fermentation is considerably augmented, by the meeting with the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious Juices from the Glanduls of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Mesentery,</hi> mixt with Gaul from the biliary Vessels, whereby the Chyle is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49498:20"/>
wholly depurated of all its feculencies, which being separated, are term'd excrements of the Belly. That there is such a fermentation in the Guts, appears by the tension and intume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence of the Belly, in some more, in others less, which may be perceived two, three, or four Hours after Meals, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of their digestion, separation, and subsequent fermentation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As I am not very flexible to recede from the general opinion of the Antients and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, importing, that the first Concoction is performed, either by vertue of the heat of the Stomach, or by force of Fermentation, as it is asserted by most of the learned, that were cotemporaries with the famous Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> and others that do succeed him: Neither am I willing to be thought so criminal, as to be contumatiously guilty of Heresie in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, yet its pardonable, if not allowable, to be Shismatical in ones proper opinion, which in all Mankind is free, and not to be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and therefore I do declare, that nothing but late experiments of no small number, do induce me to retract my former sentiments of this, and many other matters in Medicines, as firmly believing, what I have expressed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the first Concoction, and Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that the Sun is the cause of Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; though at the same time its very pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le for me to be under a mistake. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all this be really true, or only in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I am thence provided with the soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of hundred of difficulties, offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49498:20"/>
on those subjects, and the full and plain discovery of the causes of many, if not most Diseases, and what is beyond all, not unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfully conducted in the practical part, which to me is a satisfaction beyond what I have met with, either in conversing with Printed Authors, or with Men reputed very learned and experienced in the Faculty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Upon the well beginning depends the well finishing and compleating, the Stomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beginning of the whole Body, it is from the true Knowledge of its fabrick, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, Action, or Operation, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Constitution of all the Bowels, their Actions, and Operations of the whole Animal is derived. The Stomach is the only and true tuning part of the whole Body, which being well or ill tuned, causeth a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or Discord of all the Bowels. The Stomach being strong and vigorous, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Office, or Action, and Operation in perfection, renders the Body Strong, Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and long Lived; but in proportion, as it is defective in any part of its Office, Diseases in it self, and all other parts of the Body are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender'd, answerable to the degree and quality of its defect, and to the dependency all the Bowels have on it; for being the Laboratory of the whole, whatever is ill prepared here, cannot be mended afterwards, by any of the succeeding Bowels, the Chyle being vitious or corrupted, can never be converted into good Blood, nor that into good Animal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, no more than you can make good But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49498:21"/>
or Cheese out of sower or corrupted Milk. And as most, if not all internal Diseases, (En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic and Epidemic excepted,) are Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced in the Stomach, they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be cured by the Stomach, internal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies exerting their first and stronger force upon it, the vertues whereof it afterwards transmits to the part Diseased. Neither is it to any purpose, to pretend to cure any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Disease, without first of all having put the Stomach into good order, which done, most Diseases are ready to go off of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Stomach bears an adequate Analogy to the root of a Tree, and may properly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be called the root of a Man; for as the root of a Tree is the beginning of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives or draws the juice of the Earth, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and convert it into Food for the Trunc, and all the Branches, and being well digested, transmits it to all the parts; in like manner, when the Tree is observed not to be thriving, or the Branches to be decaying, changing of colour, withering, or dying, where do they look for the cause, but at the root of the Tree? Even so is it with the nourishing of the parts of the Body, and the Diseases they are subject unto, in relation to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Describing Medicines to preserve Health, and their Preparations.</head>
               <p>BY the deduction from the preceding Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, my Opinion perswades me, that the weakness of the Stomach, and its faintly performing its Office, is only occasioned by the debility of the Stomach Nerves, and its numerous branches, by being plaister'd up by too much Fleam, gross acid dregs, indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible Meats, or offensive Drinks, or other matter admitted into the Stomach, which by lodging there too long, assume a corroding Quality; or by too much heat, and too little moisture, are converted into a nidorous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. This supposed, I do believe, and have experimentally observed, that all those Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboratives of the Stomach, whose vertue is commonly asserted, to consist in a gentle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictive and warming Quality, whereby those slimy Humors are more firmly cemented, such as <hi>Aromaticum Rosatum, Caryophyllatum,</hi> Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon-water, those hot spicy Brandy-waters, a red Tincture of Roses, Methridate, Treacle, all those Compound Electuaries framed of heating Conserves, Condits, and Peptick Pouders, are so far from contributing the least strength to the Stomach, that rather a contrary effect hath ensued, and being long continued, do carry danger with them. The
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49498:22"/>
only means I have hitherto found to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Stomach, are proper abstersive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, gently wiping off those clammy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances from the tunics of the Stomach, and the terminations of the Nervous branches, and among these I have not yet detected any thing, equal to a good <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> well prepared by a long Digestion in a Sand-bath, the proportion of the Ingredients being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what altered from the common, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing also substituted in place of the Myrrh: A drop of this shall exceed a pound of Peptick Pouders, Electuaries, and other fop Stomach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks. Do only keep your Stomach clean, you will certainly preserve its Strength, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent most Diseases.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not to be understood, where a heap or weight of crudities is accumulated, so gently absterging a Remedy can have a power to disengage the Stomach, no more than a wet Mop can be supposed to rid a Room of a heap of Rubbish, in which case something more stimulating is required, that may be used in all Seasons of the Year, be it sultry or friezing, without the inconvenience of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement to Diet, or warmth of the Air, and without offence to the Stomach, or putting the Body into any disorder, to which purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the Pill I here now describe, I have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally found to be effectually answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in most respects.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take one Ounce of the clearest shining <hi>Aloes,</hi> which at the <hi>Druggists</hi> will cost about a Groat, or sometimes Six-pence an Ounce,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49498:22"/>
this being free from any considerable dross<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will not require any depuration. Pouder it in a Mortar, covered over with a brown Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, having a hole in the middle for a passage to the Pestil, to prevent the little pieces of the <hi>Aloes</hi> from leaping up, while you are in the beginning of your pounding; For afterwards the paper may be removed. Observe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint thinly the bottom of the Mortar and Pestil, with a little <hi>Florence</hi> Oyl, to keep it from sticking to the bottom. When its redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a gross Pouder, by gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nding it with the Pestil you must bring it to a smooth fineness. Put the Pouder into a small glazed flat-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd earthen Pan, that will contain about half a pint, pouring upon it about a quarter of a pint of fair water, wherein hath been dissolved two drams of <hi>Spanish</hi> juice of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorish, which is done by slicing it very small, and setting the water in a porringer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a gentle heat; place this small earthen pan into one somewhat bigger, having sand in the bottom to the height of an inch, and afterwards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>illing it up to the brim. Set them over two piles of bricks, of three or four bricks high, laid flat. The piles must stand at such a distance, that they may reach the edges of the bigger pan, to support it. Then make a moderate fire of Charcoal under it, to heat the sand, to cause the superfluous moisture to be evaporated, until the <hi>Aloes</hi> is brought to the thickness of Honey. Or you may by dropping two or three drops on the back side of a plate to cool, make trial, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49498:23"/>
it be reduced to the consistency of Dow; for if it be overdone, the mass being render'd brickly, will not only lose most of its virtue, but also its aptness of being framed into Pills; and if itbe not evaporated enough, it will be sticky, and not apt to be brought to a Mass.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The lesser pan being taken off, when the evaporation is sufficient, before its quite cold, you must with a <hi>Spatula,</hi> or slice, take out the Mass, and between your Fingers, being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle anointed with <hi>Florence</hi> Oyl, or Oyl of <hi>Sweet Almonds,</hi> to prevent the sticking, rowl it into a round ball, which you may keep in a Sheep's Bladder, being likewise thinly wetted over on the inside with the same Oyl, for many Months, if necessary, without any great impair of its vertue.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A small piece of this Mass being form'd into six, seven, eight, or nine little Pills, of the bigness of a Pepper-corn, is a Dose suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give two or three motions, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of Pills, and the loose or Costive Constitution of him that takes them. The safety of this Medicine adds much to its Character, since the taking of one Pill or two more or less, imports as little hazard, as the taking it very oft, or in any kind of Season, be it hot or cold, unless your Body be subject to a Looseness, or the Hemorrhoids, or your Constitution be thin, hot, and dry.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By the addition of the juice of Liquorish the <hi>Aloes</hi> is design'd to be obtused in its too pungitive quality, whereby its apt to raise the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49498:23"/>
Piles, and becomes somewhat less precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and consequently hindered from lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expectoration, which in this Climate is so necessary in Coughs and Pththysicks.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The same correction may also be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by dissolving the same proportion of clean <hi>Aloes,</hi> in half a pint of juice expressed from the contusion of an Ounce of <hi>Bugloss,</hi> or <hi>Borrage</hi> Roots, or a large handful of their Leaves, and stirring half a pint of warm water with them in the bruising, and clarified by subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in letting it stand in a Sellar for a day or two, and pouring it off the Faeces or Dregs in the bottom. This evaporated in the same manner will produce a Mass, almost equal in goodness with the former.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I cannot hitherto observe, that the use of these Pills, though frequently taken, either once in a Week, Fortnight, or a Month, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time, the Stomach by reason of its degree of weakness in the digestive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty may require, doth in any wise debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate those, that may properly use them; but on the contrary, rather corroborate their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, by assisting it to throw off that heap of rubbish, and crude Humours, which those that eat and drink plentifully, and either live sedentary Lives, as many that are Educated to Professions, or others that are not used to exercise or labour, are subject to engender, especially if naturally of a weak Constitution, or of an advanced Age.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For three or four days succeeding the use of these Pills, a good <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49498:24"/>
taken Morning and Evening, in a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Dose, hath by my Observation ever had the good effect of preserving Health and preventing Diseases.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To what I have mentioned touching the advantages of a familiar Acquaintance with those Mundifyers, both the Pills and the Elixir, the inquiry I made of a fresh colour'd vigorous <hi>Dutch</hi> Burgher, I casually met in my Travels, who exceeded the Age of four score, may in somewise add a confirmation. He did averr to me <hi>Bona side,</hi> that for 40 Years last past, he had seldom or never omitted once in a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, or sometimes sooner or later, according to the direction he received from his marks of fulness and uneasiness, to cleanse with Seny stewed with Prunes, from which custom he did derive his capacity of eating a hearty Meal of any thing he liked, without advising of the wholesomness, or easiness of Digesture, and at times of drinking a Glass of Wine to an Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to accommodate his Friend.</p>
               <p n="11">11. As lesser Purgatives do rather contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute strength by their consequence, so the greater being properly used, do not carry that danger with them People commonly imagine, since I have known many, that for Three Months successively, have taken strong churlish purging Pills every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, some few days only omitted; I may say, some have swallow'd a pottle of strong Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Pills in a few Years, and lived in full h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alth to a remarkable Age, and not without a libertine Mode of eating and drinking.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49498:24"/>
Whence its apparent, that the toughness of the Nerves, upon which the strength and action of the Bowels only depend, doth suffer as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by the strongest Purgatives, as an <hi>India</hi> Cane by a thousand times bending, which notwithstanding will recover its former figure and full strength. It were to be wished, that bleeding could be administred with the same safety, of which it may be justly said, that the Lancet hath, and doth in proportion kill more Men than the Sword, and it's as commonly observed, that those Physicians who do so generally practise it, know little else what to do; and on the other hand their Patients are as rash and prodigal of their lives, to submit to their heedless advice. As the first and second bleedings may be of great use to many Bodies and Distempers in the colder Climates, so I have ever remark'd, that the third and fourth have proved as detrimental, and not seldom fatal; having observed, that with two bleedings at most, succeeded with other proper remedies, incomparatively more continual Feavers, Rheumatisms, Pleurisies, and Phthysicks have been cured; then have survived those frequently reiterated bleedings, which in common Practice usually give the parting blow.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Its a consequence an Ideot inserts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Person having been blooded eight or ten times in a great Distemper, doth recover his Health, he owes the benefit of it to the bleedings, whereas it ought rather to be said, neither the Distemper nor bleeding could kill him.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:49498:25"/>13. To return from this Deviation to the use of Purgatives; tho those that are strong, are required in great Diseases, they ought to be avoided in lesser Distempers, or where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is only intended; for all Purgatives deriving their power from a specifick fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Spirit, or Salt, by rarefying or huffing up morbisick Humours, and afterwards by stimulating the Nerves to throw them off af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter separation, when strong ones are taken, where no Disease is engender'd, they are apt to cause one by fermening, or rarefying and stimulating the laudable juices or operating upon those dormant humours, which by strength of Nature, or assistance of mild pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Purgatives, and abstersive Corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, might easily have been worn off. Thus it hath oft been observed, that some by taking <hi>Extractum Rudij,</hi> have soon after fallen into continual Fevers; others through a preventing care to avert the Gout, have immediately fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into a violent fit, upon taking <hi>Elixir Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutis, Bromfield's Pills, Golden Spirit of Scurvy Grass,</hi> or the like empirical Medicines, which is not all the mischief such sort of Purgative vendibles have occasioned, as being unskilfully invented, and more unskilfully prepared, since not a few have been thrown into mortal Diseases by the use of them. Yet I stand more amazed at the folly of Mankind, that is so easily allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by vain boasting and mendacious <hi>Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia's</hi> upon <hi>Laudanum liquidum</hi> plainly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or disguised by a solution of <hi>Opium</hi> into volatile oleaginous drops, to the frequent and

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49498:27"/>
and lymphatic fluors, dripping from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vessels, may cause great pains, but less sharp, and being more subject to be incrassated, may cause swellings near the Joynts. The same subtil nervous serosities, or vitiated <hi>Lympha,</hi> being thrown upon the Kidneys, tare and vellicate their most sensible membranes to such a degree, that scarce any torture can equal it, and that sometimes, though seldom, without the least suppression of Urine, but for the most part with a total, or partial suppression, and a great sharpness of Urine, which is then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Fit; the pain which at other times the Stone in the Kidneys doth occasion, being only a heavy obtuse pain of a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and more frequent returns, which at great intervals, as Spring and Fall, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite those cutting serosities to the part, and then also are the greatest Fits; for I cannot conceive that the Stone turning angular, and grating upon the Membranes, is so general a cause of a Fit of the Stone, as many of the Learned do imagine, since a Stone once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of its bed or seat, whereto its ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by a glutinous tartarous slime, can easily, if ever return to its place, and be there fastned again as before, for which reason Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians are very cautious of administring strong Diuretics, for fear of driving the Stone out of its place. Neither do I believe, that those bloody Urines, which are so frequently made by Nephitical Patients, are caused by the corners of the Stone being moved, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

caused by a sharp <hi>Serum</hi> corroding the mouths of the vessels, or blood may be squeezed out of the vessels by the internal swelling of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Kidneys. It doth oft hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that some of those forementioned most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til limpid serosities have taken another channel, through branches of the same Nerve, that tends to the Kidneys, being divaricated and inserted into the great gut of the Colon, where they cause that great pain, (though less acute than the other, that part being by much less sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than the internal membrane of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,) which is termed the Stone-Cholick. Since then this acute pain in the great Gut cannot be caused by the Stone, at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, its more than probable, that those most exquisite pains in a sit must be occasioned by some other cause, which by many Arguments to me can be no other, than the foresaid se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity. <hi>Secondly,</hi> you must consider also, that all Opiates being inwardly taken, perform their Operation by exerting their power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Brain, <hi>in principio nervorum,</hi> in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the influx of the Animal Spirits, (that communicate sense to the Guts,) and streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Nerves, whereby pains are not only appeased in any singular part, but in all parts equally, supposing they were all in pain. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> you are to conceive, that there being a digestion perform'd in the Brain, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Arterial Blood into Animal Spirits, there must be a solution, and afterwards a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and expulsion of Excrements, which in part are a limpid serum, that is abandon'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49498:28"/>
to the ventricles of the Brain, which are the proper receptacles of that Excrement, as much as the thick Guts are of the Excrement of the Chyle, or the Bladder of the Urine, being the Excrement of the Blood. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession is also required, that this most subtil sharp excrementitious serosity, having quite filled up the ventricles of the Brain in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter measure, than they can well contain, or throw off through those passages Nature hath ordained, the thinnest part is forced into the <hi>principium nervorum,</hi> (the other part being received into the Veins and <hi>Lymphae-ducts</hi>) and carried either to the Extremities, or Kidneys, where it causeth the Gout or Stone, or to the Teeth, where it occasioneth a most exquisite Tooth-ache, or several external parts or joints, producing those violent pains, that are termed a Rheumatism, or to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> where those shri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Summarily I do believe, there scarce happens any pain, (unless caused from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,) Tumor, or Pustul, where this nervous Excrement is not a principal cause, which may be more plainly explained in another place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Against this Discourse may be objected, That the Nerves obtaining no visible hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, cannot be supposed, to transmit such a quantity of <hi>Limpid Serum,</hi> as must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to cause those before recited Diseases. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That its uncommon, and not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or any sort of vessels in the Body, that are destinated to contain, and convey their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49498:28"/>
natural and proper Liquors, Juices, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, toconveigh any other that is excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or praeternatural. To the first its answered, there must necessarily be proportionable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities in the Nerves, to contain such great measures of Juices, as have been frequently observed to drip from Nerves, though small ones, that have been cut through in Wounds, and much more from great Nerves; and therefore those larger Nerves near the Brain must be thought capable to contain a very copious quantity of moisture. If the Nerves when cut out of the Body and Dead, do not shew any visible cavities, it is because being emptied of their Spirits, and a great part of their moisture, their pores and channels do subside and fall to a close compactness. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a Nerve that is cut out, and grown from a greater bigness to that of an ordinary pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread, when its dried and condensed, its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the smallness of a fine Thred or Fibre, which when it was tumid within the Body, and fully extended, must necessarily have contained a great hollowness, though divided into innumerable very small or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutest passages. In answer to the Second, it hath been more than once observed, that purulent matter from Imposthumations in the Lungs, and <hi>Pleura,</hi> hath been evacuated through the Kidneys and Bladder by Urine, whither it hath been circularly conveyed by the veins, that have taken it up. The thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part of the Turpentine, that by Glyster hath been injected into the great Guts, hath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49498:29"/>
been taken in by the vessels, and by circulation carried to the Kidneys and Bladder, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Urine, giving by its strong smell of Violets a plain evidence of it. True it is, these instances are not natural conveyances, neither is it to be understood so of the Nerves, but to be preternatural.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This premised, if you apprehend this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> to be only probable or apparent, (which I do believe to be Truth, though at the same time I must own, that I do retract from my former Opinions, being thereunto induced by sundry Experiments and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations) it must necessarily follow, that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates frequently used, do at length not only with-hold, but intirely stop the afflux of the Animal Spirits, and closely shut up the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Nerves, whereby those acute serosities are pent in, and thrown back into the medullar substance of the Brain, which hapning an Apoplexy, Palsie, Lethargy, or some other Mortal soporous Disease must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably succeed; and hence it is, that in all those, who expire upon their seisure with those Distempers, the anterior Ventricles of the Brain upon dissection, do ever appear filled with such a sort of acrimonious limpid sero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, the Nerves and other vessels being either too much filled, or too much closed by subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, obstruction, or otherwise, to admit of a regurgitation thence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Notwithstanding though the daily, week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or frequent use of Opiates is most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended with most pernicious consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49498:29"/>
yet the extraordinary and stupendious benefit it imports, even very oft to the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a Man from the jaws of Death, when cautiously and necessarily advised in a fit of intollerable pain, a profuse Hemorrhage, an impetuous Catarrh, violent Vomitting, a flud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> long and strenuous Hysterick Fits, when they begin to threaten danger, want of Sleep for many Days and Nights, and such like urgent symptoms, may give a just cause to hold a correspondency with that or the like Medicine, provided it be not too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, and be very well prepared, and that in the interval you prevent the necessity of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this dissembling pacisick Friend in again, by removing the cause of those hazardous Diseases, and that the Patient have Strength, and Spirits enough to wrastle with such a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious and dangerous Guest, should he prove too rude. Wherefore I account it the greatest boldness in so many little Quacks and empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, even some Widwives, and Nurses also, who being intirely destitute of the necessary skill in preparing this ruffian Juice, and much more of the true knowledge of applying it, dare assume the confidence of administring it so indifferently to the loss of so many Lives, who in my Judgment can scarce have too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Law made against them, especially where a Man may be Murder'd privately, without giving the least jealousie, that any thing else besides his Distemper killed him.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I Have for a long time with an implicite Obedience submitted to the <hi>Dogmata</hi> of the Ancients, confirm'd by the approbation of the Learned succeeding Ages, as appears in former writings, touching the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Pulsation, which latter in the Heart and Arteries is by them resolved, to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by a pulsifick faculty in both, or as some will have it, originally in the Heart, and from thence derived or continued in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. This sort of explication now appears to me very negligent, and universally appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to any thing; for to say the pulsation is caused by a pulsifick faculty, is equally to saying, that Sight, Hearing, Vomiting, or Purging, is perform'd by an Optick, Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Emetic, or Cathartic faculty; or, to be shorter and more general, by a specifick or occult faculty; from which any inquisitive person can receive but little satisfaction, or scarce make a solution of any <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> with the least advantage to the practical part of Physick. Wherefore to make my marks bear the better, in resolving many doubtful Queries, and serving for a true and safer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the practick, I do rather make choice to say, (in imitation of <hi>Copernicus</hi>'s affirming
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49498:30"/>
the motion of the Earth to the exclusion of that of the Sun or Firmament,) that the Heart and the Arteries do not move the Vital or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Blood, but that the Blood moves the Heart and Arteries to a pulsation; in the same manner as may be conceived, that the Air pressing and silling the Lungs, at the same time press the Air, that fills the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice between them and the Diaphragm, and in a great measure moves the latter to a dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the <hi>Inspiration,</hi> lifting up at the same time the Belly with all the included Bowels, and crowding or condensing the ambient Air, the weight whereof (if I may so call it,) or its inclination to be relaxt again, (in indeavouring to return to its former po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,) together with the fuliginous steems, that are forced out of the whole circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Body, in their turn cause the retraction or repercussion of the Belly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphragm, in the <hi>Expiration</hi>; for its a plain and received Doctrine, that the motion of the Diaphragm, which is accounted a great instrument in Respiration, is as much natural, and more natural I may say, than it is spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous in Beasts and Infants, or voluntary in Men; and I do farther conceive, if there were no Diaphragm created in Men and Beasts, the ambient Air is sufficient, to set the wheels of the Lungs on going: For there are abundance of moving living Creatures or Animals, that have Lungs, and do inspire and expire, on which Nature hath not bestowed a Diaphragm. So that the great use of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49498:31"/>
Diaphragm seems to me, to be an instrument of expulsion, in causing, or chiefly assisting to exonerate the Guts of its Excrements by Stools, the Stomach of its offensive contents by Vomit, and the Lungs by Coughing. It may be likewise compared to a <hi>Flabellum,</hi> or Fan, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oves and ventilates all the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air contained in the great cavities of the Body. The motion of this internal Air, I do conceive, is as much assistent to the motion of the Spirits and Blood in the Arteries, Veins, and Nerves, and to the peristaltic motion of the Stomach, as the Air and Wind is to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sea, which latter the greater it is, the higher the Waves are moved. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Natural Philosophy doth Teach us, That as much Air as is inspired and admitted into the Body by the Lungs, so much Air must n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49498:31"/>
enough in the dissection and narrow inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Bullocks Midrif, whereof one is made use of in the dilatation, and the other in the contraction of the Breast; for its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, to believe, that the same muscle can perform two contrary motions.</p>
               <p>That no living Creature can subsist without the Air, and perspiration, is allowed by all, but for what Reason, or what use or benefit the Air doth afford it, is only slightly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is for ventilation only, that is to say, it gently fans and moves the living Spirits, and therein assists them in sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Fuliginous, and other Heterogeneous little Bodies or Particles, which otherwise would choak, or suffocate the said living Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. In the same manner I do conceive, That the Air in ventilating the focal Fire, or any burning flame, doth assist its most subtil parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in separating and expelling fuliginous and other corpuscles, and rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ives them also in those places, which it (I mean the Air) leaves to fill the places, left by the said fuliginous and other corpuscles; so that a Fire or flame seems to be extinguish'd, or rather suffocated, through want of Air, because it hath no places to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose its fuliginous and other corpuscles into, and stands in need of its assistance for ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gentle motion.</p>
               <p>From this premised Discourse, I deduce these consequences to my self. 1. That upon the goodness of the Air (which consists in a just temperament, a due thinness, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or purity) depends chiefly the Health
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49498:32"/>
and long life of Man. Too much heat, or too great thinness of the Air moves the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits too impetuously, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disperses and consumes them, weakens the Body, and hinders all Digestions; whence it is, that people are short lived, and weakly in the <hi>Indies,</hi> long lived and strong in the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Climates. Frequently and gently mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and oft changing the Air from one place to another, though only out of one room in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, seems to me to conduce very much to Health, because by those frequent removes you avoid inspiring the same fuligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Air, which you do expire; on the other hand, they that live sedentary Lives, that are slothful, or much addicted to lie in Bed, are seldom Healthful, but commonly crazy, and dull in their senses.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If change of Air generally is of so great an Advantage, it is far greater, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of necessity to those, that labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Distemper of the Lungs, or any kind of difficulty of breathing; so that I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that many cannot be cured without change of Air, notwithstanding the assistance of the best and most proper Applications, which sometimes the Air alone doth Cure, and other times being assist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. I am apt to believe, That in the Air are contained most subtil corpuscl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Take away the Air, and Life (which consists in motion of the Animal Spirits,) ceases at the very moment.</p>

I Return to the Heart, which to me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears for use, like unto a draining Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Mill, serving to throw off, and disperse the water to any parts, whither the Wheelshall cast, or direct it by its impulse; in like manner the Heart is an instrument, whose principal Office is, to throw the Arterial Blood to all parts of the Body; And as the spirituous and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible eruption of Water out of a deep cavern of the Earth at the source of spring head, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with its being highest in scituation, (in respect of the declination of those places, to and over which its impelled,) is the cause of that motion, so the Brain may very probably

be esteem'd the Source, as being the highest scituated; whence the Animal Spirits do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly rush out into all the Chanals, Humors, and Parts of the Body. Wherefore, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Brain and it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In like manner do the Animal Spirits penetrate, from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the the Body to the extremest parts, as Toes and Fingers, which the sense of Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth attest to us; and likewise to the deepest parts of the Bowels. I do not imagin, that the Animal Spirits being transmitted through the Nerves, must arrive to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of them, before they can be dispers'd to all the circumjacent parts; but that the Nerves are pervious throughout all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, with lateral Pores, or minute Chanals, through which they burst out in their descent, giving motion to all parts moveable. Neither do I believe there are any Vital or Natural Spirits, (as they are commonly term'd) but they are all Anim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49498:33"/>
the Veins to move at so great a distance from the Heart, when necessarily their motion must be spent at the Capillars, if the force of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Arteries, be by experience found to be less and less, in proportion of its greater distance from the Heart. But that the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Arteries, should cause the motion of the Animal Spirits, seems to me much more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd; for the Animal Spirits being incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively more subtil, and infinitely stronger and more forcible (as appears by moving all the Joints together with the whole Body) can in no manner be conceiv'd to be moved by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits, that are much more gross, and of so little force, that they cannot make the least impulse upon them. If these Maxims be true, that <hi>Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem</hi>; And <hi>In omni genere oportet ut sit quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam primum, Principium numeri est unum, &amp; omnes numeri consistunt ex uno,</hi> (or if I may so say) <hi>DIVERSIS UNIS</hi>; The Brain doth justly challenge the dignity of being the first and sole principal part of the whole Body, having an absolute Empire and Command over all other parts, performing by its Animal Spirits all the Motions, Functions, Actions and Offices of, and in every Bowel, Humor, and all other subservient Parts, which are only Instruments that modify and determine the said Spirits. This whole premis'd Discourse is plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to me, by this sole Argument. The whole body of Man is created for the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Senses, and local Motion, and these for the internal, <hi>viz.</hi> Understanding, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The Sight, or Hearing, perceiving any dangerous Object, conveys it to the understanding Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the Brain; which, by retracting its Animal Spirits, do at the next instant, cause a slow languid motion upon the Blood, Heart, and sometimes wholly stop it. On the other hand, upon perceiving a pleasing Object, a crowd of Animal Spirits are impell'd into the Blood, which immediately occasions a quicker and more lively motion in the Blood, Heart and Arteries, as may be felt by their pulsati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Whence it appears, 1. That the Seat of Passions is in the Brain, and not the Heart. 2. That the Animal Spirits are perfused thro' all the Arterial, and consequently Venal Blood. 3. That nothing in the Body, doth move so swift as the Animal Spirits. 4. That the whole Body is pervious with Pores, and most subtle Chanals, of various Figures and Dimensions. <hi>Mercury</hi> by external unction, or sumigation, is let into the Body, through the ambient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Aloes</hi> by friction about the Navil, or any part of the Belly, passeth through the Pores to all the circumvestient Membranes and Muscles, until it arrives to the Guts, where it moves Stools, kills and expess Worms. <hi>Tobacco</hi> applied to the Wrist, by penetrating through the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pores to the Vessels, Humours and Spirits, by circulation reaches the Stomach, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking it afterwards to Vomit, and in some Bodies violently enough. <hi>Cantharides</hi> exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally applied commonly cause sharpness of Urine, and sometimes bloody. Opiated Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, though applied to the Soles of the Feet, soon reach the Brain. On the other hand, I have oft observ'd the scent of some Medicines, which I us'd to give in Venereal Distempers, to pass through the Body to the external Skin, which always prov'd a certain sign the Patient would be cur'd. By all which it appears, that those foremention'd Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals were impell'd through the ambient Pores, by the Air lately expir'd, and crouding into the Body again, at the next inspiration, and that those Antivenereal Medicines, were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of the Body to the circumferential parts, by the Air expiring. 5. That the Heart is not a principal part of the Body, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental and subservient part. 6. That the Animal Spirits are <hi>Toti in toto, &amp; toti in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet parte,</hi> performing, as I said before, chiefly and principally, as the sole primar efficient Causes in all the Body, and in every part thereof, all the Offices, Functions and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, except the Rational; wherein its only

It is also found experimentally, that gentle Narcotics have a great influence, in suddenly suppressing all those recited Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; which being universally owned to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate only upon the Animal Spirits, Brain and Nerves, is a manifest Argument, they are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd by an ill affected Brain, and Vitious Animal Spirits. All these prenumerated Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms do accompany a preternaturally affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Brain. and must be acknowledg'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from vitious Animal Spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, tottering weakness of the Joints, sorrowful Thoughts, dimness of Sight, noise in the Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> excepting Palpitations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercurrent and various Pulsations, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought a Primar, but a Secondary

(<hi>per deuteropathiam</hi>) Affection of the Heart, occasion'd through the Vitiousness of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, stimulating, or othertimes retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fibres of the Ventricles, and Valves of the Heart in their motion. How and by what means the Animal Spirits may be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, either by the ill mixture of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituent parts of the blood, and its impurities, and commixtures with adventitious, or other noxious Particles, will take up more room to explain, than I purpose to allow here in this small Volumn, which otherwise may easily be render'd intelligible, or applicable by every Judicious Reader in Physick, and therefore I shall forbear any further Discourse about it. 8. To corroborate my Assertion in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Paragraph, <hi>viz.</hi> that Cordials ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be call'd <hi>Cephalics,</hi> may be plainly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the sudden Relief, Patients in Swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Faintnesses do receive, fromthe scents of Spirits of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> of Hartshorn, <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium humanum, Sanguis humanus,</hi> of <hi>Galbanum, Assa foetida,</hi> and the like; also from the fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Temples, with the thinner spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oyl of Amber, which being admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the branches of the Carotidal Arteries, are convey'd to all the parts of the Brain, where they rouze up, quicken and stimulate the Animal Spirits, and disintangle them from any adhering offensive Particles, whereby the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent being suddenly revived out of his Faintness, and Swooning, and the inordinate pulsation of the Heart reduced, is a manifest proof, that these Symptoms commonly are not depending
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49498:36"/>
upon any Primar Affection of the Heart, but upon the disturbance of the Animal Spirits. 9. Many have been much puzzl'd in some doubtful Matters relating to Infants in the Womb; as, Whether in that Station they have Respiration, and whether their Heart and Arteries have Pulsation; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether the Blood in the Infant doth circulate, and whether the Animal Spirits exercise the same Functions which they do after it is come out of the Womb. I do conceive, the Infant, as long as it continues in the Womb, doth only live the Life of a Plant, and is like to a Sucker that receives its Growth from the Tree, in receiving its Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Augmentation from the Mother: it hath no Respiration, or as little as can be imagin'd; and consequently, that its Heart and Arteries do not undergo any Pulsation; neither doth the Blood circulate in its Vessels, nor do the Animal Spirits perform those Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they are intended for after the Birth of the Infant. The Parts of the Infant in the Womb lying so compact and close, and every place fill'd up with Humours, Excrements and Internal Air, there is no room left to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Air from without; especially being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed by two thick Members, and a surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Moat of Serous Humours: It being the External Air forcing into the Lungs is the chief Cause of Inspiration and Expiration, as I have expressed before that being excluded, there can be no Respiration in the Infant in the Womb. What I have to say concerning
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49498:37"/>
the Manner and Causes of Pulsation, may be best understood by a Comparison to the Sea; which (tho' it be in the calmest Season) is subject to heave up and sink down, or to be dilated and contracted, as appears by its Waves, which is not unlike the Pulsation or <hi>Diastole</hi> (Dilatation,) and <hi>Systole</hi> (Contraction) of the Heart and Arteries. The Heaving up of the Sea I will only suppose to be caused by an Expansion and Rarefaction occasion'd by the Motion of the Salin Spirits of the Sea, of which it may be thought very pregnant by the strong Smell (being <hi>a parte objecti</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin Spirits acting upon or vibrating the Olfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Organ) of Sea-men's Clothes, and other things. The Air being crouded or conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the swelling of the Waves, forces, them down again by the Inclination it hath to recover its former place: In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I do conceive that the Animal Spirits that are copiously perfused through the Arterial Blood do expand, dilate and raresie it, which causeth the <hi>Diastole</hi> or Dilatation in the Heart and Arteries, whereby the Air that is enter'd by Inspiration into the Lungs and all other Ambient Parts of the Body, and filling all the Pores that are capable to receive it, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed and crouded; they relaxing, beat back the Sides of the Heart and Arteries, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing streighten'd, have an Inclination to return, and then occasion the <hi>Systole,</hi> or Contraction. The fore-mention'd Comparison differs in this, that the Arteries are moved continually, in Contraction and Dilatation, throughout their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49498:37"/>
whole Length, reciprocally, all at once; whereas the Sea is moved into innumerable discontinuated Waves, that are lifted up and fall again at opposite and different times; while one Wave rises, the other falls. To which I can only answer, Were the Sea coated about with a thick strong Coat, as the Arteries in proportion are, all the Parts of the Sea, or the whole Surface, would be uniformly heaved up at one and the same time, and fall in the same Order, as the Arterial Blood doth in Pulsation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Hypothesis (how probable soever, or true seemingly, it may be, I will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss at this time) implying the Necessity of Admission of External Air to cause Pulsations, explains that the Heart and Arteries of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in the Womb do not pulsate regularly, or orderly; neither do I doubt but that the Animal Spirits do in some wise move the Blood, (which else by Stagnation, would be subject to Putrefaction,) tho' not circulate. And here a Question may be moved, Whether the Blood in its Circulation, or passing out of the Extremities of the Arteries, into those of the Veins, is pressed out by the Rarefaction and Expansion of the Arterial Blood by the Animal Spirits in the <hi>Diastole</hi>; whereby ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up more room, and as it were overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is squeez'd out; or whether it is forced out by the Vigour of the Animal Spirits, and the Compression of the Arteries in the <hi>Systole?</hi> But then another Question must follow; How, and by what Force, is the Blood mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49498:38"/>
in the Veins, where there is no sensible or manifest Pulsation? For to say that 'tis the Force of Pulsation doth move it out of the Extremities of the Arteries, into the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Veins, through the fibrous, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, most minute Passages, or Pores, by Pulsation, or rather Protrusion: or thrusting forward, must run us into great Difficulties, if not Absurdities. For, <hi>First,</hi> Considering that the Force of Pulsation or Protrusion must be extreamly abated in the aforesaid Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Arteries, and more in the Intercur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Passages, and yet more in the Extremities of the Veins, which suppose in the Toes, can you rationally imagine, that the Force of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, that is so very much diminish'd, if not wholly extinguish'd, can be sufficient to force and thrust forward through so great a Length (as reaches to so far a distance as the Heart) so great and weighty a Mass of Blood, which it must by Process encounter with in the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Veins, besides the Resistance it must meet with in the several Meanders, Turnings and Windings, and a great many Valves (making a great Resistance) of the said Veins, that will still yet more deaden the Force of Protrusion; and yet more, if the Body by streightness of Clothes, or lying upon one Side, suffer a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and Narrowness in the Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppose the left Ventricle, when fill'd, to contain two Ounces, more or less, of Blood (according to the Opinion of some Anatomists) in a Heart of a mean Size; and that, according to the same Opinion, by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49498:38"/>
every <hi>Systole</hi> the said two Ounces are with a violent Explosion, as if it were with a Spring, thrown into the Arteries, it must follow, that by every Pulsation so much is receiv'd and impell'd into the Veins, which being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a forcible Pulsation to return it to the Heart, cannot possibly in the same length of time discharge it; especially, the Blood being now grown more condensed, incrassated, more fibrous, less spirituous, and possibly from a lower to a higher place, and through all the Valves, which as I said before, make a very considerable resistance. If then the Vein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> can not receive so much Blood, as is thought to be propuls<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by two Ounces at a time, by every <hi>Systole,</hi> when probably they cannot receive a Dram or two at most, at every <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stole,</hi> what must become of the remaining fourteen or fifteen Drams, that is by every Pulsation thrown out of the Heart? <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Abating so much Arterial Blood as is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in the nourishment of the parts, and in the supply of matter for ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits.</hi>
                  </note> It must either return, and regurgitate into the Heart, upon which, either an intermittent Pulse must follow, or a total stagnation, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Death. In short, to make the Veins capable of receiving as much, as by Pulsation is thrown out of the Arteries, you must grant as rapid a motion or flowing in the Veins, as there is in the Arteries, which all that have the least sense must deny; for the Blood in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n <hi>Arteriotomia</hi> doth spurt out of the Arteries with ten times the force, and in ten times the quantity, in the same proportion of time, and consequently is moved ten times swifter. It must then follow, that in every <hi>Diastole</hi> the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49498:39"/>
Ventricles of the Heart are either not quite fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or not entirely emptied in every <hi>Systole,</hi> which I do verily believe is so. By what is here discoursed, it appears, that very oft the cause of an intermittent Pulse is the incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Veins, by being obstructed in some place or other, to receive the proportion of what is thrown into them by the Arteries; and the cause of an universal stagnation may be thought too great a repletion in the Veins, wholly excluding the reception of any Blood from the Arteries.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Should it be allow'd, that the Heart by every <hi>Systole</hi> throws two Ounces of Blood (which some do assert the left Ventricle to be capable of containing) into the Veins, and that they receive it; then it will follow, that reckoning only 500 Pulsations in a quarter of an Hour, there must be circulated fifty Quarts; and consequently, that the whole Mass of Blood, or all the Blood that is in a moderate Man's Body (which is thought to contain from Eight Quarts to Twelve, according to the greater or lesser quantity of the fullest, or thinnest of Men, being in Health, must be circulated or moved round from the Heart through the Arteries into the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ighth part of a Minute, which must require a motion more rapid, and make a greater noise, than the <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mes</hi> under <hi>London-Bridge.</hi> Such a career in the Blood must be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make more way in fewer Weeks, than
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49498:39"/>
the Sea and Wind together do, in carrying a Ship to the <hi>East Indies</hi> in many Months. Besides, such a violent motion would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burst the Veins, and break the Fibres of the Blood, but chern it into Red Butter, and Blue Butter-Milk. Moreover, motion causing heat, such a violence would immediately put the coldest <hi>Icelander</hi> into a burning Fever. It is observ'd, that the too violent and quick motion in a continual Fever, makes a separation in the Blood of the Oyly sulphurous parts, swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on the serous.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Ventricles of the Heart are not fill'd by every <hi>Diastole,</hi> nor quite emptied by every <hi>Systole,</hi> appears plainly in Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacs, and Hysterics, who sometimes having a large, high and quick <hi>Diastole,</hi> (as may be felt by feeling the Pulse of the Wrist) and a low, streight, and slow <hi>Systole,</hi> shews that the taking in, must be more than the going out. Soon after the <hi>Diastole</hi> is chang'd from large to low, small and slow, and the <hi>Systole</hi> quick, which signifies a lesser repletion of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles, and consequently, that they were not fill'd as before. What can you think of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micular Pulse?

               <p n="1">1. LOnger Experience hath induced me to recede from my former Opinions in continual putrid, and malignant, I may say, in all sorts of Fevers, where the Blood tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a dissolution of the mixture (I ought not to say subversion of the <hi>Crasis,</hi> or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, being less intelligible) of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituent parts, namely of its most subtil parts, which are the Animal Spirits from the less subtil, and grosser, or of its sulphurous from the mercurial, and saline parts, may properly be termed Putrefaction, which is not necessary, or constantly observed, to be attended with a stink, as appears in a Gangrene of any part of the Body, that is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never accompanied with a stink; though a Corruption, <hi>sphacelus,</hi> or Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, always is. By this separation the most subtil parts, or Animal Spirits running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and being accumulated in greater heaps, do move much more impetuously, whereby the said mixture is more and more dissolved every minute. By this acceleration of Motion the natural Heat (whereof Local motion is the sole cause, as appears by attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rubbing any thing for a long time together causes a Heat; or by the quick and

Moreover, there are some Fevers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no preternatural Heat, quick Pulse, or high-colour'd Urin is perceived, as appears in many malignant Fevers, where the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Blood is dissolved by a sudden extinguishing, or mortifying the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by venomous Particles commonly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from without, or sometimes bred within the Body, which confirms, that a Fever is not a preternatural Heat first kindled in the Heart, whereas its oft kindled in other parts: As for Instance, when an Inflammation of any Bowel, as Lungs, Liver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or where any great pain is raised, there the Heat is first kindled, and thence communicated to the Heart, and all the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts of the Body: That there is such a dissolution in the Blood, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by the Blood, that is drawn off by bleeding in putrid Fevers, the parts being plainly separated one from the other. So that advising all the Coolers you can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, be it Snow-water, Frog-spawn-water, the coldest Spring-water, Whey, sowr Butter-Milk, or Juleps made of Succory, Edive,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49498:48"/>
Water-lilly, or any other Waters, though inforced with Spirit of Vitriol, Sulphur, Nitre, or Salt, and a Solution of <hi>Sal prunella,</hi> they avail so little in Fevers, that they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally found to increase them in all the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as the preternatural Heat, high and quick Pulse, deep-colour'd Urin, and the rest are sensibly raised to a much higher pitch. Neither doth Bleeding in the least contribute to the abatement of a Fever by cooling <hi>per fe,</hi> but by some other way <hi>per accidens,</hi> as I shall endeavour to explain here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. That Physicians have most of em, if not all, wholly abandoned prescribing such sort of cooling Juleps, as being rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental, and content themselves with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising small clear Posset, thin Gruel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an Argument, that putrid Fevers are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural heats, nor are they not primarily caus'd by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Circulation of the Blood in putrid Fevers is too quick, and the Blood too much rarefied, by the too quick motion of the Animal Spirits, is very apparent, and therefore lessening the Blood by bleeding, must also lessen the Circular motion, and diminish the Animal Spirits; which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a moderate measure, as may be done by one bleeding or two, is as much as can be expected from that remedy; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being thereby render'd more free, and the Vessels more Capacious, are put into a State of performing their Office with more ease, in throwing off heterogeneous, and very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49498:49"/>
offensive particles, that are got into the Blood, either from without, or bred in the Body. But should you proceed to a Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Bleeding, you will draw off so many Animal Spirits, that the remainder must be insufficient to perform their aforesaid Office, wherein the cure of a Fever doth consist; and should you tap off all, or most part of the Blood in the Body, as I fear too many do, and have done out of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Stubbornness, the Fever would and must still continue proportionably in the same Vigour and Degree; so that this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, must sooner kill the Patient than the Fever. As for Malignant Fevers, the most Sanguinary Physician will scarce Adventure beyond a single bleeding, which the more judicious think to be one too many.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. It remains then, that the whole Stress in curing continual, putrid, and Malignant Fevers, is by most of our modern Physicians, laid upon such Compounds, as are call'd Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial and Alexipharmacal Waters, Powders, and Electuaries, also some Chymical Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as <hi>Antimonium, Diaphoreticum, Bezoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum, Minerale, Spiritus cornu cervi, Spiritus fuliginis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The chief of those Cordial <hi>Alexiphamacal</hi> Waters now most in use, are <hi>Aqua Theriacalis, Aqua Prothericacalis,</hi> (perhaps the better of the two, as consisting of fewer Ingredients,) <hi>Aqua Epidemica,</hi> &amp;c.

Theriaca Londi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neusis,</hi> and <hi>Diascordium.</hi> The compound alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipharmacal Pouders are usually compiled out of some testaceous Pouders, as <hi>pulvis echelis cancrorum compositus,</hi> and others of Crabs-eyes and Claws, Perl, Oriental Bezoar, burnt Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, and sometimes mixt with <hi>Radix Carli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Contrajerva, Serpentaria virginiana</hi> (which are the chief) <hi>Dictamnum Creticum, Angelica,</hi> &amp;c. By these, and the like, as the <hi>Goastone, pulvis Pannonicus ruber,</hi> its supposed the Heart is much strengthned, and the Animal Spirits encreased, and propoked to throw out the <hi>materia febrilis</hi> by sweat; so that they do esteem Diaphoretics to be the only true and adequate Remedies, against all continual Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as the Physicians of the Southern parts do only acknowledge Bleedings.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:49498:50"/>5. We are to observe, that the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are continually employed, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a continual Fever to the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in subduing the <hi>Materia febrilis,</hi> which is commonly termed a Digestion, or Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; at the Declination they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the separation, and expulsion of the said febril matter, which in these colder Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates is more frequently by Sweat and Urin, and sometimes by Stool, Hemorrhage, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posthumations, or some few otherways.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If then the chief scope is to throw off and expel the febril matter by sweat, three things ought to be considered. 1. Whether Diaphor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tics ought to be used before the Declination of a Fever, at which time only they appear to be helpful in assisting Nature to throw off; for it must be own'd by all experienced Practicers, that the <hi>causa febrilis,</hi> be its vitious humours, heterogeneous parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or what other offensive matter they are please to allow, must be first subdued, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, and separated, before it can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by Sweat; and therefore should you exhibite the largest Doses of Diaphoretics, that Nature can possibly bear, and second them by loading the Patient with a number of Bed-cloaths, he will scarcely be brought to sweating; and if peradventure he should happen to be forced into a Sweat in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, augment, or state of the Fever, it must be to a very great detriment, by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Spirits from their necessary task, and squeezing the <hi>serum</hi> from the Humours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49498:50"/>
they are thickned and hardned, which ought rather to be diluted at those Seasons. Moreover by putting so great a force upon the Spirits, they must necessarily be much divided, dissipated and inflamed. Secondly, whether Sudorificks given in moderate Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so as to be insufficient to provoke Swear, do not assist the Spirits by increasing them, (I mean, such as contain some vinous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as Epidemic, as Treacle-water) and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into a gentle agitation, whereby the febril matter may be subued, or digested. <hi>Vox Medicorum</hi> doth proclaim they do, and therefore they are prescribed by them from the beginning to the ending of Fevers, in no greater measures, than what nature seems to require. For my own particular, I can scarce believe, that those Spirits are, or can be render'd homogeneous to the Animal Spirits (whatever they are when a Man is in health) being now under a great disorder, and disturbance; and as for the other subtil particles, that are supposed to be in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of the said Alexipharmacal-waters; how far they are conducing in subduing the febril matter, can best be prov'd by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, ten dying under the use of them, to one that recovers, whose Recovery may rather be attributed to the strength of Nature, a due <hi>regimen</hi> in his Diet, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him no hurt by improper Remedies. Thirdly, supposing fictitiously, that Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics were proper, the uncertainty of their Operation would often occasion a failure of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49498:51"/>
the effect that is expected from them. <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives</hi> and <hi>Vomitories</hi> seldom or never fail in their operations, if justly dosed: But <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorificks</hi> and <hi>Diureti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of Plague-water have been drunk for pleasure at one time by several that are in health, without the least sweat following up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: And as many diuretic Juleps have been swallowed by Nephritics, who have not made a drop of Urin the more after them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Wherefore I do much suspect, that there is scarce any Remedy used, that may be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed an Antifebril; though there are a great many that are in common use, and yet not commonly known, or acknowledged to he such, which, if well Dosed, and oft exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in proper Seasons, may evidently and sensibly be di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This seeming alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation doth oft incourage the Physician to a continuated use of Dormitives, throughout the whole course of the Fever, the benefit whereof is experienced, not only to consist in a longer delay of death, but also in a more certain consequence of it.

               <p n="1">1. THAT the Urin is saturated with <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> its distillation doth plainly confirm to us, and that the <hi>serum</hi> of the Blood where of the Urin doth consist must first contain the same, or else the latter could not receive it; for <hi>nihil dare potest quod non habet,</hi> and consequently that the whole Mass is thorowly replenish'd with it, doth also appear from the distillation of Human Blood, which yields a plain Spirit of <hi>Sal armoniac,</hi> little or nothing at all different from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49498:52"/>
So that the pretending that Slime-adhering to the Kidneys, or its inward membrane, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s baked into a Stone by a preternatural heat of the Kidneys, like unto Clay baked in a Kill into a brick by the extream heat of a fire, seems a Jest to me, since it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that any heat of that degree is ever felt by any nephritick Patient, or, if possible, could it be endured by him. Moreover their pale Complexions, pale Urin, sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, infrequent Urination, or making of Water, are all indications of Coldness; add hereunto, that Chrystal is generally found, and probably bred in the Snow; Rocks, Flints, and other Stones in the Bowels of the Earth, where no degree of Heat was ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. Wherefore what ever extraordinary or preternatural Heat may be felt by Nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks about their Loins or Kidneys, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly caus'd by Gravel, Stone, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obstructing matter, occasioning pain and consequently heat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In what part soever this Urinous Salt, or <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> is found, (through want of being separated and expelled by the Kidneys) be it in the Gutts, Urinary-Bladder, Gall-Bladder, Liver, Spleen, Brain, Stomach, Lungs, in the fleshly part of the Tongue, and of the Kidneys themselves, also about the Joints, though as remote as the extremities of the Fingers, there Stones may be, and have been engender'd, as is attested by a multitude of Authors. Some of these parts being allow'd by most Physicians to be of a cold Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49498:53"/>
as the Brain, Guts, Bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a second Argument, that plainly evinces, the Stone is not engender'd efficiently by Heat, though it may sometimes very considerably conduce to it. But to say, there is a <hi>Litho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poetic</hi> Faculty, or an innate calculous and fabulous constitution in the Kidneys, as is asserted by so great an Author, as <hi>Fernelius,</hi> seems to me very idle; as if he would infer, that none were subject to the Gravel and Stone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but such as deriv'd hereditarily a fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and calculous disposition of Kidneysfrom their Parents: What satisfaction there is in the Word <hi>Lithopoetic,</hi> I cannot well apprehend.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Before I recede from this subject, I ought to answer one Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is not always mucous Matter concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the generation of the Stone, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Stone, that is sometimes found in the Gall-Bladder of a Man, and very oft in that of an Ox, which consisting of Gall or choler, cannot be supposed to have any Slime, Phleam, or Mucus adjoin'd to it, being for the most part found simple unmixt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Nature of <hi>Mucus,</hi> or Phleam, which is always Glutinous or Viscous; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the whole, and make answer, that the Stone in the Gall-Bladder is oft formed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, through the separating or drying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of its thinner and moister parts; in like manner Mortar dryeth in some time into a Stony substance; as also doth <hi>Tartarum Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum,</hi> that's made by concretion, besides many others; on the other hand I must tell
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49498:53"/>
you, I am not the first, that hath observed the Gall in the Gall-Bladder very Viscous and roapy, through the admixture of some Slime or <hi>Mucus,</hi> that's separated with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from the Blood, and then it will be allowed to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very proper for the Formation of a Stone. In the same manner a Stone in the Kidneys may be formed by concretion, without the admixture of Mucous Matter, but then the Stone becomes friable, and not very hard, and of a more reddy colour, whereas according to the proportion of Mucous matter, concuring to the formation of the Stone, it becomes hard and pale.</p>
               <p>The Stone of the Kidneys is commonly observed to precede that in the Bladder; and any Stone, though of a very small dimension, falling from thence, through either of the Ureters into the Bladder, is conceiv'd to be the Foundation of one there, which by lying a considerable time, doth receive a daily growth from the Urinous Salt, and Slime, that descend thither. This in my opinion is not always necessary, it being possible enough for a Stone to grow in the Bladder, without having the Rudiments laid in the Kidneys; moreover it hath been observ'd, that at the same time one of the Kidneys, and the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, have each contain'd a Stone.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To the formation of the Stone, must be concurring. 1. Depauperated or Vitious ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, that are too weak to perform the separation and Expulsion of the abounding <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood in the Kidneys. 2.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49498:54"/>
certainly prove a great Advancement to the Art of Physick, and no less Benefit to misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Patients. However, as defective and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical only this Theory may be, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts me much more successfully in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick against the Stone, and other Diseases of the Kidneys, than the common Doctrine. I do own, that this and all the other prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Theoretick Notions might be render'd much plainer, by branching their Illustrations into so many particular Volumes; but my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Aversion to all manner of Prolixity, together with my weak Capacity of rendring them any more than scarcely probable, or other than meerly supposititious, doth entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discourage me from any such Attempt.</p>
               <p>The Practical Part of the Stone consists in these Particulars; 1. In the Means to prevent the Growing of it. 2. In the Cure of the Stone. 3. In the Removing a Fit, or Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xism of Pains, occasion'd by the Stone. 4. In the preventing the Return of a Paroxysm of the Stone, which may be term'd a Palliative Cure.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Those that live Sedentary Lives, and use little or no Exercise, as most Students; and Debauchees in sharp Wines, and very new, or stale Strong Beer, are very subject, and properly dispos'd to breed the Stone; but beyond all, those that eat much Salt with their Meat, or feed much upon Flesh or Fish Salted, Smoak'd, or Pickl'd. Wherefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing moderate Exercise between their Studies, and abstaining from their grave
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49498:55"/>
Thoughts, by intermixing Chearfulness and sober Mirth, to alleviate the Animal Spirits, which are the chief Agents of Health, and, being indispos'd, or vitiated, of Diseases. This is one Way to prevent the Stone in the former; And exchanging sharp Wines into milder, and diluted with a light thin Spring-Water, and using them with a <hi>quantum sufficit,</hi> and a total Abstinence from Stale Beer, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by Small Ale, will produce the like Effect in the latter. To drink Wine at Meals, as it lays a Foundation for the Stone, so using Small Drink in its stead prevents it: And in my Opinion, pure Wine ought not to be drunk, according to the Rules of Health, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chylification is finish'd, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution at hand, unto which it may be very assistent. A Fish-Diet moisten'd with too much sharp Wine, and a Bread and Cheese-Diet, seldom fail of administring sufficient Matter for the Stone. In short, Keeping the Stomach clean, in the manner as hath been before describ'd, is the chiefest Way and Means to prevent breeding the Stone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Cure of this Disease is commonly attempted by Bleeding in the Arm (though some judge it more advantageous in the Foot) in Bodies, that are moderately replete, to make room in the Vessels, which the subsequent Laxatives and Purgatives will necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, as working by Fermentation, that will occasion a Rarefaction of the Humours, and consequently a Distension of the Vessels, which otherwise might cause some Local Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance

But its observed of Juice of Limons, that if frequently used, its apt to cause a Thrush in the stomach, by its too sharp, or rather somewhat corroding quality, occasioning sometimes Vomiting, or a violent Looseness, for which reason the Juice of Citron is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, consisting of an acid not so acute, and yet not less diuretic. However, White-wine Vinegar distill'd is experienced to excel either of them in the diuretic Faculty, and many others, as being much more penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and consisting of Particles more subtil and Volatil. Though Vinegar is vulgarly reputed a potent restringent, yet it cannot deserve that denomination so much as Spirit of Salt, Nitre, Juice of Limons, or the acid of Tamarinds; and to speak the truth, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be term'd Adstringent, which is a quality that's binding, pursing, (draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together like a Purse) and contracting, proceeding from austere Particles, such as are perceived in Allom, Juice of Slows, and the like; but nothing resembling that, can be discover'd in Vinegar, no more than in Juice of Limons, or Spirit of Salt.

Another Author tells you, That by wearing a piece of this Stone about the Neck, next the Skin, a Person that was miserably troubl'd with the Stone, which though stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to all manner of Remedies, yet in a short time was so dissolv'd into Gravel, that was not only avoided at the Bladder, but by the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Eyes, through the Pores of the Skin by Sweat, and by Stool also.

three Fits of the Stone in a short time; but upon wearing Bracelets made of this Stone, she had been freed of them for ten Years together. The same Author reports further of a Noble-man, that was afflicted with the Stone; who, upon the wearing the Nephritick Stone about his Arm, was used to throw off such vast quantities of Gravel, that he was forc'd sometimes to leave it off, for fear the avoiding so much at a time might do him some Hurt.

Chymists set no less Value upon the Stone, that is taken out of a Man's Bladder or Kidneys, and is call'd by them <hi>Ludus Paracelsi</hi>; the Preparation whereof consists only in calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it with a vehement Fire into a Salt, and letting it turn into an <hi>Oleum per Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queum,</hi> by standing in a Cellar, or other damp place. Whatever Vertue may be suppos'd to be in the aforesaid Stone, is to be attributed to the <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> that is in it; which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not destroy'd by Calcination, may justly be doubted; and therefore, the Urine new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made by an healthful Young Man, using Wine, doth seem to be endu'd with a greater Diuretick and Stone-breaking Power: To which purpose, I have known several Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phriticks have chosen to take several Draughts of their own Urine (as having an Aversion to that made by others, who possibly may be diseas'd of some foul Distemper, or other) for many Days together, with good Success: For which Reason, Physicians do rather chuse to recommend Goats Urine, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with much more <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> than that of any other Animal; and herein they all agree, being thereto induced by the manifold successful Experiments upon Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phritick Patients, that it excels all other Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick and Stone-breaking Medicines. The aforesaid Urine must be saved, by tying a Bladder to the Goat. Others prefer the Blood of a Goat dry'd, as not only containing a great quantity of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> but its other Particles being dry'd, are harden'd into Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

In Conclusion, my Opinion touching the Virtues of those pre-numerated Stones is, That Flints being render'd brittle by Ignition, and Extinction in Water, or Small Beer, or Wine, wherein a good Lump of <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> hath been dissolv'd, and afterwards grinded into Powder, taken in large Doses, in a Draught of the same Liquor wherein it hath been quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may be endu'd with a far greater Power to drive down Urine, Slime and Gravel, and dissolve the Stone by a long continuated Use, than any of the most celebrated of them.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49498:67"/>
as a desperate Disease requires a desperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, some that have more Courage than Discretion, have adventur'd to give it in a Dose, from half a Fly, unto a whole one, powder'd, in a Draught of Clarify'd Whey, Emulsion of the four greater cold Seeds, or Skimm'd Milk once boil'd up, and grown to be luke-warm, with very ill Success; for considering, that the Patient's Strength is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a very low and deplorable State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is administer'd, if peradventure the venomous Medicine hath wrought through, so as to strain or squeeze out some Drops of Urine, which appears bloody also, it hath left such a painful burning Strangury, which, with the Addition of the Nephritick Pains, and Defect of Spirits, hath soon put an end to the miserable Sufferer; so that it had been better to let a Man die, than to kill him: But where that Medicine doth not pass, it doth infallibly torture the Patient out of his Life. However, if any be fond of the Use of them, they must either toast them, and half, or wholly calcine them into Ashes, which then will have entirely divested them of their Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick Faculty, no other Virtue remaining in them, than what is in the other Ashes; or calcine them by Corrosion, which is dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in Spirit of Salt, or Nitre, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their venomous Quality is much infring'd, and the Diuretick in a great measure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd. The Toasting is in holding them over an hot Fire in an Earthen Pan, and there stirring them, until they fall almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49498:67"/>
Powder, which doth greatly abate their Venom, together with some part of their Diuretick Power.

The Case being well consider'd, where Diureticks exhibited in large Doses, and frequent Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, do not answer the End, 'tis most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the true Cause of the Suppression of Urine is mistaken; and consequently give what you please of that kind, it will prove unsuccessful; for a very small Remedy, if it hits the Cause right, doth ever bring sudden Relief; and therefore in such Cases, we ought to use our greatest Industry, in enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what other Cause may in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cause such a Suppression, and not persist in an Opinion, the first Appearance of the Distemper hath put us in. <hi>Cantharides</hi> may be an useful Medicine externally apply'd, but a very suspicious one internally given. I do remember, I have several times made Trial of infusing two Drams of them in a Quart of <hi>French</hi> Brandy, and being filter'd through a Paper, have given thereof, from one Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to two, in Clarify'd Whey, or Ptisane, against inveterate virulent Gonorrhaea's, but I could never find I advanc'd much in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them.</p>
               <p>I have here got together a large Catalogue of <hi>Diuretics</hi> and <hi>Lithontriptics</hi> in Simples, yet it is not a compleat one; for upon a further search of Authors, it may be increas'd to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49498:68"/>
double the Number, so that as far as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, no less than the whole internal <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Medica,</hi> even the addition of Purgatives and Vomitives, (which seldom move Stools without provoking Urin) cannot be sufficient to make up a full and compleat List of Piss-drivers and Stone-grinders. The cause of increase of so great a Number of these, I can assign to no other, than to an incautelous Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit Physicians have given to all sorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that upon pretence of being troubl'd with this or that sort of suppression of Urin, Strangury, or other symptoms of the Stone, have declar'd a relief they received from this or that Remedie, though never so contrary, improbable, or preposterous (as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the aforesaid recital of Simples, and other Compositions thence fram'd), without examining the bottom, the possibility, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, and manner of acting of such like Remedies, in respect to the Indications, that ought to be taken from the Disease it self, the Causes thereof, the Symptoms, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the <hi>Actio laesa</hi> of the Kidnies, which cannot well be performed, without the true knowledge of the Function or Action of the Kidnies, and their <hi>Modus agendi,</hi> which (and indeed the Function of all the Bowels, and the <hi>Modus agendi</hi>) in my weak opinion is slubber'd over, or at least very insufficiently discoursed, so that its scarce possible to give any good Judgment of it. In order to that, I shall presume to set down some Positions, which (to speak modestly) you may please on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49498:68"/>
to take for Suppositions. 1. That the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent cause of a <hi>laesa mictio</hi> is very oft in the Kidnies, and consequently that the cause of a total or partial suppression of Urin, a Strangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> (which is an <hi>Aucta mictio) Ardor Urinae</hi> and other Symptoms are in the same part. 2. The Office or Function of the Kidneys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly the separation, and excretion of the <hi>superfluous serum,</hi> all, or most liquid or potable Matter, that's admitted into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more, than is necessary for the Blood to be supply'd with, doth naturally and by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination (if I may so speak) flow, and tend or is impell'd by the Spirits, or (if you like the Expression better) by the parts of the Body to the Kidnies, especially if in any wise preternaturally affected; the reason is, because the Spirits (I mean the Animal) chiefly flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to succour any part that is in distress, and they being the only and chief impulsors of all the Humors in the Body, it must follow, that all Potables, be they adstringent, gross, thick, thin, sharp, sweet, sowr, or indued with any other quality, must be impell'd to that part, whither the Spirits flow most<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which must be to the Kidneys, if preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally affected. Hence it is then, that Physick Authors observing all manner of Simples and Compounds being either potable of themselves, or given in any thing that is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, do provoke Urine in those, whose Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys are any wise preternaturally affected, have taken in so many hundreds of Simples and Compounds, to the almost innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p>As to the <hi>Modus Agendi</hi> of the Kidnies in their Function, I cannot imagin, that the <hi>Serum</hi> is separated from the Blood in their <hi>Parenchyma, colando</hi> (as it is commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by Physicians) by being strained thro' their narrow passages, as if it were by a Sieve; because the <hi>Serum</hi> is so throughly perfused and mix'd with the Blood, which in many bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Constitutions is as thin, if not thinner than the <hi>Serum</hi> it self, that consequently the Blood must pass with it, which would always occasion a bloody Urin. So that there must
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49498:69"/>
be another sort of separation, conceived by me, to be efficiently performed by the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, which you are not to apprehend to be singly floating in the Nerves, like Air in a Bladder, but that they are contain'd in a most subtil piercing <hi>Lympha,</hi> as may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the wound of any Nerve, which gives occasion to the said <hi>Lympha</hi> to drop out, and is then call'd a <hi>Gleet</hi> of a Nerve. This Spirituous <hi>Lympha,</hi> that's perfused through the Body of the Kidneys, doth by its most piercing subtil Particles, coagulate the more sulphurous and glutinous Particles from the abounding salin Armoniac, (that are dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the <hi>Serum)</hi> which by having some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy and contrariety against them, it doth, together with the <hi>Serum</hi> precipitate down the narrow Chanals of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Kidneys to the Ureters, whence by stimulation, and their own weight, they are moved to the Bladder. That the aforesaid Function is performed <hi>efficienter</hi> by the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirirs, is proved by several Instances of the same Import, <hi>viz.</hi> some may remember many Years past, I Publish'd a Treatise, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titl'd the Case of a <hi>Nobleman</hi> (then) <hi>lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,</hi> wherein was given an account of a puncture of a Nerve in the <hi>Plexus Nervorum,</hi> that's near the Groin, occasion'd by the wound of a Sword, that passed slaunt thwart the <hi>Abdomen</hi> down thither, upon which a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Gleet ensued, and soon after among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther direful Symptoms, a suppression of Urin. This those Physicians, as Learned and Famou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as they were, could impute to no other cause than the Stone; but they were deceiv'd by their Conjectures, as appear'd plainly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon the defection of the said Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Body after Decease; his Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder being found clear of all manner of obstructions, either by <hi>Mucus,</hi> Gravel, or Stone, though the Kidneys were exceedingly wasted, and shrunk into a much lesser Demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, than comonly is found in Men. Upon this fatal Mistake, and consequently wrong Indications, the foremention'd six Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians did very boldly prescribe the most powerful of <hi>Diuretics</hi> in very large Doses, and long continuated frequent Repetitions; until by chance, one of their Medicines having a power beyond their Expectation did give a check to the Gleet, that by derivation had deprived so great a proportion of nervous <hi>Lympha,</hi> (wherein the Animals do reside) from the Kidneys, as not to leave a sufficient quantity in them, to make separation of the salin Armoniac <hi>Serum</hi> for Urin, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought rather to be called a suppression of the <hi>Serum</hi> in the Kidneys, than suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Urin, and ought not to receive that Name, before its arrival into the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But what follow'd? The Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being return'd to their former Function, and meeting with a great quantity of <hi>Serum,</hi> (that had not been separated during the long interval of suppression) mix'd with the Blood, that was extreamly attenuated and fused by the preceding Diuretics, they separated and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49498:70"/>
excerned such a prosluvious torrent, as caus'd a most violent <hi>Diabetes,</hi> which by my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions was removed in a very little time. Further more you are to take notice, here was not only an abolition, or at least a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the separation of the <hi>Serum,</hi> or Urin, as it is improperly called, but an <hi>Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> or defect of nourishment in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, caused through want of the spirituous <hi>Lympha,</hi> or animal Spirits; so that as I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one of the former paragraphs, these are the efficients (<hi>causae efficientes,</hi> but in no wise <hi>materiales,</hi>) of nutrition, separation, and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the parts of the Body. Add to the former Instances several others of the Gleets. I have before and since observed, occasion'd by the cutting thro' of Nerves in a Wound, and punctures of Nerves in the Arm upon unskilful Bleedings, which though they did not effect so intire a suppression, as the puncture of a Nerve near the Kidnies, yet they have caused an evident diminution of Urin, and an <hi>Atrophia</hi> in that part, into which they were inserted.</p>
               <p>Several other suppressions of the <hi>Serum</hi> in the Kidnies I have now and then met with, that were mistaken for suppressions of Urin, occasion'd by the Stone, to the fatal ruin of the Patients, among which I have given an account of one very remarkable in a Treatise called, <hi>The Art of curing Diseases by Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> I shall here make a short discourse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Aetiology</hi> of the before-cited Disease, wherein the use I make of the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

set down touching the <hi>modus agendi</hi> of the Kidnies in the separation and excretion of the <hi>Serum,</hi> will plainly appear. The Patient there mentioned was of a healthful robust Constitution, and fleshy habit of body, much on Horseback, and scarce at any time long sedentary; his Appetite was much to salt Fish, Pork, Beef, Cheese, and other substantial Food. His Blood upon phlebotomy in the Arm appeared florid, thick and glutinous, with very little <hi>Serum.</hi> He felt constantly from the beginning of his Illness a weighty pain about his Loins, and pulsatory also; his Urin was pale, crude, dreggish and turbid, made at pretty long intervals, and in very small quantities, because the <hi>Serum</hi> was not, neither could it be separated in the Kidnies: For his Blood being engendred out of a thick glutinous Chyle, and this out of gross, gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Aliments, must necessarily be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though the Patient did drink great quantities of Liquor of one kind or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the greater part of the <hi>Serum</hi> it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, was thrown out by insensible perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and very oft by copious Sweats, whilst a small proportion would crowd into the Kidnies, and yield matter for that little Urin that was made. This glutinous, thick
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49498:71"/>
and fibrous Blood must be impelled through the Extremities of the emulgent Arteries with great difficulty, and very slow, and with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficulty and slowness into the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the emulgent Veins, whereby a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and distention must be occasioned, that caused the weighty obtuse and pulsative pain in the Loins, through the defect of a just and sufficient Circulation, which could not but raise great distentions in the hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, unequal pulsations, and other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, too many to be here discours'd of by retail. From no other Remedies, but such as obtain a power to remove that clammy, stringy Constitution of the Blood, could any benefit be expected; though on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, improper lithontriptic diureticks were advised, impelling the Blood more into the Kidneys, and cramming them, whence the pain increased, and the <hi>Serum</hi> was more damm'd up, until at last the Patient being inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously sent to the Bath, those hot acidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Waters inwardly taken, put a quick pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to the whole matter.</p>
               <p>Neither is it always a want of salin armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac <hi>Serum,</hi> or defect of its permixture with the Blood, that are the causes of a suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or abolition of the separation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in the Kidnies, is evident in an <hi>Asci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> or Dropsie, where there is salin <hi>Serum</hi> in abundance, and so thorowly mixt, that the Blood is but little thicker than Water, and so little glutinous, that the least drop will scarce stick to any thing; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

               <p>The five Opening Roots, Grass-Roots, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Seeds, with other Roots, Barks and Seeds like them, are suppos'd to contain a subtile hot Spirit, or subtile moving Particles, which by putting the Animal Spirits upon a quicker Motion, do by attenuating and rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Blood, separate the <hi>Serum</hi> from it, and consequently make Matter for the Urine,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49498:73"/>
which being driven down, acquires them the Name of Diureticks, that can no otherwise deserve the Title of Stone-grinders, than by ofent dripping by or upon Stones, may in Length of Time make little Holes into them, and render them brittle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Millepedes</hi> containing a subtil acidulous Spirit, are thought not only by precipitating the <hi>Serum</hi> to be very diuretic, but also by piercing into the Pores of the Stone, whose Figures seeming to be adapted for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of those acid pointed Particles of the Sows, become thereby Stone-breakers. But considering their preparation, they are not only thereby deprived of those few subtil acid Spirits, that fly away by the drying of them in an Oven, or otherwise, which is one way of preparation; or are wholly destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Substance and Virtue, by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of preparing them, which is, by washing them well in Rest-harrow-water, next soaking them throughly in <hi>Spanish</hi> Wine, which being poured off, they are to be put into an Earthen Pot or Pipkin, very closely cover'd and stop'd, and then to be dried in an Oven after the Bread is drawn, which if it be not done with a very mild heat, and several times repeated, they will be apt to be stewed, and never fit to be reduced into Powder; others do chuse after washing of them in White-wine, to dissolve them in Spirit of Vitriol, whereby not only the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vitriol is obtused and impaired, but the acidulous subtil Spirit of the Sows amortised.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49498:74"/>
This solution is pretended to dissolve the Stone in the quantity of five or six Drops, given in Persly-water, or such like Vehicle. In my Judgment <hi>Millepedes</hi> need no other preparation, than washing the dirt and slime off them with fair Water, after which they are to be but just broken, or very little brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in a Stone Mortar, and about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of two or three hundred put into a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trass or Bolt-head, and pouring three Pints of White-wine upon them; the Glass Vessel being closely stop'd, they are to stand 24 Hours, and the Wine is to be filter'd off, the Remainder is to be dried in an Oven in an open Pipkin, and then reduced to Powder; hereof from Two Scruples to Four may be taken in nine or ten spoonfuls of the impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wine. That this will prove diuretick to those, that are Nephritick, is oft observ'd, though I have known them taken, being bruised and steeped in Ale, for their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Drink, for a quarter of a Year together by those, that were troubled with running Eyes, dimness of Sight, Bloodshed, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations of the Eyes, Dropsies, Jaundice, Phthisick, and other Distempers, without any abatement of those Diseases, or causing more Urine than ordinary; so that People need not be so scrupulous in their Dose in any other Distemper, but that of the Kidneys, whither they, as all other Diuretics, are apt to carry all gross slimy Humours, they meet with in their passage. Many will put seven or eight of 'em in a Mortar, bruise them into a mash,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49498:74"/>
and pour a Glass of White-wine upon them, and drink it off without straining. Others hang four or five hundred of them in a Linnen Bag in a Firkin of Ale, and after a Fortnights Infusion, drink the Ale for their ordinary Drink.</p>
               <p>From a pretended Observation, that Goats Blood will break the hardest of Stones, which is a Diamond, most Physicians prefer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other Lythontriptics, advising it to be taken warm, as it comes out of the Veins: this requires some further preparation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Sentiments of Vulgar Authors, which is feeding a young Goat with Persly, Fennil, Carrot and Parsnip Tops, Cabbage Leaves, and the like supposed Diuretics, for three Weeks or a Month about the Spring; though others prefer the Autumn, near the Vintage, at which time a Goat is apt to feed much upon Grapes, if he can come at them, whereby they think his Blood is render'd the more diuretic, and cutting. Being then kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, they prefer the Blood, that comes out of his Veins, about the middle of his Bleeding, before that which flows out first or last. No Blood of any Animal doth sooner coagulate in the Air, and dry into a hard, brittle, and sandy substance. On the contrary, the Blood of a Stag only will not coagulate at all, but continues fluid. Now whether the Blood of a Goat being drunk warm, will not so coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in the stomach, as to occasion a great weight, pain, and indigestion there, whereas the Blood of a Stag consisting of more Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49498:75"/>
piercing Salts than any other whatsoever, cannot coagulate, by reason of the said copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Volatil Salts, which at the same time will render it the more diuretic, and piercing: so that two Drams or more of Stags Blood warm, as it comes out of his Veins, with four or five Ounces of Goats Urine, will make a more potent Medicine, than any of that kind. Many in a Fit of the Stone, and the Cholick thence caused, by drinking their own Urine (which is much worse than that of a healthful Young-Man) have suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved both to a wonder, and continuing the use of it Mornings and Evenings for several Days together, have render'd the Stone brittle; but this sort of Urinous Draught is attended with a great inconvenience of taking away the Appetite, and weakning Digestion. Beyond all doubt the Urin of a Fox is strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more piercing than any of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, as feeding chiefly upon Blood and Flesh, which abounds much more with Volatil Armoniac Salts, than most sorts of Herbs.</p>
               <p>As for Alcalious Salts, or such as are by Fire render'd lixivial, as the Ashes of several Animals, their Hair and Feathers, also Dungs, and several Chymical Salts of Vegetables and Minerals, operate by an abstersive stimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and shrinking or contracting the Vessels, whereby they propel the Humours, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate those that are acid: But all lixivials are experimentally found to abate the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and extremely disturb the digestion of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:49498:75"/>The red Cicers (which are no other than red Pease, and little different in substance and taste from Common Gray Pease) that are in so high esteem for moving Urine, perform it no otherwise than by a flatuous Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they distend the Bowels and Vessels, and rarefie the Humours contain'd in them, that are forc'd forward to gain more room; which is no more than what a Decoction of Tares, and most sorts of Vetches, Pease, Horse-Beans, and Cabbage can, and some of them do effect in a more powerful manner.</p>
               <p>It is to be further observ'd, that all Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, of what kind soever, must be used with the highest Caution in the Stone, Gravel, or any kind of Suppression of <hi>Serum,</hi> or Urine, lest by forcing and bringing down gross Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours with them, they cramb and choak up the Passages more than they were; for which Reason they are rarely prescrib'd singly, or in great Doses, and frequent Repetitions, in a Fit of the Stone, Gravel, or Suppression; but either mix'd with those Remedies, that have a Power by their Mucilaginous and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous or Balsamick Particles, to smooth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax, widen, and render the Passages slippery; as, Oil of Sweet Almonds and Linseeds; Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Marsh-Mallows, Pellitory of the Wall, Bear's-Breech, Violet-Leaves, Borrage and Bug-loss; or giving small Doses of the milder sort of them, and seldom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in a Fit, they chuse to consine themselves only to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilaginous and Emollient Medicines; also to Balsamicks, as Therebinthin, <hi>Lucatellus</hi>'s Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam,

               <p n="1">1. I must own, that among the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Diseases, nothing seems more abstruse, and inexplicable, than that Preter-natural Disposition of the Brain, that is attended with a Madness; either without a Fever, as a <hi>Mania</hi>; or with a Fever, as a <hi>Phrenitis</hi>; or any sort of <hi>Delirium,</hi> as a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrenitis</hi> with, or without a Fever, which doth affect the Brain only secondarily, and <hi>per Deuteropatheian,</hi> as the two former do pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, and <hi>per Protopatheian.</hi> In all these are <hi>Laesa</hi> the <hi>Imaginatio, Sensus Communis,</hi> and <hi>Memoria.</hi> The Manner or <hi>Modus</hi> of their Laesion cannot well be understood, without first apprehending the manner, how they are perform'd in their natural State, which is the great Difficulty, that neither all my Reading, nor the Meanness of my Capacity can remove. I am apt to conceive, there is properly called (without any Necessity of terming it Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous) a Sensitive Memory, Common Sense, and Imagination in all Animals, in some more, greater, or more exquisite, and of greater Power, than in others. A Dog seeing a piece of Meat held to him, at a greater distance than he can be suppos'd to smell it, the <hi>Ide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the said piece of Meat, or something like it, made upon his Sight or Smell, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Memory, or else would no more run at it, than to a Stone, or a Logg; the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he makes, that it is neither a Stone or Logg, or any thing else, but a piece of Meat, signifies he hath common Sense, and many Dogs though they are not hungry, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat it, they will run at a piece of Meat, or a Bone, carry it away into some retired place, and there bury it, whither they will repair, to dig it up and eat it upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of their Hunger, all which implies evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, they are endu'd with Memory, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense, and Imagination; which appears plainer, when a Dog hath been observ'd sometime to bark, walk about, return to the place he left, and do several other Actions as if he were awake, in his Sleep, caused by Impressions or <hi>Idea</hi>'s made in his wakeful time, that move his Animal Spirits when sleeping; the variety of which motion excited by those impressions, imply Imagination, Common Sense, and Memory, which is further confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Madness or <hi>Mania,</hi> Dogs, Hogs, and other Beasts, feeding upon Carrion and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Food, are subject unto, depraving their internal senses, so as to commit Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to all Creatures, they formerly were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with: And lastly their sensitive Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (so termed in distinction to those, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49498:77"/>
Acts of the Internal Senses. The Love of a Dog is easily perceiv'd by his Fawning, his Fear is discover'd by the holding a Stick at him, his Anger by biting, and his Hatred, which is a continuated Anger, by his Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing of Cats, Rabbits, Bears, Bulls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And among all Beasts, the exercise of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Senses, and Sensitive Passions is most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in an Elephant, as may be observed in the several wonderful Relations, very cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Authors do make of them. For a little digression the affinity of the Subject puts me upon this Query, Whether a Maniac or a Madman biting another Man, or a Dog, may not have the same Influence upon the Man, or Dog that's bit, in causing him to go Mad, and occasioning an <hi>Hydrophobia,</hi> as the biting of a Mad Dog has upon a Man, a Dog, or a Hog? Though it be probable, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous bite of either is reciprocal, yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard it confirm'd by experiment.</p>
               <p>Without ascending so high as the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Faculty, comprizing the Rational Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Common Sense, and Imagination, I shall for the present endeavour to satisfie my self in the <hi>Modus</hi> of these sensitive, or Animal Internal Senses, by the following Notion. I will suppose, that all external Sensation (of the external Senses) is performed by an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, or rather Pressure, made by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible external Object upon the Sensory or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan immediately, and mediately by that, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sensitive Nerve, be it Seeing, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or it may be conceived thus;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49498:78"/>
Sensation is the perception of any sensible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: All Perception is by Contact: All Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact is by corporeal Impression, and Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by local Motion. Here ariseth an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that its not likely, that a visible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at fifty or threescore Leagues distance, as the Peak of <hi>Tenariff,</hi> should reach so far, as by Contact, Impression, and local Motion, to affect the <hi>Tumica Cornea</hi> or Sight; or that the fixt Stars, Which are more remote beyond all Comparison, should reach the Eye, so as to make a corporeal contact upon it. The Answer contains no difficulty, if you will suppose that no obsect is visible by it self, but by light or <hi>Lumen,</hi> and that <hi>Lumen</hi> is a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Emission or Emanation of luminous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles from <hi>Lux</hi> (which in reference to the precited Instances is the Sun) and is extended as far above the Sun probably, as it is to us below it. The Interception of the said lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Particles by colour'd, figur'd and quantitative Bodies, and their being by them in the Interception modified and determined, do thence reach to our Eyes. And why should not Light be as diffusive, or dispersive a Body as Air, (filling so vast a Region as it doth) being much more subtil than it, as passing through every pore of it? Light hath quantity, <hi>viz.</hi> Longitude, Latitude, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity as much, and as properly, as Air, or any other Body. Being condensed by a thick Convex Glass, it hath Weight or Gravity, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> might be experimentally found, were the Glass artificially weighed) No less than Air
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49498:78"/>
condensed in a Retort by a Pump. Light ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refies the Air, which Darkness condenseth. The Light, and Colours, which are only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications of the Light, (for without Light, all things are dark, and of no Colour,) make a Pressure upon the External Tunick of the Eye, (consisting chiefly of the Filaments of the Optick Nerve, whence it is this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane or Tunick becomes the most sensible of any in the whole Body, scarce enduring the softest Touch of any external thing without an exquisite Pain,) which is very perceptible to those, that look against the Light of the Sun; this being continuated to the Optick Nerve, and thence to its Beginning, is what I understand by Sight.</p>
               <p>But here an Objection may be offer'd; <hi>Quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum Recipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> The Sensitive Nerves, as the Optick, Auditory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being all of one Composure, Constitution, or Temperament, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that actuate them, being all the same, must receive the Impression of Sensible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects all alike, and after the same manner; and consequently Light must be tasted, or a Sound must be seen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is false.</p>
               <p>To this I give in Answer, That all Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is by Contact, that is, by a real or mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Action, and not by immaterial <hi>Species,</hi> or Emission of Animal Spirits, which are vain Expressions. The said Contact i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49498:79"/>
are different as much, as the Figures upon a piece of Dow, (which is the same in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison throughout all its Parts,) made by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stamps; so that the Figures made by a visible Object upon the Pores of the Optick Nerves, and upon the Spirits included in them, are different from those that are made upon the Nerves of other Senses by other Sensibles. 2. That the Sensitive Nerves do differ each from the other in Softness, Bigness, Density, and other Qualifications. 3. That the immediate Sensation is not in the Nerves themselves, and the Animal Spirits contain'd in them, but in their invisible minutest Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, or subtilest <hi>Fibrillae</hi>; and therefore I assert, that the Sight is in the <hi>Tunica Cornea,</hi> the Hearing in the <hi>Tympanum</hi> or Drum, as much as the Sense of Feeling is in the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Cutis:</hi> For supposing that the <hi>Tunica Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> and indeed all the Tunicks of the Eye, are Expansions of Nerves, and composed of innumerable most minute Chanals, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will not here undertake the Task of an Oculist, in explaining the Concentration of the Optick Spirits about the Pupil, and the several Changes of Figures they undergo by Reflections in the Humours of the Eye, but pass ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r to the Hearing, the Seat whereof
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49498:79"/>
(as asserted before) I take to be in the Drum, and the Terminations of Fibres of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Nerve in it, upon which Pressure being made by the Air containing the Sound, and continu'd to the Beginning of the Auditory Nerve, is the Cause of Hearing. Wherefore I can in no manner be persuaded, that the Sound made upon the Drum, beating the Hammer <hi>(Malleus)</hi> against the <hi>Incus</hi> (Anvil,) and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Sound to the Internal Air contain'd in the long crooked Passage beyond it, is by the Means thereof carry'd to the Auditory Nerve; the Use of the said Internal Air being rather to keep the Drum stretch'd, (as a Bladder is kept distended by the Air that is blown into it,) and magnifie the Sound by the Hollow, containing nothing but Air, as you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in a Military Drum, the Hollowness whereof doth exceedingly magnifie the Sound that is made upon it by any sort of Percussion. That these little Bones placed in the Hollow of the Air, are so instrumental to Hearing, I cannot well understand, but do rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Use to be for a Stabiliment or Fulciment of the Hollow, and keeping the Drum, and the Circumvestient Membrane of the said Hollow distended. Hence it is, that the Drum of the Ear being by moist Weather, or damp Southerly and South-West Winds somewhat relax'd, the Hearing is dull'd, and not so sharp as it is in clear dry Weather, when the Wind gently blows Easterly, or North-East. Moreover, when the Drum hath been extreamly stretch'd by a near violen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:49498:80"/>
Noise, Thunder, or Great-Gun, so as it cannot return to its due Streightness, but must fall into a wrinkl'd Skin, the Hearing is either wholly lost, and destroy'd, as it hath happen'd to several having a thin dry weak Drum, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a near and extream sharp Sound; or is so obtused, that they can hear but very indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly. The like Accident may happen to the Sight, when any very Luminous Body makes too long and too near an Impression upon the <hi>Tunica Cornea,</hi> whereby being too much thinn'd, and distended, it doth cause a Blindness; to prevent which, Nature hath framed the said Horny Coat thicker and stronger, than any of the inferiour Tunicks of the Eye, the Use whereof (namely the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks) I take chiefly to contain the several Humours, which reflect or turn back the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Object, or Pressure made by it, to the <hi>Tunica Cornea,</hi> as the Quick-Silver on the back-side of the Looking Glass stops, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the Object to the Surface of the Glass.</p>
               <p>The most excellent of the External Senses is the Sight: Its Organ, that wonderful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine of the Eye, consists of a greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fine smooth polish'd Parts, than any of the other Senses, and is more in Use and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise than all of them together; for a Man that is awake is always seeing, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accounted awake, because we observe his Eyes are open; so that necessarily a far greater Proportion of Animal Spirits, and the finest and subtilest of them, is consum'd by Seeing, than by all the other Senses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49498:80"/>
whence it is, that Sleep being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated for the repair of the Animal Spirits, we always perceive the necessity of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching first in our Eyes, which makes People commonly say, they are so sleepy, they cannot keep their Eyes open; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do as commonly conclude a Man to be in sleep, because his Eyes continue shut. It is no wonder then, if blind Men can abstain longer from sleep than others, or that their other Senses are much more exquisite, than in those that can see; because that great flood of the finest Animal Spirits which the sight doth require, is distributed to the other external Sensories. Their internal Senses are also much stronger, in regard many blind Men have been observed to have stupendous Memories, and wonderful Phantasies: Thence it is likewise, that when a Man hath a desire to call any thing to mind, which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most forgotten, or to think very seriously up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Subject, he is apt either to shut his Eyes, or look down to the ground, whereby a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the optick Spirits are kept in the Brain, to assist the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, because so vast a supply of Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is requir'd, to be transmitted to the Eyes for Sight, Nature hath fram'd the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Nerves bigger, than any in all the Body, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49498:81"/>
that variety of Parts, which is greater than those, the Organs of Hearing, Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Tasting do consist of. I expressed, that commonly a Man seeth, or useth his Sense of Seeing, as long as he is awake, by reason of the constant readiness of visible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that will crowd in upon the Sight; he doth not in like manner always hear, or his Hearing is not always in exercise, though he can always hear, by reason there is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Sound or Noise in Being, to crowd in upon him. And though it is possible for a Man to consume or spend abundance of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits, by hearing a continual Noise from Morning to Night, so as thereby to make him sleepy, yet it seldom doth happen, because Nature can better endure the waste of Auditory Spirits, which are incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively grosser than the Optic, the loss and wasting whereof being much greater, and a greater abundance being required for the Sense of Seeing is the cause, why we all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways perceive the necessity of Sleep in our Eyes, before any of the other Senses, in which also the like necessity is perceptible, in regard, that when a Man grows sleepy, he doth not care to hear, or use any of his other Senses. And though by much stirring or local Motion, and other Labours, the wasting of the Animal Spirits in the Joints, doth occasion sleep, yet its always first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to the Limbs, and wasted by their continuated Exercise.</p>
               <p>Before I recede from this Subject, its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient I should explain, what I mean by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing all Membranes to be expansions of the extremities of Vessels, in order to make it appear, that the Seat of all the External Senses is in the Membranes, and not in the Nerves. That the <hi>cutis</hi> or ambient Skin of all Animals is a Membrane, cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when its look'd upon, after its dress'd by the Tanner of Fellmonger into Leather. That it consists of the Expansion of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of all the Vessels, as of Nerves, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, Veins, and Lymphaeducts, is evident by its exquisite Sence of Feeling, and by the least superficial hurt of a Scratch, causing small owsings of Blood, and by Sweat, the extremities of the Nerves importing feeling, as the extremities of the other Vessels lets out Blood and Sweat. By expansion, I do not understand a flat spreading out of the ends of the Vessels, as if it were Dow expanded by a Rowling-pin, but I do apprehend the said Vessels towards their terminations, to be divided into thousands of small Filaments, and glewed together in the <hi>Cutis,</hi> by a gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous substance, (engendred out of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, brought thither by the aforesaid Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels) that is not so stringy or sibrous, as to be call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Membrane of the Kidneys, and most of all the <hi>Tunica cornea,</hi> and next to that, the drum of the Ear, are of a much more exquisite Sense, than the Skin, as consisting of a far greater proportion of Nervous Expansions, and consequently too tender, and therefore not so proper to distinguish all sorts of Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or Impressions, as hard, soft, rough, smooth, hot, cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Impressions are thence continuated, by the nervous Filaments to the bodies of the Nerves, and at the same Instant to the beginning of them, and thence to the Common Sense, which doth distinguish these Touches or Tacts into specifications of hard, smooth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here by the way, it may be observ'd from the instance of some Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytics, who have lost the Sense of Feeling in some of their Joints or Members, though their mobility or motion remains intire, that for the most part those Nerves, that proceed from the Brain, bring the Sense of Feeling, and those from the <hi>Medulla Spinalis</hi> are causes of local Motion, which is an Argument, that the Spirits that flow immediately from the Brain, are much more subtil, than those that are derived from the Marrow of the Back-Bone.</p>
               <p>What I say here, is not to be understood so generally and absolutely, which made me only intimate, that for the most part, and not all, the Nerves immediately proceeding from the Brain, do only bring Sense; for some of them do also conveigh motion, but withal a motion so agil, nimb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>That the Sense of Feeling is more exquisite at the ends of the Fingers and Toes, proceeds from the greater concourse of fine capillar Nervous Terminations in those extreme parts.</p>
               <p>The spongie Membrane of the Tongue, which appears to be an expanded Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, out of the Filaments of the gustative Nerves, and of the Extremities of the Coats of Arteries, Veins, Salival and Lymphaeducts, is likewise found to be the Seat of the Taste, especially about the Tip, where there is a greater concourse of Nervous Filaments.</p>
               <p>In like manner, I do conceive the Drum of the Ear to be a thin subtil Membrane, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the Filaments of the Auditory Nerve, and the extremities of other Vessels, that are inserted into it. The sound that from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out makes its pressure upon the Drum, being enlarged by the hollow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The <hi>Tunica Cornea</hi> to be apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposed to receive the Pressure of visible Objects, must be kept up distended by the watery Humour (<hi>humor aqueus</hi>) under it, which if it be any thing lessened, either by evaporation in a hot Season, or by a Fever, so as to relax the said Tunic, the Sight im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately grows dim upon it; and if it wholly runs out by a Wound, so as the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic happens to fall in wrinkles, then the Sight is wholly lost. In old Men the Sight becomes dim, and so it doth oft upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Fever, by reason that by length of Time, or Age, and by Exiccation, the <hi>humor aqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

makes it seem thicker, and consequently not adapted to receive so vigorous an Impression.</p>
               <p>It may likewise be observed, and is now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally so received, that the Seat of Smelling is not in the Olfactory Nerves (I do not mean those that are commonly so call'd by the Antients, that had mammillar terminations, (<hi>Processus mammillares</hi>) which are now taken to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carriers off of some Excrements of the Brain) but in the internal Membrane of the the Nostrils, through which the Olfactory Nerves are expanded in Filaments.</p>
               <p>Since then it appears, that Nature having plac'd the Seat of all the other external Senses in external Membranes, as parts to which the external sensible Objects do first arrive, and make their first and most sensible Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; it is a perswasive Argument to me, that the Seat of the Sight is in the <hi>Tunica Cornea,</hi> or <hi>Sclerotica,</hi> being the most sensible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently chiefly consisting of Expansions of the Optic Nerve, whereas the <hi>Tunica Uvea</hi> or <hi>Choroeides,</hi> consists more of a contexture of Terminations of other Vessels. It will not be impertinent here to offer a few seeming Reasons out of a great many, that induce me to suppose the <hi>Cornea</hi> the Principal Seat of Vision, without excluding the necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of every Tunic and Humor of the Eye, a great Fault in any of them being as capable to occasion an abolition, diminution, or depravation of Sight, as the least conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Wheel in a Watch being disorder'd, may cause it to stand, move too slow, or too fast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:49498:84"/>I have before asserted, that all Sense is by immediate Contact of any corporeal sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Object. The Touch, Smelling, and Taste are by simple Contact, their Objects consisting of grosser Particles; but Seeing and Hearing are, as it were by a double Contact, that is, by reflection, because their Objects are more subtil, and without a due reflection, could not be perceived by the Eye or Ear; for by Reflection the sensible Object is much strengthned, and consequently obtains a greater force to move the Sensorie. The found made upon the uppermost Skin of a Drum, would not be so strong, or make such a sort of a found, were it not reflected by the undermost Skin. Wherefore Light, or any luminous Object, being a Body the most subtil of all others, must necessarily require a due Reflection, before it's powerful enough to move the Sight.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49498:85"/>
the external Senses, and the <hi>Modus sensationis.</hi> I do conceive then, that the Nerves do consist chiefly of congregated Filaments, drawn in to length, besides others that are lateral, and that the beginning of the Nerves are Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the medullar part of the Brain, (whereof its only supposed it doth consist) congregated and gathered together into one united body, which by being afterwards divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into so many lesser congregated Bodies, doth constitute each of the beginning of the said Nerves. Wherefore I do apprehend, that an impression made upon any of the sensories that consist of Nervous filaments, the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by continuation (in the manner former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention'd in the Instance of a Cord) is carried to the beginning of the Nerves, and thence to the united body of the Filaments of the <hi>Medulla cerebri,</hi> were one object is distinguish'd from another, which I term <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis sensatio,</hi> or <hi>sensus communis.</hi> I will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise suppose, that besides those prolonged Filaments, the Nerves are filled with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable lateral ones, of several figures, and minute dimensions, the various positions of which being actuated by Animal Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several representations, impressions and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that I do conceive Memory to be the <hi>basis,</hi> and antecedent to Imagination, as common Sense is of Memory, which I cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be other than various Acts of the <hi>Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noscitive,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:49498:85"/>
or <hi>Sensitive</hi> faculty. I do very well know, that applying the same Assertion to Rational Memory, and affirming that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is the <hi>basis,</hi> and antecedent Cause of Rational Imagination, admits of a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That very oft Persons of the weakest Memory have the strongest Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and the best Judgment, and that the Memory may be lost, though the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Judgment solely depending upon that, continue entire; which I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for as much of the Memory of things as is lost, so much of the Imagination must be lost; for supposing that you have intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgotten the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Horse, Cow, or Dog, you can never frame any Phansie or Imagination of them; so likewise if your Common Sense is so far abolished, that you cannot conceive or make a distinction of the impressions those Animals made upon the Filaments of your Brain, it is not possible for you to remember them. Probably then this Inference may be made, that the greater Memory a Man hath, the greater must be his Phansie, Knowledge, Wit and Judgment; which is otherwise observed, in regard that very oft the greatest Memories are not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the greatest Wit and Judgment. That they are attended with the greater Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is most certain; for a Man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members a great many Objects, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, must know so many more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who doth not remember so many; though for what concerns his Phansie, Wit
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49498:86"/>
and Judgment, they may be quicker, or nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, and more agreeable to right Reason in one of a weaker Memory, but no farther, and of no more Subjects than the number he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members.</p>
               <p>It may be abjected against what I asserted before, that Common Sense, Memory and Imagination, are only three several Acts of one Faculty; that Mad-men oft retaining their Common Sense and Memory intire, and having only their Imagination deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is an evidence they must be three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Faculties, whereof one being deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth perform depraved Acts, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are intire, do perform Acts as they they ought; wherefore since a found Act, and one that's depraved, cannot proceed at the same time from one and the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, it sollows, they must be three distinct Faculties. I do Answer to this, that the Common Sense and Memory in a Mad-man are depraved, to the same proportion his Imagination is depraved; for to him a Horse may appear to be a Cow, or he may and doth remember things to be otherwise than they were first represented to him. The fame Animal Spirits, the fame Nerves, and medullar filaments of the Brain, do all act in the exercise of the internal Senses: And that perceiving of sensible Objects (which is the act of Common Sense) the retaining them, (being the Act of Memory) and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them variously together (which is the Act of Phansie) should be other than
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49498:86"/>
Acts of the same Sensitive or Cognoscitive Faculty in Beasts, or of the Rational Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Men, I can in no wise apprehend.</p>
               <p>In regard the Memory of Beasts) though some of them have a Brain of greater dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions than a Man) is so little capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining many sensible Impressions, which are certainly material; and whereas a Man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of retaining of innumerable and infinite impressions of Words, Languages, and all things sensible and intelligible, it cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but that the Rational Faculty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Soul must be immaterial; for should you suppose, as commonly its taught, that the Memory is only an Impression made upon, and retained either by the soft sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Brain, or upon its Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits gathered into a soft Cloud; were the Brain of as large an extent as a Church, and could harbour as many Spirits, that nor these could be capacious enough to retain a tenth part of things, which a Man is capable of remembring. So that I say, the Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty must be immaterial, that is, cannot be performed by a material Organ, as the Brain, and its material Animal Spirits; and therefore its impossible for any Man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the manner of operation of the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Faculty, as long as the Soul continues confin'd and immerged in a material or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal substance: And were the Soul of Man material, as some do believe for want of true Reason, it could be capable of discerning and remembring no more Objects, than the Soul
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49498:87"/>
of a Beast, the Brain of some Beasts being as organically and aptly framed, as the Brain of a Man, and in some the Animal Spirits much more sine and subtil.</p>
               <p>From this Discourse I do infer, that the Cognoscitive internal Senses, (which are subservient to the Rational Faculty, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending a Rational or intellective Common Sense, Memory, and Imagination) in a <hi>Mania</hi> are only affected; for the Intellective being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, can in no wise be subject to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by any thing that is material; neither could any material Remedy have a power to act upon an immaterial Disease of a Man, as Madness must be termed, were the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive part touched, more than upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Madness of a Devil.</p>
               <p>This premis'd, I am of opinion, that the Animal Spirits in the Brain being irregularly and violently mov'd, is the cause of a <hi>Mania,</hi> by putting those sensible Impressions, that are made upon the lateral minute Filaments of the Brain, into a disorder, and changing their Positions, which occasions the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If a Madman, after he hath continued in a long raving Fury, falls into a long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Silence, hardly to be provoked out of it, that must be adscribed to the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and wast of Animal Spirits, by his long fit of Fury, which he is forced to repair, by giving the remainder of his Spirits time to breed more.</p>
               <p>His reciprocal seasons of Madness, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd with intervals of Rational Discourse, in some for a longer time, in others shorter, may be attributed to the variety of motion

I mean the aqueous, vitreous, and crystalline, whose Office I did only suppose is, to support and keep the Tunics justly distend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by Reflection, to return the visible Impression to the <hi>Horny-coat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do only pretend here to take notice of some defects of the <hi>Horny-coat,</hi> the <hi>Humor aqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The forementioned Tunic being of too thin a texture (from the tenuity of the Nervous Expansion) and the extreme subtility of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spirits, and the tenuity of the Aqueous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour making too little resistance to the lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Particles, coming from a great distance; the said luminous Particles being too much thinned, and lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This laxity of the said Tunic and Humour is two fold; one natural, and the other adventitious, by reason of some Disease, as a Fever, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49498:90"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The former is in no ways to be medled with. The latter either ceaseth upon the removal of the Disease, that caused it, or if it should continue, may be remedied by washing the Eyes daily with water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a very little Salt-Petre, or rather Sal Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellae hath been dissolv'd; or you may two or three times in a Day drop into the Eye, a drop or two of this Solution, <hi>viz.</hi> two Grains of white Vitriol dissolv'd in two Ounces of some clear Well-water; wherefore you are to take notice, that most common Eye-waters, that are cried up for Sovereign Remedies against all, or most Diseases of the Eyes, are strictly to be avoided in all short Sights, whereby they would be rendred much worse. Such sort of Waters are usually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled from Fennil, Celandine, Eye-bright, Rue, Vervain, Male pimpernel, Hogs-Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Besides, in short Sights the disten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Horny Tunic</hi> is too weak and slack, by reason of the loose texture, and thinness of the said Tunic and Aqueous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, upon which the seeble and almost spent Rays, that arrive from a great distance, can scarce act or exercise such an Impression or Motion, as is necessary for Sight. On the other hand, where the said Tunic is of a good Texture, and fully distended, Objects are perceptible from a much remoter distance: But where the forementioned Tunic is grown too thick, and consequently less diaphanous, and less porous, that Sight is neither good at a distance, nor near, as its oft observ'd in old
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49498:90"/>
Folks. Moreover, in those the <hi>Humor Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> is very much thickned, so as to deny a full and free passage to the luminous Beams; the said Humour is also become less turgid, and of small compass, whereby the <hi>Horny Tunic</hi> becomes less distended, and a little flatted, so that the visible Object must necessarily act very feeble upon it, the Rays not being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently congregated, through its defect in convexity. Add hereunto, that in them the Optic Spirits are grown few, gross, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, which renders the perception of the Object dim, and cloudy.</p>
               <p>To preserve the Eye-sight, is to retard, and hinder it from becoming such, as it is in old People; that is, 1. By rendering the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits light, subtil, clear, and more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious. 2. By attenuating the <hi>Horny Tunic,</hi> and the watery Humour. 3. By avoiding straining of the Sight, by exercising it long and often upon very small, shining, disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, or very distant and remote Objects.</p>
               <p>The first of these means consists in keeping the Body clean of gross Excrements, which gave so frequent occasion to the Antient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, to invent Pills peculiarly appropriated to the Sight, and distinguish'd with Names referring to it; As <hi>Pil. Lucis majores</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores</hi>; and others, as <hi>Pil. Aureae, sine quibus, Cochiae majores</hi> and <hi>minores, &amp;c.</hi> I cannot think, any of these Compositions hath any more regard to the Eyes, than to the Toes; but because in the mass of <hi>Pil.

               <p>What I mean by keeping the Body clean, is to take now and then those Pills, which are rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And yet being outwardly applied, is very excelling in thinning the Coats of the Eyes, and watery Humours, and very discu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in clearing the Sight from dimness or cloudiness.

               <p>Those forementioned Aromatics, Seeds and Roots, are discutients of Wind by their subtil Particles, which they perform by atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating of gross Humours into Bubbles, which breaking, emit those Winds, or crude mix'd Aery Spirits, that afterwards are sometimes avoided upwards or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or are impell'd into the Vessels; these mounting upwards, do for a time much disturb the Sight, until they are either dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed by the Spirits, that are in the Eyes, and assisted therein by a further continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the use of the said attenuating A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatics, and Seeds. Hence it is, that very oft those attenuating Oxydercics do render the Sight much worse, and sometimes in Phlegmatic Constitutions usher in Blindness at first, though othertimes also the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49498:93"/>
of them may discuss the Winds they first rais'd; wherefore a great deal of Caution ought to be used in the Application of them: So that it appears plainly, that the same Oxyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rcics may remedy the Sight, and keep off Blindness in some; though in others they most certainly cause Dimness of Sight, and Blindness.</p>
               <p>Diureticks, by carrying off the Salts of the Blood by Urine, (they by drying up the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Humour, and corrugating or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densing the <hi>Horny Coat,</hi> thicken and lessen the former, and harden the latter in Old People, whose Eyes therefore do appear thick, dull, flat, slow in Motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) have been experimentally found very advantageous, not only in preserving and meliorating of the Sight, but in preventing and removing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diseases incident to the Eyes. Among those <hi>Millepedes</hi> or Sowes moderately used ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Ale, or otherwise, are universally, and by common Experience, preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all others; for being copiously furnish'd with very subtile penetrating light Spirits, they do not only carry off Salts by Urine, but attenuate and discuss what is gross in the Watery Humour, and all the Tunicks, and subtilize the Animal Spirits; which Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities seem to render them specifick to the Eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Some do use <hi>Ground-Ivy</hi> in their ordinary Drink, to preserve their Sight, to no great purpose: But in <hi>Valerian</hi> and <hi>Vervain</hi> (a quantity of one or both being added to the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49498:93"/>
Wort before, or while it is working) many do affirm to have experienc'd a great Power, in preserving their Sight, and removing Dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. To mend the Taste of such sort of Ale, a moderate Proportion of <hi>Elicampane-Root, Orange-Peel,</hi> or a few <hi>Daucus-Seeds</hi> might be added. <hi>Bean-Stalk</hi> Ashes, to the quantity of five or six Ounces, if they are clean, put to a Firkin of Small Ale after the working, jumbling them well together, and allowing them four or five Days to settle to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, did they not blunt the Taste of the Drink so much, would prove more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than any of those Vegetables.</p>
               <p>As for the Externals, I should be loth to advise any Person to Compounded Eye-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to preserve his Sight: The Washing the Eyes daily with clear Spring or Rain-Water is sufficient. Water that hath stood long in a Leaden Cistern, is accounted hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, there rising a very sharp offensive Steem in Length of Time from the Lead, that mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the Water.</p>
               <p>Those whose Eyes are weak from thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Birth, ought to avoid tampering with any sort of <hi>Oxydercicks,</hi> Internal, or External, their Weakness of Sight depending much upon a natural Laxity of the Optick Nerves, and Tunicks; their Humours of the Eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also thin, and their Optick Spirits loose, and not compact; all which may be easily render'd worse by uncertain Remedies, and never or seldom better, though their Growth in Age, Change of Climate, or Diet, may
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49498:94"/>
considerably contribute towards the Meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Sight. A Weakness of the Eyes, that Sickness might have left, doth oft go off with the Weakness of other Parts, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Strength of the Brain and Bowels. But if that Weakness should singly remain, then besides due Evacuations, general and particular, Recourse may be had to proper Internal and External <hi>Oxydercicks,</hi> which ought to be chosen with the strictest Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Among Diseases of the Eyes, I do account a <hi>Suffusion, Cataract,</hi> and <hi>Gutta Serena</hi> the most dangerous; and an <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, the most painful, and oft an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Cause of the others.</p>
               <p>A Suffusion, or <hi>Hypochyma,</hi> seems to me to proceed either from some subtile Winds, or Windy Spirits, sallying out of the Arteries, or Pores of the Nerves, and breaking into the Watery Humour of the Eye, there caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very minute Bubbles of various Figures, which being actuated or moved by the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Rays, (for when a Man's Eyes are shut, whereby the said Luminous Rays are excluded, he is not in the least sensible of them,) do produce those Appearances of little Bouls, Flies, and other small Shapes, floating or flying to and fro before the Eyes.</p>
               <p>There are commonly observ'd two kinds of those Suffusions: The one arising from Crudities of the Stomach, or Flatuous Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriack Humours of the Bowels, is not
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49498:94"/>
durable, though oft returning by Intervals. Those little Figures, that do deceitfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon the Sight, moving much quicker, than in the other kind, and meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, join into a Cloudiness, that quickly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes, by reason that those Windy Spirits, which issue through the Pores of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, being of a Vaporous or Watery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure, are much lighter, move nimbler, and are much easier discussed, than those Windy Spirits, that are pressed out of the Pores of the Nerves, which being of a more faline, tough, heavy, and compact Mixture, consequently durable, and constantly abiding, (because not easily discussed,) make Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of larger Figures, and are moved much more slowly; and consisting of clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or viscous most minute Particles, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to unite; whence it happens, that their Representations are disposed to grow daily bigger and bigger. These Viscous Windy Spirits are subject to be precipitated, or impelled to the Pupil, or <hi>Foramen Uveae,</hi> by the constant passing of the Luminous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in Beams or Rays towards the said <hi>Foramen Uveae,</hi> where they are concentra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or gather'd together in the Figure of a Cone, the said <hi>Foramen</hi> forming the narrow End of the Cone, as the <hi>Cornea Tunica</hi> doth the broad.

I cannot but wonder, whence those gross thick Humours should be sent, or how convey'd; not from the Medullar part of the Brain, where Arteries or Veins are scarcely discoverable, and whose very Compact Substance is no more susceptible of of any thing that is gross, than the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Optick Nerves: Besides, such sort of slimy gross Humours might easily, in the beginning of a <hi>Gutta Serena</hi> be melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down, and carry'd off by the common Head-Purgers, which are generally very strong and churlish; as <hi>Pil.

               <p>It is more apparent to me, that the most frequent cause of a <hi>Gutta serena</hi> is the nervous <hi>Lympha,</hi> (which is the Vehicle, or rather is the <hi>Materia</hi> constituting the grosser Particles, which united with the subtiler and most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Particles, separated out of the best and finest parts of the Arterial Blood, do compose the Animal Spirits) being grown too gross, thick and viscous in the Optick Nerves, stagnate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there, and makes a Damm, thereby hinders<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49498:95"/>
and putting a stop to the influx of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits, from the Brain to the Eye, which ought not to be termed Optick Spirits before they arrive thither. By this supposition, a <hi>Gutta serena</hi> seems to be a Palsie <hi>(Paralysis)</hi> of the Optic Nerve; all other Palsies, whether universal or particular, being engender'd by no other cause, than by the stagnation of the Nervous <hi>Lympha,</hi> (being render'd gross and viscous) in the beginning of the Nerves in the former, and in particular Nerves in the latter.
