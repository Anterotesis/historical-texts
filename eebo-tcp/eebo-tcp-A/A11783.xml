            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And ſurely they haue ſeene a faire effect of this their policie; For from this ſilence of the Scripture, proceeds that vniuerſall Peace amongſt them, whereof they ſo much boaſt, and whereupon others ſo reſolutely build. In the beginning and infancie of the world, the Serpent, <note place="margin">Ier. 8. 11 12.</note> by Satans procurement, found a meanes to betray our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, by teaching them to ſeeke a prohibited and curious knowledge, ſaying, <hi>Ye shall not dye, for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eies shall be opened,</hi>

nor takes them off from their Canonicall howres deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Poeticall fictions; which Legendarie ſtuffe is the Diuinitie, whereupon at this day the Faith of the Cloiſter Catechiſt, is principally founded.</p>
            <p>But the word of our Sauiour, though it be the Goſpel of peace, is yet a <hi>Fire</hi> that inflames, a Sword that deuides. It aimes at another peace then worldlings and fleshlings dreame of; they caſt their eyes vpon peace with men, this teacheth a peace with God; they ſeeke temporall peace, though therein they ſinne againſt God and their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and doe obſtinately purſue and often obtaine it, though it laſts no longer then vntill the ſtronger hath gotten aduantage by it, for whoſe purpoſe and benefit it was onely concluded; this other aimes to reconcile God and man togither, and to breed peace of conſcience, the earneſt and initiation of an eternall peace hereafter.</p>

For that, though it be poſſible to nature, is impoſſible to grace; thou canſt not reconcile Light and Darkeneſſe, Hell and Heauen, God and Mammon, Chriſt and Antichriſt; nor canſt thou by humane policie bring theſe togither, by cauſing both ſides to abate, and meet in the midſt, through thy wiſedome.</p>
            <p>There is a worldly peace which men vnhappely hunt after, whilſt they neglect the peace of conſcience and ioy in the Holy Ghoſt; which peace and ioy the Saints of God, whoſe hearts are inflamed with that Fire which Chriſt brought into the world, feele euen in the midſt of <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 27.</note> tumults, warres, pouertie, perſecution, tortures, fire, death.</p>

            <p>In the eight and fiftieth Verſe, our Sauiour giues vs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to ſeeke reconcilement with God <hi>betimes,</hi> whilſt we are <hi>in the way,</hi> whilſt it is <hi>called to day,</hi> before we be arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and haled violently by death before the Iudge; for then there is no remedie.</p>
            <p>We ſeeke after worldly peace and clap hands with <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and his confederates, to procure ſpirituall trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Kingdome, and temporall trading in theirs; but we neglect God and Chriſt, and make them our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; nor haue we any care to be reconciled to them, and to make peace with them, though we know they haue powre to kill both Bodie and Soule alſo. Herein we doe foolishly.</p>
            <p>Whilſt our Sauiour was thus teaching his Diſciples and the multitude, there were preſent certaine perſons who told him of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> whoſe blood <hi>Pilate</hi> had mingled with their Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>And this they did perhaps as ſuppoſing the Hiſtorie pertinent for that point of Doctrine which our Sauiour taught; that is, <hi>To perſwade vs to make our peace with our aduerſarie betimes in the way; becauſe no man is ſure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the time, place, or manner of his death, death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to man ſo many wayes:</hi> and therefore it were good to be reconciled and prepared leſt we be brought before the Iudge ſodainly, by force or accident, whilſt we expect to haue faire warning giuen vs long before, by age, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and ſickneſſe.</p>

            <p>To make this more cleere, <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> the great Doctour of the Law, brings in the example of this <hi>Iudas</hi> in his ſpeech before the Councell, and there mentioneth his cauſe, courſe, and end, briefly, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 37.</p>
            <p>This newes being thus tould our Sauiour by ſuch, as it ſeemes thought him vnprouided of examples to ſecond and backe his arguments, and ſuppoſing it ſuited the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe verie well, to perſwade men to reconcilement in the way, leſt they should be ſuddainly cut off, as theſe <hi>Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were, our Sauiour takes occaſion from hence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the point, and to inforce it farther, euen vpon the conſciences of ſuch as produced it, ſaying, <hi>Suppoſe ye that thoſe Galileans were ſinners aboue all the Galileans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell ye, nay; but except</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:20736:7"/>
               <hi>ye repent, ye shall all likewiſe perish.</hi> Thus our Sauiour makes application of this Storie, to all his Auditorie, and cauſeth it to reflect vpon the conſciences of the reporters, as well as vpon all the reſt of his hearers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Galileans</hi> were not hereby wholly excuſed <hi>a toto</hi> (as the Schoolemen ſay) but <hi>a tanto,</hi> and <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> after a ſort; nor was their act of ſacrificing (whereſoeuer, whiſoeuer, or howſoeuer done) iuſtified hereby; but our Sauiour condemnes the rash iudgement of ſuch, as make our ſufferings from men, infallible markes of our ſinnes before God. Wicked men may proſper in euill courſes, good men may fall and ſuffer in holy vndertakings. The <hi>Galileans</hi> might be ſinners in ſeeking diſorderly to free themſelues from the <hi>Romane</hi> ſeruitude &amp; <hi>Imperiall</hi> taxe; and the Emperour, with <hi>Pilate</hi> his Officer, might be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinners in laying this taxe vpon the people without their conſents (for <hi>volenti non fit iniuria)</hi> and ſo forcing them to wraſtle for their liberties; yea, and all the other <hi>Galileans</hi> might be ſinners doubtleſſe, aboue thoſe that ſuffered, whilſt they ſought and deſired the ſame libertie, though they had not hearts to vſe the ſame meanes. So if conſent be a crime, where will is preſent, wanting onely courage to attempt, or powre to accomplish what others aduenture, then the whole Nation were as faultie as theſe few, though theſe did only ſuffer in their perſons, becauſe they did only enter into open action, which by the vulgar is euer cenſured good or badde according to the ſucceſſe; and though before followed, applauded, and effected ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo eagerly, yet it is preſently diſclaimed &amp; condemned as ſoone as it is oppoſed by power, or croſſed and defeated by policie. Thus theſe fondlings could cenſure the <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> to be Rebles, Traytors, and Sinners aboue others,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20736:8"/>
and ſo to ſuffer worthely for endeauouring to doe that which all of them deſired to be done: but they could not ſee their owne notorious rebellions and treaſons againſt God, who had beene a gratious King and Ruler ouer them, from whoſe eaſie and equal yoke notwithſtanding, they and their ſtiffe neckt Fathers shranke and withdrew the shoulder.</p>
            <p>The ſinnes againſt man, man cenſures ſeuerely, the ſinnes againſt God we paſſe ouer ſlightly. The iudgement of <hi>Caeſar</hi> or of his Subſtitute <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> who haue power only to kill the bodie, we tremble at, and count ſo terrible, as it frights vs euen from good duties, or frights all men from acknowledging vs, if we fall into their hands, and be branded as capitall offendors, vnder their tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cenſures, though it be for performing good duties: but the iudgements of God, who hath power to kill ſoule and bodie, we extenuate, hide, and peruert with our idle Gloſſes, Apologies, and Applycations, though we know they be euer Iuſt, Serious, Obſerueable, Sacred, and neuer inflicted but for notorious euill.</p>
            <p>But how fond and foolish doe men shew themſelues herein? For <hi>Caeſar</hi> owes more to God, then any man to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and yet <hi>Caeſar</hi> that exacts more for himſelfe then his due, denies or neglects to pay God that which belongs to him; yea, all men are more carefull to pay <hi>Caeſar</hi> more then they ought, then God what they ought, and for this will robbe God, to inrich <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Shall they for this be counted wiſe, religious, obedient, faithfull? And Fooles, Factious perſons, Rebels, Traytors for the contrarie? <hi>Caeſar</hi> can kill thee, <hi>Caeſar</hi> cannot ſaue thee; die thou muſt when God determines. If <hi>Caeſar</hi> therefore will neither pay God his due, nor permit thee to doe it, thou maiſt

            <p>Beſides, if thou offendeſt <hi>Pilate,</hi> there is no meanes to eſcape, he mingleth thy blood with thy ſacrifice; the Hornes of the Altar are not priuiledged; no place, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is exempted from the force of his fury; no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, no reſtitution can ſerue the turne to redeeme a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent from his rage. O Prophane and cruell heart of man! how ſeuere art thou againſt man like thy ſelfe? I ſay, like thy ſelfe, if thou beeſt Gods Image &amp; not Satans; and if thou beeſt Satans Image, then much thy better, like thy Maſter, like thy Maker? Thus if man offend man, there is no mercy: but if man offend God, he may repent and be ſaued. There is indeed no other remedie but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; but that remedie is left vs in the greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. <hi>Except ye repent ye shall all likewiſe perish.

They know our tenets, our practiſe, our natures; It is the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Milke onely which makes all that taſt of thoſe Adulterate Teates to be vnnaturall Wolues, Fratricides, and Parricides. The Powder-Treaſon was tryall enough of this truth, where <hi>Digby, Grant,</hi> and the <hi>Winters,</hi> with others not of the worſt natures; and <hi>Rookewood,</hi> who appeared to be of himſelfe a man of tender and good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, apprehenſiue of other mens ſufferings, &amp; inwardly touched with naturall hate of the euill entended, yet all theſe were ſo hardned by their ſubtile and ſatanicall Guides, vnder colour of the <hi>Romane</hi> Catholique good, and the merrit of the worke, as they shut the eyes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt Grace, and obſtinatly, and deſperatly reſolued
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20736:12"/>
to purſue the bloodie plot to the vttermoſt, though the innocent ſuffered with ſuch as they iudged nocent, yea-though that blow had giuen an end to the honour of our Nation. Whereas vpon the contrarie part, our clemencie and Chriſtian charitie therein appeared, who fell not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in furie and rage to root them vp, when the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion would haue giuen countenance to ſuch a reueng, nor importuned our Superiours to extend the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwerable to the crime, but wept to conſider the ſcandall of our Countrimen, and thought it enough, that ſome few of the chiefe Malefactors ſuffered a death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ordinarily for Traytours, without the exact in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of any new torture proportionable and ſuitable to the merrit of their cauſe; when I am fully perſwaded, had it beene poſſible, the Diuell could haue made our Religion guiltie of ſuch a villanous attempt, in any place where they had beene Maſters, as we were here, it would haue coſt vs a generall Maſſacre, and all Nations would haue riſen vp againſt vs, and expeld vs their Dominions, as perſons vnworthy to liue in the World, or to breath the common Ayre with bruit Beaſts, much leſſe with Chriſtians. For neuer could Hellish villanie before cauſe the Name of Chriſt be ſo blaſted and blaſphemed as it might be now through the euill occaſion of theſe <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians.</hi> Neuer could that be thought the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which dig'd ſo deepe for a falſe foundation, and tooke ſo much helpe from Hell to aduance it.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, it may be feared through our remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not ſearching the feſtered ſore to the bottome, or through our too tender pittie (for they will not call it mercie, and Chriſtian charitie, though <hi>Rookewood</hi> alone had the grace to acknowledge, that as their Act was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20736:12"/>
without example, ſo his Maieſties mercie in proceeding againſt them, the Actors onely, was without preſident) ſome of this Spirituall generation, may (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid of <hi>Cateline)</hi> creepe into the Senate Houſe againe, the place they would haue blowne vp, to fire the Commonwealth by Faction, whom their former traines of groſſer Treaſon could not blow vp. For if the Lord in iuſtice should ſo deale with vs, and permit this to be done, we had no more to ſay for our ſelues, then the <hi>Iſralites</hi> to the Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 42. Eſpecially when men thus affected for point of Faith (I ſpeake not of their honours) are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into this high place of Councell, which by Iuſtice might be that againſt them, as long as they continue of that Religion, as the Sanctuarie was againſt the <hi>Moabites,</hi> though Conuerts, for ten generations, and againſt the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> vnto the third generation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 3. It is dangerous hauing ſuch blood in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the State, though in the extremeſt parts, but to haue it in the heart and boſome, nay, about the head, to heare, and ſee all, and to haue a hand in the higheſt and moſt ſeacret Councell, and in compounding the fundamentall Actes of State, is ſo dangerous in my poore iudgement, as it makes me ſay in this reſpect alſo, <hi>If we doe not repent, we are like all likewiſe to periſp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What all perish with Maſſacres, as the <hi>Galileans</hi> did? Yes vndoubtedly, except we thinke the young Wolues not ſo cruell and bloodie as their Syres, or that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vs leſſe Sinners, and leſſe Heretikes, then they thought the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent neighbours in <hi>France, Bohemia,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate, Haſsia,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and through the Chriſtian World to be, whom they haue ſo ſerued ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20736:13"/>
vpon all aduantages preſented or obtained. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly if a Lambe be a Lambe ſtill, a Wolfe will be a Wolfe ſtill, and their Spirituall guides (whom they follow with blind obedience) both traine them vp, and lead them on in blood. You shall not heare of a Miniſter in the Head of the Troopes, preſſing to enter a Worke, or to charge the Enemie with an ambitious and eager forwardneſſe; well may they informe, animate, and rectifie the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and courages of ſuch as goe on, and aſſiſt them by prayers, but they are no open Actors in blood; whereas it is ordinarie, as it appeared at <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and all other places, for Friars, Prieſts, and Ieſuites armed with holy water, and a red Croſſe on their Shoulders, to leade on the Troopes moſt furiouſly and deſperatly, and to mount the place which they are appointed to enter, before all others, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be commanded backe by Leaden Bulls, or Iron Arguments. And what they doe publikely, they faile not priuatly much more to inculcate, thereby to breed a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of our perſons and profeſſion togither, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and cherish an vnreconcileable hate betwixt vs. For they know if Kings, Princes, and People, recouer their wits, and become ſober, the kingdome of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt downe at an inſtant, and the deeper they haue drunke of her dregges, the more they will hate her, and their owne former drunkenneſſe.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed Sauiour proceedes farther, in the fourth Verſe, to relate that which befell to eighteene perſons, who were buried vnder the ruins of a Towre, being part of the Wall of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> adioyning to the Fish-poole of <hi>Siloah,</hi> whereof mention is made in the third Chapter of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> the fifteenth Verſe, demanding of his Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, whether or no they thought them greater ſinners
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20736:13"/>
then all other men that dwelt at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſubioining his infallible iudgement, ſaying, as before <hi>I tell you, nay; but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt example proceeded from the tyrannie and malicious crueltie of man, vnder the colourable pretence of Iuſtice: but this latter example is of the nature of thoſe, whom <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſme</hi> call and account <hi>Accidents.</hi> An accident in the iudgement of this <hi>Dwarfe Ignorance,</hi> and this <hi>Monſter Atheiſme,</hi> is ſuch a thing whereof God takes no <note n="*" place="margin">Of this minde was that Papiſt who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Black-Friars Houſe vpon the heads of their Idolatrous Prieſt and people, was a iuſt Iudgement of God: made anſwer, That he proteſted he thought God did not know of it. Which ſpeech of his proceeded out of Ignorance, &amp; then it was pittifull, or out of Atheiſme, and then it was damnable. If God did not know of it, they might after be in Hell alſo without his notice. (from whence there is no redemption.) Their Saints and tutelar Angels therefore were verie negligent in their cures and charges, not to giue information ſooner: And therefore an old wife (one of their companie) being deliuered from the danger, proteſted, she would neuer pray to Saint or Angel more, nor before a Crucifixe or other Image, but only to her Sauiour and Redeemer, who was able alone to heare and helpe of himſelfe. <hi>Pſ.</hi>

               <p>In the firſt example then, Man was vſed as an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of punishment, in the ſecond ſenſeleſſe Stones. Gods hand of Iuſtice (as our Sauiour ſaith whilſt he threatens the like to all except they repent) was in both, and both fulfilled Gods worke alike; The laſt, namely, the Stones and materialls of the Wall, not knowing what they did; The firſt, namely, <hi>Pilate</hi> and his Souldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending no more then the Stones, the performance of Gods will, or any ſuch thing as the Lord effected, but purſuing blindly their owne plots and politike pretences <note place="margin">Act. 3. 17 18.

               <p>To bring this then to applycation, We ſee what lately hath befalne the Sinogogue of Satan, the Temple of <note place="margin">

               <p>Which Iudgement I relate not as a man that tooke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in blood, or in the miſerable and lamentable loſſe of my own deare Countrimen, or as one that hated the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of any that then dyed, or now ſo beleeue and liue to dye worſe, except they repent: nay rather, I pittie and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone their loſſe, and that obſtinate blindneſſe which led them into that Pitfall; yea though I cannot abſolutely with the Apoſtle deſire to be wholly cut off for my bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>threns <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> ſake, yet I could wish my body ſo bruſed, euen to the loſſe of this life for the ſaluation of their Soules that ſuruiue. As for thoſe that are dead I iudge them not, I excuſe them not, they ſtood or fell to their owne Maſter, their ſentence is ſealed vp in ſeacret from vs, till the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Iudgement, when all things shall be opened, nor dare I breake ope the Seale, to paſſe my ſentence with them or againſt them, till that time come when the <hi>day</hi>

                  <hi>ſhall declare it.</hi> But what I write is for the benefit of the liuing, and to celebrate the Iudgements of God, which none ought to conceale, nor for any reſpect whatſoeuer, to cloke, couer, extenuate, or hide from the eyes of men, ſince that is a notorious Sacriledge, to ſteale the honour of the euerliuing God, for dead Idols and dead men, of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20736:15"/>
which he is iealous, and for which theft he will hold no man guiltleſſe.</p>
               <p>I would therefore aduiſe in Chriſtian dutie, loue, and charitie, all Magiſtrates ſupreame and ſubordinate, and all people whether intereſted in the cauſe and loſſe or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to giue glorie to God by a free and open publication of this great worke of his Iuſtice; leſt Prince, Prieſt, and People pay for the concealement by ſome ſeuere and ſtrickt Inquiſition. For my owne part, theſe few things that I heare for truthes confirmed, againe and againe by eye witneſſeſſe, I shall reueale to Gods glorie and the Churches edification, togither with ſuch ſimple obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as I am directed to make vpon them for the vſe of all men. For I beleeue this Iudgement is the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable, being done vpon them who ſtand vpon Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, for the confirmation of their falſehoods, and make euerie thing ſuch, that may be wreſted by wit for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, either touching our diſaſters or their owne feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. And I hope euen the moſt ſerious on both ſides, who might otherwiſe iudge my obſeruations rash and triuiall, ſadly thinking vpon this point, and withall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and well weighing that this befalls them at ſuch time as they vainely hoped, preſumed, &amp; proudly boaſted of reſtautation, when they might rather expect a Miracle from <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as an Omen of good lucke, and would rather haue fained one (had not this croſſe come in their way) then wanted ſuch a meanes to ſeduce the people, and reeſtablish them in the common mans conceit, will not condemne me altogither to be a trifler in my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, but that ſome or all of them, may profitably paſſe vnder the verdict of their ſeuere cenſures. In aſſurance
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20736:15"/>
whereof, I proceed to propound them, with ſuch exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as our neceſſitie and this occaſion giue me life and courage to make, to my Superiours and Equals vpon our ſide and theirs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Obſerue that the <hi>Romane</hi> Catholikes (who are cunning in all their courſes) procured this Houſe, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in all reſpects for their purpoſe; when doubtleſſe they ſuruaid the ſtrength of the building and capacitie of euerie roome. If the Law should take notice of their vnlawfull aſſembly (as that was the leaſt of their feares) then they had the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours Houſe for a Cloake to which it was adioyning. Or if the People should riſe (as this was one of their aſſayes or tryals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they durſt appeare to play in publike, to proue if all men were growne tame enough to be muzled and hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winked, and whether they would ſtart at holy Water, a Maſſe, a Proceſſion, or the like) then the Ambaſſadours Houſe should be their Sanctuarie, againſt the force and rage of the people. And becauſe it might be perillous to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour to haue the firſt publication at or about his Houſe, who hath beene the firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall moouer to introduce or reſtore Idoll-worship in this Iſland, to the generall diſcontentment of the people, therefore the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours Houſe muſt be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, not for the Papiſts affection, but for ours, as leſſe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that Nation for all our antient enmities, then the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> for all their new friendship and high alliance ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, which they proffred with one hand and ſnatched away with the other, as if they had beene too great for our Royall coniunction, when (I prayſe God) ours was too good for their commixtion.</p>
               <p>Thus the place is ſecured againſt man; but who can
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20736:16"/>
ſecure it againſt God? Not the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, though they haue more powre and priuiledge in <hi>England</hi> to ſerue their Idols, then the Prince himſelfe could haue in <hi>Spaine</hi> to ſerue God. For though his Chaplaines were ſent thither to ſatisfie him and vs, yet might they ſay nothing (as we heare) when they came there, to ſatisfie them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The time is obſerueable; It was their fifth of <hi>Nouember,</hi> wherein they perished by anticipation, as they would haue dealt with vs before vpon the fifth of our <hi>Nouember.</hi> Here is the difference, they fell downe, as they would haue blowne vs vp; and did alone feele the furie of that ſodaine confuſion, without ſtirring their Neighbours Houſes, as they would haue blowne vs vp, with the neceſſarie ruine of diuerſe places adioyning. And this they ſuffered from God, when from the King they had in their fond conceites and miſtaken hopes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that, for which they would haue made him &amp; his, vs &amp; ours, ſo miſerably ſuffer without mercie. But we ſee though Pardons, and tollerations paſſe freely at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in other places for politique reſpects, yet they are not ſure, till they be Sealed and Inrolled in Heauen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Obſerue the Play-Houſe ſtands in that place vnshaken, though too often laden with ſin-full multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of all ſorts, ſexes, and ſects; becauſe it profeſſeth it ſelfe to be no better then it is, a Play-Houſe; and perhaps ſome Houſes of Corporall Fornication ſtand there alſo, becauſe for cuſtome ſake, that they may haue the more commings in, they deſire to ſeeme what they are, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thels: But this Houſe which profeſſeth it ſelfe for Chriſt, when it is for <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and playes with the Word and Sacraments in a moſt Anticke or Apish fashion, euen
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20736:16"/>
when it pretends to be moſt ſerious; and teacheth men to commit Spirituall Fornication vnder the shew of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie and Holineſſe; this muſt not ſtand, but the Lord makes it a ſpectacle of his Iudgement; as he made the Beare-Garden long ſince, whilſt they prophaned the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day (a day at the Creation ordayned for peace and reſt) in that beaſtly ſport of crueltie betwixt the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, proceeding from Gods curſe vpon our Fore-fathers ſinne; which ſight should make <hi>Adam, Abell,</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> with their pious poſteritie, weepe; as it makes <hi>Caine, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech, Cham, Nimrod,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> laugh, with all their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage and impious Seed and ſucceſſion. Theſe Houſes therefore muſt not ſtand when they touch vpon the skirt of Religion, to prophane and pollute the holy things of God, whereof man is not ſo carefull a keeper and zealous defender, as of his own right and intereſt. It may perhaps not ſeeme friuolous to ſome that I mention here, what I haue heard for truth, concerning an other Play-Houſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Fortune,</hi> in which, repeating their Playes vpon a Sabbath day in the afternoone, at night following the Houſe fell on fire and was conſumed to ashes. The Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorie in the preaching place at <hi>White hall,</hi> which ſtood from the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> to King <hi>Iames,</hi> muſt fall then vnder the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadours feet, when he was ſent the ſecond time to perfect what he had before but rough drawne. I doe not wonder that it fell then, hauing ſtood ſo long; I rather wonder it fell not before, being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes as heauely laden (except with the ſin of Idolatry) But that Gods prouidence muſt reſerue it to that inſtant, at that I wonder; and me thinkes it told me the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> footing was not ſo certaine in this Land as he preſumed, but that whilſt his power did tread downe the preaching
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20736:17"/>
places of the Land, he might hap to tumble with them, and by oppoſition giue a happy occaſion to reedifie their ruines more ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Obſerue no Idols, Crucifixes, Croſſes, Holy-Water, Medals, Beades, or any ſacred Relique or <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> whereof doubtleſſe there was great prouiſion laid in, could preſerue or protect from this blow. Let this open the eyes of their ſuperſtitious and bewitched Cuſtomers, and abate the price and eſteeme of ſuch <hi>Romiſh</hi> and Anti-Chriſtian <note place="margin">Reuel. 18 11.</note> 
                  <hi>merchandize,</hi> teaching wiſe men to diſtinguish betwixt toyes, trash, and reall ſafeguards.</p>
               <p>And here I make bold to demand, What became of thoſe Wafer-cakes which the Prieſt had before turned into gods (for doubtleſſe ſome were there or in the roome vnder (which was the Maſſing place) reſerued for the ſicke) What were all of them brayned with the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Brickbats, and did they perish with the Prieſt and the reſt of the people? O blind men, lift vp your eyes and ſee your owne abſurdities! Should I feare the ruines of Heauen, if he who ſits at the right Hand of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtood by me, to ſupport the Roofe from his owne omnipotent and my impotent Head? Reply not ye blind who make others blind with your ſophiſticating tongues, but pray to God for your ſelues, as I doe for you, that he would vouchſafe to giue you grace to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth which you cannot chooſe but ſee. When our Sauiour roſe from the Graue, the Prieſts hired the Souldiers to ſay, <hi>His Diſciples came and ſtole away his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>

Souldiers will be ſuch hirelings, as doubtleſſe you may fit your ſelues with ſome zealous <hi>Reformados</hi> vpon promiſe of abſolution; or otherwiſe make shift with your owne equiuocating Locuſts, armed at all points for the purpoſe with mentall reſeruations and diſpenſations) to ſay, they ſaw the conſecrated Cakes riſe alone from vnder the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, or I shall neuer beleeue your Tranſubſtantiation, nor can you perſwade any to retaine your erronious opinion any longer, or receiue it farther; except ſuch as you with the Cup of Abhominations haue tranſubſtantiated or transformed Spiritually (as <hi>Medea</hi> and <hi>Circes</hi> did their Gueſts Corporally) into ſuch <hi>Don Quixſhots</hi> or <hi>Gorgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuahs</hi> as would eat vp their God Almightie at a mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or in their melancholly mood imagine themſelues to be ſuch Monſters as could doe it.</p>
               <p>The Lord complaines againſt his People that they rob'd him of Tythes and Offerings: But you haue rob'd <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 8.</note> our Sauiour of Head, Heart, Hands, Feet, of a true Body, of his Humanitie.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Obſerue how after the Fact, either thoſe that were reſerued or their obſtinate friends, clouded the worke of God, and out of malice caſt the aſpertion vpon man, to their owne diſaduantage; as if God, who would not ſuffer them to blow vs vp in Parliament, would yet fuffer vs to pull their <hi>Baalitish</hi> Temple ouer their eares in time of their deuotions.</p>
               <p>So in the Powder-Treaſon it was their plot and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe after the ſtrocke, to lay the fault (if Gods mercie had not preuented their malice) vpon the Puritans (as now they haue gotten a tricke for their aduantage, to nickname euen good Proteſtants) &amp; accordingly they had drawne a Proclamation to that effect ready for the Preſſe. Wherein
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20736:18"/>
they charged the Puritans (meaning hereby, all honeſt men that are not like them) with that odious and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fact; and with this draught they were found, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the manner, beyond retracting, or shadowing.</p>
               <p>O what honeſt man can be ſafe among theſe Slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers? The poyſon of Aſpes is vnder their lips. If they entend miſchiefe, the Innocent man muſt ſuffer for it; if they ſuffer from God himſelfe, his Seruants shall be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for it.</p>
               <p>But they ſpeake truer then they are aware (as <hi>Caiphas</hi> prophecied) It is true, it is true, O <hi>Antichriſtians,</hi> thoſe poore Chriſtians vnpind and ſawed aſunder the beame which vpheld the flore whereon you ſtood, from whence you fell.</p>
               <p>But they did it onely with Hands lifted vp to Heauen, which will vnpin the principals of <hi>Babylon</hi> alſo, and with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> plucke the Houſe ouer the <hi>Pheliſtines,</hi> in the midſt of their mirth, whilſt they are reioycing and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing before their Idols.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Obſerue the ſilence of all men at that time and in that action, prouokes God to ſpeake and to doe. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe had here need of <hi>Paule</hi> to reproue him to his face, for he was worthy to be blamed; yea, ſome of thoſe that ought to haue honoured their profeſſion with Martyrdome, before they had giuen ſilent way to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochments of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> shew their readineſſe to hold their peace if they should be requeſted, and ſay it is their <note place="margin">Pſ. 39.</note> dutie to doe ſo. Holy <hi>Dauid,</hi> a man after Gods owne heart, made once a promiſe to doe the like, but for all that when it came to the point, he would not, he could not hold his word againſt God and his Truth, but we ſee his zealous heart was moued to heat, and he ſpake with his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20736:18"/>
tongue. Silence in Gods cauſe was an iniunction layd vpon <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> by the Councell, who anſwered, <note place="margin">Act. 4. 19 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to hearken vnto you more then vnto God iudge ye. For we cannot but ſpeake the things which we haue ſeene and heard.</hi> It was Saint <hi>Paules</hi> caſe, whoſe heart was ſo ſtird when he came to <hi>Athens</hi> and ſaw that learned Citie deuoted to Idolatry, as he could not hold his peace, though his perſon was thereby in perill. That Hiſtorie betwixt <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Bishop of <hi>Millan,</hi> makes more for the vertue of the Emperour, then for the valour of the Bishop. It is no great matter to ſay what the Bishop did, ſince he for ſo doing may be cenſured to be <hi>ſatis audax,</hi> but what the Emperour did and ſaid of the Bishop, when his anger was ouer, is to the purpoſe. For as <hi>Sozomen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Soz. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Theodoſius dixit ſe ſolum Ambroſium dignum Epiſcopi nomine noſſe. Theodoſius</hi> ſaid he knew one <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> onely worthy the name of a Bishop. And this was for ſpeaking truth, and diſcharging his conſcience, though herein he plainly condemned an action of the Emperors, and doubtleſſe croſt his preſent deſires.</p>
               <p>Let no man cloake his luke-warmneſſe or perſonall cowardice vnder the pretence of modeſtie, patience, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, moderation, prudence, or temperance. He that hath a Soule hoping to be ſaued, will ſpeake for his Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Shall there be ſo many offer themſelues to plead for <hi>Baal,</hi> becauſe he cannot plead for himſelfe, whilſt few or <note place="margin">Iudh. 6. 31.</note> none pleads for Chriſt, who pleads continually for vs all? No, no, Let all men aſſure themſelues if they will not ſpeake becauſe they will not be counted factious, furious, and hot-headed fellowes, but diſcreet, moderate, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent perſons, fit for preferment and imployment, that yet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20736:19"/>
God can raiſe vp Stones to doe that which they should, but will not, or dare not; neither shall they eſcape the Hand of God, but he will find them out, and punish their falshood and faintneſſe in his cauſe.</p>
               <p>Proceed to expreſſe your Chriſtian courages, therefore O Princes, Nobles, Prieſts, People! Behold God goes before you, Who will not follow? Remember what <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid to that falſe Prophet, that hireling, who ſought to diſcourage him, that his example might diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all the reſt, <hi>Should ſuch a man as I am feare?</hi> Surely <note place="margin">Neh. 6. 11.</note> it doth not become his Place, his Profeſſion. What could a Slaue, a Coward, a Traytour doe more? O let it neuer be recorded of you, to your perpetuall dishonours, as it was of the ignoble Nobles amongſt the <hi>Tekoites. Next</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Neh. 3. 5</note> 
                  <hi>vnto them the Tekoites repaired, but their Nobles put not their necks to the worke of the Lord.</hi> And what I ſpeake to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> I likewiſe ſpeake to <hi>Manaſſes. England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> should be vnited in this. They both looke for examples from each other, both should be examples to each other; <hi>England</hi> as the richer in regard of the world, <hi>Scotland</hi> as being no leſſe rich in Spirituall treaſure; <hi>England</hi> as the ſtronger, <hi>Scotland</hi> as the freer; <hi>England</hi> as being more engaged for the Royall Preſence, <hi>Scotland</hi> as being more entereſted in the Royall birth and educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>England</hi> as being neereſt the danger, <hi>Scotland</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too neere to auoid it.</p>
               <p>O all ye Peeres, Prieſts, and People ioyne with your Royall Head, and remember what he hath often ſaid, written, and vowed, and cauſed you to ſay, write, and vow, whilſt he hath proued by his learned Labours that the Pope is <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> The truth is too ſtrong to be repulced or retorted, ſince <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that <hi>Romish Goliah,</hi> with all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20736:19"/>
his aſſiſtants, could not wreſt the Staffe and Sling out of his hand with Arguments. Nor is our <hi>Dauid</hi> growne ſo <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21</note> faint now with age, that he muſt goe no more to battell, for feare of quenching the Light of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You that haue fought Gods battells with him againſt the red Dragon, the ſeuen headed Beaſt, and her whorish rider, with all their armie, &amp; can tell how brauely he hath borne himſelfe, and what blowes he hath dealt with his tongue and with his pen. It was <hi>Saule</hi> and not <hi>Dauid</hi> that fell vpon his owne Sword. If the Pope be not <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> why hath he written ſo? It is Gods Word and his <note place="margin">Ier. 20. 7</note> Pen that hath deceiued vs. If the Pope be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> then to make a Couenant with him, or to trade with him in Spirituall Merchandize, is to make a Couenant with <note place="margin">Eſ. 28. 15</note> Death, Satan, and Hell, againſt God, his Sonne, and his Church.</p>
               <p>To be a <hi>Mahumetane</hi> is to be an open profeſt enemie, which is in compariſon honourable; but to be an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,</hi> is to be a Traytour, <hi>For Chriſt in ſhew, againſt him in deed,</hi> which is ſuperlatiuely deteſtable. To be a <hi>Iudas,</hi> though one of Chriſts Apoſtles, is worſe then to be a <hi>Pilate,</hi> though a condemner of Chriſt. <hi>Antichriſt</hi> of all the enemies of the Church, is the moſt perillous and moſt pernitious.</p>
               <p>But what need all this? What cauſe haue we to feare the reentrance of <hi>Antichriſt?</hi> What shall euerie shadow afright vs?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, We doubt not the ſodaine reentrance of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> but his ſlye inſinuation, and their wiles who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to worke reconcilement, and ſay that humour is too much ſtird vpon both ſides. We would not haue confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Serpent, nor caſt an eye vpon the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20736:20"/>
Fruit, though neuer ſo beautifull. <hi>Is it not a little</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>one?</hi> made way for a great offence. We are will'd to come out of Myſticall <hi>Babylon,</hi> as out of Spirituall <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> not to looke behind vs as if we long'd to turne <note place="margin">Apol. 18 4. &amp; 11. 8.</note> backe, nor to touch any vncleane thing, but to flee the garment polluted with the flesh. This puritie becomes Virgines and Angels, who will not mixe with Spirituall Fornicators. Such Soule chaſt Spirits shall onely ſee the face of the Bridegroome in glorie. We feare to looke of a <hi>Moabitish</hi> woman, leſt she proue a ſnare and a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <note place="margin">Num. 25</note> blocke to the Princes and People; or to take a fauor from <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> leſt it proue to our Church and State as <hi>Achans</hi> wedge to the Hoaſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>What hope of reconcilement is there, where the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſide holds it to be a fundamentall veritie, that they cannot erre. To abate, is to denie their grounds, they know it, they haue ſet downe their reſt vpon it, and this alone forceth them to maintaine shameleſſe errours with an obſtinate and womanish will, hauing nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their nakedneſſe, but theſe arguments that they are old, and belong to an infallible Chaire. For if they should confeſſe in one, all <hi>Babylon</hi> were ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>The experience of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his ſucceſſour, mightie Emperours, armed with all aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which man can thinke vpon, to procure reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reconcilement, and ſtudiouſly and conſtantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying their power and policie to that end, with great zeale and affection to the cauſe, and faire probabilities to effect it, may notwithſtanding in their booteleſſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours reſolue the World how vaine a worke it is to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake or attempt ſuch an enterprize which God hath reſerued to himſelfe to accomplish. It is an eaſie worke
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20736:20"/>
to draw vs to them by corruption, but it is too hard a worke for man to draw them to vs by reformation, which is a kind of regeneration. The paſſages of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> may inſtruct vs ſufficiently what to hope of their reformation, except we long to be deluded; and for vs to come on vpon their ſide, and take vpon vs the leaſt marke of the Beaſt which we haue caſt off, therby to buy our peace, and to endeare our entertainment, is to wound our owne Conſciences, and to ſinne with a high Hand againſt the Light of Knowledge. And hauing thus ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed one abomination (which God forbid) a reprobate ſenſe will make roome for all, and men, by the iuſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God giuen ouer, will begin to beleeue thoſe lyes in good earneſt, which at firſt they heard and repeated in ieaſt.</p>
               <p>Leaue that great worke therefore, to the Reconciler of Heauen and Earth, to the Moderatour and Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man, who will conſume the Man of Sin <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2</note> (by degrees, not altogether) with the <hi>Breath or Spirit of his Mouth</hi> (by the powrefull preaching of the Word, and effectuall working of the Spirit) and will <hi>abolish and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him with the brightneſſe of his comming;</hi> till when we shall haue <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> though impotent, old, and in a conſumption. Thus let vs guard our owne, for it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable God will no more vſe the temporall power or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of <hi>Princes</hi> in the totall and finall ſupplantation and eradication of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> then he did vſe them in the firſt planting of the Goſpell of Chriſt. They are to be nurſing Fathers and nurſing Mothers, not generating and naturall Parents to the Church, that Chriſt may be <hi>all in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider this well ye moderate minded men, and shew vs a way how we may be ſuch politique Chriſtians, as to

               <p>Therefore leauing that which is improbable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, impoſſible, <hi>Let vs follow after charitie,</hi> and purſue <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14 1.</note> that which is both poſſible and probable, that is, The vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Reformed Churches within themſelues. And to this end conſider what things they are that keepe vs deuided. Whether they be points of Doctrine, or points of Diſcipline. Whether matters ſubſtantiall and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, or ceremonious and circumſtantiall. Whether of neceſſitie and vnalterable veritie, or of indifferencie and variable conueniencie.</p>
               <p>If of the firſt ſort, then conſider whether they may be reconciled by clearing or remouing ſome termes diuerſly vſed and vnderſtood, or by ſilencing ſome peremptorie expreſſions and abſolute definitions, ſetting a modeſt bound to the inquiſition of curioſitie and ſingularitie in matters vnſearchable.</p>

And whether vpon the other ſide it be charitie in them who are at libertie, to condemne vs and all other Churches of <hi>Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> who vſe thoſe formes and eſteeme them indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p>Whether it can be imagined that we will in <hi>France</hi> by Treaties, Articles, and Arguments, or in the Vnited <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces</hi> by reall aſſiſtance, or in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> by chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Armies, deale ſo ſeriouſly and effectually for the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and replanting of Religion, as long as theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences remaine vndetermined, vnſetled, vnreconciled, as the Papiſts doe for the planting of their Superſtition, or, as we would doe if in all reſpects we were perfectly one.</p>
               <p>And whether the Religion in <hi>France</hi> the Vnited <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> be not the ſame in ſubſtance with that in Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> which we should not doe well therefore to diſcountenance and abandon for the outward forme ſake.</p>
               <p>Theſe points in the humilitie of my Soule, and as in the preſence of God the Searcher of the Heart, and the Iudge of all men, and all actions, I preſent with all feare and reuerence to the eye and conſideration of my Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, not with any purpoſe to contend or ſaucely to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the contrarie reſolutions of ſuch as God hath placed ouer me in authoritie, or to giue them the leaſt offence
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20736:22"/>
or diſtaſt by propounding theſe things publikely, or as a man that thought my ſelfe able to direct in theſe bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Depths, or to ſaile in theſe Seas by my ſelfe and my owne skill without Compaſſe, where no Land can be ſeene; but hoping hereby to giue occaſion, to men of place and abilitie, to ſtudie the point, and to purſue it to purpoſe to a finall reſolution and determination. And if theſe poore vnworthy papers of mine shall euer haue the happineſſe to kiſſe his Maieſties hands, or the hand of any that may whiſper a plaine truth into his Iuditious eare, then I humbly deſire he may know (and from my Soule, and the ſinceritie and ſimplicitie of my Heart, I ſpeake it) that nothing could haue moued me to write what I haue done (leſt thereby I should offend his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, whoſe wiſedome hath beene pleaſed to run a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie courſe) but onely that I feared to offend God by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing this truth from the eares of his Maieſtie, and the reſt of his loyall Officers and louing Subiects, which I am fully perſwaded God put in my Heart to the end I should vtter it. And to incourage me and prouoke me the more to this worke, the infirmitie of this Seaſon and of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with it, are continuall meſſengers telling me I muſt make haſt, for I am not likely to ſtay long here, but I muſt appeare before his Tribunall, where Kings and Beggers <note place="margin">Pr. 12. 2.</note> ſtand vpon euen termes, and where men shall anſwer, as well for the concealing of truth, as for the venting of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. The Peſtilence alſo walkes about the Street, and enters euerie mans dore at night or noone-day without knocking; This alſo makes me the bolder, as men that are in the heat of warre, dare do more then vpon cold blood. But my hope is in the vnſpeakeable mercie of God, that he will perſwade the Heart of his Maieſtie, and all others
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20736:22"/>
that shall reade this Treatiſe, that whatſoeuer is herein vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rered, proceeds from an vpright and good intention, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to helpe to vnite the reformed Churches in one, and to remoue or qualifie ſuch differences as hold them deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the great aduantage of the enemie: Wherein if I haue tatled to little purpoſe, or perhaps a little too much, it is becauſe I am able to doe nothing but tattle; but were I able to doe more, I would doe it, that our deuiſions might not be told in <hi>Gath,</hi> nor our nakedneſſe published in the Streets of <hi>Askelon,</hi> to the reioycing of the publike enemie.</p>
               <p>For I know how much it concernes the Reformed Churches that they should be vnited in one (if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) that the humours of men might be mittigated, and made in loue with Peace, which is ſo much in their mouthes.</p>
               <p>And I know how much it concernes the proſperitie of our Church and State, and the peace and proſperitie of all Reformed Churches, that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> should firſt be perfectly vnited.</p>
               <p>I know what aduantage euen in opinion, much more in action, the enemie takes from our deuiſion; and I feare euen ſome of thoſe who pretend to be Chyturgions to cloſe the wounds, do make them wider vpon purpoſe by preſſing the Flesh too hard. Force neuer did good, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with fierie natures, but mollifying Oyles of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange and abatement, may by kind conference cloſe and conſolidate all differences.</p>
               <p>And vpon the other ſide I know how much thoſe Spirits haue diſaduantaged the cauſe, that haue made their breath bellowes only to blow vp contention by oppoſing Superiour powers with violence, and dipping their pens

in Gall and Vineger, haue exaſperated the humour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other profit to the cauſe then prouoking of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſecution, where patience, ſubmiſſion, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance might haue qualified and allaid the heat.</p>
               <p>In which regard I could wish that men howſoeuer forward and zealous that way, would be warie how they ſtirre vp coles of contention by writing againſt <hi>Iuda,</hi> as if they writ againſt <hi>Aegypt,</hi> leſt they kindle a fire to the great hurt of the Reformed Churches, which may waſte that ſtrength and Spirit within, that, employd abroad, would waſte and conſume the foundation of <hi>Babylon.</hi> I ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally I wish this courſe were taken at this time, when his Maieſtie hath beene gratiouſly pleaſed to condeſcend to our weakneſſe, and to ſecure our feares and iealouſies, by open proteſtation, that his whole intention is to procure and effect the good of the Reformed Churches and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in all his deſignes; that he will neuer entertaine Treatie to the contrarie; and to reſolue vs of this (a thing that he need not) hath made a fearefull imprecation againſt himſelfe and his poſteritie, in caſe he do otherwiſe.

               <p>The Doctrine of Chriſt and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is mingled in your Church, as the Tares and Wheat both in one Field; doe but diſtinguish that which is of God, and that which is of man, and the controuerſie is cleared.</p>
