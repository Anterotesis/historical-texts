            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For we Chriſtians be as well kynges, as Chriſt is our heade and kynge: &amp; that bycauſe we beleue in him. Now, Chriſte is no worldely kynge, for the ſcripture ſayth. Io. 18 (The kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſte is not of thys world) for he is kyng of kynges: for bycauſe he hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer all thyng.

kynges, for all that apperteyneth to Chriſte are ours. And alſo, al we chriſty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans, be Chriſtes, for chriſt and by Chriſt, For by hym we all do offer ſpirituall ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crifyces dayly vnto God, and one pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for an other: and we haue power to preache goddes worde, whiche thynges S.

And that that we ſaye vnto fathers of houſholdes, we wyll to be ſpoken vnto euery Chriſtian woman which is mother ouer her houſhold, for the which thynge, leſte that any might doubte in this matter, I wyll proceade a lytle further in it. Fyrſte of all, Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus in the firſt boke of his Antiquites doth wryte, that Adam and hys ſonne Seth did make two tables, one of ſlate, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other of ſtone, in the which they wryt the worde of god and hys Prophecyes, the which they did, without any doubt, that they myghte both brynge vp theyr houſhold in the worde of god, and leaue it to their poſterytie, and to to exercyſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offyce of a Biſſhoppe in teachynge the worde of God.

But what nede I to bryng this or that example, as though the olde Taſtament were not full of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherewith it might be eaſely proued, that a good and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſe father of a houſholde oughte to enforme all hys hole honſholde, bothe in godly doctrine and in good manners Furthermore, Deute. 11.

Deute. 6. and bynde them for a ſigne vpon youre hande, that they may be as a warnynge betwene your eyes, Prouerb. 3. And ye ſhall teache them youre Chyldren, that they may talke of them, when thou ſyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſte in thy houſe: and when thou wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt by the way, when thou lieſt downe and when thou ryſeſt vp, yea, and thou ſhalt wryte them vppon thy dore poſtes of thy houſe, and vppon thy gaates that your dayes may be multiplyed &amp;c. Do we not heare in this place, that god wyl that euerye good father of a houſholde ſhall teache his Chyldren and hys famy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:9931:4"/>
the commaundementes of god, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhal take the office of a priuate Byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and preacher. Euen lykewiſe, euen a lytle before. Deute. 6. God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund when he ſayth. Thou ſhalt loue thy lorde God with all thy herte &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And theſe wordes which I commaund the thys day, ſhalbe in thy herte &amp; thou ſhalte ſhewe them vnto thy Chyldren, &amp; ſhalte talke of them, when thou arte at whome in thy houſe, and as thou wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt by the way &amp;c. But here ſome men wolde ſay. God dyd commaunde them vnto the Iewes, that they myght teach theyr famyly the preceptes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> x. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, what haue Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men that be fathers of houſholds, to do with thoſe preceptes? He not Chriſten me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyuered from all Moyſes lawe by Criſt therfore heare thou (o Chriſtian) of the Chriſtian libertie. At this tyme I do no thynge ſpeake of the abrogation of the lawe, for that euery father of a houſhold ſhoulde inſtitute and teache hys Chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and famyly, aſwell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> x. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, as any other Chriſtian doctryne. S. Paul teacheth us playnely and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfeſtly
<pb facs="tcp:9931:5"/>
in his Epiſtle to the Epheſy. 6 Chap. when he ſaith. Ye Fathers moue not your Chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wrath. But bring them vp thorowe the doctryne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the lorde.</p>
            <p>What meaneth it to brynge them vp in the doctryne or diſcyplyne of the lorde? truely nothyng elſe, but their Chyldren alwaye frome their tender infancy to be Chriſtianly brought vp, in thoſe thinges which our lord god wyll require at their handes. What thynges be thoſe? The x. commaundementes do ſuffycyentlye declare. Furthermore, leſte that youthe ſhoulde forgette or contempne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of god (as euen in dede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſort is moſt neglygent) therfore Paul ſayth, that they ought to be admonyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and warned of their gouernoures, with the admonirion of the lorde: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thynge to be grafted in their myndes, whiche God doth ſpeciallye requyre in them. And as we maye eaſely perceyue by the wordes of Paul, that it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trew part of a father of a houſhold, to brynge vp dyly gentlye his Chyldren &amp; houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in the ten commaundementes. And
<pb facs="tcp:9931:5"/>
lette no houſeholde keper agaynſte thys thynge wynce or kycke: but lette theym brynge them vp, in fayth, hope and cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rytie, and in other wholeſome preceptes and doctrynes of Chriſte: that the lawe maye be as a ſcolemaiſter (As S. Paul ſayth vnto Chriſte) that is, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng brought to the knowledge of their ſynne by the lawe, may prepare and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne theyr ſelues to ſeke vnto Chriſte, and to his ryght herytage: for why, the law (as Paul to the Romaynes &amp; Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathyans doth argue) doth make vs to prepare our ſelues to receyue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of god, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſetteth before our eies our ſin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, and putteth downe the ſtubbernes of our mynde. and maketh vs very gree die of Chriſtes doctryne. Furthermore when Chriſte (as it is ſhewed in the 5. of Marke) had delyuered a certeyne man of a deuyll, and he dyd pray Chriſt, that he wolde tarry ſtyll wyth hym. Chryſte made anſwere vnto him. Go thy waies into thyne owne houſe, vnto thy famy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſhew them how moche the Lorde hath done for the, and what compaſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had ouer the.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9931:6"/>
Nowe, we haue herde Chriſte our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſauyour commaunde alſo, that he which was delyuered by hym frome a Deuyll, ſhoulde take the office of a Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and preacher of his worde in hys houſe amonge his Chyldren and famy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that he ſhoulde ſet forth the gret benefyciall goodnes, which he had recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued of god: and ſo to brynge his famyly by the loue of god, to the very knowe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we maye gather oute of dyuers Epiſtles of Paule: that in hys tyme, there was both fathers of houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdes, and mothers of houſholdes, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che dyd bryng vp very earneſtlye their famyly, both in the fayth of Ieſu Chriſt and alſo in other pryncypall matters of Chriſtes religion, for whi, in the Epiſtle vnto the Romayns the laſte Chapter, he doth ſalute the houſholde and faythfull church of Priſca &amp; Aquyia (or as I may vſe his termes) the Chriſten family whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che was in the houſe of Pryſca and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila: for wythoute doubte, theye were informed priuyly in the fayth of Chriſt. And in the fyrſte Epiſtle to the Coryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyans
<pb facs="tcp:9931:6"/>
the laſte Chapter he ſaith. Aquy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>la &amp; Priſcilla, with thoſe which be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faythefull congregation in their houſe doth ſalute you hertely in the lord. And where agayne, he calleth the houſholde faythefull Churche, the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faythfull Chyldren, men ſeruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and women ſeruauntes, which were in the houſe of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Priſcilla (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he calleth to the Romayns Priſca) and Aquyla her houſbande.</p>
            <p>The ſelf ſame thynge Paul to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians the laſte Chapter ſayth. Salute the Bretheren which are at Laodicia, &amp; ſalute Nymphas, and the congregation which is in his houſe, where S. Ambroſe thynketh that thys Nimpha was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man diligeut in the commaundementes of God, thys artycle in greake, <hi>Aphtae,</hi> doth reproue it, that he was no woman but a man, which did noryſſh and bryng vp his Chriſtian famyly at home in hys houſe in Chriſtian loue and godlyneſſe. The ſelfe ſame thynge dothe S. Paul exhorte Tytus. Tit. 2. That old women ſhoulde be ſoberlye aparelled, no ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and that they ſhoulde teache ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſte

And here Paul wylleth alſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> old women ſhould inſtructe their yonge women at home in their houſe, to godlyneſſe and good manners. And alſo Paul vnto Tymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the fyrſt Epiſtle the fourth Chapter commaundeth wydowes to learne god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyneſſe at home in their houſes, and to haue a godly famyly. And howe canne they haue a godly familie, excepte theye teache theyr houſholde dylygently and priuately in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> learnyng and erudition of Goddes word?</p>
            <p>To conclude, that holy man Sayncte Chriſoſtome in hys fyrſt homely in Ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſis ſaythe. When ye ſhall depart from hence from thys ſenſyble table, let there be put afore you a ſpiritual table, and let the good man of the houſe ſaye ſome of theſe wordes, whiche be here ſayde. Let the woman here. Let the ſeruantes lecne Let their aquayntaunce lerne, and let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe be the Chuche of God, that the Deuyll may be dryuen away, and that our daily aduerſary may be put to flight wyth all the enemyes of our health and
<pb facs="tcp:9931:7"/>
let the grace of the holye ghoſte here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyde in this place, that all peace and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>corde maye defende all inhabytauntes herein. &amp;c. Theſe be the wordes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome. Of the which wordes what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not vnderſtande, that it perteynethe to godly fathers of houſholdes, to make their houſe the churche of God, and the congregation of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people: and to take the office of a Biſſhop vpon them Alſo Chriſoſtome ſetteth fourth the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes whiche ryſe of ſermonnes made at home in houſes: for bycauſe of them the deuyll is driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awaye. As S. Peter ſaith which goeth aboute as a rorynge Lyon fekyng whome he may deuoure. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſte doth reſte vpon the inhaby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauntes and dwellers in the houſewhere the worde of god is taught: and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habytauntes and dwellers doo lyne in concorde and vnytie, and they do agree peaceably, one wyth an other. Whiche frutes verelye do eaſely brynge to thys poynte all fathers of houſholdes, that they ſhoulde dylygently inſtructe their famyly, with the worde of God in their houſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9931:8"/>
For we may ſee by dayly experyence, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the deuyll goeth aboute with all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, to make debate and ſtryfe in how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and breaketh amitie &amp; peace and ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth diſcord. And it is no doubt (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoſtom truly ſayth) the deuyll y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie of mans ſaluation, and of our hole famy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye, ſekethe oure lyfe: and often tymes wolde brynge bothe the father of the houſholde, the wyfe the Children, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole family to perels, onleſſe he be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away of godly fathers of houſholds by the ſwerde of the ſpirite, which is the worde of God. With theſe examples of holy fathers, with the preceptes of god in tyme paſte gyuen and commaunded in the olde Teſtamente, withe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente of Chriſt, which he gaue vnto hym whome he delyuered from a deuyll, and by theſe examples of fathers of houſholdes and mothers of houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, whiche I haue reherſed oute of S. Paules Epiſtles.</p>
            <p>And where as Sainct Paul, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre of olde women and widowes, we may gather eſely by the wordes of Cri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoſtome, euery father of a houſhold hath
<pb facs="tcp:9931:8"/>
lybertie to teach his famyly at his own houſe the worde of God, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of ryght he is, and ought to be, the very Biſſhop of his famyly. And there is no leſſe to be thoughte of mothers of houſholdes. If there be any brother of a houſhold whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is illyterate or vnlerned, and can not teache pryuately hys houſholde, let him hyer one, whiche in hys ſtead may lerne hys famyly, or if he can not, let hym ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uygyſantly marke the ſayenges of Pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lycke and open ſermons, and let hym re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pete thoſe ſaiengs at home in hys houſe before hys famyly, aſſone as ſupper or dynete is done. Therfore I beyng per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded wyth thoſe arguementes of S. Paul, which I haue made relation of, y<hi rend="sup">s</hi> I euer thoughte dylygently wythe my ſelfe, that it were very neceſſary to write for my chyldren and for my hole houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, certeyne houſholde ſermons. In the whiche thoſe thynges whiche were requiſite to a very trew and Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lygion, myght be expounded wyth few wordes propiſe &amp; coreſpondent for the matter, which ſermons often tymes I vſe to reade in my houſe, to mye Chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="tcp:9931:9"/>
in laten, to my famyly, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother tonge. And do earneſtly require at their handes after my readynge, whether thei do vnderſtand theſe thynges which are rede or no, and leaſte they ſhould forget veri quycly thoſe thinges which I haue red, I do require oftentymes of theym all thynges, which in theſe ſermons be entreated of, euen as of their diſtafe and ſpyndell, which ſermons I beyng ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly requeſted of my eſpeciall frendes haue ſuffered to come abroad, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by them euen other fathers of houſholdes maye be ſtyrred towarde their famyly, to tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che them wel and godly. For I knowe that fathers of houſholdes be ſlacke in this thynge: and do not dylygently exce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cute their office commytted to them of God.</p>
            <p>Fyrſte I wyll leaue out ſome of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mons in laten, yf my fryndes ſhall think it beſte, and ſet out thoſe that be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother tonge. But vnto the (mi welbeloued Thomas) doo I dedycate theſe my pryuate ſermonnes, for that I know the to be gyuen ſtudiouſly to a perfecte godlyneſſe. And althoughe I
<pb facs="tcp:9931:9"/>
knowe thou haſte no nede of theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to enſtructe thy famyly wyth, for that thou haſte attempted many godly thynges wyth the ſtudie of godly wyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: yet for all that ſeyeng I knowe that euery thynge which may be condu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyble and profytable to obteine and get ſome godly wiſdome is moſt acceptable vnto the, I doubte not but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wylte take theſe my ſermons well at worthe. For bycauſe I haue writen them to the furtheraunce of Chriſtes true relygion. Some perchaunce wyll laughe me too ſcorne, for that I wolde be taken for an earneſt lawer, and haue taken vpon me to interlace my ſelfe with holy ſcripture, whoſe laughinge to ſcorne I wyll vtter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly diſpiſe, Although that I am amonge the company and the felowſhyp of law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers: yet I will not be forgetful of thoſe thynges which perteyneth to a chriſtian father of an houſhold, for this is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed ſaiynge of S.

be led into temptation. But delyuer vs from euyll. Amen. Ierome. I haue this prayer vpon my fyngers endes: yf thou wylte know it, I wyll ſay it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the boke. Ch. O brother, it is not y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſaye this godly and holy pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er without the boke, excepte thou maiſt vnderſtand it, for our father did ſay, that this praier ſhall neuer come from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the herte, vnleſſe we do well vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtande it, &amp; there is no prayer thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taken of god, onleſſe it be drawne out of the inwarde boſome of our herte. Ie. Therfore make me that I maye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande this prayer by ſome meanes, all though I learne it not withoute the boke. Ch. I wyll go aboute to do it god wyllyng. And as thou arte wonte to do gyue thy dilygence vnto me wyth an at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tentyne eare. Ierome. I ſhall doo that thyng. Chriſto. In the firſt begynnynge of this praier, our father dyd affirme be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neuolence almoſte to be taken of thoſe thynges which ſhal be aſked afterward for ſynce that god, not onely God, that is to ſaye, oure defender ſuccuorore
<pb facs="tcp:9931:13"/>
and helper, but alſo is a father, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there of this man, or that man, but oure father, that is, of us all, which puttethe their truſte in Ieſus Chriſte his onelye begotten ſonne. And how can he denye vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thynge, the which we aſke of hym? Ierom. Surely euen in lyke caſe, ſeyng that oure yearthely fathers (bye whoſe mean we were brought into this world) can not deny vs that thynge, which we aſke of hym: moche leſſe euen that oure father celeſtial, which is father of vs all can deny vs of any thynge that we aſke which doth excell all other yearthely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers both in goodnes &amp; mercy. Chriſto. Surely, thou doſte gyue a godly Iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mente of our god, my brother Ierome: euer talke thou on theſe thynges, &amp; lette thys be thy Godly exercyſe. Therfore thou knoweſt, how with theſe wordes our father ſhould be a preparation, with a certeyne beneuolence, towardes thoſe thynges which we ſhalbe about to aſke. Iero, I knowe it very wel, but how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeſt thou thys thynge, which is added vnto, which art in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Chriſto, God truely, as thou haſte hearde of our
<pb facs="tcp:9931:13"/>
father, is in euery place, but peculyarly he is in heauen: and he is in celeſtial and hygh thynges. And withe theſe wordes we are called from the care of worldely thynges, for to be alwaye in contempla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, of heauenly thynges. Wherefore, Chriſte when he ſhoulde praye, did lyft vp his eyes vnto heauen. Iero. Surelye this fyrſte begynnyng doth excellently well, and therefore ſay on. Chriſto. The begynnyng of this prayer, doth gather ſeuen petitions / in the which thou haſte hearde all thoſe thynges as knitte vp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to gither with one band, euen what ſo euer ſhoulde be eyther aſked of God, or neceſſary for vs. Iero. I haue hearde thoſe thynges whiche thou haſte ſayde, but cauſe that I may more playnely vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtande them. Chriſto. Fyrſt we praie let thy name be halowed, thys thynge our father did ſaie that it did ſmell ſome what of the Hebrew phraſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not be vnderſtanded ſo wel of men. Ierome. Whatte doth it meane then? Chriſto. This it meaneth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of god, that euer both was, and is, holy, ſhalbe ſainctified in vs, that is (as oure <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

Iero. How wylleſt thou that theſe wordes ſhalbe vnderſtande, euen in earthe as it is in heauen? Chriſto. Haſte thou forgotten thoſe thynges that oure father did ſay, that theſe wordes, ought thys waye to be taken, that in lyke caſe as the holy Aungels in heauen do obey his holy will, ſo in like caſe here in earth his holy wyll to be obeyed of all men, yea, and that in all maner of thynges. Iero. But gentyll brother, what do we then aſke to be gyuen vnto vs of God whyleſt we ſaye, gyue vs this daye our dayly bread? Chriſto. To be ſhorte, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle brother, we do not onely aſke of god for bread, but we aſke for thoſe which la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour dilygently, that he might preſerue vs with a ſufficiencye, yea and alſoo for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tillers
<pb facs="tcp:9931:14"/>
of the earthe, that god wolde ſend a proſperous ſucceſſe vnto their labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, to ſende temperateneſſe of weather, to make their grounde frute full, that the corne may growe to our ſuſtenance, we alſo do aſke here, that god maye take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye all euyls which be wonte ether to deſtroye cornes, or choke vp cornes, as hayle, thunder, boyſterous wyndes, or elſe ſuch proper chaunces as doth apper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyne, or come by their owne nature, as wormes, or rottynge, when it dothe lye on the grounde, where vpon oure father did ſhew, that the Heathens had certen holydayes that were inſtituted to praye vnto their Goddes, for ſuche chaunces. In the ſteade of ſuch feaſtes, as I thynk wee haue come into their place certeyne (ſuperſtitious) ſupplications and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made vnto Amburbya, or the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Amburbia. Ierom, Forſoth thoſe thynges which thou haſte ſhewed, I re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membre that they were declared of our father. Chriſto. We pray for in the ſame petition that god may dryue awaye bat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayle: for that in tyme of warre all corne and fyldes be deſtroied, trode vnderneth

Iero. I vnderſtande very wel how many thynges we do aſke of god wyth theſe few wordes: but I pray the, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this worde (to day) addyd. Chriſ. (To day) our father ſayd that it was ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded for this purpoſe / after the mynde of S. Cypryan, that whoſoeuer wyll be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diſcyple of Chriſte, after the voyce of hys mayſter, he muſte forſake all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and aſke hys dayly meate, and not be longe in aſkynge of his petition, the ſelfe ſame lorde ſhewyng the ſame, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſayde in the, <hi>6.</hi> Chapter of Matthe. Be not thoughtfull for to morow, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what ſhall we eate, and what ſhall we drynke, and with what ſhall we be clothed, after theſe thynges do the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyls inquire alſoo, your heauenly father doth know, that ye haue nede of al theſe thynges. Ierom. Gentle brother, howe doſte thou vnderſtand theſe wordes, and forgyue vs our treſpaces, as we forgiue

and brynge vs not into temptation. Do we in this place deſyre to be delyuered from all kynde of temptation? Chriſtop We doo notte praye heere, that we ſhoulde not be tempted, but that wee ſhoulde not be led into temptation: that is to ſaye, that we ſhoulde not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with temptation. Iero. Of what enemyes be we chiefly-tempted? Chriſt. Of three enemyes, the worlde, the fleſhe and the deuyll. Iero. How be we temp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted of the worlde? Chriſt.

When the great abundaunce of our ſyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes be ſet before our eyes, and be inticed to deſperation, and we are compelled to caſte awaye the hope of goddes mercie. Furthermore, when we are ſtirred too murder, to be a parricide or kyller of our kindred / or to commit anie ſuche abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable crimes. Ierome.

Furthermore, that duetie whyche we

And what is this promys, I praye the here, that it may be well with the, for it is well with vs, when all thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges chaunce accordynge vnto our mind vndoutedly, if we be in helth or yf there be mynyſtred vnto vs aboundauntly our daylye neceſſaryes, or what ſo euer we do, it doth luckelye chaunce when our mynd is voyde of all troubles, we are well ſpoken of, we are taken reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of all men.

it is the fyrſte commaundement of god hauyng promes, that is not once much ſpoken of, abrode, but we fynde it very often repeted in holy ſcripture, yea and alſo by examples, wyth the whiche God ſheweth inobediente chyldren, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their parentes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wyll be auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Wherfore ſayth a Chriſtian man, I beleue in god, and not ſimplye, I beleue god, beholde heare Gregorie Nazyanzene, which in his fyrſte boke of the worde of god wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, to beleue in any thing / doth proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly perteyn vnto the godhead.</p>
               <p>To beleue therfore in god, is to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue / and to haue aſure confidence in his deuine ſubſtaunce, and euerlaſtynge ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtaunce which hath neyther begynyng nor endynge. And god is the name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuine maieſty. And for that that we do ſay more ouer in our beliefe, that we do beleue not onelye in god, but in god the father, it is the beclaration of a greate
<pb facs="tcp:9931:43"/>
fayth, for he that doth beleue god to be the father, to hym, is promyſed al thyng of god, and loketh for all thynge of god, for yf the ſonne hath a confydence that he ſhall obteyne all thynge of his yearth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly father, how mothe more ought we to haue a confydence that we ſhall obteine all thynges, of god the father, for why? as Chriſte ſayth hym ſelfe, if you which be euyll, can gyue your Chyldren good gyftes, how moch more, royll the father of heauen gyue, yf ye ſhal aſke of hym? Matthew, the <hi>6.</hi> Chapter What mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this, that a chriſtyan man ſaythe. I beleue in god, the father almightie? Tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly nothynge elſe, then I beleue in God, and alſo in god the father, which can do all thynge that he wyll, to whome there is nothynge impoſſible. And it folweth, the maker of heauen and yearth, that is to ſaye, I beleue in god, whiche hath cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ate heauen and yearthe, and all thynge, which eyther is ſene in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or in earth whiche be the ſonne, the Moone, the ſterres innumerable, the Cloudes / the foules, the fyſſhes, and all kynde of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes. And god y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father hath not brought
<pb facs="tcp:9931:44"/>
fourthe the yearthe naked, but garnyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it with greate varyetie of all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, corne, flowers, graſſe, and with dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe kyndes of beaſtes. And we ought not to thynke, that god hath onely once created all theſe thynges, with the word (for he ſayde, and they were made) whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che we ſee as well in heauen, as in earth and ſo leaue in creatyng of thynges, but we ought to prynte this in our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, that yet God dothe create all thynges, in euery momente, of the why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we haue neade of, in thys preſente lyfe, for Chriſt ſayth Ihon the 5. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, my father dothe worke euen at thys tyme, &amp; I alſo. And the C. lxiiij. Pſalm. Thou openynge thy hande, all be fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led wyth plentyfulnes.</p>
               <p>And god dothe not create as yet ſoo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moche, but yet for all that all thoſe thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges, whiche haue bene create frome the begynnynge, he doth dayly encreace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hys power, yea, and alſo kepe with hys worde, and is preſente wyth all thynges that be created, for ſo god makethe the pearthe frutefull: ſendynge rayne frome heauen, and kepeth the frutefulnes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb facs="tcp:9931:44"/>
leaſte thoſe whiche it bryngeth forth, ſhoulde peryſſhe wyth anye tempeſtes, but that it ſhoulde retourne to our vſe, for that thynge that I ſaye of the earth I wyll to be ſpoken alſo of other thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, Saincte Paul ſaithe to the Colloſſians. the 3. Chapter. All thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges ſtande by hym, and in the 2. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Alſo, to the Epheſians, the firſt chap. he doth after the counſels of his wyll. Mat. the 10. Two ſparowes be ſoulde for a farthynge, and one of them falleth not upon the earth, witout the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father. But this article in his kinde, doth require this thinge, that we ſhould beleue in god the father, nowe if euerye man will examine him ſelfe, he ſhal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in hym ſelfe alſo many good thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges that be priuate, for he ſhal perceyue that he is a man indewed with reaſon, &amp; healthful in his body, to haue the power to giue, and to receiue, and to floriſſhe in the quickenes of his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres, &amp; can go hi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther and thither, &amp; hath a perfecte ſighte &amp; can heare very wel, &amp; to get his lyuing But who can reherſe thoſe benefites
<pb facs="tcp:9931:45"/>
whiche floriſſheth often tymes in one maner, I pray the, from whence do they come? forſooth euen from God, which hath created by his almyghtifulneſſe al theſe thinges, and daily doth create, and kepeth thoſe that be created, and gyueth al thinges. Therefore to beleue in God the father is to perſwade with his herte that al which thou haſte, thou haſt them of god. The firſte Epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians the <hi>5.</hi> Chapt. And that god hath for thy cauſe created al thinges, whiche either be in heauen or earth, and dailye doth create. And thou canſt not content thy ſelfe with theſe thinges, but he alſo gentely deliuereth the fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al euils. And doth adioine vnto the his holy Aungels that they may fight for the againſte the aſſaultes of the deuill. And he dothe all theſe thinges, for bicauſe he is thy father by his onely goodnes and mercie, and of none of thy deſeruinges. And thoumaiſt thinke to thy ſelfe that thou ſhalt haue of him all thinges, ſeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

               <p>YE haue harde now welbeloued chyl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren, what god the father is, &amp; what we ought to beleue of him, the voice that he ſente from heauen do declare.

I do not ſygnifye onelye, that I beleue, that Chriſt is the ſonne of god. Mathew the 8. chapter, for that the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyls of hell do beleue, ſaynte Iames, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 2. Chapter.

Thoſe things which truely be ſpoken of Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is Ieſus, for why he maketh ſafe his people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſinnes.
