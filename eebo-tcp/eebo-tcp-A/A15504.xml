            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Good Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Nthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is a great defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, both as it is a great sinne against iustice;
<pb facs="tcp:3228:3"/>
and as it prouokes wrath, whereby such persons are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vp to vile affections. And though thankefulnesse cannot stay in the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but goeth by it to the author, yet it is due to such, by whose hands God conueyes his benefits. It hath pleased that blessed God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to stirre vp your Ladiship for my good: first, in calling mee to be a Minister to your Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable familie, how weake so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer; yet not without some fruit by his blessing, whose power is seene in weakenesse; where, how I was cared for, my conscience doth witnesse: secondly, in your opportunity (preferring publike good,
<pb facs="tcp:3228:3"/>
so were your words) giuing me a free, and comfortable entrance into this charge, wherein I now labour, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my measure. And from that time, I haue beene followed with kindnesse from that house; but that special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refresheth mee to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that for the worke of my Ministerie, your Honour willed mee to count you as my mother. I am bold thus in particular, to propound you for Gods Honour, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, especially to Patrons.</p>
            <p>And finding my selfe so much bound, I haue long thought how besides my prayers, I might by some pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per testimonie, shew my selfe
<pb facs="tcp:3228:4"/>
thankefull to your Ladiship; and resolued at last to write these notes faire, and send them for the helpe of your faith and comfort, in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the continuing, of my true care for your soules good. Hereunto I was the rather inclined, for that I vnderstood, some to haue found helpe (through the mercie of God) to the quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their conscience by the reading of them, when they were in shorter notes of a Sermon: In the meane time, diuerse friendes called vpon mee, for some thing to the Presse, from which the knowledge of mine owne wants hath hitherto kept me,
<pb facs="tcp:3228:4"/>
yet debating it thus; If the matter be profitable: first, it is not likely to bee hurt that way, but more vsefull then by writing: secondly, more fit to some for reading; and to conuey bookes to friends, more commodious then Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies in writing. Here I stucke at this, that good books for this helpe bee not scant; but then I thought againe, that acquaintance being a helpe to make them knowne, all come not to one hand: thi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dly, my desire to leaue testimonie of my faith, on whom I hold: and how, fourthly, that God hath glory of diuersitie of gifts, which manifest the
<pb facs="tcp:3228:5"/>
spirit, giuen to profit withall: fiftly, that my selfe owe to them that haue so aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselues. It yelded, not without feare, I confesse, yet commending it to God for his blessing, and to the loue of my deare friends to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it, it is now out of my hands.</p>
            <p>Good Madam, vse it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other helpes: I once left a little thing with you, to helpe you in examination of your title to Heauen, this may a little further that as being (I thinke) fuller, to that purpose. Calling made sure is a great comfort, and aduantage for a Christian,
<pb facs="tcp:3228:5"/>
many giue testimonie to you: you haue giuen good example in your constant respect of Gods ordinances, glorifie God more with the fruites of your faith and loue; call for the inspirations of the spirit, to be carried earnestly after him, hee purchased a people, to be iealous of good workes: looke into the felicitie of Gods chosen dayly, bee still making it sure in your owne conscience; the end of this life puts Gods people in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of endlesse life. The highest in the earth, haue but terme of life in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent things, how great so euer; and dying out of Christ, are
<pb facs="tcp:3228:6"/>
without end miserable. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they that so trust in Christ, as to haue the Lord for their God: that is to bee knowen in experience by the spirit of Christ, destroying the dominion of sinne, and lading vs, so as that in the course of our life, we are with God, though foyled for our humbling in many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The God of life, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue your life of his good pleasure, for the good of many, that praising God for you, may by their prayers further your grace heere with the exercise of it: the Lord bee with you, your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable sister with hers, all

that belong to you, and guide your hearts into the loue of God, and to looke for his Sonne, the blessed hope from heauen.</p>

               <p>From his punishment for this cause that hee beleeued not the word of God, sent by his messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, we may gather, how prouoking a sinne it is not to beleeue God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. His fault was but in one part of Gods word, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting some doubt about thee fulfilling of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: 1.

at the promise, knowing that God had spoken, he shall speake no words of his owne, till God haue fulfilled his. <hi>Sara</hi> ouercame her doubt, <hi>Heb,</hi> 11.11. by faith she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued power to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue seed, and was deliuered of a child when shee was past age; because shee iudged him, faithful who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, yet laughed at the message of the Angel and is reproued for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12.

I will not feare, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5.6. God will doe that which he hath spoken to me of, <hi>Genes.</hi> 28.15. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> did giue hope to them in the Ship with him in great extremity, <hi>Bee of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, for I beleeue God,</hi>

of sinne and danger.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 1.8.</note> It is a manifest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16, 21. against the first and great commaundement of the Law: which though it doe not directly command faith in Christ, nor reueale the righteousnesse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee are saued, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. yet bindes vs to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to God, in all that hee commands vs; to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer Christ is preached, the commandement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him is giuen, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.29.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.23.</note> They that reuolt after profession of faith, are saide to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement giuen to them. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.10.</note>Secondly, Vnbeliefe is a kinde of blasphemy; it makes God a lyar, which agrees not with his nature, it is impossible to him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. His witnesse is greater then the witnesse of man. Hee that honours a man with cap and knee, yet counts him a vaine ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fellow, doth more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him thereby, then with all the outward signes he honours him: so hee that beleeues not God te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying of his Sonne, that whosoeuer receiues him hath life, what respect soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hee giue him in other things, dishonours more then hee honours him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Vnbeliefe hath in it an odious vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in refusing Christ with his grace so freely offered to euery creature, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. Christ louingly cals euery one that is athirst to come to him, with graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promise that they shall not come in vaine,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.20. 2. Cor. 6.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.37, 38. beseeching men by his seruants in his stead, to be reconciled to God, and not to receiue the grace of God in vaine. Hee waits that hee may haue place in mens hearts, promising

sweete and refreshing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity to any that heares his voyce and opens vnto him, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.20. He puts none away that come to him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.37. God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulates with men, why they will die, seeing life is so freely offered them, <hi>Eze.</hi> 18.31. lamenting their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and losse in refusing him. Therefore whether it bee of sottish negligence, or of obstinate rebellion, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable vnthankfulnesse to reiect him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Vnbeliefe holds a man in the power of sinne, in an vniuersall pollution of nature: the seate of it is an euill heart,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3228:15"/>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. a heart full of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill affections; so it robbes God of that inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which faith purifying the heart sets vp and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, it is ioyned with loue, a pure heart and a good conscience, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>No true inward worship can be performed without faith, as may appeare by considering all the parts of it.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Confidence in God (whereby wee rowle our selues vpon him for all needfull good, and to bee helpt and defended against all hurtfull euill,<note place="margin">Psal. 112.7.</note> so as not to bee afraide at any euill

               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:3228:16"/>That a man may stay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, hee must know that hee is his God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the care of his safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the charge of his happines to belong to him, being both able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to helpe him; which necessarily requires faith in Christ, that hee may haue right to that couenant, <hi>I will bee thy God.</hi> So know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom hee hath belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he with quietnesse and confidence commits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to him, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p>Diffidence, and thereby feare are found in godly men, and that in good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by defect of faith: much

more in them that haue no faith, whose hearts by the sound of feare are mooued as the trees of the forrest by the winde, <hi>Esay</hi> 7.2. or are hardned against threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, by flatterie, trust in lying words, making false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood their refuge.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Loue of God (whereby we are mooued towards him, and cleaue to him, as soueraignely good in himselfe; 2. the authour and maintainer of all our good had or hoped for; 3. and for him doe loue such persons and things as hee hath commended to our loue; 4. giue our selues to him to bee at his will,

                  </note> 1. In such the loue of God is not. 2. Gods loue preuents vs, and mooues ours. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.19. 3.

The vnbeleeuer is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1.21.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Feare of God (whereby we sanctifie him in our hearts; stand in awe of him &amp; his word; hate to sin against him, euen where no eye but his can take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of vs; giue our selues to good duties with strife to doe them,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>The vnbeleeuer either contemnes God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it by lewdnesse in his waies, <hi>Prou.</hi> 14.2. Or if he feare, it is either penall <hi>Esa.</hi> 33.14. like the diuells trembling; or meere seruile, to be a bridle, to work some ciuility, the chiefe obiect of it is euill of punishment. The feare of the belieuer, is ingenuous, voluntary, with confidence, and ioy, the chiefe obiect of it is euill of sinne, not his owne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse but Gods offence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Obedience
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3228:18"/>
(a voluntary subiection of minde and heart to God, to hearken to, and to doe his will, after that manner, and to that end which hee appoints) is not in an vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer; whose wisedome is enmitie against God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. He is a seruant of sinne, addicted to the wils of the flesh and minde, to fulfill them, not subiect to God nor can be.</p>
               <p>Faith is the Mother of obedience, by it wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the spirit, renewing our nature vnto delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some agreement with Gods Law, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.3.4. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs by Gods mercies, impelling vs by the loue of

so neither for temporall freely, feelingly, with loue of the duty, with tast of Gods loue and delight in him. As a iudge that feasts a malefactor by the way, who feares his hanging at a place appointed, gets but heartlesse thanks of him: so God for his bounty to an vnbeleeuer, who still feares that he will destroy him after he hath done him good.</p>
               <p>Vnbeleefe disables a man to euery good worke, the branch brings not forth but in the vine without Christ, or not being in him we can doe nothing, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.4.5. The worke can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                  <p>The historicall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie faith, may bee in

reprobates, as it was in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persmith, and such as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene illuminated and tasted the word of God, fall totally and for euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Iustifying, or faith properly so called, is onely in the elect: the seate of that is onely the minde that assents to the truth and goodnes of the word. This is in the heart, receiuing Christ with his blessing, staying vpon him with affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of heart for our whole felicitie.</p>
                  <p>The temporarie faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues neither what should bee receiued, nor as it should, nor is effectuall in

giuing out, as the sauing doth, by diuine vertue. Faith which is onely histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, receiueth not Christ vnto vnion and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: what it receiueth is neuer with an honest heart, it purifieth not the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>Faith properly so called, receiueth Christ vnto vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the beleeuer. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.56. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.30. it receiues in Christ the gift of righteousnesse vnto iustification of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.17. reconciliation and safety from wrath for euer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. adoption, to bee children of God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.12.</note> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires with Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.

                  <p>Secondly, It workes towards God, according to the strength and measure of it,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> a quiet state of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.25.</note> agreement of the new nature with Gods law vnto delight in it, consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>Fourthly, Towards faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full brethren, coniunction of soules and communion of gifts spirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,<note place="margin">Act. 4.32.</note> with a brotherly

                  <p>Fiftly, against the deuill, resistance, standing, victory, by the power of the Lords might. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For parts of nature, temporary faith hath but two which the spirit workes; knowledge, and appobation vnto some ioy in the word receiued: faith properly so called hath both them &amp; an other as an essential degree aboue the other; which distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth it from the other in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3228:44"/>
kinde, as sense distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the life of beasts from that of plants, that haue vegetatiue life but not sensitiue; and reason the life of men from that of beasts, which haue sense common with man but not reason. And this part of faith which so formally &amp; essentially differenceth it is application, or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of Christ and the promise of mercie in him, which is called receiuing of Christ, and drinking his flesh and blood, putting him on: by this Christ dwels, and liueth in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer, ioyning him so to the Lord that he is one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3228:45"/>
with him. For want of this, the temporizer is an vnbeleeuer, in respect of true faith, a hidden infidel, such as Christ would not commit himself vnto.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.64.</note> 
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.24.</p>
                  <p>Yet they are said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue by reason of some materialls of faith: 2. for similitude in a chearefull profession of that Gospell: 3. In regard of some subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the word which open infidels cast away, yet differs from faith properly so called, as hypocritical from sincere, dead from liuely, generall from spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, ineffectuall from effectuall, and transitory from abiding.</p>

                  <p>By the light of God in their minde they see the kingdome of Christ to bee glorious, heauenly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue this world; which many thought but earthly: they see their state for whom it is prepared to bee full of happinesse, Gods loue and good will therein of great admiration: they perceiue a possibility of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this happinesse,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3228:46"/>
which knowledge for the time delights them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue sinne to be full of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable vexation, know and feare a painefull sting in death, and hearing of a free and full deliuerance from these euils by Christ, they in some sort for a time sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselues to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, forsake them which are wrapped in error, cease concerning act many grosse sinnes, and do many things commanded, and so are receiued in the charity of the Church as members: by which vanishing taste temporary and partiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, with some

                  <p>Thirdly, The spirit of God makes no preswasion of Gods loue to them, nor euer giues life to the seed which in sowing fel in such ground. It is saide to spring vp as corne in stonie ground or sowen among thornes that choke it, but it neuer is brought forward to that which God works in them whom he calls of his purpose. They are said
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3228:47"/>
onely to seeme to haue. Hence it is that they doe not so much (setledly) as purpose, desire, &amp; indeuour to get that faith which is proper to the elect: 2. or striue (of conscience of the commandements) against doubts and feares to giue glory to God by beleeuing: 3. they are not iealous of the deceiuablenesse of their heart, they try not their state, with loue to be true, and to know they are of the truth.</p>
                  <p>It is with them as with a man admitted into a rome, where a table is furnished with delicates (for some chosen guests) to see &amp; tast

                  <p>The true belieuer tasts the loue of God to him as a chosen guest in the delicats prouided for him, &amp; by that taste is carried in desire to grow vp more in the grace that reioyceth him, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Christ for that rest and sweetnesse he finds in in him,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.2.</note> and comes with indeuour more and more to him,<note place="margin">1.

he is a Sauiour.

implicite in respect of cleare knowledge of Gods fauour, euen after many yeeres soberly spent in Gods seruice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Faith is for a time but in seed, not able to quiet the heart in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods loue, yet the reigne of vnbeleefe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed: he that was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of, or auerse from faith, now wills, loues, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, labours to beleeue: the grace giuen hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed him to follow after it according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Follow after faith.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.11. <hi>The will is Gods worke.

                  <p>Thirdly, Lusting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the flesh argueth the presence and working of Gods spirit; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. in that the will of the flesh is not fulfilled but hindered.

receiue some common graces which God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes to the producing of some good works for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but he neuer renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fountaines of actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the minde will, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the worke proues in Gods sight corrupt by the disposition of the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and no mixture of true goodnesse in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, as there is none in in the instrument. They are as clouds without water, like comely members of a bodie that want a head to giue them life. God leads the beleeuers by his spirit into good workes, by gouerning the gracious
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3228:56"/>
habites infused, the godly nature into holy acts, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and corrupted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by the flesh concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the operations of grace in the same worke, that the best worke needs the sacrifice of Christ to make it accepted, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt mixture pardoned. Yet their is some true goodnesse in it, and it is properly a good worke, by the production of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit exercising faith, hope, loue, zeale, feare of God, humility, and other graces.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, True righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is a begun obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to al the Law of God, by the seed of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3228:57"/>
in the beleeuer wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee sinnes not, as the vnbeleeuer, nor can sinne. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9. As disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was punisht with losse of originall righteousnesse, and vniuersal corruption of nature that man had all sin in seed: so by faith in Christ discharged of guilt thereof God giues againe originall iustice and all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in seed that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Christians. A little child shall lead him. <hi>Esay.</hi> 11.6. because of his new creation and disposition to keepe Gods law which God hath put in his heart.</p>
                  <p>False righteousnesse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deliuers vp a man to a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3228:57"/>
full rule, and conscience of seueritie of right liuing; it giueth not strife thereunto, it is with percialitie, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation either for persons, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.44. times, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.34.36. or things, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.26. True righteousnes hath something singular, false righteousnesse is euer with reigning sinne: of which after.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, True righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is done to God in honour and obedience, to please and glorifie him, to adorne his doctrine, to iustifie profession, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare vnbeleeuers, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and prouoke belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers by good example: in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3228:58"/>
conscience of which the soule rests, when carnall men traduce the beleeuer and impute his worke sometime to madnesse, when it transcends their capacitie, sometimes to some peruerse affection, or bad counsells of heart. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. Thou hast fully knowen my manner of liuing, purpose &amp;c. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13.14.</p>
                  <p>False righteousnesse, as its not wrought in God, so it is not done to him, but bends back vpon a mans selfe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5.6. either to auoid punishment, and get reward, it is seruile, and mercenarie, or to get
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3228:58"/>
praise, to be counted an honest man, fit to liue in a societie. To doe all in the name of Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. that God in all things may be glorified, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. in ministring as of the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie that God ministereth,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.11.</note> is of grace. It is the true loue of God that carrieth the heart in intention to God. To a good worke is required power, loue, and a sound minde which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians receiue in measure. Loue is counted the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the law,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.8.</note> it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and directs the workes of the beleeuer to God in Christ, to whom he liues as the Lord of his life and

death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.8. Men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuerted are turned so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.21.</note> that they cannot spiritually loue him. It may be as the God of nature, and author of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, which they seeke to haue and receiue, they loue him for their aduantage: but not as he is in himselfe soueraignely good, nor as they beleeue his loue to them in Christ. They may doe something not onely for temporall blessings, as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iehu,</hi> but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to eternall life as the young ruler that was so rich, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.16. but liue not to magnifie Christ in their bodies which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

                  <p>There change is the gift of some common graces, which Christ, as Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes vpon them, but he neuer giues life to them as members of his body whereof he is head. They are made partakers of the holy Ghost, in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior working, but are not made new creatures, nor
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3228:60"/>
receiue grace accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing saluation, as appeares by the opposition of these two, Their works proceede not from one and the same principle internall:<note place="margin">Heb. 6.4, 5, 6, 9.</note> the true beleeuers proceede from the new creature, faith working by loue, from the life of the spirit, which the other haue not. Consider a little the difference of the worke of God in the fountaines of action.</p>
                  <p>First, the minde of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizer is not holy, though it be inlightened to know and acknowledg the truth. It is peculiar to beleeuers to be renewed in minde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the image of God: <hi>Col.</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:3228:60"/>
3.12. They that beleeue not, haue mindes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences still defiled and not healed with the vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him that is holy.</p>
                  <p>Which may appeare: 1. in that his knowledge of truth is not rooted in him, in time of temptation hee goeth away, and his light vanisheth; so as that a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darknesse commeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.

For degree the deuill was said to be cast out, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possesseth them againe; so it is worse with them then before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:3228:61"/>Secondly, There minde not being sanctified,<note place="margin">Col. 2.20.</note> they soone are puft vp in their minde vnto vaine reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which beget a false o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: which hauing stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for, they hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake. They sometime fancy a lie which seemes wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to them to follow, though they send to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of God, as seeming to offer their minds to his direction to know what is best to doe. <hi>Ier.</hi> 42.3.5.20. Surely ye dissembled, you were fully minded to go into Egypt whatsoeuer the Lord should say. They haue an inclination to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnes, and meeting
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3228:61"/>
with deceiuers, are easily carried away, and that by the iust iudgement of God, whose the deceiuer and deceiued be, <hi>Iob.</hi> 12.16. and makes the punishment of the master as the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Scholar. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In that their knowledge is ineffectuall, they know not as they ought to know. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. Not for their owne vse, which yet is required, <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.27. Not what first and principally, what more earnestly to follow. It leaues them ignorant of themselues, so as they think themselues to be some
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3228:62"/>
thing, when they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, are puft vp, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly, censorious not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards fraile man, but sometimes towards God himselfe, as, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. <hi>verse</hi> 14. Their light shineth not effectually into their conscience, and so as to guid them, it is denied therefore the account of knowledge for the liueles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.4.9.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, their thoughts and deuises declare the fleshlinesse of their mindes, that which riseth naturally as the fruite of their minde is as an ill fauour out of a sinke, they minde things of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3228:62"/>
the flesh, and when they take counsell and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, it hath the same sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with the roote, when they rowle some good thing in their heads, they corrupt and defile it, the diuell also whose power is yet in their minde, puts ill thoughts into them, as his first borne, and his breath to blow vp the fire of flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lusts, vnto which they so attend, as they forget God, his properties, works and wayes, and walke in the sparkes of their fire that they haue kindled, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.11.</p>
                  <p>But the true beleeuer is not so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:3228:63"/>First his knowledge is an abiding light, shining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly till hee come to life, called for that the light of life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.12. He is taught of God, so as hee declines not from his statutes. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119, 102. Because he taught him, hee cannot beleeue otherwise then hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, though false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers confirme their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with signes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>Matthew</hi> 24.24. They will not heare a stranger, specially in fundamentall doctrine, they know not his voyce, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.8. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.4. They know by an holy annointing abiding in them the truth, and that no lye
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3228:63"/>
is of the truth, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27. and discerne the particular lye, vsing such meanes and helps as God affords them. They be tempted &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the temptation, but are alwayes with God, and ouercome the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and returne to their minde with confirmation, knowing whom they haue beleeued, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.2, 23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though they may erre in many things because sight is not perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at once, it is with some darkenesse as it were in the dawning betweene light and darkenesse, yet not in full darkenesse true light
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3228:64"/>
hath shined to them, and they see though with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fancies, as hee who at the first touch of his eyes saw men walke,<note place="margin">Mark. 8.24,</note> but as trees, not in their perfect lineaments till Christ set to the cure againe, then he saw cleerely; hence comes such diuersitie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among learned and good men: yet truth bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propounded to them and defended by others, they haue a gracious apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to yeeld to it when they see it. <hi>Esay</hi> 11.6. A little child shall leade them. <hi>Iames</hi> 3.17. The wisedome from aboue is tractable; they offer sincerely their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3228:64"/>
emptied minds vnto Christ that he may fill them with a frame of truth: so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the wisedome of the flesh, they allow their wits no liberty but in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The eare tastes words as the palate doth meate, <hi>Iob</hi> 12.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37, 38. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies in the Church mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the approoued. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. As Aegles to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case, by proper sagacity, so are they gathered to the truth concerning Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.37.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is effectuall, life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is begun, continued, and consummate in it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.8.12. For Gods tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3228:65"/>
is such as the effect followes. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.45. <hi>Euery man that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, commeth to mee.</hi> These are together, 1. knowledge of him, 2. beeing in him, 3. loue of him, 4. and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his word, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.3, 5. They by this light see God, specially as hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.18, 19. They see themselues in the very secret cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their hearts for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, contrarietie to Gods law inwardly; whence hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of good and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of euill comes, admire the rich and abounding loue and grace of God
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3228:65"/>
in Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. confessing their owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse,<note place="margin">Iob 9.3.20.</note> haue meane thoughts of themselues, compared to God, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Saints: and shew by good conuersation their workes in meekenesse of wisedome.<note place="margin">Iam. 3.13.</note> They be called the meeke of the earth,<note place="margin">Zeph. 2.3.</note> that doe Gods iudgements.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The thoughts of the iust are right,</hi> Prou. 12.5. their renued minde giueth disposition thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and they are as fruits brought forth to God by the vertue of Christ; speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as the spirit breaths obedience, and gouernes them to deuise good things
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3228:66"/>
                     <hi>Isaiah</hi> 32.8. They not onely haue a good trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in their hearts, whence good thoughts are brought forth, but they forme their thoughts vnto good min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with studie and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thought how to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, pray for pleasing meditations, and labour to keepe their thoughts in an order, to serue God with their thought.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a temporizer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you consider quiet, or troubled, differs much from the beleeuers, in the execution of the function; because the beleeuer hath some holinesse restored to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3228:66"/>
his conscience, which none can haue but in Christ, who haue learned him, and haue beene taught as the truth is in Christ Iesus, to put off the old man, and to put on the newe, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.22.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The cause of quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. 2. the effects. 3. the continuance, difference it.</p>
                  <p>First, The quietnesse of an vnbeleeuer, or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues not, (so as it may properly bee called faith) is vpon mistaken grounds, as that his faith giues him right in the Couenant which God hath made to all that truely receiue Christ, whose merit is the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3228:67"/>
foundation of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it is infalliblie true in the proposition, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hath his Sonne hath life,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.12.</note> to as many as receiued him he gaue this dignity, to be the children of God, but it is false in the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I beleeue in Christ and receiue him. So in the point of sanctification, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with shew, when he hath not the truth, he rests vpon the promise made to the sanctified, but falsely assumed to him: as before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Or it is by a wilfull presumption of finding God peaceable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him,<note place="margin">Deut. 29.19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ier. 7.8,</note> against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse words of the curse,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3228:67"/>
trusting in a lying word, wherein sometimes they are strengthened by false teachers, that giue life to them that should not liue.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Or by not stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of corruptions, slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering in error without sense. By ignorance of the law I was a liue without the law, but when the commandement came sin reuiued, and I died.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.9.11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By earthing themselues, as it were in a caue of forgetfulnesse of God, and their own estate; diuerting their thoughts to other things, not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he remembers all their sinnes and that they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3228:68"/>
shall come to iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Oppressing their conscience with false rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings they take euill for good, good for euill, &amp; lye vnder the woe denounced against it without feare.</p>
                  <p>Secondly it giues no true comfort in God as recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, no delight in him <hi>Iob.</hi> 27.10. it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed vnto that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse which was lost, holds not to vniuersall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but suffers to liue in some sinne knowen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencelesly, it witnes not, nor holds a man vnto, right manner and end of actions with due circumstances, but onely excuseth the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3228:68"/>
worke done, as <hi>Iehu</hi> did when he said to <hi>Iehonadab</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Rachab</hi> come with me and see the zeale that I haue for the Lord.<note place="margin">2. King. 10.16.</note> He was caried with a great will to the fact, but not with pure intention, but to make himselfe sure of the kingdome: as the young mans conscience witnessed,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.21.</note> all these haue I kept; when for right manner and end he had kept none of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The peace it hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth not. When God enterrupteth his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, opening his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to notice his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of iniquitie, in the midst of laughter the heart is sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3228:69"/>
and like <hi>Balteshar</hi> at the fight of a hand writing vpon the wall he is filled with terror,<note place="margin">Dan. 5.6.</note> and his false confidence destroied, there shall be only feare to make them vnderstand the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Esa.</hi> 28.19.</p>
                  <p>First, The quietnesse of a true beleeuers conscience is caused by resting on Christ, to the sprinkling of it with his blood, as the blood of attonement for all his sinnes;<note place="margin">Rom. 5.9, 10.</note> so particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for those that doe speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lye vpon the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, both for present peace with God, and safety from wrath for euer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, through Christs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3228:69"/>
and intercession, appearing in heauen for him.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.33, 34, 35.</note> It is also strengthed by experience of Gods good will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 41.11, 12. and by euidence of sanctification, in the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the root of all sinnes by degrees, lessening the force and fruits of sinne, in the life of the spirit gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the soul by exercise of holy graces planted in it, to bring glory to the name of God by good workes and labours of loue, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19. with faith of Christian liberty, and particularly of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the rigor of the law, that God accepts in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3228:70"/>
Christ a begun obedience though it be imperfect.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For effects, it works comfort in God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in him because of the attonement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. free enterance into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with our lawful suits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. with a holy shame for sinnes though forgiuen, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.63. witnessing the loue of Christ to vs, it holds to his word, to liue no more to our selues but to him;<note place="margin">Act. 24.16.</note> it hath the authoritie of God in such respect that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any knowne law cast it out with despising the commandement,<note place="margin">Psal. 18.22.</note> giuen to vs though in lesser matters:<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.9.</note>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:3228:70"/>
&amp; therfore makes vs striue against sinne and maintaine a close fight with it, and not onely holds vs to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile of soule for inward mortification, but to hold on in good duties when wee suffer euill for the Lords sake. It encourageth in wel-doing not onely for matter, but for intention, against imputations of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie and vanitie. <hi>Iob.</hi> 27.4.5.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. The peace it giues keeps the minde and heart in Christ Iesus. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For continuance, it is a neuer failing feast; it may be interrupted, by desertion, temptation, falls,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3228:71"/>
but it remaines in cause, and returnes at length. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.9. The troubled conscience of the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or vaine beleeuer, and the troubled conscience of a true, though not perfect beleeuer are differenced in cause, measure and effects.</p>
                  <p>First, The vaine belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers trouble is of the spirit of bondage causing feare and disquietnesse. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. He is amazed at his owne brutishnesse rebuked for sin, whereof the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is witnesse, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension onely of misery following it. <hi>Prou.</hi> 5.12.13.14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For measure,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3228:71"/>
the conscience of an vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer accuseth too sorely, hiding away the Gospell; and so without hope, greife wholly possesseth the hart, without strife against it, as sinfull; vrgeth not to faith and repentance truely: hee affects deliuerance and sometimes complaines of God for the greatnesse of his punishment, as they doe in hell, with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gnashing their teeth, despairing vtterly as <hi>Iudas.</hi> For the spirit hauing ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their conscience to see their sins and Gods wrath, with sense of guiltienesse, leaues them in terrors, and mooues them not to go to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3228:72"/>
Christ. So through their own corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they bring forth desperate sorrow, a fearefull effect of their desperate sinning, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere such as exhort them to repentance, <hi>There is no hope, I haue loued stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and them will I follow; Ier.</hi> 2.25. to whom God may iustly say this shall ye haue at my hands, <hi>yee shall lye down in sorrow. Esa.</hi> 50.11.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it makes a man shunne God, as <hi>Adam</hi> vpon his fall, as the deuils did Christ as their tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, it makes a man flee the stroke of the word in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ministerie, it hates
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3228:72"/>
the light <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.20. as <hi>Ahab</hi> said of <hi>Michaiah,</hi> whom he confessed a prophet of the Lord, <hi>I hate him,</hi> as <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, The troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the true beleeuer is from the Spirit of grace sanctifying the conscience vnto some rightnesse, in performing this function, in accusing and disquieting to his good, though not without some mixture of the flesh, it troubles for sinne, as of enmitie against God, offensiue to him, and causing wrath, whereby the sinner is detestable to himselfe, doing things so vnworthy. He cannot liue
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3228:73"/>
vnder Gods displeasure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for measure, this vnquietnesse is not full, because hee is not without some measure of faith in Christ, to the purging of his conscience from guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and filthines of sinne; though, it may be, he seeth no faith in his owne heart. His conscience telleth him hee ought to beleeue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he valueth faith high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and seekes it of God constantly, with mourning for his vnbeleefe; he calles vpon his heart to trust in God, as not without hope, though languishing, not without loue whereby hee
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3228:73"/>
cleaues to God, seeking his fauour and the light of his countenance, specially, be he in prosperity or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly for effects, it makes the beleeuer to beare punishment vpon him, whether from God, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.28, 29. putting his mouth in the dust, hee opens not his mouth against God, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.63. It maketh him to feare sin to come, and suffers him not to continue in knowne sinnes, it workes him to readinesse to forgiue men, because hee needes pardon and seekes it. He welcomes the ministerie, wounding
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3228:74"/>
and healing, and striueth to remember God in his waies, promising with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of heart to sing ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Gods righteousnesse, when he opens his mouth. Or from men: of which after; whether from law and iustice, or from wrong dealing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the will of an vnbeleeuer (of which a worke is specially good or bad, and so accounted of God) is not made free from spirituall bondage: a man is counted good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of his will. It is the comfort of a strong christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that he findes the worke of God in his will for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3228:74"/>
to doe that which God requires, with present and working will, not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ineffectuall.</p>
                  <p>The new heart is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to them whom God hath receiued in Christ. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.26. To haue the stonie heart taken away and to receiue a heart of flesh. Godly desires are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to godly men who are carried by Gods Spirit, which they alledge to him as his owne worke, who giues to will, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 1.11. <hi>Esay</hi> 20.8. graciously hearing and fulfilling them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Prou.</hi> 10.24. It qualifieth a worke vnto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation and reward, that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3228:75"/>
it was not onely done, but willed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10.</p>
                  <p>Men not in Christ by a true faith, are said to be dead in sinne and their works dead, their Will is not free then to any spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall work, death depriues not onely of action but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie.</p>
                  <p>They are said to serue sinne, if their will be in a full bondage they are not free, all that are not freed by Christ remaine in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bondage to sinne, they must be in him whom he freeth, and that is by a true faith; they are gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the prouidence to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3228:75"/>
some workes that are good for their matter, but in them they are intrinsecally guilty, they haue no will to obey &amp; honour the Lord, therein they proceed not from an inward frame of goodnesse, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of heart to Gods law, their will is worse then their deed, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Gospell, but not with an honest heart, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it selfe, but with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt respect.</p>
                  <p>They forbeare some sins but not for loue of God, and that they haue chosen Gods law, whereof sin is a violation, their will is not turned against it out of any
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3228:76"/>
inherent holines contrary to it, but as contemned by light of the minde as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull for one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth true religion, or some way daungerous, as appeares by their partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the law. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                  <p>The true beleeuer is by the spirit of Ghrist in part, truely and for euer freed in his will from the spirituall bondage and seruitude of corruption, and his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is brought forward by degrees. The change is by a supernaturall worke, as if a stone which a hundred times forced vpward falls downe againe should haue a new inclination put into
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3228:76"/>
it, the change were aboue nature. But now the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is naturall, so in this worke of God in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the stonie heart and giuing the will a new inclination, the diuine power hauing made this alteration by infusion of grace and holinesse into it; the action of it, in willing to belieue to be iustified, to be healed in nature of the sinfulnesse perceiued, to be quickened vnto good workes, to doe them more spiritually, is naturall and free, by reason of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature.</p>

                  <p>For motiues. As the strife is betweene a fleshly mind, and sensualitie, that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the conscience, that the thing to be done is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, and against ciuill behauiour, this wilfully eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him on to satisfie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate humour: So the arguments to hold backe the will from consenting to the act, are taken from

Thus Christian rigteousnesse is noted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8.9. <hi>The scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of thy kingdome is a scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of righteousnesse, thou hast loued righteousnesse and hated iniquitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which moues strife against sin in the beleeuer is the will of the spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the will of the flesh, with loue to God, to Christ, to Gods law, by the inherent holinesse agreeing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3228:90"/>
with Gods Law, so the commandement is not greiuous, but obedience to it is chearfull and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, thereby it setts it selfe against the corruption of it self:<note place="margin">Psal. 119.161.</note> thus <hi>Dauid, I haue refrained my feet from euery euill way that I may keepe thy word,</hi> the strife was from the loue of the word of God, and so from the loue of God to obey and please him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer though he escape for some time the filthinesse of the world, he is intangled againe and ouercome, and come vnder a stronger bondage then before, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated

                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:3228:91"/>They by the allurement of temptations may sinne sometime against their light and conscience, as <hi>Dauid</hi> by violence of lust, captiued of the flesh as got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the power of it in that particular, the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence brought a-sleep, the soule doting for a time vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deuise of the flesh, and a while lieth in a kinde of liking of the sinfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning the carnall part in the soule: now grace is driuen as it were from her station, and lyeth in weak and disseuered de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, yet without purpose to continue in and heape vp sin. But God will send

new succour from heauen to ioyne to that weak grace remaining: then conscience awakes, the will is excited, downe goeth the power of the flesh, the heart is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned to Christ.

As frequent acts of vertue strengthen the habite: so by more acts contrary to it, it is weakened. Yet thus may it fall out in this strife of flesh and spirit: the diuell though resisted flees from vs, yet will returne againe with new assaults, and not alwaies tempt to other sins but many times to the selfe same that we haue repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if God see it good to leaue vs and not confirme our wills in the strife.

                  <p>As in anger grace giues an inclination against the inordination of it, yet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasions it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, it was mortified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question in <hi>Dauid,</hi> as other sinnes in root; yet find how <hi>Nabals</hi> churlishnesse

was confirmed by the answer of <hi>Elias</hi> prayer, that the Lord, hee is God. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.37, 38. <hi>Dauid</hi> gathers Gods approbation of him, and his loue to him by receiuing, and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.17, 18, 19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.1.2. and so calles his soule to rest. <hi>verse</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>Some vpon their hauing answere, that their prayer was heard, and the effect should follow, haue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped in thankefulnesse, before they saw it come so to passe, as was promised. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20.18, 19.</p>
                  <p>The example of one heard in his prayer, addes
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3228:102"/>
to the hope of godly men, that they shall not seeke him in vaine. <hi>Psalme</hi> 32.6.34.5, 6. He hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs in vaine to seeke him. <hi>Esay</hi> 45.19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the spirit makes requests which wee cannot expresse, but God knoweth the meaning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Rom.</hi> 18.26. So may it giue answere, whereto, through anguish of spirit wee little attend: as <hi>Exodus</hi> 6.9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, though God answere the prayers of his seruants, when it is onely in their purpose, before they pray, perceiuing that they will aske. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Esay</hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:3228:102"/>
65.24. Sometimes while they are speaking. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.21. Or vpon the ending of their prayer. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.11. Hee holdes some longer, sometimes many yeeres in suspence, yet answeres, when his glory shines most in the grant. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.13. He will take notice of men praying. <hi>Ananias</hi> must to <hi>Paul,</hi> and giue him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for behold hee pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.11.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Numb. 12.13, 14.</note> hee deferres vs sometime for our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, wee are not low enough yet, for his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of vs. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12.13. Hee prayed, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himselfe greatly, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3228:103"/>
prayed, and God was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, or to prooue vs. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2. Wicked men will not attend long, but quarrell with God for not answering; and leaue off praying. <hi>Mala.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Esay</hi> 58.3. Godly men feele strife of flesh. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.8.24. Yet the spirit that wrought, doeth maintaine the desire, and vpholdes the soule in the strife, and thus makes the victory of faith recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense the deferring of our desire, as in the woman of <hi>Syrophoenissa,</hi> who striuing with three great lets: Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which the flesh might interpret a negatiue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3228:103"/>
Particularitie, <hi>I am not sent but to,</hi> &amp;c. third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Vnworthinesse, called a <hi>dogge,</hi> vnmeete for the <hi>childrens bread</hi>: held her faith, vnto her great praise, obtained her desire, to her great comfort. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iacob</hi> was deferred, yet would not cease wrestling, till hee had the blessing, there God spake with vs, <hi>He obtained</hi>; so shall wee, vsing like faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie in our striuing with God in prayer. <hi>Hos.</hi> 12.4. God that requires vnwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riednesse, and will heare his crying day and night, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1, 7. doeth in stead of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3228:104"/>
present answere, glorifie himselfe by his supporting grace. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8.9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he sits vs vnto due estimation of his gift, and care to hold that fast, which wee came so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he hath put to euery worke a conuenient time, which wee are no fit iudges of. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.4. Mine houre is not yet come. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent measures of grace, are giuen at diuerse times. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.36. Now thou canst not, thou shalt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after follow me.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, sometimes it may be, it is because wee aske amisse either in our end.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:3228:104"/>
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 4.3. Or that wee are amisse, in not ioyning indeauours: we are to pray in the spirit, but with all to build vp our selues. <hi>Iud.</hi> 20. Wee must pray in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but we arme our selues also, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.11.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs, that wee haue the grace of prayer, though our desired answere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not, it is a signe of a gracious estate. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. The spirit of prayer, is the spirit of adoption, and makes requests for the Saints. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.27. Such prayer as a good worke, furthers our account in the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3228:105"/>
day of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 6.6. If wee know hee heares vs, wee know wee haue the petitions, that wee aske of him. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.15. God will accept of no other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in prayer,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.18. 2 Tim. 4.22.</note> but that which the spirit ioyns with making our voyce to bee heard aboue, in prayer: that is alway needefull; the Lord bee with thy spirit. In all worshippe of God, priuate or publike, God seekes such as worship him in spirit and trueth; <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.23. in their spirit sanctified and gouerned by his.</p>

                  <p>First the holy spirit as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists no man in this life in any good worke so as to free it wholly from mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sinne, when we would do good euill is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with vs. In praier,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3228:106"/>
God, and the deuill taking aduantage of our carnalitie will hinder vs what he can in a worke so much against his kingdome, we are apt to be tyed to things by our senses, from which diuine things being so farre remooued, we cannot without much watching and trauaile of soule stay our spirits vpon them long.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A godly man hauing much of the flesh in him is sometimes onely sensible of the operations of it when yet the spirituall part is willing to doe the worke according to God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.8.</note> Gods breathing in vs is at
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3228:106"/>
his liberty, and no more to be let then the wind, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time wee feel motion but we know not whence it comes, because we suspect the flesh. There be helpes to know when it is of God.</p>
                  <p>First, When with vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse we propound to our selues the seruice of God in praier, and with strife of heart labour to worship him with our faith, trust, hope, reuerence, humilitie of heart, bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our want herein.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when at other times we are conscionable of our doing Gods will, as
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3228:107"/>
we are in praier desirous that he should doe ours. <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.18.19. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.31. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.12. That praier which is out of a good conscience with strife to go forward in duty, though farre of it, is of Gods spirit who makes requests for them whom he hath san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When wee are brought into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with loue and desire, our prayer not merely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by necessitie, but an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of our filiall affection to God, who inspires in the weakest motion of faith, teacheth to go, and holds
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3228:107"/>
by the armes such as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, with some pleasure in it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When we can deny our owne wills, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to vnderstand Gods, content in our heart that it be done whatsoeuer be to vs denied of that we desire, desiring that the creature may be for the creator, that his name may bee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in all that wee are taught to pray for, things, or persons, though we be not profited thereby, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the power, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be his.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, When we seeke
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3228:108"/>
spirituall things specially, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. they that minde the things of the spirit are after the spirit. It is of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life that wee seeke and affect not things on earth but things in heauen <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1.2.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, When not for our selues and ours onely, but for all that we are to pray for, friends and enemies in a due order, specially for Saints, and persons chiefe in place and power for Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, When such desires are setled, so as wee neither forsake them nor change them for others,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3228:108"/>
knowing that they be after the will of God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.4. One thing haue I desired of the Lord which I will require, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of my life, that I may behold the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Lord. Naturall motion is not so: it is not hard to make the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, betweene it and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall motion, by that which hath beene said of the signes of it.</p>
                  <p>For varying: 1. Our Sauiour giues example, when the matter is one, to make no scruple of varying words. God delights not
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3228:109"/>
in varietie of words, that which he lookes to, is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, the desires and groanes of heart, whether we can expresse them or no, being after his will: as in singing, the melody that pleaseth the Lord is that in the heart.<note place="margin">Col. 3.16.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Forme of wholesome words is profitable, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered according to inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red word, in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherin matter of our requests is contained either expressed or by iust colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, inuention, memory, affection, may be helped so.</p>
                  <p>If formes were vnlawful ny way as limiting the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:3228:109"/>
spirit, then the prescribed formes, by God appointed to be vsed, and chosen, yea commanded some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in the words to bee done in extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of praise, as: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 20.6.</p>
                  <p>As he that praieth by another mans mouth prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well, though he be kept therein to the forme deuised according to the will of God for matter to be asked: so may the forme written, informe him for matter sometimes more then his owne heart, and worke instantly with the apprehension, true feeling
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3228:110"/>
of it, and desire, by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whose work is specially inward.</p>
                  <p>Occasions being diuerse, God reuealing other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will surely inable you to make knowen your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, at least to looke to him, as a sicke child to his father, whose desires it may be the father knowes not, nor can satisfie. Our heauenly Father is full in both, this ability may be in a man, like the money he hath about him, which he knowes not of, till neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity makes him search, and is glad to find.</p>
                  <p>It is good to meditate
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3228:110"/>
of matter needfull before we pray, and to lift our heart to God, to teach vs to aske what wee ought, who know not of our selues: and to giue what he knowes we ought to haue asked.</p>

                  <p>First, calling is indeede a selection of men from the World, vnto Christ and his Kingdome. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.19.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cautions.</hi> First, the heart must bee watcht ouer, that it bee not weighed downe with the cares of the World, not the Word bee choaked. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, earthly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment must bee season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, not shutting out spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall opportunitie. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18, 21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it must not bee seruice of worldly lust, but of God requiring in our

                  <p>Secondly, It is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to take content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in good things gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of God to vs and our familie: we may tast him sweete in his blessings and reioyce, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.11.

                  <p>First, Nature feares things hurtfull to it, seekes the perseruation of it selfe, it is a part of true wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to foresee euills and to prouide against them: beware of men, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.16.17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a feare due from inferiors, in subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to superiors. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. with sense of Gods image in their superiority, and conscience of their

owne infirmitie, to season obedience, which requires feare, and to preserue them from vndecent behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and inordinate feare, whereby we sinne in not sanctifying the Lord in our hearts by depending vpon him, and making him our dread and feare,<note place="margin">Esa. 8.13.</note> for no feare of any creature to sin against him: which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full and occupieth the heart wholly: which kinde of fearefull ones haue a fearefull place appointed, if they doe not repent, <hi>Reu.</hi> 21.8.</p>

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:3228:115"/>Or it is of infirmity, with loue to God and his commandement, strife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it to glorifie God in resting on him, which in the weaknesse of faith may preuaile, yet not reigne.

                  <p>Fourthly, Thinking on the spirit you haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, not of the world, not of feare, but of power and a sound minde: 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Of the good that comes by such sufferings
