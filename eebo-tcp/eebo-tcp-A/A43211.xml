            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>None of all theſe ſigns revealed or diſcovered the abſtruſe, and moſt reſerved deep and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fortune of this perſon, The ſubtleties, Arts, and Policies of his deſtiny, potently and irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conſpiring with his as cloſe Treaſons and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled Treacheries, to the ruin and overthrow of this Church and State, ſingly and inſenſibly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by the mean and unobſerved Hand of this bold and perjurious politique.</p>
            <p>All therefore that to this purpoſe is noted of him, is this, that he was born the laſt year of that wonderful Century of 1500. to begin the next with his fital Marvails, juſt before the union of the Two Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> by King <hi>James;</hi> as if it were congenial to Crowns, as to the other leſſer acceſſions of Felicity in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, to have at the ſame inſtant a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament and alloy to their luſtre and greatneſſe;

            <p>Every thing hath its good and evil Angel, to attend or haunt it, and that grand and happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution was to be afflicted and proſecuted by this Fury to an almoſt diſſolution of its well compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, united, and eſtabliſhed Frame.</p>
            <p>He was born and deſcended of a very ancient knightly Family of his name in the County of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> where for many ages they have had a very large and plentiful patrimony, it will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice therefore to deduce him from no further ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals then Sir <hi>Henry Cromwell,</hi> his Grandfather, a Gentleman highly honoured and beloved both in Court, and Country, who had iſſue Sir <hi>Oliver</hi> his eldeſt Son, <hi>Henry, Robert, Richard,</hi> and Sir <hi>Philip</hi> the youngeſt, (whoſe Son upon Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of poyſoning his Maſter a Lawyer, was accuſed thereupon and convicted, and hanged ſome 35. years agoe.) This our <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> was Son of Mr. <hi>Robert Cromwell</hi> the third Son of Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> a Gentleman who went no leſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59799:8"/>Fortune in that County, but of ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne effect on the Courſe of this his Nephews life, as hereafter ſhall be declared, that if all the Lands he gave him, (as ſome were Fenny Ground) had been irrecoverably loſt and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by any accident or diſaſter whatſoever, it might have paſt for a moſt propitious providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial prevention of that dire miſchief and miſeries that Eſtate occaſioned.</p>
            <p>He was born <hi>April</hi> the 25. in St. <hi>Johns</hi> Pariſh in the Town of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> and was chriſtned in that Church the 29. of the ſame Month <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1599. where Sir <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> his Uncle gave him his name, being received into the boſome of the Church by her Rites and Ceremonies, both which he afterwards rent and tore, and ungraciouſly and impiouſly annulled and renounced.</p>
            <p>From his Infancy to his Childhood he was of a croſſe and peeviſh diſpoſition, which being hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured by the fondneſſe of his Mother, made that rough and intractable temper more robuſt and outragious in his juvenile years, and adult and Maſterleſs at mans eſtate.</p>
            <p>No ſooner therefore had he obtained the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of his Tongue, but his Father careful of his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſent him to School to learn the Elements of Language and principalls of Religion, both which he ſtudied with the ſame indifference, and <hi>inſide</hi> and fallacious endevour, as afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by his never ſpeaking what he thought, nor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59799:8"/>believing what he heard or was inſtructed in; ſo that his main policy was a radical and original hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, which growing up with him, could not but be at laſt after ſo many years of Experience moſt exquiſitely perfected.</p>
            <p>From this A. B. C. Diſcipline and the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Governance of a Miſtris, his Father removed him to the Tuition of Dr. <hi>Beard</hi> Schoolmaſter of the Free-School in that Tovvn, vvhere his Book began to perſecute him, and Learning to commence his great and irreconciliable Enemy; for his Maſter honeſtly and ſeverely obſerving that and other his Faults (vvhich like vveeds, ſprung out of his rank and uncultivable nature) did by Correction hope to better his manners; and vvith a diligent Hand and carefull Eye to hinder the thick grovvth of thoſe vices vvhich vvere ſo predominant and viſible in him; yet though herein he treſpaſſed upon that reſpect and lenity due and uſual to Children of his Birth and quality; he prevailed nothing againſt his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and perverſe inclination. The Learning and Civility he had, coming upon him like fits of <hi>Enthuſiaſme,</hi> now a hard Student for a week or two, and then a Truant or <hi>Otioſo</hi> for twice as many months; <hi>Nunquam ſibi conſtans,</hi> of no ſettled conſtancy; the very tenour and mode of his future life till his grand attainment.</p>
            <p>Among the reſt of thoſe ill qualities which <hi>fructuated</hi> in him at this age, He was very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious for <hi>robbing of Orchards; a puerile</hi> crime
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59799:9"/>and an ordinary treſpaſſe, but grown ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and injurious by the frequent ſpoyls and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Trees, breaking of Hedges and Incloſures committed by this <hi>Apple Dragon,</hi> that many ſolemn Complaints were made both to his Father and Maſter for redreſſe thereof; which miſſed not their ſatisfaction and expiation out of his hide, on which ſo much pains were loſt, that, that very offence <hi>ripened</hi> in him afterwards to the throwing down all boundaries of Law or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the ſtealing and taſting the <hi>forbidden fruit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>From this, he paſſed unto another more manly their, the robbing of Dove-houſes, ſtealing the young Pidgeons, and eating and merchandizing of them, and that ſo publiquely, that he became dreadfully ſuſpect to all the adjacent Countrey; and this was an unhappy alluſory <hi>Omen</hi> of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Actions, when he Robb'd the King his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of his Innocence and Vertues, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted them to the People and Soul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>'Twas at this time of his Adoleſcency, that he dreamed, or a Familiar rather inſtincted him and put it into his Head, that he ſhould be King of <hi>England;</hi> for it cannot be conceived, that now there ſhould be any ſuch near reſemblance of truth in Dreams and Divinations (beſides the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, with which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59799:9"/>to make him forget the Arrogant Conceit and opinionated pride he had of himſelf doth ſeem to evince, it was ſome impulſe of a Spirit) ſince they have ceaſed long agoe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Thought or Viſion came, moſt certain it is, that his Father was exceedingly troubled at it; and having angerly rebuked him for the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Idleneſſe, and Impudence thereof; and ſeeing him yet perſiſt in the preſumption thereof, cauſed Dr. <hi>Beard</hi> to whip him for them, which was done to no more purpoſe than the reſt of his Chaſtiſements, his Scholar growing inſolent and uncorrigible from thoſe reſults and ſvvaſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, to which all other dictates and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were uſeleſſe, and as a dead letter.</p>
            <p>Now to confirm this Royal Humour the more in his ambitious and vainglorious brain, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened (as it was then generally the Cuſtome in all great Free-Schools) that a Play called <hi>The five Senſes,</hi> was to be Acted by the Scholars of this School, and <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> as a Confident Youth, was. named to Act the part of <hi>Tactus</hi> the ſenſe of <hi>Feeling;</hi> in the perſonation of which as he came out of the Tyring roome upon the Stage, his Head encircled with a Chaplet of Lawrel, he ſtumbled at a Crown, purpoſely laid there, which ſtooping down he took up, and Crovvned himſelf therevvithall, adding beyond his Cue, ſome Majeſtical mighty vvords; and vvith this paſſage alſo the Event of his Life held good analogie and proportion, vvhen he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59799:10"/>the Lavvrel of his Victories (in the late unnatural War) to all the Povver, Authority, and Splendor that can be imagined vvithin the Compaſſe of a Crovvn.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the Relation of a Father, and one ſo ſtern and ſtrict an Examiner of him, (he being in his ovvn nature of a difficult diſpoſition, and great ſpirit, and one that would have due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances obſerved towards him from all perſons, which begat him reverence from the Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people) kept him in ſome awe and ſubjection, till his tranſlation to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he was placed in <hi>Sydney</hi> Colledge, more to ſatisfie his Fathers curioſity and deſire, than out of any hopes of Completing him in his Studies, which never reached any good knowledge of the Latine Tongue.</p>
            <p>During his ſhort reſidence here, where he was more Famous for his Exerciſes in the Feilds than in the Schools, (in which he never had the honour of, becauſe no worth and merit to, a degree) being one of the chief Match-makers and Players at Foot-ball, Cudgels, or any other boyſtrous ſport or game; His Father Mr. <hi>Robert Cromwell</hi> died, leaving him to the ſcope of his own inordinate and irregular will, ſwayed by the bent of very violent and ſtrong paſſions.</p>
            <p>There is little to be ſaid more of his Father, that is requiſite to his Sons Story, further than this, that whereas 'tis reported <hi>Oliver</hi> kept a Brew-Houſe, that is a miſtake; for, the Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59799:10"/>was kept in his Fathers time, and managed by his Mother and his Fathers Servants, without any concernment of either of theſe therein, the Accompts being alwayes given to the Miſtris, who after her Husbands death did continue in the ſame Employment and Calling of a Brewer, and thought it no diſparagement to ſuſtain the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and port of a younger Brother as Mr. <hi>Robert Cromwell</hi> was, by thoſe lawful means; however, not ſo reputable as other gains and Trades are accounted.</p>
            <p>It was not long after his Death, er'e <hi>Oliver</hi> weary of the Muſes, and that ſtrict courſe of Life, (though he gave latitude enough to it in his wilde ſalleys and flyings out) abandoned the Univerſity and returned Home, faluted with the Name of young Mr. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> now in the room and place of his Father, which how he became, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled debaucheries did publiquely declare, for Drinking, Wenching, and the like outrages of licentious youth, none ſo inſam'd as this young <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who would not be contraried in his Luſts, in the very ſtrain and to the exceſſe of that Regal Raviſher.</p>
            <p>Theſe pranks made his Mother adviſe with her ſelf and his friends what ſhe ſhould do with him, and to remove the Scandal which had been caſt upon the Family by his means, and therefore it was concluded to ſend him to one of the Inns of Court, under pretence of his ſtudying the Laws, where among the maſſe of people in

            <p>
               <hi>Lincolns-Inne</hi> was the place pitch'd upon, and thither Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> in a ſutable Garb to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes was ſent, where but for a very little while he continued, for the nature of the place and the Studies there were ſo far regretful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all his tedious Apprentiſhip to the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile Academick Sciences, (by reaſon Laws were the bar and obſtacle of his impetuous reſolutions and the quite contrary to his looſe and libertine ſpirit, that he had a kind of antipathy to his Company and Converſe there; and ſo ſpent his time in an inward ſpight, which for that ſpace ſuperſeded the enormous extravagancy of his former vitiouſneſſe. His Vices having a certain kind of intermiſſion, ſucceſſion, or tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like a complete revolution of wickedneſſe into one another. So that few of his Feats were practiſed here, and it is ſome kind of good luck for that honourable Society that he hath leſt ſo ſmall and ſo innocent a Memorial of his Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip therein.</p>
            <p>His next traverſe was back again into the country to his Mother, and there he fell to his old trade, and frequented his old haunts, conſumed his money in tipling, and then ran on ſcore <hi>per</hi> force; in his drink he uſed to be ſo quarrelſome as (few unleſſe as mad as himſelf) durſt keep him

            <p>Theſe and the like ſtrange, wild, and diſhoneſt actions, made him every where a ſhame or a terrour, inſomuch that the Ale-wives of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and other places, when they ſaw him a coming would uſe to cry out to one another, <hi>Here comes young</hi> Cromwell, <hi>ſhut up your Dores,</hi> for he made it no <hi>Punctilio</hi> to invite his Royſters to a Barrell of Drink, and give it them at the charge of his Hoſt, and in ſatisfaction thereof either beat him, or break his Windows, if he offered any ſhew, or gave any look or Sign of refuſal or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>His Luſtful wantonneſſes were not leſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant than the other unruly appetites of his mind, that there might no vice be wanting to make his Life a <hi>Syſteme</hi> of iniquity; the publique, open and more ingenuous <hi>vileneſſes</hi> of his Youth, becoming the ſeveral dangerous and druell Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his Old Age, it being now his rude cuſtome, to ſeiſe upon all Women he met in his way on the road, and perforce raviſh a kiſs, by ſome lewder ſatisfaction from them; and if any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59799:12"/>reſiſtance were made by their Company, then to vindicate and allay this violence and heat of his blood, with the letting out of theirs, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Friends Honour, and Chaſtity, innocently ingaged them. And the ſame riots was he guilty of againſt any who would not give him the way; ſo that he was a <hi>Rebell</hi> in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, long before he was a <hi>Belial</hi> in Policy.</p>
            <p>I am loth to be too large in ſuch particulars, which may render me ſuſpect of belying him, out of prejudice or revenge; but I have heard it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ſo often from knowing perſons, and the ſtories made uſe of by his party who did thereby magnify his Converſion, making him thus dear and precious unto God, that I was obliged to mention them, partly as due to this Memoir of him, which pretends to an exact Biography, as well in the minute and ſmall beginnings, as in the grand and moſt important Events of his Life; and partly to ſet him as a remarque againſt all Satanical deluſions of Inſtantaneous Sanctity, with which yet at this very day the World is bewitched though they have ſeen in him the Tragical, even Diabolical effects of his Religious Auſterity.</p>
            <p>Onely one thing I may not omit: by theſe lewd actions he had ſo aliened the affections of his Uncle and Godfather Sir <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> that he could not endure the ſight of him, having in his own preſence in the great Hall of his Houſe, where he magnificently treated King <hi>James</hi> at his aſſumption to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> in a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59799:12"/>
               <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> time, (which was alwayes highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by him by Feaſting, and keeping open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe) played this unhandſome and unſeemly trick or frolick; with the Relation of which the Reader will be pleaſed to indulge me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſeen it raccounted by a Worthy and Learned hand.</p>
            <p>It was Sir <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Cuſtome in that Feſtival, to entertain in his Houſe a Maſter of Miſ-rule or the Revels, to make mirth for the Gueſts, and to direct the Dances and the Muſick, and generally all manner of ſport and Gambols; this fellow, Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> having beſmeared his own Clothes and hands with Surreverence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſts in the midſt of a frisking Dance, and ſo grimed him upon every turne, that ſuch a ſtink was raiſed, that the Spectators could hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Room, whereupon the ſaid Maſter of Miſ-rule perceiving the matter, cauſed him to be laid hold on, and by his Command to be thrown into a Pond adjoyning to the Houſe, and there to be ſous'd over head and ears, and rinced of that filth and pollution ſticking to him, which was accordingly executed, Sir <hi>Oliver</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his Nephew to undergo the puniſhment of his unmanerly folly.</p>
            <p>By this time and by theſe wayes, <hi>Oliver</hi> had run himſelf out of that little Patrimony he had, and brought his Mother to the ſame near ruine, when taking a ſad proſpect from the brink of this deſtruction, of his preſent deſperate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59799:13"/>a giddy inſpiration ſeiſed him, and all of a ſudden ſo ſeemed to change and invert him, that he now became the wonder, who juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the hiſſing and ſcorn of all people. And that this Converſion might ſeem true and real, he manifeſted it with the Publican firſt in the Temple, the Church, which he devoutly and conſtantly frequented, affecting the Companies and Diſcourſes of Orthodox Divines, no way given to that Schiſme of <hi>Non-Conformity,</hi> into which <hi>Oliver</hi> ſoon after fell, not out of Seducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Ignorance, but Sedition, and Malice, and Treaſonable deſign.</p>
            <p>But this appearance of ſuch a Reformation in him (as he no doubt forecaſt it) did effectually conduce to his preſent purpoſe; for theſe Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Divines, glad of the return of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, made it their buſineſſe to have him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed and received with the Fatned Calf, to remove the prejudices that lie upon the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſtianity; and therefore ſeverally and joyntly they deal with Sir <hi>John Steward</hi> his Uncle (for Sir <hi>Oliver</hi> would by no means hear of him, as being aſſured and confirmed againſt him out of ſome good hints certainly of his own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) to take him into his favour, and did at laſt prevail ſo upon h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that he declared him his Heir, and dying ſoon after, left him an Eſtate of Four or five hundred pounds a year; which being got and obtained by ſo impious a practiſe, a kind of inverted <hi>Symony,</hi> to purchaſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59799:13"/>Lands by Counterfeit Gifts and Graces, could not eſcape the canker of Sacriledge; but in few years mouldered away peece-meal, nothing at all remaining thereof but a thatcht Houſe, with ſome Lands of Forty or fifty pounds a year, in a Town called <hi>Wells,</hi> within four miles of <hi>Wishich</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ely.</hi>

            <p>In the <hi>Interim</hi> of this Eſtate, having ſerved himſelf of thoſe Venerable Divines, he fell in with ſome of the preciſer ſort; began to ſhew himſelf at Lectures, to entertain ſuch Preachers at his Houſe, to Countenance that Way, and be very Zealous in all meetings of ſuch People, which then began to be frequent and numerous; and to Exerciſe with them by praying and the like; to eſtrange himſelf from thoſe his benefactors, and at laſt to appear a publique diſſenter from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He had Matched a little before upon the account of this Eſtate in reverſion, with a Kinſwoman of Mr. <hi>Hambdens,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> of <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> by Name <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter of one Sir ... <hi>Bowcher,</hi> whom he trained up and made the waiting Woman of his Providences, and Lady-rampant of his ſucceſſeful greatneſſe, which ſhe perſonated afterwards as Imperiouſly as himſelf; ſo did the <hi>Incu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>During his continuance here, he was grown (that is, he pretended to be) ſo juſt, and of ſo ſcrupulous a Conſcience, that having ſome years before won thirty pounds of one Mr. <hi>Calton</hi> at play, meeting him accidentally, he deſired him to come home with him and to receive his money, telling him, that he had got it of him by indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and unlawful means, and that it would be a ſin in him to detain it any longer; and did really pay the Gentleman the ſaid thirty pound back again.</p>

But it ſo luckily evened to him, that by his lopping off, as it were, this Limb of the Kingdome, and depriving the King thereby of any aſſiſtance thence, and of the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the ports of thoſe Eaſtern Counties for any forraign ſupplies, one <hi>Canton</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was as planet ſtruck in point of Allegiance, and not only a Member, — <hi>Mancum &amp; inutile dextre Perſ.</hi> but of a very ſiniſter conſequence to the Royal Cauſe, the Gangreen thereof ſpreading and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing it ſelf through the whole Maſſe of the Nation, by feeding the Humourous rage of the War through the whole diſtemper thereof, till it finally conſumed all; this being the abundant Magazine of Men and Horſes for the Parliament Service.</p>
            <p>This therefore was <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s firſt Province or Superintendency, wherein he exerciſed the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Office of a Major General, when as yet
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59799:18"/>he ſounded no more then a Captain, being the chief Committee-man of the Aſſociation, making himſelf moſt notably eminent by his activity and zealous induſtry in promoting the good Cauſe, and levying and liſting of Forces, and Diſciplining them, the skill whereof he had preſently learned, from an exact obſervation of ſome veterane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, <hi>viz.</hi> Coll. <hi>Dolbier,</hi> whom he had by great ſums of advance money, and as extraordinary pay allured to his ſide.</p>
            <p>The groſſe of thoſe Troops he raiſed here and ſent from this Seminary to the Camp and School of Action, were ſuch, whoſe dull Spirits were to be beaten into the knowledge of Arms, and like the <hi>Turks</hi> Aſapi were on purpoſe ſent thither to blunt the weapons of the Kings generous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, on purpoſe to beget in them a relaſh and contemptuous neglect, of ſo baſe and deſpicable an enemy; that ſuch their regardleſſe confidence might conclude their ruine. He himſelf was all the while continued by eſpecial Order of Parliament in this Employment like an <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> Commander to have an Eye upon any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that might be made thereabouts, and as a <hi>purer</hi> and preciſer reſerve to the mix'd multitude, that then from the equal motives of pay and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotry ruſht into the War.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Oliver,</hi> underſtanding how miſerably the Cavalry freſhmen of his party were worſted at every Encounter, and well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of the quarrell; (which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

            <p>Againſt the dangerous evil of this Aſſociation, the King directed his Commiſſion of Array, which was firſt put in execution in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> by Sir <hi>Henry Conisby</hi> High Sheriff of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who proclaimed it at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to raiſe the County to the Kings Aſſiſtance, but by the vigilance of <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> the Deſign was prevented; for by that time the Members at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> had notice of Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s Loyal endevour, <hi>Cromwell</hi> with a party of horſe had ſurprized and ſeized that party almoſt in the very inſtant of their appearance, and ſent Sir <hi>Henry</hi> and ſome other prime Gentlemen enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with him, Priſoners to <hi>London,</hi> to the great ſatisfaction and liking of the Parliament Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, who were at firſt agaſt at an attempt made for the King ſo neer their own Dores: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this their Commander was ordered the

In this deſtructive work, his module and method of Ambition, <hi>Cromwell</hi> was mainly and chiefly active, as alſo againſt the Orthodox and Proteſtant Miniſtry, and their Churches, defacing all the Ornaments and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, leaving them the ruinous Spectacle of his Reformation.</p>
            <p>And from this Employment now finiſhed he was Commiſſioned Lieutenant General to the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> who had the ſeparate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in a diſtinct Supremacy of theſe aſſociated Counties, and was deſigned to march Northwards with thoſe Forces and joyn with the <hi>Scots</hi> newly entred <hi>England,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> againſt the Marquiſs of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> who was General for the King in thoſe parts, and yet ballanced the

            <p>The importance of this place, and juncture of time, which either won or loſt the North to the King (who had newly had great ſucceſſe in the Weſt by the defeating of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> at <hi>Leſtithiel</hi> in <hi>Cornwall</hi>) cauſed him to ſend away Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> as <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> with a very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Army to raiſe that Siege, and fight the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my if he found occaſion. The Prince accordingly advanced, and upon his approach the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates drew off from their Leagure, affording the Garriſon liberty to joyn with their friends, when it was reſolved by the Prince, without any delay to give Battel; though the Marquiſs knowing what hazzard the Kings Intereſt, and his own, and all the Loyal parties Eſtates would thereby be put to, did very much diſwade the ſuddenneſſe of the Encounter, which notwithſtanding enſued on the Evening of the ſame day <hi>July</hi> 2.

            <p>The ſucceſſe of this day made him indeed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly famous, and his Lawrells moſt verdant and flouriſhing, the Victory being principally aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to his courage and conduct. His Cuncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temperate delay were highly magnified; and then his Reſolution in the deſperation of the Event extolled the firmneſſe and conſtant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of his mind, when intrepidly and fixedly he beheld the overthrow of the groſſe of their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59799:21"/>Army, and thereby animated his Troops to the more vigorous recovery of the day, now that the adverſe fury was ſpent in the chaſe of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the <hi>Scots,</hi> whom <hi>Cromwell</hi> ever afterwards though in Covenant with them, moſt diſdainfully deſpiſed, but not only for this reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Credit of this Atchievement was induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cryed up at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and all the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezza's of Scriptural <hi>Ovation</hi> fitted and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated thereto; He himſelf with the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Troops, as yet in the ſame quality under the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> was remanded from the North to oppoſe the King, then returning victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious out of the Weſt; and becauſe the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had hither to been unfortunate, therefore this lucky Cheiftain was added as his better Star, at the ſecond Battel of <hi>Newberry,</hi> within font Months after <hi>Marſton Moor;</hi> and here again the Fates favoured him, though not with a complete Victory, yet on that ſide where he fought with a part of one, and ſo much as endangered the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King, if the noble and ſtout Earl of <hi>Cleveland</hi> had not hazardouſly interpoſed, and bore off the purſuit.</p>
            <p>This indifference of Fortune begot very great differences among the Parliament Commanders, one Taxing the other of Neglect, Treachery, or Cowardize, and by what means it could come to paſſe that nothing was yet effected againſt the King, whom in the beginning of the War they had thought to have ſwallowed up preſently?

            <p>Having thus made ſure of the Army, he thought it time now to make ſure of the King, whom the Parliaments Commiſſioners had brought to his Captivity at <hi>Holmby-houſe,</hi> and therefore <hi>Ireton</hi> and he having ſometime before acquainted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the King in this his reſtraint, and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and proteſted their readineſſe to ſerve him, to the enſnaring the Kings belief, while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doled the hard uſage and unreaſonable carriage of the Parliament towards him, eſpecially in point of Liberty of Conſcience, and the Worſhip of God (His Majeſties Chaplains having been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately refuſed him) they judged it no difficult thing to get his perſon into their Cuſtody and deceive his good nature, with the ſame ſemblances of it in themſelves, only the manner was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reſolved by them. For without the Generals conſent and command it could not be done in his name, nor might it avowedly be done by the Councill of War, for it would be a peremptory and hazardous enterpriſe, and engage the whole Kingdome about their Ears, but at laſt it was concluded betwixt them that this ſurprizal of the King ſhould be fathered on the Council of Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, as the ſenſe and Act of the Army.

            <p>This way being agreed upon, one <hi>Cornet Joyce</hi> a buſie pragmaticall perſon, whom <hi>Cromwell</hi> his Familiar had tutoured in the Method of boldneſſe and Rebellion, was privately conferred with about it, and after ſome familiar compellations hugged into the Conſpiracy, and immediately diſpatch'd away with a party of 1000 Horſe on the 4. of <hi>June,</hi> to <hi>Holmby,</hi> where he arrived late at Night, but being very importunate to ſpeak with the King, was by his order admitted, to whom he declared his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>The King nevertheleſſe deliberated the whole night, and conſulted with the Parliaments Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, what was moſt adviſeable for him to do, though the ſway of his judgement in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>From <hi>Holmby</hi> therefore next morning the King was carried to <hi>Childerſly,</hi> then the head quarters of the Army, though the King deſired to go to <hi>Newmarket</hi> his own houſe, as perſwading himſelf in ſome greater degree of Royalty, then in the Parliaments Tuition; but this was at firſt denyed and a complementary amends made him by the Generall, and more particularly by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that His Majeſty could no where be ſafer or more regally honoured then in their quarters, which were the only Sanctuary of his perſon.</p>
            <p>This daring preſumption of ſeizing the King, gave <hi>light</hi> to the World what this <hi>Oliver</hi> would at laſt <hi>appear,</hi> though no certain Concluſions could be made, what the miſchief did preſently ſignify: It was ſufficient to <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s deſign to amuſe the World, and let them <hi>gueſſe</hi> at the danger he had <hi>readily</hi> prepared beyond any <hi>ſudden remedy.</hi> And therefore he now perſonates the Kings Intereſt, profeſſeth himſelf exceeding ſorry to have miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the quarrell; intimates and inſinuates to the King, that there were a corrupt party (meaning the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) in Parliament, who alone withſtood his Reſolution, and that He and all the power and friends he could make, were reſolved to aſſert his Rights, and vindicate them from thoſe unreaſonable injuries of the <hi>Juncto,</hi> as he ſpared not frequently to own the ſame <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty</hi> to the Kings friends, then admitted to attend Him; particularly He declared to Collonel <hi>John Cromwell</hi> (a Commander in the States Service in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59799:31"/>
               <hi>Holland)</hi> then in <hi>England, That he thought the King of</hi> England <hi>was the moſt injured Prince in the World,</hi> and clapping his hand to his Sword in ſome paſſion ſaid, Couſin <hi>This ſhall right him:</hi> to the very great Contentment of that Loyal Subject, whom we ſhall have further occaſion in this Diſcourſe, and from this Paſſage to mention.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the King is at his earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſeemed moſt officiouſly to ſtudy, conveighed to <hi>Newmarket</hi> Houſe, and thither his friends and Chaplains without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction admitted, and ſuch a ſudden change made in the condition of the King as to his Liberty and Honour, that moſt of his party were <hi>dazeled</hi> with the <hi>ſhews</hi> of it, and could not <hi>foreſee</hi> the Treaſon that was hid under thoſe fair <hi>Umbrages:</hi> Nor could the King himſelf (ſo cunningly <hi>Cromwell</hi> carried it) give any true judgement of this his Surprizal, more then that the Examples and rules of all Policy generally reſolved him, <hi>That the Perſon of a Prince in whoſoever hands it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, addeth Strength and Authority to that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being thus in <hi>Olivers</hi> hands, as he had declared (upon <hi>Joyces</hi> telling him, that he had the King in Cuſtody) that he had the Parliament then in his Pocket; ſo his next Main Work was to perform his word; and to this intent he never ceaſed exaſperating the King againſt the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Members in Parliament, thereby indiſpoſing the King to any accommodation with them, though
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59799:31"/>the Terms or Propoſitions ſent his Majeſty were ſo unreaſonable that they needed no diſſwaſion to his Aſſent: but this <hi>Ambodexter</hi> ſo inviſibly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged both the injuſtice of the <hi>Juncto,</hi> and the indignation and reſentment of the King, that he was look'd upon no otherwiſe then as a partial Spectator and Wellwiſher to the Kings Fortunes.</p>
            <p>Nay ſo far had he proceeded in this Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Treachery (the more deteſtable, by how much the ſimple confidence of ſo innocent a Prince was abuſed and deceived) that he ſtuck not ſundry times voluntarily and of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to aſſure the King, that if the Parliament fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their duty, and did not ſpeedily reſtore him, and ſettle the Kingdome, the Army ſhould do it without them, and that to that very purpoſe the newly conſtituted Council or Court of Adjuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were now proceeding, and that ſpeedily his Majeſty ſhould ſee the effect of his Faithfulneſs and Allegiance, while he the more indiſcernably ſought, and moſt nefariouſly practiſed his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in Parliament, were haſtily alarum'd at theſe Tranſactions of <hi>Cromwell;</hi> and therefore (the Army having aſſumed to themſelves by decree of this their Court of Adjutators, a right of Petitioning as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Freemen, as being no mercenary Souldiers) reſolved as was partly hinted before, to divide the Army and ſend part of it to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and forthwith to Caſhiere <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and his Chief Partizans, and to run parallell
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59799:32"/>with his deſigns, to ſend propoſitions to the King, at the ſame time as the Army had hammered out ſome propoſals of more equall and of fairer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences then theirs, that the King acknowledged the juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Thus practiced he with the King by Deluſion and Treachery, but againſt the Parliament he proceeded in a more forcible way, for his party therein had tryed all wayes to overreach the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> with fineſſe and Artifice, but found them ſo vigilant and ſenſible of their proceedings and being alſo far the Major part of the Houſe, that no iſſue was to be expected from debates and diſputes with them, for a Declaration was now publiſhed, forbidding the Souldiers to Petition the Parliament, as being under their pay and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and for diſobedience hereunto Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> had drawn their Swords upon one Major <hi>Tuleday,</hi> and committed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one <hi>Nicholas T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59799:32"/>but <hi>Oliver</hi> having ſudden intimation of the deſign got ſecretly and haſtily out of Town, and upon a Flea-bitten nag without ſtop or ſtay arrived at the Rendezvouz at <hi>Triploe Heath, June</hi> the 5. his Horſe all in a foam, and there was welcomed with the Shouts of the whole Army, to whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the actions and deſigns of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>And here was made that pernicious and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive engagement of perpetuating the Army till their deſires, that is till <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s devices ſhould be attained, and this for his better ſecurity he cauſed to be confirmed at another more generall Rendezvouz, <hi>June.</hi> the 14. at <hi>New-market,</hi> where he himſelf was the firſt man alighting from his Horſe at the head of his Regiment and lying upon his Belly that ſubſcribed it, which was in ſeverall Parchment Rolls univerſally Followed. I muſt not omit one further remarque, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion one <hi>Edward,</hi> afterwards better known by the name of Collonel <hi>Sexby,</hi> and one <hi>Lazingby,</hi> both of the Councill of Adjutators, were ordered by the ſaid Councill to attend the Lieut.

            <p>For immediately hereupon an Impeachment is drawn up and preſented to, and approved by, this Councill of Adjutators againſt 11.

            <p>This was accordingly with impudence enough preſented to the Houſe of Commons, though they

            <p>But before this great ſucceſſe, the dubious Expectation thereof, had cauſed <hi>Cromwell</hi> to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger now and then at his firſt reſolutions, (which it proſperous would at all times help themſelves and there ultimately he was fixed whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and promiſes croſs accidents ſhould extort from him) and therefore he was dealing with the King in way of recompence and reward for his Service in his reſtitution, that he ſhould be made Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and a Knight of the Garter, his eldeſt Son to be of the Bedchamber to the Prince, his Son in Law <hi>Ireton</hi> to be either Lord Deputy or at leaſt Feild Marſhall Generall of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and it was reported by <hi>Henry Cromwell,</hi> that then Commanded the Generalls Lifeguard, that the King had put himſelf upon his Father and Brother <hi>Ireton,</hi> to make his terms for him and reſtore him to his Crown: which grant of the Kings, cauſed and produced thoſe propoſals beforementioned to be contrived, but now in the very nick of this Juncture ſet forth and publiſhed, called the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals for the ſetling a juſt and lawfull peace where in the three firſt and laſt particulars the Authority was left as entire in the King as before the reſt were ſome <hi>Caprichio's</hi> of Bienniall
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59799:37"/>Parliaments and the like Figaries, whoſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinences diſcredited the important veracity of the other. But this feud betwixt the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> ending ſo fortunately for him, there being nothing at preſent to withſtand his firſt and grand intendment, he began to waive his reſpects to the King and caſt off thoſe diſguiſes wherewith he had made himſelf acceptable to the Kings adhaerents, and laid aſide the King and them.</p>
            <p>The King therefore gently reminds <hi>Cromwell</hi> of his promiſes, repeats to him his Proteſtations and urgeth the Propoſals aforeſaid (and not only ſo but in confidence of the fair meaning of the Army declines a ſpeedier accommodation with the Parliament) but <hi>Cromwell</hi> begins to turn a deaf ear, to deny many things what he had ſaid and promiſed, to retract from others, pretending the difference of times and circumſtances, that they cannot be performed, telling the King more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that He did miſtake and not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his meaning, and in ſhort that though he would keep his word with His Majeſty, that now it was not in his power, for that the Adjutators were grown to ſuch an ungoverned and inſolent licentiouſneſſe. that untill the Diſcipline of the Army could be recovered, it were in vain to expect any ſuch things as he when he promiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intended.</p>
            <p>The King was at this time at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> perplext on the one hand with the obſtinacy of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59799:37"/>the Parliament, in their Propoſitions, being more rigid ſince the laſt garbling by the Army; and on the other with the dangerous Poſitions of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutators and the Levelling party both in Camp and City, in which laſt <hi>John Lilburn</hi> was Chief of the Faction, who decryed Monarchy and all former forms of Government, having ſomething (which <hi>Ireton</hi> ſpread by the by as it were among the Souldiery) in projection, on purpoſe to ſtave off all manner and means of ſettlement. This at laſt came to a Syſteme or Conſiſtency and was ſtyled an Agreement of the people, and was now the onely darling of the Army and the Sectaries: being a mixture or miſcellany of Politique No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions no way practicable among <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> being a deformation or deſtruction of all things, but an eſtabliſhment of nothing a meer temporary expedient, and ſhift of deſign; (except always their Arrears, Indemnity and the Period to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) and this ſhape <hi>Cromwell</hi> aſſumes alſo confeſſing and acknowledging the excellence, acquity and goodneſſe of the ſame the only fault in it was the unſeaſonableneſſe, for as yet it was not his time and his cue to appear ſo publiquely againſt the King; and this his Character of it was dreſt out and enlarged with ſuch taking Saint-like Language, as the Phanatick rabble might beſt be ſurprized, and not ſuſpect any of his own vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous deſigns to be lurking under the leaf of His holy and ſacred pretences. Withall when his Plot againſt the King vvas ripe for Execution, he cauſed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59799:38"/>a Faſt to be publiſhed in the Army, (a certain forerunner of miſchief with him) where he was as uſually obſerved to howl and cry and bedew his Cheeks with the Tears of Hypocriſie, cruelty, and deceit; and after this mock-duty performed, he and the reſt of the Officers pretended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their iniquity and abomination, in declining the Cauſe of the people, and tampering with the King, and then in the preſence of the All-ſeeing God, acknowledge the way of an Agreement of the People to be the way to peace and freedom.</p>
            <p>The King was in the mean while, by the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious advice of <hi>Whalley,</hi> and the practiſes of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> (who had cauſed frequent rumours to be whiſpered, of ſome Aſſaſſinate intended by the <hi>Levellers</hi> againſt his perſon) frighted from <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> which place was found to be too near to <hi>London</hi> for fear of a reſcue, in a dark and tempeſtuous night, in <hi>November</hi> 1647. and forced to caſt himſelf into the diſloyal hands of Coll. <hi>Hamond,</hi> Governour of the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and Brother to the moſt Learned and Reverend Dr. <hi>Hamond,</hi> which conſideration <hi>Cromwell</hi> forelaid, would invite the King in his diſtreſſe to betake himſelf thither, where we ſhall leave him in a moſt diſconſolate Impriſonment; the Votes of <hi>Non Addreſſes</hi> being not long after procured by <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Menaces to the Parliament, when upon the Debate of them he declared in ſuch like words. <hi>That it was now expected by the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Nation, and the Army, that the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59799:38"/>Parliament would come to ſome Reſolution and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, as the Price of all the Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that had been expended in the War, and that they would not now leave them to the expectation of any good from a Man whoſe heart God had hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but if they did, they ſhould be forced to-look for their preſervation ſome other way.</hi> At the end of this Speech he laid his hand upon his Sword by his ſide, as was the more obſerved, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the ſame place it could not keep him from trembling, when Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton</hi> a man of ſpirit and metal baffled him; but Sir <hi>Philip</hi> and his ſeconds were now out of Dores. Next to him ſpoke <hi>Ireton</hi> in the very ſame ſenſe (being newly choſen a recruit for the Parliament, by their illegal writ of Election) extolling and magnifying the valour, civility, and duty of the Army, concluding with the ſame threats, that if the Parliament would not ſettle the Kingdome without the King, then they of neceſſity muſt and would.</p>
            <p>So that after ſome Oppoſition, the ſaid votes paſſed againſt any further Addreſſe to be made to the King, and now <hi>Oliver</hi> thought himſelf cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and therefore the King, Parliament, and City being in his power, he had no rub left to his Ambition, but thoſe Imps and Spirits of his own raiſing and conjuring up, the Adjutators and Levellers of the Army, who having conn'd their Leſſon of the Agreement with the people, were became moſt artful and skilful Governours, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59799:39"/>boaſting in the Country, (many of which ſilly people they had induced to their ſide, upon the accompt of laying all in common, and in a wild Parity) that the Parliament ſate only during their pleaſure, and till a new Repreſentative then a forming, ſhould take upon them the Government; nor did they more dutifully reſpect and behave themſelves to their Officers, whom they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as peices of the Prerogative Military &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore decried all Courts and Counſells of them, which began to ſeparate and act by themſelves, without the mixture of their Adjutators.</p>
            <p>This exorbitancy and heigth of the Soldiery, was altogether as deſtructive to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> now he had done his work with them for this time, as any of the other 3 Intereſts, but deſperate diſeaſes muſt have deſperate Cures, for immediately the Headquar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being then at <hi>Ware</hi> Coll. <hi>Eyer</hi> a Leveller was ſeiſed and impriſoned, and one <hi>Arnold</hi> a private Soldier ſhot to death for promoting the former ſolemn Engagement, and Agreement of the People, and after that He caſhiered all ſuch who favoured the ſame; and to fan and cull out the reſt he proceeded to disband 20 out of a Troop, by which the moſt of that party were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally excluded; the like was done in <hi>London</hi> by the Impriſonment of Mr. <hi>Prince,</hi> and others of the ſame Faction.</p>
            <p>Having for the preſent ſtill'd that commotion in the Army, the danger of a ſecond war ſeemed a freſh to threaten the <hi>Juncto</hi> and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59799:39"/>reaſon of their injurious Votes of <hi>Non-Addreſſe</hi> and therefore to prevent ſo potent and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Conjunction of all Intereſts and Parties againſt him, He now by his Party and Emiſſaries, propoſeth an accommodation between the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> and a way and means whereby they may be ſo united; at the motion of this in the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> a Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>That if there were any ſuch perſons, who had any private Intereſt different from the publique and under the diſtinction of parties had prejudiced the Kingdome, he was not fit to be a Member of that Houſe;</hi> Nevertheleſſe it was inſiſted on that the Houſe would declare and ratifie their Votes of nulling and making void the Votes that paſſed in the abſence of the Speakers that fled into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in 1647. and their Engagement of adhering to the Army, which were tacitly confeſſed to be then unduly procured; ſo fearful and doubtful was he again of the iſſue of thoſe new Troubles he foreſee would fall out, and therefore would ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf and juſtifie his Actions by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he had ſo often bafled.</p>
            <p>The ſame Artifices he uſed likewiſe to the City offering them now upon the like condition of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Intereſts, the freedome of their Lord Maior and Aldermen, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>John Gayr,</hi> Alderman <hi>Langham,</hi> Alderman <hi>Adams,</hi> and others, and the ſetting up again their Poſts and Chains, but when they (having already treated and engaged with the <hi>Scots,</hi> then in preparation for a March into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59799:40"/>refuſed to give ear to any propoſitions or terms, reſenting the baſe affronts He and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had put upon them, He, queſtioned his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Glover,</hi> who gave him Commiſſion to make any ſuch Overtures, and in great rage turned him out of his Service.</p>
            <p>The danger ſtill increaſing, he ſuffered the Lords as namely the Earls of <hi>Suffolk, Lincoln,</hi> Lord <hi>Maynard, Willoughby,</hi> &amp;c. whom he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached of High Treaſon after his March into <hi>London,</hi> to be freed from their Impriſonment in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and with them the Maior and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aforeſaid; and as a further ſatisfaction and ſubmiſſion to the Authority of the Parliament, A Declaration of the Army is publiſhed, wherein <hi>they bewail their former miſcarriages and miſdemeanors towards the Parliament, their medling with the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil power, and that force and violence they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the two Houſes, and in Concluſion promiſe faithfully and dutifully to acquieſce in their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Wiſdom.</hi> With this <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> deluding the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> party into a kind of ſtupid neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality or rather worſe, while yet they would by no means comply with the King, untill <hi>Polyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Courteſie appeared in this <hi>Cromwellian</hi> Craft.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> under Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>England,</hi> and divers Inſurrections happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> according as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, <hi>Cromwell</hi> was ordered by the Parliament to attend the firſt of them, which was the <hi>Welch</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59799:40"/>and Northern Armies (though the <hi>Scots</hi> delayed their March ſo long till all was neer loſt in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) and after a ſhort Siege upon the Defeat at St. <hi>Pagons,</hi> which was atcheived in his abſence, took in <hi>Tenby-Caſtle; Pembroke Caſtle</hi> held out a while longer; thence he marched for <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> having joyned with Major General <hi>Lambert,</hi> who attended the motion of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, and at <hi>Preſton,</hi> his forces amounting to few more then 9000 Men, whereas the <hi>Scots</hi> were not leſſe then 20000, gave Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> Battle, and after a very ſhort Diſpute, wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> forces under Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> made him the greateſt Oppoſition, totally routed the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, taking all their Artillery, Bag and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and ſome 9000 priſoners, with the Duke himſelf in the purſuit Southwards, while he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Main of the flying Army Northwards, with a reſolution of putting a final end to that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and to rid himſelf of the Fears which from thence had hitherto perplexed him. Upon this his haſty advance, Major General <hi>Monro</hi> who commanded the reſerve of 6000 Men to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Army, and was marching after them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately returned to <hi>Berwick,</hi> and ſo back into <hi>Scotland. Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Cromwells</hi> approach rendred it ſelf upon terms, and hindred not his advance to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where by the Committee of Eſtates he was very ſumptuouſly welcomed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monro</hi> as yet and the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> with him ſtood to their Arms upon the <hi>Hamilton</hi> account
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59799:41"/>in the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>Arguile</hi> with another party ſtood for the purer Kirk, which ſince the Dukes march had recovered its Magiſtracy and Superiority, and with <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s acceſſionall Troops could give Law to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: but becauſe <hi>Cromwell</hi> was loth to venture a new War there, ſo far diſtant from his main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which the Army ſucceſſes at home had now matured, and his preſence only wanting to accompliſh it, he ſo ordered the matter that a Treaty was procured, by which all parties were to lay down their Arms (a greater aſſurance to him then if the Kirk had been abſolute victor) the <hi>Hamiltonians</hi> to have indempnity, but none of them to be admitted or elected for the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament or Aſſembly Generall, ſo that he ſo abſolutely manacled that Nation, that they had no other uſe of their hands then to hold them up to Heaven at the dolefull murther of their natural Prince, whom by their primitive rebellion they had brought to the Block.</p>
            <p>Things thus ſettled in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he departed thence, having been moſt highly and magnificently treated by the Grandees of that Kingdome before and at his departure, and complemented by the Kirk as their deliverer, which he regeſted in as good Scriptural Language, laying his hand on his breaſt and demurely looking on their <hi>Scotch</hi> ſcrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faces, and laughing to himſelf what Ideots he had made of thoſe Polititians at their own ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Weapons.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59799:41"/>
            <p>In his way homeward he viſited the Seige of <hi>Pomfret,</hi> and was by the Commander in Chief againſt that place importuned, to ſee it reduced (it being beleived that his fortune or experience Maſtered all things) as he was afterwards at <hi>Scarborough,</hi> which being upon the point of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, he diſpenced, for the Honour thereof, to ſtay at the laſt place and have it delivered into his hands; and ſo poſted for the head Quarters of the Army then at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> having ſubdued all the oppoſition made this Summer 1648, where he vvas welcomed with the higheſt gratulations of his late atchievement, eſpecially by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, for as yet the Souldiers knew not what to think of him as to their nevv Agreement of the People, vvhich vvas novv began again and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red already by <hi>Ireton</hi> ſo much, as that he had it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, and promiſed to return it vvith ſome additions and amendments of his ovvn.</p>
            <p>And that proved that accurſed Remonſtrance of the Army, in vvhich all the former freaks of policy were inſerted to make up the number, but the burthen thereof was the Treaſonable Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Kings Death, and the altering the Government; for firſt they remonſtrated to the Parliament, That all perſons of whatſoever qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or condition, not excepting the King, that had been guilty of the blood ſpilt in the late War, ſhould be brought to juſtice and condigne puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Next, That a day ſhould be ſet for the ſummoning the Prince and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59799:42"/>appear and clear themſelves of ſuch things as ſhould be laid to their charge, and if they did not, then to be declared incapable of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Government. Many ſuch there were of the like Batch, but all of them concluded with a moſt favourable Aſpect to the Royal party, whoſe fines and compoſitions they pretended to have mitigated, and many more Good Morrows, on purpoſe to amuſe even them too, as they had deceived and outwitted the <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> This peſtilent paper <hi>Cromwell</hi> got delivered to the Houſe of Commons by a ſelect number of Officers, juſt as they had almoſt conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the King by a Treaty in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to the amazement and fright of all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Subjects.</p>
            <p>And here <hi>Cromwell</hi> terminated and centred all the crooked lines of his moſt Impious ambition, reſolving to ſtand or fall by this Concluſion, and therefore immediately, (the Army being then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to <hi>London</hi> to proſecute this Remonſtrance) as he had diſpatched Collonel <hi>Ewer</hi> to take the King out of the Cuſtody of <hi>Hammond,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him over to <hi>Hurſt-Caſtle,</hi> a moſt unhealthful place, ſo did be upon notice that the Parliament had voted the Kings Conceſſion a ground for a peace and ſettlement of the Kingdome, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Coll. <hi>Pride,</hi> a fellow who had not wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conſider his buſineſſe, to ſeize upon the avennues and paſſages to the Parliament Houſe, and exclude above a 140 Members, whoſe names
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59799:42"/>were given him in a Roll, which unheard of and unparallell'd Violation was back'd and ſccured by Force of Horſe and Foot quartering up and down the City and Suburbs, another lawleſſe and forcible Intruſion upon their Charter.</p>
            <p>The Houſe being thus purged as they called it, &amp; others beſides thoſe that were forcibly ſecluded, abſenting themſelves for fear of being engaged and overpowered in thoſe wicked Councells which this Action portended, the remaining <hi>Juncto</hi> of his culling, a great part whereof were Army Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers not amounting in all to 60. paſſed an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for Tryal of the King, the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by a High Court of Juſtice of his and <hi>Iretons</hi> own forming and Conception, was fully agreed upon, and the King brought from the ſaid <hi>Hurſt Caſtle,</hi> by <hi>Wincheſter, Farnham,</hi> and <hi>Windſor</hi> to St <hi>James's</hi> in order thereunto.</p>
            <p>But of this lamentable Tragedy ſo much hath already been ſaid, that I will not add this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary load to him here, though it were his principal guilt, and to which all his other perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations were but as ſubſervient.

            <p>The Collonel putting ſome confidence in what <hi>Oliver</hi> formerly had told him, willingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the Errand, and forthwith repaired to <hi>London,</hi> (juſt before the Kings Martyrdome) and found him out at his houſe, but ſo recluſe and lockt up in his Chamber, with an order that none ſhould know he was within, that he could not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till he had told his name. After mutual Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations the Collonel deſired a word or two in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, which being granted, he began roundly to tell him, of the flagitiouſneſſe of the Fact, now almoſt ready to be committed, and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtable it ſounded abroad, adding that of all men living he never ſhould have imagined that he would have had a hand in it, having proteſted ſo much for the King in his hearing.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59799:44"/>had prayed and faſted for the King but no return that way was yet made to him; whereupon the Collonel ſtepping back clapt the Dore to (to the agaſting of <hi>Cromwell</hi> who ſuſpected an aſſaſſinate) and coming cloſe to him, <hi>Couſin</hi> ſaid he <hi>it is no time to dally with words in this matter, look you here ſayes he</hi> (pulling out the aboveſaid Papers out of his Pocket) <hi>'tis in your own power not only to make yourſelf, but your Paſterity, Family and Relations happy and honourable for ever, otherwiſe as they have changed their name before, from</hi> Williams <hi>to</hi> Cromwell, <hi>ſo now they muſt be forced to change it again, for this Fact will bring ſuch an ignominy upon the whole generation of them, that no time will be able wipe away.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Cromwell</hi> here pauſed, and ſeemed to ponder with himſelf, and after a little ſpace ſaid, <hi>Couſin, I deſire you will give me till night to conſider of it, and do you go to your Inn, but go not to bed till you hear from me, I will conferre and conſider further about the buſineſſe.</hi> The Collonel did ſo and about one of the Clock (within an evening or two of the murther) a Meſſenger came to him and told him he might go to Bed and expect no other anſwer to carry to the Prince, for the Councill of Officers had been ſeeking God as he alſo had done the ſame, and it was reſolved by them all that the King muſt dye.</p>

            <p>The very ſame day appointed for this Murther <hi>Cromwell</hi> and the Officers aſſembled together, to conſider of ſome means if poſſible (with ſecurity ſtill to the Nation) of ſaving the Kings life, and many tediousexpedients were offered by ſome not ſo bloody as the reſt, &amp; a ſpeedy Remonſtrance to the Parliament propoſed, and in the mean while the King ſhould be Reſpited. <hi>Cromwell</hi> likewiſe ſeemed very forward, expreſſing how glad he ſhould be if ſuch a thing might be effected, for he was not ignorant, he ſaid, what calumny that action would draw upon the Army and themſelves in particular, though they did nothing therein but in obedience to the Parliament. But before we (ſaid he) proceed in ſo weighty a matter, let us ſeek God to know his mind in it; hereto they agreed, and <hi>Oliver</hi> began a long-winded prayer and continued in it till a Meſſenger whom he had appointed for that purpoſe, came rapping at the dore and haſtily told them that they need not trouble themſelves about the King for the work was done, which being unexpected to many of them, did at preſent aſtoniſh them while <hi>Cromwel</hi> holding up his hands,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59799:46"/>declared to them, that it was not the pleaſure of God he ſhould live, and therefore he feared they had done ill to tempt Him againſt his wil or words to that effect.</p>
            <p>When the Kings body was removed and Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, <hi>Cromwell</hi> to ſatisfie himſelf of the full and certain conſummation of all his practices againſt his ſacred life would needs ſee him himſelf, and upon his return thence was heard to ſay, <hi>That if he had not been a King, he might have lived longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other paſſages there were which concern this dolefull ſubject, both preceding and ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as namely <hi>Olivers</hi> Conferences with <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> at <hi>Ware,</hi> his feigned letters out of the <hi>North</hi> to applaud this Fact, and extolling the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Courage of the Army, by whoſe means it was, that the great Cedar of the Forreſt was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, without any noiſe, and now the time was comming when we ſhould rejoyce under our own Vines and Fig-trees—whence this Criminal had his leaves, and we Blood inſtead of Wine, but of this more then enough.</p>
            <p>With much craft and cunning did he now hide his daring ambition, for though it was thought as feaſible for him now to have ſeized the Crown as afterwards, conſidering that his Uſurpation was to be maintained by Arms, yet he well knowing what a Faction there was in the Army of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling principle, ventured not to put his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe Petitioners being ſeized, were tryed at a Councill of War, but for fear of too much exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Army were only ſentenced in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Coll. <hi>Baxter</hi> being then Preſident, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered judgement in theſe words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen; for ſo I think I may without offence call you, for as yet you are Souldiers; but truly you are not long to continue ſo: For you are guilty of high crimes, as your Letter here by you owned doth manifeſt, being Scandalous to the Parliament, Councel of State, High Court of Juſtice, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to breed mutinie in the Army; for which you have in an high meaſure deſerved death; but through the great mercy of the Court that is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and truly they have waved the Sentence again and again, and now they are come as low as poſſibly they can: and it being late, I ſhall declare unto you your ſeveral Sentences which are as followeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſhall ride with your faces towards the Horſe-tails, before the heads of your ſeveral Regiments, with your faults written upon your breaſts, &amp; your Swords be broken over your heads, and ſo be caſhiered the Army, as not worthy to ride therein; and a Proclamation to be made, that none ſhall receive you into any Troop, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or Gariſon. And this I would have you look upon as a great mercy of the Court.</p>
            <p>Which ſentence was accordingly executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, in the <hi>Great Palace-yard</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter, March 6.</hi> to the exaſperation of the Army.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59799:51"/>
            <p>Soon after, all the Army quartering near <hi>London,</hi> rendevouzed at <hi>Ware,</hi> where ſeverall Regiments among whom was <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s of Horſe, in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſame Petition and to be known to themſelves, wore white in their Hats; <hi>Oliver</hi> had intimation of it, and therefore he appointed two Regiments of Horſe from further quarters who were ignorant of this Combination to appear there likewiſe. Being all drawn up in <hi>Battalia Cromwell</hi> with an angry and down look rides round, and of a ſudden Commands one of thoſe two Regiments to encompaſſe a Regiment of Foot, which being done he commanded four men by their names out of the body, and committed them with his own hands to the Marſhal, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately called a Councill of War, (while the reſt of their partakers ſlunk their White Colours into their Pockets and trembled at this boldneſſe of <hi>Cromwell</hi>) and tryed and condemned them, but by the favour of the Court they were to caſt Lots for their Lives, two only to dye, by which means the two Guilty perſons and whom <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> chiefly aimed at, and luſty Fellows alſo, eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the two other ſneaking ignorant Fellowes were preſently ſhot to death, upon a green bank by the other two, in the face of the Army.</p>
            <p>But yet could not this humour be purged out of the Army, though another Leveller bled for it, one <hi>Lockyer</hi> a Trooper, who for promoting the ſame engagement and agreement was ſhot to death at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard, and was attended
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59799:51"/>to his grave like a Generall Officer, a thouſand people of the <hi>Lilburnian</hi> Faction following his Herſe all of them wearing Black and Sea-green Ribbons; Colours that denoted a <hi>Storm</hi> was coming, the whole Army being now generally leavened with the ſame principle &amp; furiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at this Butchery of their fellow Souldiers being avowedly egged on by the ſaid <hi>Lilburn,</hi> and ſecretly encouraged by the Royal party, who promiſed them their aſſiſtance in caſe they ſhould need it.</p>
            <p>And it was ſeen when too late by the Souldiery (the Inſtruments of that Tyranny) that they had borrowed their Libertiniſm at a dear rate, the price of their Lives; like <hi>Cratanders</hi> they ſhould rule for a while but then become <hi>Victimes</hi> to their ſhort ridiculous Uſurpation, while the Revenges of their Rebellion followed their endeavours after thoſe ſhadowes of their own caſting.</p>
            <p>The firſt formidable eruption of it was at <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> where Col. <hi>Scroops</hi> Regiment of Horſe laid aſide their Officers, and with their Colours march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thence, in order to a conjunction with <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Iretons,</hi> and <hi>Skippons</hi> Regiments, who had confederated (by means of thoſe Adjutators) in the ſame deſign: which affair admitting no delay, <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> with his own Regiment advanced to them, to <hi>Bagſhot,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Alton,</hi> where they had notice that they were marched to <hi>Abington,</hi> whither (after a tedious march of 40 miles in one day) the General came; and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:59799:52"/>fell preſently to work with his old arts of Treachery, for <hi>Harriſons</hi> Regiment was haſting to the Conjunction.</p>
            <p>His firſt fineſſe in order to their reducing, was the offer of a Treaty, wherein ſatisfaction might be mutually given, and that done, that neither party ſhould come within 10. miles of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereupon the Levellers marched to <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and being oppoſed at a Paſs called <hi>Newbridge</hi> over the River, to avoid any quarrel, and hoping the Souldiery there would no doubt joyn with them upon the Treaty, paſſed a mile lower, and arriving at the Town, relied ſo much upon the Generals and <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s engagements, that moſt of them had put their Horſes to graſſe, leaving a <hi>Corps de guard</hi> of ſome 60. men, the whole party making in all 900. conſiſting of 12. entire Troops, reputed the beſt in the Army, and whoſe defeat would have coſt many mens lives, if the Army would have ſtood againſt them. But to ſave that diſſiculty, while thoſe ſecure Troops were reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, and their Horſes put in the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meadows, about 12. a clock at night Coll. <hi>Reynolds</hi> fell into their quarters, having notice from ſome Traytors within of their poſture, and preſently maſtered the guard, not dreaming of ſuch a Camiſado, and ſeized moſt of the other, then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipling or aſleep.

            <p>Theſe peſtilent and alike dangerous Papers, (which in effect ſeemed rather an agreement then cauſe of quarrell between the Antagoniſts) were warily conſidered by ſome, even of Kirk-men who loved the King, as of ſudden and deſperate conſequence to his Majeſties Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo highly vilified and diſre-garded; ſo that a Declaration (to the liking of the Kark) was extorted from him, that there might no cauſe of pretence remain, either for their obſtinate car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards him, or ready compliance with the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army advanced again, and though ſeveral Bodies of <hi>Scotch</hi> Horſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they preſently withdrew upon their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; which that it might not be altogether fruſtrate, <hi>Cromwell</hi> in ſight of them cauſed a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon (called <hi>Red-houſe,</hi> within a mile and a half of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) to be Stormed, wherein were taken 60.

In which poſture

            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> at night, the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (making at moſt not above 12000. men) came to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> whither the <hi>Scots</hi> (keeping cloſe at their Heels) came alſo, and drew up their whole Army, conſiſting of between 20. and 24. thouſand men, upon a high Hill within a mile of the Town, to the great amazement at firſt of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but diſpair adding reſolution to their courage, they preſently drew out in Battalia in the Corn-field near adjoyning, and ſo ſtood all night, being incamped upon a Neck of Land, whoſe Breadth was not a Mile and a half from Sea to Sea; ſo that they were by Land quite coop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

In conſidence therefore of an aſſured Victory, <hi>David Laſhley</hi> who Commanded this Kirk Army in chief, began to advance as early as the Sun next morning, and drew down the Hill, fixing at the foot thereof, and about 4. a clock in the afternoon brought down his Train, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Ditch betwixt both the Armies. That night the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (by Command) placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cloſe to the Ditch, and placed their Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces likewiſe in every Regiment, that they might be in a readineſs in caſe the Enemy ſhould attempt any thing upon them, who were vainly expecting terms of a rendition; boaſting that they had them in a worſe pound then the King had the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> at <hi>Leſtithiell</hi> in <hi>Cornwall.</hi>

            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning at four of the Clock, a Brigade of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army drew down to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves of a paſs upon the Road, between <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>Berwick,</hi> which being had, they might with the more eaſe and advantage, make their way home, and in order thereto paſs over so

This Brigade conſiſted of three Regiments of Horſe, of Major General <hi>Lamberts,</hi> Commiſſary General <hi>Whal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Lilburns,</hi> and two of Foot. This gave the <hi>Scots</hi> a great Alarum, and a fore diſpute happened about the paſs, which laſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hour, the great Guns playing in the mean time againſt both the bodies.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59799:65"/>that <hi>Cromwell</hi> a little while before was choſen Chancellor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and honoured here with the publique Seal thereof, on purpoſe to ſtave off the rapinous, ſacrilegious hands of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who were a hammering upon an Act for the ſale of Colledge-Lands, to carry on their Wars; and <hi>Cromwell</hi> did (as was was well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected) undertake their preſervation, and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſome angry reſentment at the Parliament for this Barbarity, laying his hand as uſual upon his Sword; There was this remarkable herein, that the Delegates of the Univerſity declared not their main deſign till they had given him his Oath as Chancellor, which was thought of little ſecurity, but only that the ſolemnity of it might the better mind him to whom he had given it.

               <hi>Cromwell</hi> being at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> having notice how the King lay encamped at <hi>Sterling, Leſhlys</hi> Foot quartering on the Southſide, and <hi>Middletons</hi> on the North-ſide of the Park encompaſſed with a Stone-wall; and that abundance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was brought in daily, ſuppoſing they would march; drew al his remaining forces out of the weſt with as much care and conduct as could be, and encamped likewiſe in the Fields by <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in a readineſſe for them, whither to march or fight: But in the mean time he was taken very ill of his Ague, ſo that Doctor <hi>Wright</hi> and Doctor <hi>Bates</hi> eminent Phyſicians, were ſent down to attend his cure, &amp; many blith &amp; anxious diſcourſes were made concerning his Death, as either party wiſhed, for he was brought very low; but being recovered to ſome degree of health by theſe Gentlemen, it was preſently ſounded like a Proclamation: and I have therefore thought fit to tranſcribe a peice of the Letter, that the world may ſee what queer Hypocrites his attendants, like himſelf and his times were, by the pious nonſenſe and moſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous flattery of this Apocrypha Epiſtle.

            </p>
            <p>This Occaſion of his Sickneſſe, minds me of one paſſage of his Life, wherein was a <hi>Ray</hi> or <hi>Specimen</hi> of his <hi>Humanity.</hi> He had a Servant a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> one <hi>Dury,</hi> that attended him in his Chamber, whom of all his Retainers he beſt loved, and would hardly brook his abſence out of his Sight, whether for that he could more freely communicate his Privacies to a forraigner, who was altogether unconcerned in them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of greater ſecreſie and confidence; or for his diligence and care of his perſon, ſet off with his national fondneſſes &amp; inſinuations. This fellow dying not long after, <hi>Cromwell</hi> did paſſionately grieve thereat, and for the memory of this his dear Servant, made ample proviſions by a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for his relations, which continued during his Uſurpation.

            <p>The Engliſh Army in <hi>Scotland</hi> was now in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for graſs, and marched upon their old deſign of <hi>Sterling</hi> to <hi>Newbridge,</hi> ſo to <hi>Lithgow,</hi> from whoſe Caſtle Battlements, they might eſpy the Tents of the Scotch Army encamped in <hi>Torwood</hi> 4 Miles of this ſide <hi>Sterling</hi> (whither his creature <hi>Warreſton</hi> was now ſummoned by the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Aſſembly peremptorily by the third of

The Engliſh therefore, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back again, Major Generall <hi>Lambert</hi> being ſent from <hi>Glaſcow</hi> a week after to view the paſſes, which he reported by reaſon of the boggy approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches there, to be very hazardous.

                  <p>In purſuance of the providence of God, and that bleſſing lately given to your Forces in <hi>Fife,</hi> and finding that the Enemy being Maſters of the Paſſe at <hi>Sterling,</hi> could not be gotten out there without hindering his Proviſions at Saint <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtons,</hi> we by general adviſe thought fit to attempt Saint <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> knowing that that would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate Him to quit His Paſſe; wherefore

I do apprehend that if he goes for <hi>England,</hi> being ſome few dayes march before us, it will trouble ſome mens thoughts, and may occaſion ſome inconveniences, of which I hope we are as deeply ſenſible, and have, and I truſt ſhall be as diligent to prevent as any; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is our comfort, that in ſimplicity of heart as to God, we have done to the beſt of our judgements, knowing that if ſome iſſue were not put to this buſineſſe, it would occaſion another Winters War to the ruin of your Souldiery, for whom the Winter-diſſiculties of this Country,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59799:68"/>are too hard, and be under the endleſſe expence of the Treaſure of <hi>England</hi> in proſecuting this War.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſuppoſed we might have kept the Enemy from this, by interpoſing between him and <hi>England,</hi> which truely I believe we might, but how to remove Him out of this place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing what vve have done, unleſſe we had had a commanding Army on both ſides of the River of <hi>Frith,</hi> is not clear to us, or hovv to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver the inconveniences aforementioned vve underſtand not; vve pray therefore, that ſeeing there is a poſſibility for the Enemy to put you to ſome trouble, you vvould vvith the ſame cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage (grounded upon a confidence in God) wherein you have been ſupported to the great things in which God hath uſed you heretofore, improve the beſt you can ſuch Forces as you have in readineſſe, or may on the ſudden be got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give the Enemy ſome check, until we ſhall be able to reach up to him, which we truſt in the Lord we ſhall do our utmoſt endevour in; and indeed we have this comfortable experiment from the Lord, that this Enemy is heart-ſmitten by God, and when ever the Lord ſhall bring us up to them, we believe the Lord will make the deſperateneſs of this Councel of theirs to appear, and the folly of it alſo; when <hi>England</hi> was much more unſteady then now, and when a much more conſiderable Army of theirs unfoiled, invaded you &amp; we had but weak force to make reſiſtance at <hi>Preſton,</hi> upon deliberate advice, we choſe-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59799:69"/>to put our ſelves between their Army and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and how God ſucceeded that is not well to be forgotten.</p>
                  <p>This is not out of choice on our part, but by ſome kind of neceſſity, and it is to be hoped will have the like iſſue, together with a hopeful end of your work, in which it's good to wait upon the Lord, upon the earneſt of former experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and hope of his preſence, which only is the life of your Cauſe.

            <p>This ſhews what ſudden troubled apprehenſion He had of this well deſigned March of the Kings, and made him repent his obſtinacy of Honour in reducing St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> by which the King got 3 days March of him; but however he excuſed this to the Parliament (who were almoſt in deſpair, and terribly affrighted at the News of it) yet they did highly taxe him for his negligence, and ſpoke ill words of him, which came to his ears, and for which he ſoon after cried quits with them.</p>
            <p>The King departed from <hi>Sterling</hi> the laſt of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and came into <hi>England</hi> by the way of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and upon his firſt footing there was Proclaimed rightful Kin' of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and did thereupon publiſh his Declaration, wherein He offered His free Grace and Pardon (to be confirmed by an Act thereafter) to all His Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> of what ever nature or crime their offences were, excepting <hi>Cromwell, Bradſhaw,</hi> and <hi>Cook,</hi> the more immediate Murtherers of His Father; and therewith proſecuted His March, being proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame manner through all the Towns he paſſed.</p>

            <p>In the mean time the Parliament had amaſſed a numerous Militia in all the Counties of <hi>England</hi> and glad were the Members that the King ſtayed for them, for nothing was more dreaded then his continued march to <hi>London,</hi> which place would have ſoon ridded their fears, upon an approach of the Kings Army but 30. miles further from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> but to prevent that, as <hi>Eſſex</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the beginning of the War (whoſe firſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts took this way) <hi>Cromwell</hi> by long Marches through <hi>Newcaſtle, Rippou, Ferrybrygs, Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, Mansfield,</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> had interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himself, and joyned with his Army at <hi>Keyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where a General Council of all his Officers was held, and a ſpeedy advance to <hi>Worceſter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on, Lieutenant General <hi>Fleetwood</hi> being diſpatch'd to bring up his Forces, then on their

            <p>There were ſlain in Field, and in Town (in the laſt the moſt) and in purſuit ſome 3000. and ſome 8000. taken priſoners in ſeveral places, moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> eſcaping by their <hi>Shiboleth,</hi> the principal were Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who preſently dyed of his wounds, and at <hi>Newport</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> Earl of <hi>Carnworth,</hi> Earl of <hi>Kelly,</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> the now Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> Sir <hi>John Packing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Lord <hi>Spyne,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Clare,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Cunningham,</hi> Colonel <hi>Graves,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Fanſhaw</hi> Secretary to the King, 6 Col. of Horſe, 13. of Foot, 9 Lieutenant Colonels of Horſe, 8.

            <p>On the 12. of <hi>Sept. Cromwell</hi> came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and was met about <hi>Acton</hi> with the Speaker and the Members, and the Lord Mayor and the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59799:73"/>Recorder <hi>Steel,</hi> who in a ſet Speech congratulated his great ſucceſſes, and like a falſe Prophet, by a miſtaken Prolepſis, applied theſe words of the Pſalmiſt,—<hi>To bind their Kings in Chains, and their Nobles in fetters of Iron,</hi> in an arrogant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of his Atcheivements.

            </p>
            <p>He had now paſſed and ſurmounted all the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and troubles that the Intereſt of the Crown hither to had threatned, and nothing was wanting to the Completion of his aims, but the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, moſt miraculouſly preſerved and reſcued to the perpetuall diſquiet and vexation of this <hi>Would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be-Monarch.</hi> But becauſe that ſacred ſtory ought not to be blaſphemed with the impiety of his, I will not intermingle any of thoſe bleſſed Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of His <hi>Eſcape,</hi> with the direful deſignments of <hi>Cromwell's unobſtructed paſſage</hi> to the Throne.</p>
            <p>For having ſuperated all <hi>outward</hi> appearances of danger to his ultimate deſign, there remained nothing but a wretched and hated <hi>Juncto</hi> of Men with whom he was next to grapple; things ſo ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him and their Authority ſo ſcorned after this diſcomfiture of the King, that he never vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſed

            <p>And therefore at his firſt comming into the Houſe, (where he was entertained by the Speaker with the ſecond part of <hi>Steel's Panegyrick</hi>) a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſtarted for a new Repreſentative, and all the Codlings and Embryons of <hi>Tripl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The main whereof was the propoſal of a new Repreſentative to be equally choſen to ſucceed the preſent Parliament. A moſt abhominated and deprecated evil by the Members, who having done ſo much miſchief and incurred ſo much deteſtation for practiſing his and their mutuall deſigns upon the beſt Government and the moſt incomparable Prince in the world, were almoſt at their Wits end with madneſſe at <hi>his,</hi> and invention of <hi>their, (contra)</hi> devices.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were debating amongſt them and every day produced ſome freſh altercation and quarrell about diſſolving this and chooſing a new Repreſentative, which the Souldiers not only from their former principle as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Freemen but now as the Generalls <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and in obedience to his dictates and commands; with the pretenſory
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59799:74"/>advice of his Council of Officers unanimouſly and readily urged, (for he had brought the Army to his bow and diſciplined them to a moſt exact ignorant devotion and obedience to his ſervice during the <hi>Scotch</hi> War, where the diſtance of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth-men could not reach:) his ſecond ſelf his ſon in Law <hi>Ireton</hi> died in <hi>Ireland,</hi> juſt as he was comming to the fruition of thoſe grand projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had both conſpired. He had employed his Vice-government after <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s departure in reducing places held for the King there being no Feild ſervice ever after.</p>
            <p>He ſurvived not the totall Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to which he was by compact and <hi>Olivers Bull</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, but ſaw a very fair proſpect thereof in the rendition of <hi>Limbrick</hi> and the expected delivery of <hi>Galloway:</hi> and ſince this concerned <hi>Cromwell</hi> and the Agreement between them (which is moſt certain though none of thoſe ſecret compacts are diſcoverable) I will give the Reader his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and this ſhort account of his deceaſe here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Limrick</hi> being taken, <hi>Ireton</hi> marched to joyn with Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> to attempt ſomthing further, and together took in <hi>Clare</hi> Caſtle, but the weather not proving ſo ſeaſonable, and the Souldiers tired out with duty at the Siege of <hi>Limrick,</hi> they parted into Winter Quarters, <hi>Ireton</hi> back again to <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> in the way whither he fell ſick on the 15. of <hi>November,</hi> and after purging and bleeding and other means uſed, died of the Plague in that City on the 27. of the ſame month, the Commiſſioners
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59799:74"/>for the Parliament there ſubſtituting to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Army (while the Parliament or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral (for <hi>Cromwel</hi> was lately ſo made of <hi>Ireland</hi>) ſhould otherwiſe appoint) <hi>Edmund Ludlow</hi> the Lieutenant General of the Army in that Kingdom. On the 17. of <hi>December</hi> his Carcaſſe was landed at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and pompouſly diſmiſt to <hi>London,</hi> where it was for a time in ſtate at <hi>Summerſet-Houſe,</hi> all hung with black, and a Scutcheon over the gate with this Motto, <hi>Dulce eſt pro patris mori,</hi> how ſutable, that Countryman beſt told who Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it in theſe words, <hi>it is good for his Country that he is dead:</hi> on <hi>Feb. 6.</hi> following he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in <hi>H.</hi> 7. Chappel (being carried out with a pompous Funerall at which <hi>Cromwell</hi> was chief Mourner, and the Members of the Juncto atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants in Black with a great deal of State,) but hath ſince found a fitter repoſitory for his accurſed duſt. It was beleived by the Army who did credit their own conjectures and others impoſtures for want of literature that he was a perfect Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-man, and would have withſtood his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law in his ambitious intruſions upon the Parliament, and this becauſe he was the Drawer or Promoter of all the Levelling Fundamentals, but he prevented their juſter judgement by appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a greater and moſt exact Tribunal, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with rottenneſſe in the maturity of his deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:59799:75"/>He was abſolutely the beſt prayer-maker and preacher in the Army for which he might thank his Education at <hi>Oxford,</hi> though <hi>Oliver</hi> came but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle behind him, being very frequent and inſtant, now eſpecially, in ſuch devotions out of all ſeaſon and reaſon, but it was all one to the Souldiers who had nothing elſe to doe but to <hi>Prey</hi> and to <hi>Pray.</hi> The other qualities and conditions of <hi>Ireton</hi> were ſo congenial with <hi>Olivers,</hi> that in the proſecution of his ſtory I ſhall but tell the ſame things, the evil <hi>Spirit</hi> after his deceaſe being <hi>doubled</hi> upon him by a miſcheivous <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> a tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of ſoul, which aſſimilated their aſhes in the ſame grave at <hi>Tyburne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fortune of this Grand atcheivment at <hi>Worceſter</hi> ſubjugated all the Dominions of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Soveraignty entirely under the power of the free States, the Iſles of <hi>Scilly, Man, Barbadoes,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtophors</hi> ſubmitting and acknowledging their Juriſdiction, all which were reckoned by <hi>Cromwell</hi> but the Trophees due to his valour and the reward of his labour; and therefore all things thus flattering his conceits of Majeſty, He was angry with himſelf for permitting thoſe delayes to his eager Ambition, now complemented, ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tyred by many fine and pretty Evaſions of the Members, who wanted not moſt juſt pretences to detain the Government from his handling; but of this preſently.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:59799:75"/>
            <p>There was another thing in his eye which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him moſt of all and reſpited and ſuperſeded his deſign up on the <hi>Rump,</hi> which was the Illuſtrious Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> then a Priſoner at <hi>Carisbrook-Caſtle</hi> the priſon of His Father and the Cuſtody of himſelf; ſo long therefore as that Prince ſhould continue here, he could not expect that a ſingle perſon could be oppoſed to his right, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt danger from all parties, who to be revenged of their injuries would rather comply with the Royal Family then ſuffer his bold Uſurpation. Therefore to quit himſelf of that fear, he procured by his Party in the Parliament (who were reſolved to diſpoſe of him here in ſome ordinary profeſſion to make Majeſty more contemptible in the ſight of Men) that for the leſſening the charge of the Common-wealth, the ſaid Duke ſhould be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported into ſome place beyond Sea, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Exhibition of ſome ſcorned Penſion.</p>
            <p>The noble Duke being accordingly removed to the great content and joy of his Relations, who dreaded his Murther, and the ſatisfaction of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> who was Gorged with his Royal Fathers, another danger returned from beyond Sea in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of that exported: for the <hi>Dutch</hi> gave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Symptomes of a Rupture with this new Commonwealth whoſe inſolent depredations at ſea had moleſted and greatly damnified their Trade, and braved them to a revenge, upon a pique taken from their rejecting their offers of a Treaty and Amity and ſuffering their Ambaſſadours <hi>St John</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:59799:76"/>and <hi>Strickland</hi> to be affronted at the <hi>Hague</hi> while the affairs of the King in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were yet in ſuſpenſe.</p>
            <p>It was therefore a hazardous Enterpriſe to be fighting with two Common-wealths together, and to which his confidence and Reſolution could not raiſe him, without a ſurer intereſt in the people, who were to undergoe his Tyranny. This now reprieved the Members from his Decree of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, while they had tryed the fortune of war with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and had put things into ſuch a poſture and certainty, that no home alteration could diſcompoſe or diſorder it. The Treaſures for the ſupport of the War, being now a filling, a Naval force rigging and Equipping, and the Honour and glory of the Nation engaged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Thus far he caſt his Eyes to ſorraign Tranſactions: To return;</p>
            <p>At home the Parliament had a greater miſchief breeding againſt them then they feared from the moſt dangerous of their forraign Enemies. A dangerous impoſture of ambition, whoſe quabbing beating payns gave them no reſt, nor could all their skill tell how to aſſwage or cure it. It ſwelled every day more and more in continual addreſſes, deſires, petitions, declarations, till it came to be ripe, and then burſt out to the deſtruction of this political body. This was the reiterated and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſtory of the Parliaments providing for future equal repreſentatives and putting a period to this, then which nothing could be more diſtaſteful, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59799:76"/>of greater antipathy to the preſent members, which yet they did moſt artfully conceal, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in a hundred complying Votes and reſolves even to the aſcertaining of the longeſt day, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 5. 1654. for their ſitting, but that was two years too long for <hi>Cromwel,</hi> whoſe fingers itched to be managing a Scepter. In order to this delay, the Committee that firſt ſat and hatcht upon this bill were removed from the neſt, and the addle eggs put under the chil incumbency of other wild foul, and they to proceed therein with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, a thing ſo unlikely, that Sultan <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who expected a <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> brood, reſolved not to be baffled much longer, or await the leiſure of his mercenary Servants, as after a Faſt and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of him and his Council of Officers, and the Communication of the grounds thereof to the whole Army in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (which was a lamentation for the tedious continuance of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted perſons in the Authority, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious melancholy about Charity, the want whereof was greatly bemoaned) we ſhall fully diſcover.</p>
            <p>Every other day almoſt more Faſts, or ſome ſuch religious Exerciſe was managed by <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Harriſon,</hi> who mainly promoted the ſame Propoſals for a new Repreſentative, in order to the perſonal Raign of Chriſt, and that therefore it was high time the Government was placed in the Hands of his Saints, for all the glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies thereof were now ready to be fulfilled,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59799:77"/>and this was cryed up as the Doctrine of the Times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſeemed to be of the ſame judgement and of that Millenary Principle, deſigning (as he ſaid) nothing in thoſe Mutations of Government which were agitating, but in tendency to that great Revolution, ſo that he had abſolutely fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Harriſon</hi> into a confidence of his good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that he aimed not at his own greatneſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and thereupon all the party <hi>Harriſon</hi> could make which was <hi>Feaks, Rogers,</hi> and <hi>Sympſons,</hi> Congregations, were impatient to have the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment outed, and their fine module to takeplace, wherein Righteouſneſſe and Holyneſſe ſhould be exalted in the Kingdoms of the World. And now the Turk and the Pope were horribly threatned, and <hi>Oliver</hi> lookt upon as the great Inſtrument that ſhould confound Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>But though moſt of the Officers were thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd and beſotted, yet a great many of them had juſt and ſtrong ſuſpicions what his diſſolution of the Parliament would end in, and therefore ſecret conſultations were held how to oppoſe theſe practiſes upon the Parliament, in whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity conſerved and ſecured, they were ſo wiſe as to ſee themſelves ſafe and defended from the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter claps of the Rebellion; Among the reſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Officers of Note came voluntarily out of <hi>Ireland</hi> (as ſome out of <hi>Scotland</hi>) who had by their general Faſts perceived the Driſt of their General, to withſtand Him, and publiquely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59799:77"/>againſt the conduct of this buſineſs, as direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tending to the overthrow and undoing all, for which ſo much blood had been ſpilt, and giving up the moſt glorious Cauſe in the World, to its <hi>Nols</hi> own vanquiſh'd Enemies Argument.</p>
            <p>Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> nevertheleſs did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with him in every particular, the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign being ſecretly imparted to him, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſed as a reward for his Aſſiſtance, the ſucceſſion to the Supreme power. This intimacy of <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was of a long ſtanding ever ſince <hi>Preſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fight,</hi> and was cemented the faſter by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency <hi>Oliver</hi> took in his Wife; A Woman of good birth and good parts, and of pleaſing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions both for mind and body. The Voyce of the people was, that ſhe was more familiar with Him then the Honour of her Sex would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and that ſhe had ſome extraordinary kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for him which ſhe had not for her husband, and that being the Medium or Reciprocation of Intelligence between them, ſhe did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all her husbands deſigns, and conceal ſome of the others, though ſhe needed not to have been ſo ſqueemiſh, or reſerved for one, whoſe Depths were never fathomed nor diſcovered to any one mortall, <hi>Ireton</hi> excepted. Of thoſe that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him in the Deſign; Col. <hi>Venables,</hi> Scout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter-General <hi>Downing,</hi> and Major <hi>Streeter,</hi> were the moſt eminent, who to that purpoſe as aboveſaid, came out of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but Colonel <hi>Venables</hi> was ſoon wrought upon, and Mr. <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:59799:78"/>offering to ſpeak againſt it in the Council of Officers, and getting upon a Table for better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, was bid to come down by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him what he did there: only Coll. <hi>Streater</hi> perſiſted in his Reſolution of giving reaſons againſt it, and being flamm'd with <hi>Harriſon</hi> with Chriſts perſonal Raign, and that he was aſſured the Lord General ſought not himſelf, but that King Jeſus might take the Scepter; He preſently replied; <hi>That</hi> Chriſt <hi>muſt come before</hi> Chriſtmas, <hi>or elſe he would come too late.</hi> For this opportune oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and 10. Queries then publiſhed by him in the Army, he was committed to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> and look'd upon by <hi>Cromwell</hi> as his Mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>The next Scene of this applauded Comedy was laid at the <hi>Cock-pit</hi> by <hi>White-hall,</hi> where <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> concealing the number of the Beaſt in his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypſe,</hi> declared to his Council of Officers, <hi>That if they ſhould truſt the People in an Election of a New Parliament according to the old Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it would be a tempting of God, and that his confidence was, that God did intend to ſave and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver this Nation by few; as he had done in former times, and that five or ſix men, and</hi> ſome few more, <hi>ſetting themſelves to the Work, might do more in one day, then the Parliament had or would do in a hundred, as far as he could p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rceive; and that ſuch</hi> unbyaſſed <hi>men, were like to be the only Inſtruments of the peoples Happineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things had been offered to be debated
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59799:78"/>with a Committee, and a Treaty agreed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo many Officers, and ſo many Members ſhould meet, and argue the buſineſs, which ſignified on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the crafty Cunctation of the Parliament (who made Aſſes of the Sword-men) <hi>St. Johns</hi> being one of thoſe Referrees, with other reſty Sages of the Anarchy. By this means 4. or 5. Months were ſpent upon the Definition of an equal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative. But <hi>Cromwell</hi> growing teaſty, ſome began to make particular excuſes, others to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a new Repreſentative to his mind, and ſome to ſide with the Equity of his Propoſals, as moſt conſiſtent, well adviſed, and prudential means, to the Peace of the Nation; ſuch a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous colluſion, that I cannot but anticipate the Event of this Conſpiracy with this Truth.</p>
            <p>Upon his return from the Diſſolution of the Parliament back again to the Council of Officers, He acquainted them of his Exploit, and then told them, That now they muſt go hand in hand with him, and juſtifie what was done to the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of all their Lives and Fortunes, as having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and concurred in it. Adding, That when he went into the Houſe, he intended not to do it; but the Spirit was ſo upon him, that He was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled by it, and did not therefore conſult with Fleſh and Blood at all, nor did He preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate the doing thereof, though he plainly ſaw the Parliament deſigned to ſpin an everlaſting Thred, And becauſe there are few good Acts of his Life let the Reader <hi>ſcore him up One</hi> for the 23. of <hi>April</hi> 1653.</p>

               <hi>Oliver</hi> himſelf attended by Major General <hi>Lambert, Harriſon,</hi> and ſome 8. more Officers having after ſeveral conferences with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees (who ſhowed him the danger of calling a new Repreſentative as the caſe then ſtood with the Common-wealth, for that no qualifications could ſufficiently ſecure the intereſt thereof, and that the only way was to recruit the Houſe which could judge of ſuch Elections by their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) received no ſatisfaction, entred the Houſe (ſome Members being made privy to his deſign before, eſpecially Sir <hi>Gilbert Pickering</hi> who had held conſultation the night before with him, and was up armed in his Chamber till the very time) and after a Speech therein ſhowing the reaſons and neceſſity of that Diſſolution, did declare it to be ſo, and required them to depart; ſaying in ſome paſſion to ſome of them who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ask the reaſon of this, thou art a Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, thou a Drunkard, thou a Cheater of the publique; and preſently M.G. <hi>Harriſon</hi> perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily bid the Speaker to leave the Chair; which be refuſing to do without the Order of the Houſe, and till he was pulled out, <hi>Harriſon</hi> deſired him to lend him his hand, and gently heaved him out; <hi>Cromwell</hi> alſo commanded that Bauble (as he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Mace) to be taken away, and to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried no more in State before him, and ſo having turned them out of Dores, lockt them up and clapt Guards before them, and about all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Palace, to keep theſe ſpirits out from profeſſing it again.</p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:59799:80"/>
            <p>The News of this Luciferian fall, was quickly ſpred throughout the City, and from thence into the Kingdome, being related and received with all imaginable gladneſſe, while the Members ſlunk away, muttering to themſelves the affront they had received, and laying their heads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how to retrive themſelves, for loath they were to ſuffer this Violence, or acknowledge their Diſſolution, which they would by no means hear of. But what ever they fancied to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, raving at this boldneſſe and audaciouſneſſe of their ſervant, as they ſtyled <hi>Cromwell,</hi> he minded it not, but went on in his work.</p>
            <p>The Government (ſuch as it was) was now lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Council of Officers of his own making and preferring, and the firſt thing done by them after this new module, was the Emitting of a Declaration from Him and His Officers, ſhewing the grounds and reaſons of this Diſſolution of the Parliament, with an account of their intentions as to the preſent and future government of the Nation: which that it may appear by how ſlender a thread the Sword of this lawleſs Commander hung over the Heads of thoſe Parliament Tyrants, is very requiſite to be inſerted, it holding forth the preſent Intrigues of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s deſigns, and method of ambition.</p>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59799:81"/>that his Excellency and Officers of the Army, which were Members of Parliament, ſhould be deſired to move the Parliament, to proceed vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly in performing what was amiſs in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the ſetling of the Commonwealth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a foundation of juſtice and righteouſneſſe; which having done, we hoped that the Parliament would ſeaſonably have anſwered our expectations: But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (to our grief) delays therein, we renewed our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in an humble Petition to them, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in</hi> Auguſt <hi>laſt, and although they at that time ſignifying their good acceptance thereof, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us thanks, and referred the particulars thereof to a Committee of the Houſe, yet no conſiderable effect was produced, nor any ſuch progreſs made, might imply their real intentions to accompliſh what was Petitioned for; but on the contrary there more and more appeared amongſt them, an averſion to the things themſelves, with much bitterneſs and oppoſition to the people of God, and his Spirit acting in them, which grew ſo prevalent that thoſe perſons of Honour and Integrity amongſt them, who had eminently appeared for God and the publique good, both before and throughout this War. were rendred of no further uſe in Parliament, then by meeting with a corrupt party to give them countenance to carry on their ends, and for effecting the deſire they had of perpetuating themſelves in the ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For which purpoſe the ſaid party long oppoſed, and frequently declared themſelves againſt having a new Repreſentative; and when they ſaw
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59799:82"/>themſelves neceſſitated to take that Bill into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, they reſolved to make uſe of it to recruit the Houſe with perſons of the ſame ſpirit and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, thereby to perpetuate their own ſitting, which intention divers of the activeſt amongſt them did manifeſt, labouring to perſwade others to a conſent therein: And the better to effect this, divers Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions preparing from ſeveral Counties for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this Parliament, were encouraged, if not ſet on foot by many of them.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>For obviating theſe evils, the Officers of the Army obtained ſeveral meetings with ſome of the Parliament, to conſider what ſitting means and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy might be applied to prevent the ſame: leaſt that this Cauſe which the Lord hath ſo greatly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and bore witneſs to, ſhould languiſh under their hands, and by degrees, be wholly loſt, and the Lives, Liberties, and comforts of his People deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into their Enemies hands.</hi>

                     <hi>All which being ſadly and ſeriouſly conſidered by the honeſt People of this Nation, as well as by the Army, and wiſdome and direction being ſought from the Lord, it ſeemed to be a duty incumbent upon us, who had ſeen ſo much of the power and preſence of God going along with us, to conſider of ſome more effectual means to ſecure the Cauſe, which the good People of this Commonwealth had been ſo long engaged in, and to eſtabliſh Righteouſneſſe and Peace in theſe Nations.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And after much debate it was judged neceſſary, and agreed upon, that the Supream Authority
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59799:82"/>ſhould be by the Parliament devolved upon known perſons, men fearing God and of approved Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the government of the Commonwealth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them for a time, as the moſt hopeful way to encourage and countenance all Gods People, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Law, and adminiſter Juſtice impartially; hoping thereby the people might</hi> forget Monarchy, <hi>and underſtanding their true intereſt in the Election of ſucceſſive Parliaments, may have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſetled upon a true Baſis, without hazard to this glorious Cauſe, or neceſſitating to</hi> keep up Armies <hi>for the defence of the ſame.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And being ſtill reſolved to uſe all means poſſible to avoid extraordinary courſes, we prevailed with about twenty Members of Parliament, to give us a Conference, with whom we freely and plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the neceſſity and juſtneſs of our Propoſals on that behalf; and did evidence that thoſe, and not the Act under their conſideration, would moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably bring forth ſomething anſwerable to that Work, the foundation whereof God himſelf hath laid, and is now carrying on in the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The which notwithſtanding found no acceptance, but in ſtead thereof, it was offered, that the way was to continue ſtill this preſent Parliament, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that from which we might reaſonably expect all good things. And this being vehemently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, did much confirm us in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; That not any love to a Repreſentative, but the making uſe thereof, to recruit, and ſo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate themſelves, was their aim.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>They being plainly dealt with about this; and told, That neither the Nation, the honeſt Intereſt, nor we our ſelves, would be deluded by ſuch dealings, They did agree to meet again the next day in the Afternoon for mutual ſatisfaction, it being conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to by the Members preſent, that Endevours ſhould be uſed, that nothing in the mean time ſhould be done in Parliament, that might exclude or fruſtrate the Propoſals before-mentioned.</hi>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59799:83"/>our names, lives, families, or intereſts, how dear ſoever; with clear intentions, and real purpoſes of heart, to call to the Government perſons of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved fidelity and honeſty: believing, That as none wiſe will expect to gather Grapes of Thorns, ſo good men will hope, that if perſons ſo qualified, be choſen, the fruits of a juſt and righteous Reformation, ſo long prayed and wiſhed for, will (by the bleſſing of God) be in due time obtained, to the refreſhing of all thoſe good hearts, who have been panting after theſe things.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Much more might have been ſaid, if it had been our deſire to juſtifie our ſelves, by aſperſing others, and raking into the Miſ-government of Affairs; but we ſhall conclude with this, That as we have been led by neceſſity and Providence, to act as we have done, even beyond and above our own thoughts and deſires, ſo we ſhall and do, in that of this great work which is behind, put our ſelves wholly upon the Lord for a bleſſing; profeſſing we look not to ſtand one day without his ſupport, much leſs to bring to paſs one of the things mentioned, and deſired, without his aſſiſtance: And therefore do ſolemnly deſire and expect, That all men, as they would not provoke the Lord to their own deſtruction, would wait for ſuch iſſue as he ſhould bring forth, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their buſineſſe with peaceable ſpirits; wherein we promiſe them protection by his aſſiſtance.</hi>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59799:84"/>have taken our lives in our hands, to do theſe things, they would be inſtant with the Lord, day and night on our behalfs, that we may obtain grace from him.

                  <p>
                     <hi>We beſeech them alſo to live in all humility, meekneſs, righteouſneſs, and love one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and towards all men; that ſo they may put to ſilence the ignorance of the fooliſh, who falſly accuſe them; and to know, that the late great and glorious diſpenſations, wherein the Lord hath ſo wonderfully appeared in bringing forth theſe things, by the travel and blood of his Children, ought ſo to oblige them, ſo to walk in the Wiſdome and love of Chriſt, as may cauſe others to honour their holy Profeſſion, becauſe they ſee Chriſt to be in them of a Truth.</hi>

            <p>In the mean time <hi>Rous</hi> the Speaker (with the Mace before him and his Followers) came to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and there reſigned the Inſtrument he gave them, by which they were conſtituted a Parliament, and gave him likewiſe to underſtand how they had left their Fellows: Their ſurrender was kindly received by <hi>Oliver,</hi> and they thanked for the pains they had taken in the ſervice of the Common-wealth, however he and they had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of their intentions of the good ſhould thereby have come to the Common-wealth, which a ſtrange ſpirit and perverſe principle in ſome of the Members had ſolely hindered; and as to them yet Sitting in the Parliament-houſe, he diſpatch'd away Leiutenant Colonel <hi>White</hi> a Confident of his to diſlodge them, who accordingly with a Guard of Red-coats came thither, and entring the Houſe demanded them in the Name of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to depart, for that the Parliament was Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, who replying to the contrary, and telling him they were upon Buſineſſe, and ought not to be thus diſturbed; he asked what Buſineſs, they anſwered, we are ſeeking of God; Pugh ſaith he, is that all, that's to no purpoſe, for God hath not been within theſe Walls theſe 12. years, and ſo fairly compelled them out, muttering with the ſame wrath and ſorrowfull look-backs, as thoſe that had Sate 30. times the ſame term, and could almoſt have pleaded preſcription.</p>

            <p>Thus was the Power emptied from one Veſſel to another, as the Scribes and Chaplains of the Grandees phraſed it, and could find no ſettlement, till <hi>Oliver</hi> was called to it by his Council of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to ſupply this gap in Government: and now a Single Perſon with a Council is the only expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the ſafety of the People, for that there is no truſt nor truth in Parliaments, as their often abberrations and failures had ſufficiently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and it was diſcourſed by the Abettors of this change, that 'twas not Monarchy which was quarrelled at, but the corruptions and abuſes of it, in its unlimited, unbounded Prerogative, all which would be avoided, by the circumſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in a Protector, by his Council and a new Inſtrument of Government, and the ſupreme power of a Triennial Parliament, in whom during their Seſſion the Soveraign Authority ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>
            <p>So they ſaid, and ſo they did, for after 4 dayes time (in which <hi>Feak</hi> and his Freaking Partiſans were almoſt run from their wits in rage and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) <hi>Cromwel</hi> was appointed and declared for Protector of this Infant Common-wealth (and it was a tedious interval to him) the <hi>Chancery</hi> Court at <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> being prepared for the Ceremony of the Inſtalment in this manner, after the uſual ſeeking of God by the Officers of the Army.</p>
            <p>The Protector about one of the clock in the afternoon came from <hi>White-hall</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>

            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where as the late Parliament Diſſolved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and reſigning their Powers and Authorities; the Government of the Common-wealth of</hi> England Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>in a Lord Protector, and ſacceſſive Triennial Parliaments is now eſtabliſhed: And whereas</hi> Oliver Cromwell <hi>Captain General of all the Forces of this Common wealth is declared Lord Protector of the ſaid Nations, and hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted thereof: We have therefore thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59799:89"/>(as we hereby do) to make Publication of the Premiſes, and ſtrictly to charge and command all and every Perſon or Perſons, of what quality and condition ſoever in any of the ſaid three Nations, to take notice hereof, and to conform and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Government ſo eſtabliſhed. And all Sheriffs, Mayor, Bailiffs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are required to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this Proclamation, to the end none may have cauſe to pretend ignorance in this behalf.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>This Miſcellany of the Laws, and new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, ſuted a great many humours and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perſwaſions of the Phanaticks, Independents, Anabaptiſts and others, being the ſecond part of the Alchoran. And becauſe there is occaſion for it, we will diſcourſe a little of the preſent State of Religion, and what opinion <hi>Cromwel</hi> beſt aſpected. The Orthodox Proteſtants were wholly ſuppreſt, and yet ſome Reverend perſons, as Dr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Brownrig</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> received ſome ſhews of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence from Him, which he more manifeſtly boaſted in the funeral Expences of the Learned <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> and this to captate a Reputation of his Love to Scholars, and the meek, modeſt, and vertuous Clergy. The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> was rather tolerated then countenanced, and yet ſuch of them as would comply with his Court greatneſſe, were much in his eye and his favour; for others of them he cared not, pleaſingly expreſſing himſelf how he had brought under the Pride and Arrogance of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59799:90"/>that Sect, making thoſe that would allow no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to others, ſue for it for themſelves. The Independents and Anabaptiſts he loved and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by turns, and was moſt conſtant to them, as the men that would and did ſupport his Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; only he could by no means endure the Fifth Monarchy men, though by their dotages he had raiſed himſelf to this height; and therefore <hi>Feak</hi> and <hi>Rogers,</hi> were by him committed to Priſon in the Caſtle of <hi>Windſor,</hi> where they continued a long while, and not only ſo, but he ſet <hi>Kiffin</hi> the Anabaptiſt whom he had taken out of deſign into his favour, with his party, together by the ears, with <hi>Feaks,</hi> to the raiſing of a Feud between them, the Ballance of his Security in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The like he did betwixt the Presbyterian &amp; the Independent, a ſubdivided Schiſme from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Feaks</hi> and <hi>Kiffins</hi> were from Independency; whom when out of his zeal to the Unity of Chriſtian Religion, he ſeemed to bring together, to compoſe and accommodate all Differences; in the near probability of ſuch expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, he would divide and more irreconciliably ſever and alienate. And this was all his practical Devotion. But to return;</p>
            <p>Great ſhooting of Guns at night, and Volleys of Acclamations, were given at the cloſe of this mock ſolemnity by <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Janizaries, while the Cavaliers were more joyfully diſpoſed at the Hopes of the Kings Affairs, but no body of any Account giving the Uſurper a good word or <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiditche</hi>

            <p>I ſhould have mentioned the Dutch War in its place, which aggrandized him with the uſual victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſucceſſe; but becauſe, he was never perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally engaged in the Service, but owed this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as he did the glory of <hi>Dunbar</hi> to the noble General <hi>Monk,</hi> and wore but a ſecond-hand Triumphal Robe; I will not conſtellate Him with that Hero's Splendor and Brightneſs of Fame.</p>
            <p>That which properly concerns <hi>Cromwell</hi> is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Diſhonour of that War, the Peace that enſued the Concluſion of it; for the Stomach of that Nation had been ſo humbled by ſeveral great loſſes, their Trade ſo ſpoyled, and their Subjects ſo impoveriſh'd, that it was thought impoſſible for them to have equipped another Fleet, able to look out Navies in the Face; Withall there were ſo many Diſcontents and Diviſions in that popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar State, that they were ready to ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without any of our help, yet did this puny and unfledged Prince come to a Treaty and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them, upon moſt mean and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Terms, when it had been no queſtion but another rub at Sea, or beleaguering their Ports, would have brought them down to the Humble Complement of Our faithful Tributaries, which of how great advantage it might have been to the Trade, and conſequently the greatneſſe of this Kingdome, I take not upon me to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>His next Affair was a Concluſion of a League with the Queen of <hi>Sweeden,</hi> which he tranſacted
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59799:91"/>by the Embaſſy of the Lord Commiſſioner <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> who being commiſſioned at his Departure by the fooliſh Parliament, was inveſted with new Credentialls from <hi>Cromwell,</hi> whom accordingly he owned as his moſt ſerene Highneſs his Maſter.</p>
            <p>But that which he moſt aſpected, was the two neighbouring potent Monarchies of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> with one whereof he muſt of neceſſity quarrell, and ſo ſpend the ill blood, and convey away thoſe humors which were ſo redundant in the old Soldiery, both of the Kings and <hi>Eſſexes</hi> Army, and if not employed in ſome forraign war, would create him trouble at home; this the French Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, newly reſtored to the adminiſtration of that Monarchy, timely foreſee, and therefore a Treaty was privately and induſtriouſly carried on here by Mounſieur <hi>Bourdeaux Neufville,</hi> to an amicable Aſſociation and League againſt the <hi>Spaniard. Cromwell</hi>'s Covetouſneſſe and thirſt of Gold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing againſt his Intereſt and Ambition and thirſt of Malice and Miſchief againſt the Royal Family, which was now ſhaded under the <hi>French Flower de Lyzes,</hi> whereby all petſons expected an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from hence of that Kingdome, that if it were poſſible for his Treaſon, he might drive it out of the World.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Golden expedient, &amp; temporary Medium, of ſhifting the King and his Relations out of that Kingdome, by vertue of the ſaid League, wholly ſwayed and inclined him to a War againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> which not long after was commenced:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59799:92"/>The greater invitation thereto being Three ſhips pretended <hi>Hamburgers,</hi> but laden with the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Peices of Eight, whether for his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or no uncertain, that had been newly ſtayed and ſeized by the Court of Admiralty, at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of one <hi>Violet</hi> a <hi>Goldſmith:</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, <hi>Don Alonſo de Cardenas,</hi> proteſted and ſtrugled againſt it, were carried to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and there minted to the Sum of 400000. <hi>Sterl.</hi> This and other moneys in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> gave the greater courage to his Ambition, and his raw and unſetled Uſurpation. He had alſo now accepted ſatisfaction from the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and was entred into League and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Him.</p>
            <p>How many are the troubles, cares, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Tyrant greatneſſe. No ſooner is one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, one paſſion gratified and accompliſhed, but another diſquiet and danger invades or perplexes Him. No ſooner had he ſacrificed to his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, but now he muſt offer Victims to his cruelty the next Aſſurance of his hated Throne.

            <p>In this Convention <hi>Lambert</hi> laboured Tooth and Nail to have the Inſtrument confirmed, for by that the Protectorate was left undetermined and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective, threatning them that if this Parliament would not, they would call 4. or 5.

            <p>He publiſhed a little after an Ordinance for the Trial and Approbation of Miniſters, wherein <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llp Nye, Goodwin, Hugh Peters,</hi> Mr. <hi>Manton,</hi> and others, were named Commiſſioners, the queſtion theſe men put to the Examinants, was not of Abilities or Learning, but grace in their hearts, and that with to bold and ſaucy Inquiſition, that ſome mens ſpirits trembled at their Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they phraſing it ſo, as if (as was ſaid of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>) they had the Holy Ghoſt in a Cloak Bag; or were rather <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his own Diſciples; and certainly there were never ſuch <hi>Symoniacks</hi> in the World, not a living of value, but what a Friend or the beſt purchaſer was admitted into, to which humane learning even where a former right was, was a good and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Bar; no leſs to the ruine then ſcandal of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion and Profeſſors thereof; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War therefore commencing, the Protector began new practices againſt the Cavalier party, whoſe intereſt and ſpirit was againſt his Government as high as ever: he foreſaw that by the <hi>French</hi> peace, the King only ſhifted &amp; changed war from one quarter to another, and was yet as neer as ever, and in a more opportune and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous poſture, for that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and he would certainly concur againſt him, and ſo the Low Countries, his Provinces and Ports be open and at the ſervice of our Soveraign, therefore his party was by all ways, how unjuſt and tyrannical

            <p>For the better diſpatch of this Affair, He had erected a new Military Authority, like the <hi>Turkiſh Baſhaws,</hi> diſtributed into ſeveral Provinces or Counties, with an unbounded power, <hi>England</hi>

In ſhort there was nothing which they might not do; nor which they did not, ſuch an Arbitrary vaſt power they
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59799:103"/>had from the Protector. To this purpoſe a M. Gen.

            <p>The Barbarous Cruelty and Severity of theſe <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> to the Orthodox Clergy, while with the <hi>Hotneſſe</hi> of the perſecution it ſuffocated the true Religion, did warm and foſter the viperous brood of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As to the Fifth Monarchy men, he had neerly pried into that danger, and ſeized and took the chief of that party, among whom was <hi>Venner</hi> the <hi>Wine-Cooper,</hi> being engaged ſomewhat after in a Plot, in a houſe in <hi>Shorditch,</hi> where ſome Arms were taken, and and an Enſign with a <hi>Lyon cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>judah</hi> painted in it, having this Motto, <hi>Who ſhall raiſe him up?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hereupon <hi>Harriſon, Carew, Rich,</hi> Vice-Admiral <hi>Lawſon, Courtney, Portman, Day,</hi> and the like, were impriſoned in remote places, as Col. <hi>Overton,</hi> Major <hi>Holms,</hi> and others of the ſame party, had been ſeized in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Gen. <hi>Monck,</hi> according to <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Order, and ſent up Priſoners to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Levellers,</hi> he had lately diſcovered their practices and combinations againſt him, and had likewiſe clapt up the chief of them, one Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> in order to his Tryal being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at <hi>Marleborough,</hi> inditing and drawing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations againſt him; ſo that they were at a ſtand and a loſs which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay to proceed, to the unſetling and overthrow of his Tyrannical power; procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59799:106"/>by ſo many tricks and cheats put upon them by him; ſo that afterwards when they began pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Subſcriptions to Petitions, and Addreſſes to the Parliament againſt the Kingſhip, he peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily upon their peril forbid them to intermeddle with their Conſultations, and ſo awed and daſhed them, that they never offered any more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to hold up ſo much as a Finger againſt him. <hi>Lambert</hi> was the only impediment, and we ſhall ſee him neatly and quietly removed and diſcarded like the reſt of his former Confidents.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Olivarian</hi> Parliament brought together by theſe, means was not leſſe awed in its Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Major Generals (they themſelves and all their friends being returned for Members, while the Gentry and other Honeſt men being confined or under ſome qualification or other, could not, or dared not appear, particularly Col. <hi>Berkstead,</hi> and <hi>Kiffin</hi> the Anabaptiſt, by Voyces of Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotes got themſelves returned Knights of the Shire for <hi>Middleſex,</hi> with Sir <hi>William Roberts,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chute</hi> (4 as the Inſtrument directed;) then in the Admiſſion to the Houſe, where a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition of his Highneſs and the Government by a ſingle perſon, with a Guard of Soldiers was ready placed, and unleſs each Member ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the one, he might not paſs the other, by which means almoſt 200. were at the firſt daſh ſecluded, thoſe within taking no notice of the force, but referring the excluded to the Examination of the Privy Council.</p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:59799:107"/>
            <p>The firſt Work this Parliament did was their declaring the Juſtice of the War againſt <hi>Spain</hi> (the <hi>Cromwellian</hi> party perſonating the Intereſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Nation, that they might by that be looked upon for all this garbling, as a due Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, and to credit their enſuing By-blowes) and a Reſolution to aſſiſt the Protector in it; And next as the grand and Liminary work to <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Regality, <hi>An Act for the renouncing the Title of His Majeſty, and the whole Line of King</hi> James; ſeconded with another for the Security of His Highneſs perſon, in which they alledged the peace and ſafety of the Nation was bound up.</p>
            <p>And that this might appear moſt neceſſary and opportune, a Plot was hatched by <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Thurloe,</hi> for further quaſhing all Levelling and Fiſth Monarchy deſigns againſt that party; A Book had likewiſe been lately divulged, ſtyled, <hi>Killing no Murther,</hi> wherein it was proved, that it was moſt lawful, juſt, neceſſary, and Honourable to kill him, and this Printed with the Name of one <hi>Allen</hi> a disbanded Leveller, but ſo politely and learnedly written, that it intimated a more exact and curious hand; whoſe ever it was, it ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Cromwell</hi> almoſt out of his Wits, and made him betake himſelf to preventionary Artifices, and fright Aſſaſſinates with his Severity againſt the ſuppoſitious Authors of pretended dangers.</p>
            <p>This Scare-Crow was one <hi>Miles Syndercombe,</hi> a disband of <hi>Overton</hi>'s in <hi>Scotland</hi> by General <hi>Monck,</hi> a Leveller and Fifth Monarchiſt, both
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59799:107"/>which parties he conjoyned in this trap, as moſt feared by him: The wily Arts of <hi>Thurloe,</hi> who ſet one <hi>Cecil,</hi> and <hi>Trop</hi> of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Life-Guard, to urge this Male-content into a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of The Protector's Death; This was readily aſſented to, and ſeveral Engines and Inſtruments fixed for that purpoſe and places appointed, and <hi>Whitehall</hi> Chappel to be fired; all which was from time to time diſcovered, and <hi>Syndercombe</hi> after the laſt vain experiment, ſeized and arraigned, and after a careleſs defence convicted and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for Treaſon, which he avoided (as the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Jury gave their Verdict) by poyſoning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the <hi>Tower</hi> the night before his Execution, and was drawn at a Horſe Tail to <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and inhumed, and a Stake driven through him under the Scaffold.</p>
            <p>For this Delivery of his Highneſſe the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> voted a Thankſ-giving, and attended him at the <hi>Banquetting-houſe</hi> in <hi>Whitehall</hi> with a gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Oration, ſetting forth the Ruine that was intended in that horrible Treaſon to the whole <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion</hi> throughout the World, with the like paraſitical deſigned Falſhoods, but to the almoſt ſpoyling the Complement, the Stairs in the aſcending broke, and ſamed <hi>Richard Cromwel,</hi> and others, who for amends were invited to dinner there upon the Thankſgiving day; and that Courteſy requited by a more gaudy Gift.</p>

            <p>The ſuitable political talk of the party of the Uſurper, was now engaged in ſtrained Arguments for a Monarchy in the perſon of this their Ring-Leader, and this Maxime was broach'd in the News-Book, That there was no everlaſting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in Government as to any particular form; that Government is but a temporary expedient, that it is like <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltima tabula poſt Naufragium,</hi> in the hazzard of the Common-wealth the next ſhift may be made uſe of. The ſame was the inſpired reaſon into the Humble Petition and Advice, which after ſeveral debates and reſolutions was drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Conſiſtency, the main whereef was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Protector to change that Title for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of King. On the 9. of <hi>April,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59799:108"/>having deſired a Meeting with him, came to the <hi>Banquetting-houſe</hi> in <hi>White-hall,</hi> where Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington</hi> in a Speech, commended the Title and Office of a King, as ſetled here with Chriſtianity, approved by our Anceſtors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting with our Laws and Temper of the people, and then preſented him with the module of the Humble Petition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this tender, <hi>Cromwel</hi> in a fit of Devotion, anſwered, <hi>That it was a weighty matter, and therefore deſire a ſpace to ſeek God, that the charge laid upon him was too great for him to bear without His Aſſiſtance, that the Engliſh were the beſt people in the World, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired therefore all tenderneſs and conſideration of their Liberties,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The next day a Committee was appointed to attend him, and receive his Anſwer, which being inſignificant, they upon report thereof reſolved to adhere to their Petition, and appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of above half the Houſe to attend him, to receive from him his doubts and ſcruples touching any of the particulars contained in the Petition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to offer reaſons for his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the maintenance of the Reſolution of the Houſe, and wherein they cannot ſatisfie to report. The chief of this Committee were Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Glyn,</hi> Lord <hi>Breg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, Lenthall, Liſle, Philip Jones, Fiennes, Strickland, Thurloe,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Onſlow,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Woolfley,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:59799:109"/>
            <p>We have through theſe <hi>Labyrinths</hi> of his ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Deſigns, now <hi>clued</hi> him to his <hi>Luſtfull</hi> and <hi>adulterous</hi> Uſurpation, which the <hi>nocturnal pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of his <hi>Dream</hi> had ſo long before <hi>fancied</hi> and <hi>acted</hi> in his thoughts.</p>
            <p>This was the critical Time, and the very Junct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of his accompliſhment of all his projections upon the Crown, which now ſeemed to court his Browes by the complemental tender of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo pick'd and cull'd to his purpoſe. But it pleaſed God, to reſcue the Honour and Majeſty of <hi>England,</hi> from the prophanation of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; by ſome ſudden emergent dangers, and Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions he raiſed in his Breaſt, and to elude his Royal Phantaſmes with Rival and Democratick apparitions; His Oracles now ceaſed, and a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit was in the Mouth of his Prophets, who in their preachments harped upon this Subject. Now that the Reader may know how the whole myſtery and cabal of this Buſineſſe was managed by the above mentioned Committee (who would fain have drawn <hi>Oliver</hi> under the yoak of Laws, and retrencht his exorbitant power of the Sword) and <hi>Cromwell</hi> (who feared they would fortifie his Title, and weaken his Tenure, and had notice that <hi>Lambert</hi> laboured in the Debauch of the Army) He is here preſented with the ſum of that abortive Regal Conſultation, which like the Philoſophers Stone, or rather the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> vaniſhed and periſhed in the Attrectation.</p>
            <pb n="193" facs="tcp:59799:109"/>
            <p>After many Meetings and Conferences toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>White-hall,</hi> the Commiſſioners being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to receive his Highneſſes Scruples at his requeſt (the whole Affair being managed with Royal State and reſpect to him they came to theſe Diſputes. It was alledged by the Committee who were to offer and make play, that the Title of King had been confirmed by all Parliaments, for 1300 years, and the perſon, not the name, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to any of them. That it was interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the Laws, and the very conſent of this Parliament in being.</p>
            <p>To this the Protector anſwered, that theſe were ſwaſory not compulſive or convincing Arguments. That the Title of the Protector might be made accommodable to the Laws, by the content of the Parliament, as well as the Title of King was made ſo by the ſame; that the Title of King would be diſpleaſing to many godly men, and Officers of the Army, who had declared againſt the Title and Office.</p>
            <p>To theſe it was replied, <q>
                  <hi>That the Title ought to be accommodated to the Laws, not the Laws to them. That Invention of Titles was ſuſpected as the Veil or Concealment of ſome Deſign againſt the publique; and that therefore the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>had ſcrupled the new Title of King of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>to King</hi> James. <hi>That if he regarded not his own honour and Greatneſſe, yet he ſhould reſpect the Honour and Reputation of the Kingdome. That the name of Protector had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59799:110"/>been unfortunate to the Kingdome during the Minority of our Princes, and alſo to themſelves. That it being given him by the Soldiery it ſounded of Victory. That when the Kingly Title was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire, nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion followed, nor could the State find Reſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under Conſul, or Dictators, or Prince of the Senate, untill the pleaſure and will of</hi> Caeſar <hi>came to be acknowledged for Law.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Other inſtances there were of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, who ſeverally by order of the Committee delivered their Anſwers to Him, as namely the reaſon of the change of the Stile of Lord to King of <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>H.</hi> 8. time, for the better, and more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Government of that Nation, and Examples of a neighbouring Proteſtant Kingdome of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who had crown'd their Marſhal that took up Arms with them againſt their Soveraign, but their main Argument was drawn from the Statutes of <hi>9 Edw.</hi> 4. &amp; 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. by which all perſons were indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that took up Arms for the King in being, which was one and the chief reaſon ſaid <hi>Whitlock,</hi> why ſo many at firſt aſſiſted the King againſt the Parſiament, and would be his Highneſſes caſe and Security. And laſtly to his Argument of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing many godly men, and that Providence ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to croſſe the introduction of the Kingly Office by a ſeven years War to the overthrow of it: He was anſwered that the reduction of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to Monarchy, was a greater Act then from Monarchy to the Protectorate; that in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59799:110"/>ſome men would be unſatisfied, and that therefore his ſafeſt way would be to rely on this Settlement by the Parliament. But after all <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s Fears ſurmounted his Ambition, and he told then in a long <hi>Harangue,</hi> that He could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Title of King, being againſt his conſcience.</p>
            <p>The Protector having refuſed the Title of King (awaiting a more opportune time and advantage to reach to that top and heighth of his ambition, which inwardly tormented him) was now by the <hi>Parliament</hi> to be confirmed in his former dignity, and a Committee called of the Settlement was ordered to prepare an Explanatory part to the Humble Petition and Advice, in reſpect of the Protectors Oath, his Councils, the Members of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the other Houſe, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of 60. and od Lords of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Election, of which in their place we ſhall give an Account; all which with ſome Acts being prepared and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the <hi>Protector</hi> came to the <hi>Painted-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and ſent for the <hi>Parliament</hi> where the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tendred him theſe Acts of State, beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers relating unto Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>An Act for Aſſeſſement of</hi> 60000 <abbr>l.</abbr>

               <hi>(and this was the reaſon and ſoul of that Law.)

            <q>
               <hi>I perceive, that among theſe many Acts of Parliament, there hath been a very great care had by the Parliament, to provide for the juſt and neceſſary ſupport of the Commonwealth, by theſe Bills for levying of money now brought to me, which I have given my Conſent unto; and</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>it hath been the practice of thoſe who have been Chief Governours, to acknowledge with thanks to the</hi> Commons, <hi>their care and regard of the Publick: I do very heartily and thank-fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their kindneſs herein.</hi>

For his part nothing would have induced him to take this unſupportable burthen to fleſh and blood, but that he had ſeen in the Parliament a great care in doing thoſe things, which might really anſwer the

               <hi>Hill</hi> was one, being made a Baron of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, June 16.) then <hi>Norroy,</hi> the Lord Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, and the Seal car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Commiſſioner <hi>Fiennes,</hi> then <hi>Garter,</hi> and after him the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> with the Sword, born before the Protector, Bare headed, the Lord Mayor <hi>Tichborn</hi> carrying the City Sword (being the ſpecial of Coaks of the Protector) by his left hand: Being ſeated in his Chair, on the left Hand whereof ſtood the ſaid <hi>Titchborn</hi> and the Dutch Ambaſſador, the French Ambaſſador and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> on the Right; next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him ſtood his Sons <hi>Richard, Fleetwood, Cley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole;</hi> and the Privy Council; upon a lower deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſtood the Lord Viſcount <hi>Liſle,</hi> Lords <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> and <hi>Whitlock</hi> with drawn Swords.</p>
            <p>Then the Speaker (Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington</hi>) in the name of the Parliament, preſented to him a Robe of Purple-Velvet, a Bible, a Sword, and a Scepter, at the Delivery of theſe things, the Speaker made a ſhort Comment upon them to the Protector, which he divided into four parts, as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Robe of Purple, <hi>This is an Emblem of Magiſtracy and imports Righteouſneſs and Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice: When you have put on this Veſtment, I may ſay you are a Gown-man. This</hi> Robe <hi>is of a mixt colour, to ſhew the mixture of Juſtice and Mercy. Indeed, a Magiſtrate muſt have two hands,</hi> Plect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entem,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59799:113"/>&amp; amplectentem, <hi>to cheriſh and to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Bible, <hi>it is a Book that contains the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, in which you have the happineſſe to be well vers'd. This Book of Life conſiſts of two Teſtaments the Old and New: the firſt ſhews</hi> Chriſtum Velatum, <hi>the ſecond</hi> Chriſtum Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; <hi>Chriſt vailed and revealed: it is a Pook of Books, and doth contain both Precepts and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for good Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is a Scepter, <hi>not unlike a Staff; for you are to be a Staff to the weak and poor; it is of ancient uſe in this kind. It's ſaid in Scripture, that</hi> The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah. <hi>It was of the like uſe in other Kingdoms;</hi> Homer <hi>the Greek Poet calls Kings and Princes</hi> Scepter-Bearers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The laſt thing is a Sword, <hi>not a Military but Civil Sword; it is a Sword rather of defence then offence: not to defend your ſelf only but your people alſo. If I might preſume to fix a Motto upon this Sword, as the valiant Lord</hi> Talbot <hi>had upon his, it ſhould be this,</hi> Ego ſum domini Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectoris, ad protegendum populum meum, <hi>I am the Protectors to protect my people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Speech being ended, the Speaker took the Bible and gave the <hi>Protector</hi> his Oath: afterwards Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> made a prayer, wherein he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Protector, Parliament, Council, the Forces by Land and Sea, Government, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59799:114"/>of the three Nations, to the protection of God. Which being ended the Heralds by Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets proclaimed his Highneſs Protector of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereunto belonging: requiring all perſons to yeild him due obedience. At the end of all, the Protector with his Train carried by the Lord <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard Warwick</hi>'s Nephew, ahd the Lord <hi>Robert</hi>'s his eldeſt Son, returned in the ſame poſture, the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> ſitting at one end of the Coach againſt him, <hi>Richard</hi> his Son, and <hi>Whitlock</hi> in one, and the Lords <hi>Liſle</hi> and <hi>Mountague</hi> in the other Boot, with Swords drawn, and the Lord <hi>Claypool</hi> Maſter of the Horſe, led the Horſe of Honour in rich Capariſons to <hi>White-hall.</hi> The Members to the Parliament Houſe, where they prorogued their ſitting to the Twentieth of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He vvas novv ſetled and eſtabliſhed in his firſt aſſumed Dignity, to the ſatisfaction of ſome part of the Army, only <hi>Lambert</hi> vvas gravelled with that clauſe in it which gave the Protector power to name his Succeſſor. Whereby he ſavv himſelf deprived and fruſtrated of his Hopes, and that Contract that had paſſed betvveen them. <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> therefore to ſecure himſelf, ſet the Army Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment after Regiment to ſubſcribe Addreſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating his legal Authority, and declaring their readineſſe to aſſert Him therein with their lives and Fortunes; being the very ſame Method he had uſed before to prevent any Deſigns againſt him
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59799:114"/>in the Army, when he vvas left upon his ovvn bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome by the Parliament before.</p>
            <p>In the mean time a more potent enterprize was formed by the Kings Intereſt, and the appearance of the Marquiſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> (as my Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> from beyond Sea, was engaged before in <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruddock</hi>'s riſing in the Weſt) about <hi>Suſſex,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> forces for <hi>Flanders</hi> in the Kings pay and ſervice were to have been tranſmitted; but by the traiterous diſcovery of two former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Royalliſts, which <hi>Cromwell</hi> by great pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions had corrupted, one a Knight, the other a Miniſter, and one that a hand in the killing of <hi>Rainsborough,</hi> the whole Intrigue was diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Marquiſs narrowly eſcaping back again to the King, who was diſpatching General <hi>Marſin</hi> with his Forces then in readineſs.</p>
            <p>He was no ſooner rid of the danger of this, but he was puzzled with <hi>Lamberts</hi> Cabal, who had inveagled and almoſt debauch'd <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough Cromwell</hi>'s neareſt Relations with his but emulous pretended Democratick principles; ſo that <hi>Cromwell</hi> (having diſſolved the Parliament at their acceſſe in <hi>January,</hi> when according to the new Inſtrument the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> met in a full Houſe, who began and were reſolved to undo all again that had paſſed during their Secluſion, nor would own the other Houſe of upſtart Mechanick Lords, but flew ſo high as bringing <hi>Oliver</hi> into queſtion for thoſe confuſions of the State) was now in as tickliſh a condition as ever; therefore <hi>Lambert</hi> was gently
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59799:115"/>laid aſide, and his Commiſſion taken from him, and his Regiments taken from him and diſpoſed to better hands, and Spies and Eves-droppers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through the Army to give him intelligence of their Affections and Inclinations.</p>
            <p>This made him moſt ſuſpiciouſly fearful, ſo that he began to dread every perſon or ſtrange face he ſaw (which he would anxiouſly and intently view) for an Aſſaſſinate, that Book of <hi>Killing no Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> perpetually running in his mind; It was his conſtrant Cuſtome to ſhift and change his lodging, to which he paſſed through twenty ſeveral locks, and out of which he had four or five wayes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void purſuit: when he went between <hi>White-hall</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> by private and back ways, but never the ſame backward and forward, He was always in a Hurry, his Guards behind and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore riding a full Gallop, and the Coach always filled, eſpecially the Boot with armed perſons, he himſelf being furniſh'd with private Weapons; and was now of more then difficult acceſſe to all perſons.</p>
            <p>A Plot was again on foot, and like a Mongril deſign that had no iſſue, was made up one half by the Cavalier, &amp; the other half by himſelf (who was ſure not to be behind hand in ſuch deſigns) for which Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hewyt,</hi> and 3. other private perſons loſt their lives by a High Court of Juſtice, the Severity whereof ſo afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or affected the mind of his Daughter <hi>Cleypoole,</hi> that falling ſick with the pains and torments of an
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59799:115"/>Ulcer, in her inteſtines, which ſtopt her terms and made her frantick, ſhe never ceaſed roaring againſt that bloody man, her Father.</p>
            <p>He was now again adorned with another Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and Triumph, by the Defeat of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army and ſurrender of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> into his hands, <hi>Lockhart</hi> his Kinſman &amp; General of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, being made Governour thereof, which I am conſtrained to paſs without any further remark and from the height of this glory, level him with the duſt of other Mortals.</p>
            <p>This Kingdom was now almoſt ſtupified and tired out with ſtrugling againſt his Government and Domination, when it pleaſed God to call him to an account of all that Miſchief he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated; Uſhering his End with a great Whale ſome three Months before on the ſecond of <hi>June,</hi> that came up as far as <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and was there killed, and more immediately by a terrible Storm of Wind, the prognoſtick that the great <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> of men, that Tempeſt and overthrow of Government, was now going to his own place.</p>
            <p>He was taken ſick at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> having not been well in mind ſometime before (troubled with the laſt frantick words of his beloved Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Claypole,</hi> who threatned Judgement like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mad <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> and with the inſinuations and encroachments of the Republican party into the Army, nor were muſt of his Relations taint free of thoſe principles, but were winding towards them:) the diſeaſe was a baſtard Tertain which
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59799:116"/>appeared not at firſt of any danger, but after a weeks time it began to ſhew very deſperate ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, wherefore he was removed to <hi>White-hall,</hi> where his Chaplains and others of that pious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, kept private meetings and faſtings of which they were to vainly confident (as before) that they obtruded their unſeaſonable thanks to God for the certainty of it, and with the ſame unſeaſonable flattery and pickthank with the Protector, deluded him into the like perſwaſion, ſo that he told his Phyſicians, <hi>He ſhould not dye this bout;</hi> but the Fits proving worſe and worſe, and cauſing him to talk idely, and to faint often, They in Councell concluded, he could ſcarce ſurvive another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſme, at which the Privy Council being aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, they immediately repaired to him, about his ſettling a Succeſſor, whom by the Petition he was to declare in his life-time; but he was then ſcarce himſelf, which they perceiving, interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, if he appointed not his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> whereunto he anſwered in the affirmative. It was thought that he had deſigned <hi>Fleetwood</hi> in his ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate thoughts but the diſtraction of the choice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Son and Son-in-law, had made him leave it undetermined (a private Will relating to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily he made at his firſt ſickning at <hi>Hampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.</hi>) Continuing in this condition, he dyed on Friday the ſaid 3d. of <hi>September</hi> at 3. of the clock in the afternoon, though divers tumours were ſpread, that he was carried away in the Tempeſt the day before; His body being Opened and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59799:116"/>his Milt was found full of corruption and filth, which was ſo ſtrong and ſtinking, that after the Corps were Embalmed and filled with Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick odours, and wrapt in Cere-cloath, ſix double, in an inner ſheet of Lead, and a ſtrong Wooden-coffin, yet the filth broke through them all, and raiſed ſuch a noiſome ſtink, that they were forced to bury him out of hand; but his name and memory ſtinks worſe.</p>
            <p>The Corps (preſently after his expiration) being buried for the aforeſaid reaſon, a Coffin was on the 26. of <hi>September,</hi> about 10. at night, privately removed from <hi>White-hall</hi> in a Mourning Horſe, attended by his Domeſtick Servants, to <hi>Sommerſet houſe,</hi> where it remained in private for ſome dayes, till all things were in readineſs for publick view; which being accompliſhed, his Effigies was with great ſtate and magnificence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed openly; multitudes daily flocking to ſee the Sight, which appeared in this order.</p>
            <p>The firſt room where the Spectators entered, was wholly hung with Black: at the upper-end whereof, was placed a Cloath and Chair of State: In like manner was the ſecond and third, all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Scutcheons very thick upon the Walls, and Guards of Partizans placed in each room for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to paſs through. The fourth room was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly hung with black Velvet, the Ceiling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame; here lay the Effigies, with a large Canopy of Black Velvet fringed, which hung over it. The Waxen Picture lying upon it's
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59799:117"/>back apparrell'd in a rich Suit of Velvet, robed in a little Robe of Purple-Velvet, laced with a rich gold Lace, furr'd with Ermins: upon the Kirtle was a large Robe of Purple-Velvet, laced and furr'd as the former, with rich ſtrings and taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Gold. The Kirtle was girt with a rich embroydered Belt, wherein was a Sword bravely guilt and hatched with gold, which hung by the fide of this <hi>fine thing.</hi> In the right hand was a Scepter, in the left a Globe; upon his head was placed a Purple-Velvet-Cap furr'd with Ermines, ſutable to the Robes: behind the head was placed a rich Chair of Tiſſued gold, whereon was placed an Imperial Crown, which lay high that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might behold it. The Bed of State whereon he lay, was covered with a large Pall of Black Velvet, under which was a Holland Sheet, born up by ſix ſtools covered with Cloth of Gold. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Bed was placed a compleat Suit of Arms and at the Feet of the Effigies ſtood his Creſt. This Bed had fix'd about it an Aſcent of two ſteps; a little from thence ſtood eight ſilver Candleſticks, abut five foot high, with white wax Tapers ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, of three foot long. All theſe things were environed with Rails and Ballaſters four-ſquare, covered with Velvet; at each corner thereof was erected an upright pillat, which bore on their tops Lions and Dragons, who held in their paws Streamers crowned. On both ſides of the Bed were ſet up in Sockets, four great Standards of the Protectors Arms with Banners and Banrols
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59799:117"/>of War, painted upon Taffaty, About the Bed ſtood men in mourning bare-headed; and without the Rails others to receive people in, and turn them out again.</p>
            <p>When this Shew had been ſeen for many weeks together, the Scene was then altered; the Effigies being removed into another room, it was there ſet up, ſtanding upon an Aſcent under a Cloath of State; being veſted as it was before, lying: only now his purple-Velvet-Cap was changed for a Crown. In the ſame manner (as formerly) were men waiting upon him bare-headed. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he continued until the 23. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> which day was appointed to to carry him in ſolemnity to <hi>Weſtminſter-Abby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This great Funeral was performed with very great State, in this manner following. All things being in readineſs, the Waxen Picture of the Protector (with a Crown on his Head, a Sword by his Side, a Globe and Scepter in his hands) was taken down from his ſtanding, and laid in an open Chariot, covered all over with Black Velvet, adorned with black Velvet, and with Plumes and Scutcheons, and drawn by ſix Horſes in black Velvet. The Streets from <hi>Somerſet-houſe</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter-Abby,</hi> were guarded by Soldiers in new Red-coats and Black Buttons, with their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns wrapt in Cypreſſe: which made a Lane to keep off Spectators from crouding the Actors.</p>
