            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The famous Author <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> though eminent for Learning in his Country, and by his own Repute able to bear up againſt the Malevolent Bluſters of Envy, yet were his Poſthume Works glad to crave the Protection of Superiours, by whoſe Approbation, they have gone through the World, meriting the higheſt Applauſe.

            <p>IT is a Crime too incident to Humane Frailty to be finding fault, though they undergo the Laſh of the <hi>Satyrical Poet</hi> for it, <hi>Turpe eſt Doctori cum culpae redarguit ipſum;</hi> And I cannot expect to be free from ſuch <hi>Calumniators:</hi> But I hope better things from the <hi>Ingenious Readers,</hi> who, if I flatter not my ſelf, will be inforced to acknowledge, That if I have not arrived at the higheſt Pitch of the Author's Fancy, yet that I have not deviated from the ſame.</p>
            <p>You have here the firſt <hi>Riſe</hi> of the <hi>Quondam Poor Diſtreſsed States;</hi> which, as the Author confeſſeth, was by a Revolt from their Lawful Soveraign: And the Sacred Scripture parallels <hi>Rebellion</hi> to the <hi>Sin of Witchcraft.</hi> But, <hi>Succeſs</hi> brought in that <hi>Pagan Principle, Proſperum Scelus vocatur Virtus:</hi> And from this Step they aſſumed the Title of <hi>High and Mighty:</hi> Yet is it not forgot, that <hi>Babel</hi> ſhould have reach'd to <hi>Heaven,</hi> but was deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Our Author, as he ingeniouſly acknowledgeth the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Growth,</hi> ſo he often brings them forth with their <hi>Humble Suit</hi> for Aid and Aſſiſtance; and afterwards, with the Expreſſions of their <hi>humble and hearty Acknowledgments</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as their main Support, in their moſt diſtreſſed Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And with more Humble supplications to her,

Not to leave them to the Rage of their Enemies, but to continue them under the Wings of Her Protection; unto which Protection, out of her meer Mercy and Compaſſion, ſhe admitted them; Becauſe of the <hi>Inhumane Cruelties</hi> committed upon them by the Bloody Duke <hi>D' Alva:</hi> And though They in all humility offered unto her Submiſſion, as to their Prince, (ſuch was their low Condition) yet, notwithſtanding their Preſervation by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, ſo often acknowledged by Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they, like the ungrateful Snake, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deſtroy their <hi>Foster-Father,</hi> forgetting all their Obligations to <hi>England,</hi> and offering all the Violencies imaginable, which, with <hi>Amboyna,</hi> ſhall not now be particularized.</p>

This <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Conjunction, was a very great Augmentation: But now, as if grown more wiſe, as the Wealth of thoſe in Superiority over them mightily increaſed, they began to ſuſpect with a kind of Dread, from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Behaviour, which they had Opportunity

In which Interim, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> men of an unlimited Authority, emulous <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> being removed, as alſo the Cities of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> eſtabliſhed a kind of Eccleſiaſtical Kingdom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> being as Judges Laterall, they have aſſumed the height of Empire, and have continued in a long Series of Dominion, none in any manner contradicting them, becauſe moſt of the <hi>European</hi> Nations had received their Chriſtianity from inſtructors ſent from <hi>Rome.</hi> Hence it was that the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Latine</hi> Church were all received, and the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue onely uſed in all acts of devotion by the Church.

               <p>This was well pleaſing to the People, who weary of the charges and injuries they underwent, did exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, that now they ſhould no longer ſerve God, and ſeek for Heaven, with anxious dread, and in blind obedience, but with a more firm and ſetled confidence, and with fewer Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. Neither were ſome Princes backward in breaking in upon this Prieſtly Power, which had now almoſt ſubjected unto it ſelf the Kingly Diadem. But here the Proverb was truly manifeſted, <hi>the hand alwayes followes the hurt,</hi> certain people of troubleſome natures, that could not endure any quiet: what was publickly to be deſired, they will though pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, extort, and now they fall together by the ears about the manner, nor will they admit any to compoſe the differences. But it was no eaſie matter to pull aſunder thoſe joynts which for ſo many Ages had grown together. And the diſcompoſed face of Affairs was very diſpleaſing, the peoples minds being ſet a madding, and no apparent way to bring them into order again: for here were revived the opinions of <hi>Huſſe</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> of <hi>Wicliffe</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> whence by the meetings of their ſeverall Inhabitants by the company of the forreign Souldiers, and by commerce and Trading, they were tranſperſed over the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and grew common.

               <p>Of this endeavour and intention of <hi>Philip,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves were afterwards ſenſible, but the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders</hi> (for ſo for the greater part of them, are they to be called) being now maſtered into obedience, but yet not willing to bear an arbitrary Government, though they would ſeem to bear the yoke the better, from a long uſe, ſo that hence were hoped many great and ſeaſonable opportunities againſt Neighbour Kingdome both by Sea and Land.

That the very Collectors &amp; Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thereof ſhould pay towards the ſame: This was charged upon them as an unaccuſtomed thing, and a crime by them committed againſt their Liberty, which indeed then was but ſmall. Hereupon the meeting of the States being interpreted as a Meeting of confederacy, was ſtrictly forbidden: Nor did the <hi>Spaniards</hi> doubt to make the offence ſeem greater, ſome of them affecting honour, others minding only rapine, which while the Lawes ſtood, they knew would not admit them.

And ſome of the ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, eſpecially He of <hi>Leige,</hi> cryed out, the Pope was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented, and with all eagerneſs proſecuted their right. Hereupon many other Cities refuſed to receive their new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and who were admitted, were ſo generally hated, that they could never officiate without mocks and taunts.

               <p>What marvel is it now, that all things were in a deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition, when, in all their evills, the baſeſt flattery could rob them of their onely remedy. The adverſe party took notice of all, to little purpoſe, therefore it was for them to diſſemble how far their malice tended, in proſecuting, with hatred, the man that had been induſtrious for the King, more than they would have had; and therefore, the Miniſters of State, under <hi>Philip,</hi> were to inquire out any that were emulous of the Princes Power, and who thoſe ſhould be, to whom all would ſubmit in this great alteration, the Abbots were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their own private lucre ſake. The Nobility were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to theſe; and the reſt, under the notion of the States, were doubtfull, and in ſuſpence, for the uſe of their temporal uſages.

And the praiſe and thanks of diſſembling their Crimes, was ſo much the greater towards them, by how much he would divert them from the ſenſe of their evill, ſo that now, acting wholly as Victors, they had taken all things into their own hands, whether belonging to publick accounts, or to the Law, ſaying, it was the Soveraign pleaſure of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and that to it all the other Aſſemblies ought their Service and Obedience.</p>

Theſe thus diſperſed, the Regent, eaſily perceiving whence at firſt theſe perturbations did ariſe, betook her ſelf to <hi>Viglius</hi> his former Counſels, which had been ſlighted, to wit, to break the connexion and band which was between the Lords, and the better and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſort of the people; which ſhe brought to paſſe, either by her ſelf or others, with them that ſo receded, firſt by cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, by and by more openly, as if ſhe had been terrified thereby, would caſt out the falling away of others; for no ſooner was ſhe advertiſed by the private order of the Judges, that they had proceeded againſt the perſons who had committed Sacriledge in the tumult before mentioned, who had gone beyond words againſt the publick rites, even to the taking up of Arms, the reſt, knowing themſelves not able to go through with the management of their cauſe, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that they differed among themſelves in point of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, broke up their ſtrength. Nor did the confederate Lords, either by hope or fear, divided among themſelves, leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the Weal-publick: for Conſcience a little accuſing for their evill deeds, ſome of them running over and ſubmitting, obtained Pardon; others diſſwade the gathering of Taxes, and levying Bands of Souldiers, as things not fit for private men to undertake; another ſort, while thus every one was mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own particular, are forgotten by all. And now, for the better maintaining the peace of the State, the Regent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the <hi>German</hi> Souldiers, under the Command of <hi>Ericus</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> commanded another Regiment of <hi>Walloons</hi> to be forthwith raiſed; for by that name, the people in that part of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which borders upon <hi>France,</hi> are called, and are diſtinguiſhed from the others, by the uſe of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, and beſide, are more valiant, and not ſo dull-witted as the reſt; And that ſhe might the better chooſe able Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders over them, ſhe cauſed them to take an Oath, to that purpoſe contrived, that they ſhould take all perſons without

               <p>This Oath was taken by Count <hi>Egmond, Charles Arſcot</hi> of <hi>Croya,</hi> a perſon quite unconcerned in the former troubles. <hi>Charles Baylaymont</hi> and his Brothers; the Counts <hi>Peter Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> Governour of <hi>Lutzenburgh,</hi> Count <hi>Megem,</hi> Governour of <hi>Gelderland,</hi> Count <hi>Aremberg,</hi> Governour of <hi>Frizeland,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Noricum,</hi> that in <hi>Henault</hi> held the place of the Marqueſs of <hi>Berghen:</hi> And quickly did they begin to make the truth of their Oath appear by their actions; <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> infeſting thoſe in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the ſafeguard of whom he had undertaken.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Noricum</hi> marcheth againſt <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> where were others of the Rebels, and by Siege forcing them to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, puniſhed them with great ſeverity: by which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples terrified, the beſt and greateſt Cities, the troubles being thus for a time ended, received their appointed Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the reſt deſtroying and ſlaughtering all the remains of thoſe mad people, that they could find any where together: onely the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> and <hi>Hochſtraten,</hi> denyed to change their old Oath, by which they were obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the King and Laws, for any other; <hi>Aurange</hi> adding further, that his Wife was one of that number, which by that Oath were deſtined to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were in agitation, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (as they can ſee when they have an opportunity) did not ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhly manage that happy occaſion. And firſt, while the danger was yet ſcarcely removed, it was agreed almoſt on all hands, that the Preſence and Majeſty of the Prince would be very available for the quieting and compoſing of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the moſt faithfull and loyall among all the <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> telling and aſſuring, that if the King ſhould ſend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not come himſelf, it would produce more hate and leſſe obedience; which the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> the Kings Father, well knew, when upon a ſmall diſturbance, onely in

the defence of Religion, and the Laws, and to Protect the lives of Innocents, although therein they not onely diſobey the Kings Command, but reſiſt his Perſon. This did in ſome ſmall meaſure help the <hi>Naſsavians,</hi> becauſe they took Arms againſt <hi>Alva,</hi> the King being abſent, which they would have let alone, if he had been there; But they, who, in defence of the Kings Power and Greatneſs, boaſted, that they would lay down their lives, were, by a more fatall neceſſity, compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not onely to bear Arms, but to fight many bloody Battels againſt the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now were the <hi>Roman</hi> Ceremonies quite caſt out of their Churches, and who were of that Judgement, were not eaſily admitted unto any great Offices or Imployments; not that there was any Law againſt them, but it was ſo ordered cut of common Prudence, leaſt they bearing a grudge to all that diſſented from them, might, by that Licence, probably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn and ſeperate their own from the publick Cauſe, and the Diſcipline which was taught at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and here and there diſperſedly in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> was publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and owned; but with this difference, that many of the ſame Religion vary in the toleration of divers things; for the teachers in this ſay, not onely that Cities and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates were ordained of God, for prevention of injuries, either to mens Perſons or Eſtates, but that he commanded in what manner he would be worſhipped; but that ſaith, it is enough to worſhip at large; of which duty, many being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, had drawn upon themſelves the puniſhments due for the impieties of other men. But on the contrary, thoſe people judged it not onely fit to give them all ayd, but all of the Religion voluntarily did abhorre the very name of the Laws of the Inquiſition; and from thenceforth did diſpute, that no man would willingly go aſtray, neither could any man be forced to believe againſt his will; And that a true opinion in matters of Religion, was onely by God infuſed into the minds of men; no devotion being acceptable to

him, but what is voluntary. And that it hath been found true, that erroneous opinions have not been ſtifled ſo well by force and humane Laws, as eaten out by length and proceſs of time; Under theſe pretences and vizors, not onely the publick Rites of Religion were deſpiſed without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſometimes abſurd and impious diſcourſes would be publiſhed among theſe evills of too much liberty.</p>
               <p>Now were the Tributes and Revenues of the <hi>Prince, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monasteries,</hi> together with the Eſtates of all ſuch as were fled, and lived in the Enemies Country, and alſo all Prizes taken at Sea, brought into a common Treaſury for the publick uſe.</p>
               <p>1573. Then were found out the ſeverall names of Taxes impoſed on mens Heads and Eſtates; then were invented exactions under the names of Loanes, and Impoſitions laid, even on thoſe things which were conſumed by uſe; and all theſe increaſed more and more, as the Warre grew more fierce.

The Captains were yet not skilled in managing their Men, and the Men were untoward to be commanded: This onely helped them, that they had as much skill in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting and taking of Towns, as their Enemy: Hence it proceeded, that Sieges became ſo long, and the main force they uſed, was to ſtarve the Enemy out; till by many ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and wounds, they became more expert, having out of each others blood learned perfectly the art of Warre.</p>

               <p>Another party there was, whoſe Crimes had been no cauſes of the beginning of the Warre, who willing to preſerve their Loyalty to their <hi>Prince,</hi> and their duty and zeal to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, were very much in fear, leaſt by others violence they ſhould be hurried from the ſame.</p>

               <p>At laſt there hapned, when once they came to divide into parties, a thing not very ſtrange, that who would not ſubmit to Citizens, ſhould, without any regard of Covenants, be compelled to ſerve under a forraign Power.

other things relating to the raiſing of money. To the</hi> Hollanders <hi>and</hi> Zelanders, <hi>the uſe of their Religion (one being common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them) was freely granted in publick. To the reſt of the Provinces, Toleration either to uſe the ſame, or any other, or both, was allowed according to their pleaſure.</hi> The Governours were ſet forth in theſe words, <hi>The Magiſtrates, Council of every City and the Commonalty: for by an antient Law, the chief of the Townſmen, whoſe Age made them able to bear Arms, were went to be enrolled into certain Companies, like Bands of Souldiers; and this in time of Warre, was for Gariſon and defence, and in time of Peace, for a Fortification to maintain it; when yet the art of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality had not arrived to the Coufidence of relying on forraign helps:</hi> This Cuſtom and Badge of neglected Vertue, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and the uſe is by theſe late Commotions in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reſtored, while their faithful pains hath been imployed oftentimes againſt the Enemy, and for the allaying Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>In this manner, the <hi>Provinces</hi> which I mentioned before, took their Oath for performance of theſe Covenants, agreed on at <hi>Utrecht:</hi> And that they might the better be able to judge of their ſtrength, they commanded all the people, between the Ages of eighteen and threeſcore, to be numbred, as well of men inhabiting in Cities and Towns, as in Villages, and in all other parts whatſoever of the Country.</p>
               <p>But among thoſe Provinces, which were not preſent at the making this League: what, and how great troubles and diſſentions had they, while ſome part will concern themſelves in the care neither of the common Religion, or their Country, and others are drawn away by the vain hope either of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Peace, or the deſire and love of contention?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> held <hi>Boisledue,</hi> deſerted by the vain fear of the other party; they that remained, contracted with the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> that he would grant them that proper Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Peace, that they ſhould never be garriſoned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their free conſent: It hapned quite contrary at <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:55798:62"/>
for the common people of the adverſe faction remained their Superior, in a threatning poſture, ſetting upon all ſuch as had been imployed in the Solemnities of puniſhments: Not could the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> reſtrain his People, or hinder them from throwing out the <hi>Prieſts</hi> by force; though his Enemies interpreted to have been acted by his conſent and will, what he could not by any meanes reſiſt or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: for he was not given to cruelty, but was one, who would wiſely make uſe of an occaſion given, and for the gaining mens love to him, would lay before them long before the advantages they ſhould thereafter receive: But this made many of the people, who were deprived of their way of Worſhip in Religion, to wiſh evill, and combine againſt the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> becauſe they believed the Servitude they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent to the King to be more moderate; nay, ſome of the Nobles from hence alſo took occaſion to go over to the King. Among whom, <hi>Charles,</hi> the Son of Count <hi>Egmond,</hi> was one, who when he endeavoured to take <hi>Bruxells, Matthias,</hi> as was ſaid, not ignorant thereof, by the unlucky help of thoſe that followed the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, the reſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed him in the Market-place, as if he had been there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged; where then his own guilt, the Image of his Fathers death, and unrevenged Ghoſt, were all become tormentors to him; for there were them who objected, (and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome admiration of the chance,) that in the ſame place, that very day, eleven years before, the Father dyed by the hand of the Executioner, through the cruelty of that people, among whom the Son was now come as a Traytor to his Country: but at laſt, by the pitty of the Townſmen, he got thence away, and came ſafe to <hi>Nienove,</hi> who being received by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> was after by the power of his own People, as we ſhall relate, made Priſoner.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bruges,</hi> there was a ſharp and dangerous tumult, ſo that Arms were taken, and bloodſhed very hardly prevented; both the parties having ſet forth Souldiers that belonged to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55798:63"/>
them, the Bands of the United Provinces came firſt, being haſtned by the Magiſtrates; and this was the end of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention: the Tumults of other Cities were prevented by Garriſons; <hi>Ipre</hi> of its own accord, came and joyned it ſelf to the League of Union, and the like did <hi>Gaunt;</hi> and a little after the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> came into that City, by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and good will of all the multitude.</p>
               <p>So great inconſtancy was there in the reſolutions of the vulgar rout, and their levity being the ſame both in good things and bad: there, removing ſuch from Authority as had by violence intruded themſelves, he gave the Honour to others: Moſt of the Priſoners, which we mentioned to be there detained, being careleſly looked to, had broke out; the reſt that remained, the <hi>Prince</hi> ſet at liberty.</p>
               <p>And another thing, which proved as well to augment his Honour, as revive envy againſt him, was, <hi>That the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Flanders <hi>was put upon him, notwithſtanding his many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſalls to accept thereof:</hi> In the Embaſſey to <hi>Colen,</hi> there was nothing done, but what the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was well pleaſed with, to wit, that minds diſtracted to the hope of Peace, ſhould never adviſe well concerning the publick good: The <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors</hi> of both ſides complaining mutually, that their <hi>Collegues,</hi> by private agreements, were ſolicited againſt the peace, diſturbed by new Confederacies, not minding the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute or Eſteem of the Treaty; But the <hi>Dutch,</hi> becauſe of the preſent danger, for that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had gained much upon <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> a City partly belonging to <hi>Brabant,</hi> and partly to the Jurisdiction of <hi>Leige,</hi> as being ſcituate upon the Confines of both; and they could not get an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of relieving it, either with Souldiers or Proviſion, they deſired the time of the pacification might be freed from War, and they hoped the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> would aſſiſt them herein: But the Duke of <hi>Terranova</hi> denied that he had received any ſuch power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55798:63"/>Thus while a Truce is asked and denyed, while Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Peace begin to be offered, while the Inſtructions of the <hi>Dutch</hi> are found fault with, as being not free, but bound up to new Orders and Commands, the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had crept under the very Walls of <hi>Maeſtricht:</hi> when, after a four moneths Siege, he took the City by force, though the ſame were valiantly defended, and his own ſtrength not very great: But at Winter, he ſent away almoſt all the <hi>German, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers, retaining onely the Captains, and one Wing of <hi>Italian Cavalry,</hi> though later than was agreed by the Covenants made in <hi>Artoys;</hi> but yet this gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him <hi>Mechlin,</hi> with <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> and the City of <hi>Iſsell.</hi>

               <p>Beſides the Old Laws, there were ſome new ones added, for limiting the Government, according to the <hi>League</hi> made at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> to wit, <hi>That once every Year, the</hi> States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>of the</hi> United Provinces <hi>ſhould be Aſſembled; without whoſe Conſent, no League might be made with the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>by any Chief Commander in the War; and, at whoſe Requeſt, all Forreign Souldiers ſhould be Disbanded. In the ordering Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and ſetling Forreign Garriſons, every Province ſhould be alike concerned: The ſame ſhould nominate Three Perſons, out of whom their Governors ſhould be choſen: And if any Difference happened among them, the Duke ſhould have the Hearing and Determining thereof: That two</hi> French-men <hi>ſhould be admitted into the Senate; the reſt, at the preſent, to be be choſen by the States, hereafter by the Duke; But of thoſe nominated, as is beforeſaid: And that the</hi> Netherlanders <hi>ſhould have all chief Offices belonging to the Court. Four and Twenty Hundred Thouſand Florens a Year, were promiſed every Year to the ſupport of the War, out of the Prince's Patrimony, and that what wanted more, was to be ſupplyed out of the private Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Duke, or the King his Brother.</hi>

It were better therefore, and more ſafe to aſſay and try the <hi>French,</hi> who having been once taken tardy, will never hereafter ſeek ſuch an opportunity; or if they ſhould, would never have impudence enough, or courage to put it into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>About this time, there was a certain baſe Fellow, he was generally called <hi>Hog,</hi> that by Diſcourſe and Writing began to trouble <hi>Holland;</hi> who, notwithſtandidg his Mothers vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his own miſhapen Form, yet vainly boaſted the Honour and Greatneſs of his Bloud, as being (from his own Relation) Son to the Emperour <hi>Charles.</hi> Hence, fed up with a fooliſh hope by ſome <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for his Brother, he withdrew ſome led away with

Novelties; and others, that were not pleaſed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ordring of Affairs, from their then Principles, to a hope of Peace and Submiſſion to the <hi>Austrian</hi> Family. But the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy</hi> being yet green, and but in the Bud, was, by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of its Author, quickly nipped. Now alſo a War did begin in the Juriſdiction of <hi>Colen,</hi> which was offered, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Biſhoprick, to <hi>Erneſtus</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> for the <hi>Marriage</hi> of <hi>Truxiors:</hi> For being Biſhop of that place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and being taken exceedingly with the Love of a Noble Woman, had made haſt to lay aſide his Vow of ſingle Life, (for by the Rules of the <hi>Latine Church,</hi> no <hi>Prieſt</hi> may marry) which in the Heat of his promiſcuous Luſts was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily connived at: Wherefore, ſetting <hi>Humane Decrees,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Divine Laws,</hi> and finding himſelf unfit for ſuch Charges, by <hi>Caſimire,</hi> and <hi>Nienar,</hi> Count of <hi>Nurſa,</hi> both Generals for indifferent Armies, keeps the Cities, until by his Enemies Forces, and his own Mens Treacheries, moſt of his Garriſons were taken from him; and then making a <hi>League</hi> with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> he fled to the Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> whence he revenged him, as well as he could, by laying waſt the Country: And this War brings on a greater, wherewith the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was well pleaſed, becauſe he might thereby the more colourably involve the <hi>Frontier Towns</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> which were old <hi>Receptacles</hi> of <hi>Netherlandiſh Fugitives</hi> in the ſame: And this every day augmented the growing Fortune of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> eſpecially one <hi>Taſſo,</hi> a Captain, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by Surprize, the Town of <hi>Zutphen,</hi> held by a weak and ill agreeing Garriſon, and that by the help onely of one common Souldier that was his Priſoner: From hence all the Country, between the Rivers <hi>Iſſel</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> were daily infeſted and harraſed by <hi>Spaniſh Incurſions,</hi> nor could they at any time be hindred in their going off; and the City it ſelf was beſieged, but in vain.</p>
               <p>Thus did the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> at this time, loſe both their Forces, and other Opportunities; And as a further miſchief,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55798:77"/>
(many of Noblemen and Chiefs, utterly deſpairing any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy) privately ſought their own Security, from the Grace and Pardon of the King, which they knew was not to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for by ſome heinous Adventure. Therefore, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Heremberge,</hi> who by <hi>Marriage</hi> of the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi>'s Siſter, was the ſole Companion of his Hopes and Dangers, inconſiderately, and without Reaſon, Reſolved to deliver up <hi>Gelders,</hi> which he then Governed, to the <hi>Conquerours:</hi> But his <hi>Treachery</hi> being prevented, and Promiſe taken for his Fidelity, he was diſmiſſed; yet notwithſtanding, he fled to the Enemy, conferring nothing more of ſtrength to their Party, than that of his Sons, whom he compelled to Revolt with him, though not intangled or ſullied with his Crimes, nor inſenſible of their Honours.</p>
               <p>Now was the ſtate of <hi>Flanders</hi> very miſerable; <hi>Ipre</hi> was Beſieged by <hi>Parma:</hi> The <hi>Gauntoys</hi> had recalled <hi>Imbis,</hi> for no other Reaſon, than to revive old Enmities, and conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By theſe Subtilties, creeping into the thoughts of thoſe that interpreted the holy Scriptures to the People, he deluded the ſimplicity of ſuch as were not very circumſpect, but well meaning men, and by them was wrought into the affections of the vulgar.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Charles</hi> held no leſſe Correſpondence, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intelligence with the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> than <hi>Imbis</hi> did, though openly both of them, impriſon ſome of them, and not let them ſo much as come together.</p>

                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:55798:77"/>In the <hi>Interim,</hi> they had ſo obliged another part of the People to them, by a faigned zeal in Religion, that whoever did but ſuſpect, or ſiniſtrouſly interpret any of their actions, was ſure to incur a generall hatred: Theſe were the two, who undertook to betray into the enemies hand, all <hi>Flanders,</hi> a moſt noble <hi>Province,</hi> and then ſtrengthned with ſo many Cities: And firſt, that they might take the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling the <hi>French</hi> they began to talk of <hi>Caſimire,</hi> &amp; <hi>Truxius,</hi> making a League with <hi>Germany,</hi> not that there did any ſuch hopes appear, but that by the loſſe of time being left reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs, there ſhould remain nothing to be done but to ſubmit.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe Commanders of Peace, firſt had onely licence to parley; but afterwards, they had Authority to conclude; but they had ſo ordered their buſineſs, and informed the People, as if a Peace had been made, not with the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but with the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Cities which had revolted, for that bayt was more popular, and eaſie to be ſwallowed; adding moreover, that the King was ſatiſfied therewith, and content with that obedience which was due to him, would not rob God, but leave to him all things Divine.</p>
               <p>Now are both Books and ſpeeches caſt up and down, ſtuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bitter railings againſt the <hi>French</hi> and others, who had ſo long conſumed, as well the private as publike Wealth of the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> in ſo unequall a Diſpute: That now they had no Forces, nor the hope of any allyance or ayd from abroad, and the Victorious Armies of a moſt potent King, had in a manner, incloſed them round.

to alter their Condition: He took away their Princes, but never allowed a Sword in their Hand to remove them; That when the power of <hi>Warre</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> was once given to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there was nothing left to the Subjects, but <hi>Patience</hi> and their <hi>Prayers:</hi> Nay, that <hi>Piety</hi> it ſelf did rather chuſe to ſtrengthen it ſelf by <hi>Perſecution,</hi> than weaken it ſelf by <hi>Licu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs:</hi> Did there many ſuffer Death by Law, under the <hi>Emperour Charles,</hi> and Ring <hi>Philip?</hi> How many more have periſhed now by the Sword? And ſurely, they are moſt happy, who dyed not in their ſinne: In the Fury of Citizens, there is no diſtinction, all are alike miſerable; as wel they who do ſuch things, as they who ſuffer them: To an Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spectator, there will not appear to be the Cauſes of a War, as they are called; but the Ambition of a few, who by Domeſtick Dangers, have expoſed their Country to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</p>

               <p>Of this <hi>Auxiliary Army</hi> ſent to the <hi>Dutch, Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was made <hi>Generall,</hi> a great Pretender to <hi>Virtue,</hi> and who hid the unhappy and hated Spirit of the Family of the <hi>Dudleys</hi> (whereof he was a Branch) with an acceptable and courteous Behaviour. The Original of the Greatneſs of his Fortune, began firſt in a <hi>Priſon</hi> (for the Greatneſs of his Stock, had not exempted him from Troubles) wherein the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was then alſo confined, by the Suſpitions of her Siſter Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> In this place he gave great <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> to the young Lady, though not in regard of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Affairs at that time: From whence, by obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and partaking of Misfortune, a commiſeration and loving kind of pity aroſe; wherewith ſhe behaved her ſelf with ſuch a Womanly Indulgence, yet ſo that he might nor forget his more Manlike Care, that his Mind was ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated into a flattered Conceit of himſelf, as he imagined ſhe would chuſe him for her Husband, being <hi>Queen;</hi> which though he could never obtain, by the Emulation of thoſe who loved him not, yet was he raiſed even to the higheſt Pitch of Honour; and though ſurrounded with Envy, yet amongſt the moſt powerful of his Enemies, he paſſed without Affront or Moleſtation. When he firſt came among the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> he was followed by the Love and Affection of the People, and courted with the Flattery of the Great Men; for there was a certain pleaſant and winning Majeſty, both in his Countenance, and Speech; and he was really looked upon, as the onely <hi>Reſtorer</hi> of their loſt and decayed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. He uſed an excellent Freedom and Liberality, both in his <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Martiall Acts;</hi> wherewith the <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> were ſo taken, that in all haſt, to this perſon, though a Forraigner, and among his own people, not altogether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> before any tryall of his diſpoſition, the Government of the whole <hi>Netherlands,</hi> as it was in the times

of the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> together with the whole Command both at Sea and Land, and the ordering and diſpoſing of publike moneys was committed; The <hi>Senate</hi> alſo were ſo addicted to him, that they ſuffered him alone to chooſe Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants out of thoſe named, and in ſome manner, he alone eq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poized the notes and ſuffrages of them all. But his outward zeal in matters of Religion, was the great inticement of all beginning his Government with the ſettlement thereof: And the yet freſh hatred of <hi>Valois</hi> for the contrary, made him the more beloved. And there were ſome, who preferred him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Aurange,</hi> hoping he would not exact ſo much, in regard the way now to ſeek their right, was become ſhorter, in regard of their own Wealth, and the powerfull friendſhip of ſo excellent a <hi>Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe two great Honours, ſome judged to be beſtowed on him, to ſatisfie his ambition; but the more ſimply ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, only looked at them, as done with intent only to oblige the Queen further to them; but it fell out otherwiſe, for ſhe urged them to excuſe her, ſeeming as if ſhe were afraid, that they would unawares in the perſon of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> throw upon her the Government, which ſhe had before refuſed. But probably ſhe had, as knowing his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſome higher ſuſpition of him. Preſently, that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant evill of all power and greatneſs, flatterers incroached into his Boſom, by whoſe inſinuations, and his own ambition, (as there is nothing more naturall to a man) being envyed, when he was deſired by the <hi>States,</hi> to take the accuſtomed Oath in Solemn manner, and to receive the Enſigns of the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> he turns their favours againſt them, and, as it were, going into a <hi>Province,</hi> he enters into Conſultation with divers, but chiefly <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> how, and by what means he might compaſs the Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>It is here to be underſtood, that there is very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Natures and Diſpoſitions, manners and Cuſtoms of thoſe two Nations; for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as they ſerve

faithfully, ſo when they are raiſed to Honour, they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence their former humility with much inſolence and pride; But the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> obey and command in one equall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, no Nation having men of Eminency in greater eſteem, not hating, with a more implacable malice, thoſe who they find contemn them. Which <hi>Leiceſter</hi> not conſidering, and not acquainted with the Authority wherewith he was truſted, not taking notice of thoſe who truſted him with it, began to fling off all thoughts of reſenting, and to grow obſtinate in his Opinion (ſuch was his Confidence in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, and his preſent <hi>Grandeur.</hi>) And this was ſo much the more dangerous, becauſe he himſelf knew nothing of the Intrigues of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Affairs of State, nor would hearken to ſuch as had ſome inſight therein. Nay, the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> themſelves ſome of them took his part, but they were onely either ſuch whoſe Eſtates at home being waſted by their own ill Husbandry, or the Wars cruelty, whatſoever ſlavery they fell into, choſe it rather than poverty, the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of all, or elſe, who in the Country taken from them, having been bred in Honour, were now impatient to lead a private life, and ſaw no other way than that, again to riſe by; the reſt meerly lovers of novelty, for no reaſon, but becauſe it is new, to whom, in brief, as it always happens in like caſes of Sedition, all the looſe and villainous perſons joyned themſelves.</p>
               <p>With ſuch a Company was the <hi>Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> followed; and firſt, they began to caſt out oblique ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls againſt the <hi>States,</hi> which if they ſaw received with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ears, then preſently they fell to more open railings, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all of the faults, which it may be, ſome few were guilty of, as if all things had been known and underſtood by this over-buſie multitude, that conduced to their good.</p>

Nor were theſe the onely men to be found fault with about him; there were others very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with him, and privy to all his Counſels, whoſe Factious Deſigns were ſoon diſcover'd. Among whom, <hi>Ringaltius,</hi> one eminent in the Guilt of the <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> refuſed all the <hi>Tribunals</hi> of <hi>Judges;</hi> until at laſt, as a <hi>Renegado</hi> and a <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> he ended his infamous Life among the Enemies, in a miſerable poor condition: Wherefore, now innumerable Complaints, as it were all at once, were made to the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;</hi> returning from the War, to wit, That <hi>Warro</hi> and <hi>Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> being not poſſible to be Governed, without the Injury of the Citizens, againſt this, ſuch ſhould be put into Command as the People were pleaſed with: And there was added, That the Office and Dignity of <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> or <hi>Receiver Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,</hi> was given to <hi>Strangers,</hi> by whom it was deceitfully managed; That the Price and Value of Money was unſetled, and the <hi>Souldiers</hi> and other <hi>Charges</hi> of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> were not compared with the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> That the Commands of the Sea was betrayed, by the exhauſting the <hi>Navall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues;</hi> That <hi>Trading</hi> and all <hi>Commerce</hi> decayed; That <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> were beſtowed on thoſe, who in no wiſe merited them; That the <hi>Authority</hi> of all inferiour <hi>Lieutenancies</hi> was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him; and their Right, ſo many years maintained, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured and ſwallowed up in <hi>Garriſons:</hi> Nor was it paſſed in ſilence, that the <hi>Souldiers</hi> at that time hired, did not come, (concerning which, there was a Suſpition, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had been the cauſe thereof; as willing rather, that their own Forces and proper ſtrength ſhould be brought in) in regard the Numbers of them were ſmall, when the <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Commanders</hi> or <hi>Paymaſters</hi> had exhauſted the <hi>Auxiliary Numbers;</hi> ſo much, that they were neceſſitated to give way to the <hi>Enemy,</hi> not being able to withſtand his <hi>Victories.</hi>

               <p>This the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> took very ill; that Men from <hi>Shops</hi> and <hi>Taverns,</hi> ſhould come to make a <hi>Judicatory,</hi> who could bring nothing thither with them, but ſordid and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Arts, and Minds proſtituted to Lucre and Gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that he, a Man of that Birth and Quality, ſhould receive Laws from the Ignorant, and deſpicable Vulgar, and fight under the Banner and Command of Strangers. Much vexed hereat, he thought it would be a Work well worth his pains, if he could poſſible, to remove ſuch Clowns from the <hi>Stern</hi> of <hi>Government;</hi> for there is nothing more hateful to <hi>Nobility,</hi> than the Dominion of <hi>Peaſants,</hi> being generally ſharp Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of <hi>Oppreſſors:</hi> And this he thought might the more eaſily be brought to paſs, becauſe <hi>Strangers,</hi> and the multitude of <hi>Citizens,</hi> (which is far the greater) having no ſhare in the <hi>Government</hi> (as was ſuppoſed) would gladly hearken to this Equality.</p>

               <p>But the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> prepared to alter both theſe, and other long-continued Practices; not ſo much in a ridiculous Affectation of Novelty, but that by ſeparating the Nobility, and others, for Wiſdom eminent, from the reſt, he might draw them into Parties.

In this mean while, among the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> were bloody tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and as either party prevailed, ſo were bonds and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments inflicted; But where <hi>William Stanley</hi> delivered <hi>Davoury,</hi> and <hi>Rowland York,</hi> the Fort oppoſite to <hi>Zurphen,</hi> to <hi>Taxis</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who accepted of the Treachery, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the perſons, though both very intimate with the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> then many of the common people extolled the wiſdom of the <hi>States,</hi> and highly condemned their Treachery.</p>

Nor did he find the Rewards he hoped for there, no one daring, or at leaſt willing to lay any Confidence on him.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Confederate States,</hi> taking in their own behalf, the voluntary ſubmiſſion of the People, as well as of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, that the Calamity wherein the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, though for the preſent great, might be turned to good; they incited Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> to the affections of his Father, and now in the abſence of the chief <hi>Governour,</hi> they give him the whole Command of the War: Beſides, they required both the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Provinces,</hi> and the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> to take an Oath to the <hi>States,</hi> which hitherto had been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but was by the <hi>Traytors,</hi> and all other ſeditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that they might thereby the better conceal their crimes, and by the more ignorant, interpreted to the Honour of the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> as if it had been the Oath to the Queen.</p>
               <p>This done, the <hi>Edict</hi> againſt Exportations was reviewed, and moderated; ſo that to the peaceable <hi>Provinces,</hi> all things but only neceſſaries for War, might be carried.

to diſcord, if the fear of the publick Enemy be but abated; but the Government it ſelf loſt nothing, for what was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted by any means from its power, was doubly regained in the benevolence and affection of the People, for Honours and Licences were wholly granted by it, whereas Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Taxes and Subſidies, and other burthens were laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People by another hand. And beſides, ſuch is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the common People, that they will generally lay the fault of all miſcarriages upon thoſe who are moſt active in the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and yet for Victories they will only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one.</p>
               <p>The Nobles and more potent men, were wont by an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cuſtom, according to the hereditary right of their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, to govern the Country, and the Inhabitants therein, but Towns were left to be ruled by ſelected and choyce Citizens; and the Reaſon was, becauſe the People imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in multiplicity of Affairs, did not deſire to be called together, and aſſembled upon every occaſion of electing Officers, or making Laws; but out of them forty, or ſometimes fewer were picked, who afterwards meeting together, did conſult and deliberate of all things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and theſe were called, <hi>The wiſe and ſober men.</hi> And if death or baniſhment, took any one or more of them away, others are forthwith choſen into the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant places, who are eminent for their Prudence and Riches; and the Laws and Ordinances made by this Aſſembly or Common-Council, are, by the Conſent of the whole City, obliging to all, ſo that it is hardly found in an Age, that any People gainſay them, but are ready rather to fight in defence of the Authority of their <hi>Governours.</hi>

For three or four times in the year, or oftner, as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies of Affairs require, there is a Council ſummoned out of both degrees of the People, which is called the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the <hi>States:</hi> But the Nobility, becauſe they cannot eaſily meet from their ſeveral Remote Habitations, have conferred their Power and Authority upon ſome few, whoſe Riches and Honour is greater than the reſt, and they meet in that Great Council in the behalf of all.</p>
               <p>To theſe, in reſpect of their Quality, is only given the priority of ſuffrage; for every one of the meaner Ranks have a Vote equall to them: When therefore the Common-Council of any Town hath deliberated at home, concerning matters there propoſed, the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Aſſiſtants,</hi> are ſent to the great Convention, to give them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what they have ſo done, and thereupon to obtain their permiſſion: all other things that may happen, either by accident or conveniency, are left to their Prudence and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.

All the <hi>Infantry</hi> was divided into Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (for ſo we will call them,) every Regiment contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten Enſigns, and ſeldom more.

               <p>And that all theſe might with the more eaſe be paid, every <hi>Province</hi> took to themſelves certain Companies of Foot, and Troops of Horſe, to whom out of their proper Treaſure, they conſtantly gave their Pay: And as every <hi>Province</hi> thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd his proportion, ſo they began a new Cuſtom, which was, <hi>That they would in Vacancies, name the Captains, and other inferiour Officers under their Pay.</hi> The <hi>Captains</hi> themſelves managed the meaner Services; but they who governed the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> either for their Vertue, or out of Favour, would appear in ſuch as were more eminent.

At firſt, theſe Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were laughed at, by the Ignorance of thoſe who are aſhamed to learn what they underſtand not; but after the Succeſs of ſome <hi>Experiments,</hi> they were admired; becauſe hereby they that had turned their Backs in many <hi>Fights,</hi> now durſt ſtand and look the Enemy in the Face, and reduce by ſtrength Towns that they had loſt: So that now all did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſs, <hi>That as no man excelled his Father, in gaining the love of the People, and laying the Foundation of a Commonwealth; ſo by the great Bleſſing of Heaven, the Son was as famous, for the increaſing and defending the ſame.</hi> But how much the manner of the War was alter'd from the firſt uſe, will eaſily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the <hi>Context</hi> of the following Work. A conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Number of Ships are ſent to infeſt the Enemies Towns that lay by the Sea-ſide, and to guard the Paſſages of Rivers: Some go out, as a ſafe Convoy for <hi>Merchants,</hi> and to ſecure the <hi>Fiſhing Trade:</hi> Others ſail up and down, to ſcour the Sea of <hi>Pyrates:</hi> Without all doubt, in this, the Enemy was inferiour, who had very few <hi>Ports,</hi> and they incommodious, and not many Ships, which onely waited upon Towns. The <hi>Nobility</hi> on both ſide, either contented themſelves in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable careleſneſs, or the peaceable enjoyment of their Honours, with a kind of <hi>Neutrality</hi> for Envy, of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> on one ſide, and of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the other; or elſe out of an <hi>inveterate Stupidity,</hi> becauſe ſome cunning Princes, changing the <hi>Execution</hi> of their <hi>Military Offices,</hi> into <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Poſſeſſions,</hi> had taken all from them, and given them as
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55798:104"/>
a Favour to the other. Some few there were, that either out of Love and Thirſt of Renown, or their particular <hi>Diſcontents,</hi> did take up Arms, and do Service ſuitable to their Births and Qualities. Among the <hi>Commons,</hi> the young men, and ſuch as onely knew the Evil of the preſent Times, becauſe they had never ſeen <hi>Peace,</hi> were content with any condition of Affairs, not being ſenſible of the War, otherwiſe than by <hi>Rumors,</hi> and paying <hi>Taxes;</hi> and many, becauſe the Religion publikely received was not affected by them, for no other cauſe, followed the Cry. But the Laws of <hi>Holland,</hi> though many of them not very harſh in their Sanction, did ſorbid to the <hi>Catholikes,</hi> even the uſe of their Religion in private, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the like <hi>Orders</hi> had been the cauſe of ſo many former <hi>Tumults:</hi> The ſame alſo, by a kind of implicite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, put them from the chief Honours: But the <hi>States</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome mean Allowance to <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi> ſo long as they lived quietly, becauſe in many places their Poſſeſſions were laid waſt; but it pleaſed, by connivance, to ſuffer the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of other <hi>Sects.</hi> The <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Publike Religion,</hi> were admitted on neither ſide into the Council; nay, the whole <hi>Throng</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Perſons</hi> were beyond the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi> Finally, if the neareſt Troubles had been appeaſed, there would have been no ſuddain fear of new ones.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, There was another Party of <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> whoſe long <hi>Experience,</hi> and continual <hi>Converſe</hi> among Troubles, had made them now not gainſay the Cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55798:105"/>
thereby, were either ſuſpended or moderated, in regard of the War, and reſpect to the Enemy; becauſe the greateſt part having fled, that were <hi>Diſſeuters,</hi> the reſt had learned to obey, rather out of fear than puniſhment. On both ſides, <hi>Traffike</hi> and <hi>Merchandizing,</hi> together with the increaſe of Work-mens Wages, did readily ſupply the dearne's of Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, and other Things neceſſary for Man's Life; and alſo, the Prices ſet upon greater <hi>Commodities,</hi> and the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Field,</hi> which were ſomewhat ſcarce.

The <hi>Commonwealth</hi> had ſtill the ſame Face, Religion was controverted with like Animoſity, the War ſharply maintained with equal Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, and all hopes of <hi>Peace</hi> utterly laid aſide; ſo that now the <hi>Series</hi> of Things was indeed, in reſpect of its Actions,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55798:106"/>
various, but in it ſelf, not at all intricate: <hi>England</hi> was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by <hi>Spaniſh Forces,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> greedily thirſted after, not with a covetous Eye, or vain Wiſh onely, but by the ſad Threats of a Malicious War. It cannot be denied, but that his <hi>Treaſury</hi> is exceeding great, yet not ſufficient to maintain ſo many Wars at once; from hence becoming ſenſible, of all the Evils of <hi>Poverty.</hi> During this time, both the Minds and Forces of the <hi>Low-Countrymen,</hi> had ſome eaſe and reſpite, <hi>Leagues</hi> and <hi>Alliances</hi> were begun with ſeveral Kingdome, and in part again broken off: There the <hi>Praefects</hi> and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> often changed, and at laſt the <hi>Regent</hi> himſelf; <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> not reſting aſſured in the meanneſs of her Guard, and <hi>Treacheries</hi> moſt ignoble abounding every where: Whereas here, by the Vigilance and Ingenuity of one Captain, not onely Danger was eſcaped, but Arms advantaged; the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall</hi> and <hi>Maritime</hi> Power increaſed infinitely, and at once in <hi>Strength</hi> againſt the <hi>Enemy,</hi> and in <hi>Reputation</hi> amongſt others: ſo that now it might credibly be believed, that in the <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of both <hi>Parties,</hi> the War would now grow doubtful; for this time made it appear, that the ſmalleſt things might be waited on with humane hope, and that it was never too late to be helped by a Miracle. I am about to publiſh, according to the Method of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> what things have certainly been ſeen and heard; nor am I ignorant, how odious it is afreſh to being in mind theſe things among them, whoſe Hatred is yet raging; where by the poſitive and impartial Aſſertions of Truth, you may happily by the <hi>Enemy</hi> be accuſed of <hi>Flattery,</hi> and to your own Side not ſeem altogether free from untruths: But the Judgment and Reward of my Fidelity will proceed from <hi>Poſterity;</hi> And if God have, in Mercy, appointed any End to this grievous and bloudy War, it may chance there will be ſome, who drawing <hi>Arguments</hi> from hence, may give an Account thereof with greater Security, and more Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.

However, this may ſurely be believed, that there were many principal men in <hi>England,</hi> who were much troubled at the preſent ſtate of Affairs there, whoſe Affection to the <hi>Spaniard, Bernardinus Mendoſa,</hi> who, under the Name of an Embaſſadour, had lain there for many years, as a Spy in the Court, by his vain Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings had diſcovered: But whatever his Thoughts were, it appeared true afterward, that however the <hi>Engliſh Catholicks</hi> might differ in Religion, yet there was none of them ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, as to truſt their Lives and Fortunes to the undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Sword of a <hi>Forreign Conquerour.</hi> In all the Parts and Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and in <hi>Italy</hi> where the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had Command, there were raiſed and armed Twenty Thouſand

Men, and One Hundred and Fourty Ships, part of them of an almoſt incredible Bulk and Burthen, which afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the main cauſe of their Deſtruction. Among theſe, there were many <hi>Galeons,</hi> and <hi>Galeaſſes,</hi> which built high, with many Turrets and Cabines, like Cities or Caſtles ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Ships, were Rowed with Three Hundred Oars, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd over Head againſt the Shot, and caſting of Darts, or other like things, and their Belly and Sides made very ſtrong, the better to be able to bear the Violence of the Waves: <hi>Marriners</hi> were hired almoſt from all Nations to put into them, and they were Victualled with full Proviſions for Six Moneths, beſides a very great Maſs of Coin, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a War at Land, was in them, and Cannon, and other great Guns for the Land-Service, to the Number of Five and Twenty Hundred. And all this Preparation, the Work of ſo many Years, was publiſh'd in Print, to their own Glory, and the Terrour of others, that it might evidently appear a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Demonſtration of the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s Wealth and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Now though there were ſome that would have had Warre proclaimed with a <hi>Herald,</hi> yet others thought the Right of Claim from the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Sentence,</hi> would make out but a lame Title. But ſo great was their Confidence, that the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Counſel both of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> was diſapproved; which was, <hi>That the firſt Care ſhould be to get ſome Part belonging to the</hi> Hollanders, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all</hi> Flanders <hi>could not yield one ſafe Harbour for a Fleet, against the Hazards both of Warre, and the Sea:</hi> But moſt adviſed, <hi>That the ſurest Victory would be gotten by Delay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Army were preſently landed at the</hi> Thames, <hi>to aſſault the City of</hi> London.</p>
               <p>The Charge and Command of this whole Fleet was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Don Alphonſo Perez Guſman.</hi> Duke of <hi>Medina Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> a Perſon meriting that Honour, as well by the Nobility of his Bloud, as any other thing whatſoever; and, under him,

many <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the nobleſt Families in <hi>Spain,</hi> and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite others of inferior <hi>Gentry,</hi> had entred themſelves as Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but at their own charges, induced as was ſuppoſed, not ſo much by the covetouſneſs, as the aſſurance of getting very great booties. It was conſtantly reported, that they divided among themſelves, as the reward of their pains in the War, beforehand, as well Honours, as Lands and Houſes. There were taken among the ſpoyls of their Ships, many Ropes, Halters, and other Inſtruments of death and ſlavery, which they, as not doubting the <hi>Event,</hi> had prepared for ſuch as they ſhould conquer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spring</hi> growing now very forward, they met at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> whence driven into a Haven in <hi>Gallicia,</hi> they wanted three Ships, which by a cruel Tempeſt, together with Slaves that rowed them, getting their liberty, were thrown upon the Coaſt of <hi>France;</hi> In the mean while, the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> upon whom depended the principal part of the Expedition, with above thirty thouſand Horſe and Foot, lay in <hi>Flanders,</hi> having cut great Ditches, for the eaſier carriage of all his Forces to the <hi>Sea-Towns.</hi> He had brought thither eight and twenty Veſſels, ſerving to ayd other Ships of Burthen, and to hold his men, beſides near four hundred Flat-bottomed Boats, that might without hindrance come cloſe to the Shore, part of them being bought, and the reſt built by inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Labour and working night and day; He had ready alſo, Bridges for the better and more ſafe tranſporting Horſes and Men on a ſudden, as ſoon as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet had entred the Sea; But neither the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Hollander</hi> made any provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to prevent the danger of ſo great a <hi>War</hi> approaching, thinking they had been driven back by the Wind, or elſe vainly imagining, that Ships of ſuch Bulk and Burthen, would never venter, or run the hazard of their narrow Seas. Finally, ſome did not ſtick to affirm, that this was only a Convoy for the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleets return, although the King of

               <p>Thus did they flatter themſelves with Reports and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, not ſenſible of the greatneſs of the danger they were in, till it was afterwards avoyded.

given to the Lord <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> Earl of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> . The <hi>Vice Admirall</hi> was <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> (afterwards Knighted,) a Man eminently famous for his <hi>Victories</hi> at Sea, the fame whereof, he carryed with him in the compaſſing of the World, and moſt worthy in this great danger, to be called by his Country to her aſſiſtance. The Enemies Fleet was not far off from <hi>England,</hi> when the Queen, who herein had been deceived by falſe Rumours on purpoſe invented and ſent out of <hi>Spain,</hi> Commands by her Letter, the Lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Howard,</hi> that in regard She was informed, that the Fleet was not coming, or at leaſt would be a long time before they came, that he ſhould unarm and diſcharge the beſt of her Ships. He had ſcarcely performed her Command, before the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet appeared, when it was no ſmall care and pains to the <hi>Admirall,</hi> to recall his Souldiers, who had without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or fear, taken liberty to be abſent from their Quarters and duty, as ſuppoſing they had leave to do ſo. And no leſs was the <hi>Spaniard</hi> over-ſeen, in that he did not immediately fall on, when he might have taken them ſo unprovided, and at unawares. But the <hi>Commanders</hi> that were afterwards taken Priſon is, though they blamed themſelves for that over-ſight and folly, yet were heard to excuſe the ſame, by the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the orders laid upon them, and the nicities they were to obſerve in all points preſcribed, then which nothing hath cauſed the loſs of more fair opportunities. For <hi>Philip</hi> would not have his <hi>Fleet</hi> run any hazard, untill the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> by putting likewiſe to Sea, had doubled the terrour of their approach. But the Lord <hi>Seymor,</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Ships joyning together, kept him cloſe in <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> that he durſt not venter to break through with his ſmaller Veſſels; nor could the <hi>Spaniſh Fleet,</hi> though by that means it had eſcaped the following diſaſters, come ſo near the ſhore, being full of ſhelves and Quick-ſands, as to drive away the Enemies Ships, that were much more light and nimble: And that was a thing of great conſequence at that time, that no men did ſo
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55798:110"/>
much as ſuſpect, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (poſſeſſed as it were with a fatall and ſtupid blindneſs to their own ruine) had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to furniſh their Ships with many things which were neceſſary for them, out of hopes to have them from the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is to be noted, that his Ships, or the greateſt part of them, had few or no <hi>Seamen,</hi> and the Reaſon thereof might be, beſides the avarice of their Prefects and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> that there were very few <hi>Seamen,</hi> either bred in, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to any of thoſe <hi>Netherlandiſh Cities</hi> under his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And the <hi>Baltick Cities</hi> were not able to ſupply the number he wanted; and eſpecially, for that all who were forced aboard by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> took the firſt opportunity they could find to run away.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Interim,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Fleet</hi> was gotten together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and with very much difficulty, and hard Labour, by reaſon of a croſs Wind, at laſt got out from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> that they might at a diſtance annoy the Enemy. In which kind of fight, it eaſily appeared, whether was more advantageous, the Ships of great and heavy Burthen, or Veſſels more nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and expeditions to turn and wind at all Aſſayes, for few of the <hi>Engliſh Ships</hi> were equall in bigneſs, to thoſe of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but being more nimble, and apt to ſail, they could at any time get the wind of the Enemy, and either go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or backward at pleaſure; and if the Wind changing, drove them as it were upon the Enemy, by fetching a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, they eluded their expectation. And now there being a calm, ſo that the Enemy could eaſily come forward by the help of their Oars, they did not ſhoot common round Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, but chained ſhot, wherewith expanding themſelves, they not only tore their Sails and Tackle, but broke their Oars: by which means the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not come forward, or if they could, yet they kept back, not having a mind to fight. Their Ships were drawn into a long Rank, with extended horns, which as it made their Progreſs very ſlow, ſo alſo it
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55798:110"/>
made them more lyable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cannon to be ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And then if any Guns more ſharply annoyed them, they drew in their Mooned and creſcent Squadrons into the Body of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and that one might not go before another, bore leſs Sayl, neither could this be done altogether with ſafety, as was experimentally found by them, their Ships often falling foul upon one another, in their making ſuch Tryals. And this hapned to <hi>Valdez,</hi> a great <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain, and of the ſame Family with that <hi>Valdez</hi> who is memorable for the Siege of <hi>Leyden.</hi> For a Ship of <hi>Sevill,</hi> carrying eight hundred men, under his Commadd, fell foul upon another with ſuch impetuoſity, that the <hi>Fleet</hi> was neceſſitated to leave it, having loſt her Maſt, that ſhe alone might not hinder the courſe of the reſt.</p>
               <p>This being encompaſſed and aſſayled on every ſide, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf to Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and the Men in her, ſaved by his mercy, contended in prayſe of their <hi>Conquerour,</hi> even to flattery. At the ſame time, the beſt Ship of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> whereof <hi>Michael Oquendo</hi> was Captain, took fire. Some report, that the Man being a <hi>Netherlander,</hi> and that either mindful of his Country, or angry that he ſaw himſelf ſuſpected, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thoſe that begun the fire, upon the approaching of the flame, leaped into the Sea. Few of the Men were ſaved, but the lower parts of it, being untouched by the fire, became a booty to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Preſently after, they miſſed a Ship of <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſeverall other ſmaller Veſſels.</p>
               <p>During this, the <hi>Engliſh Fleet</hi> augmented with Recruits, and the flocking thither of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> who did ſtrive by their forwardneſs to manifeſt their affection to the Queen, was in many diviſions ſpread over the Sea, ſo that which way ſoever the Enemy ſteered his courſe, he was ſtill ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, and in every place torn with continuall ſhooting; wherewith ſo much <hi>Gunpowder</hi> had been ſpent, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now had the fight continued without ceaſing, at a diſtance, for the ſpace of eight dayes (for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers being fewer, and not able to cope with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> had ſhunned, by all means, a cloſe fight) and on the eighth of the Ides of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>

favouring the Deſign: But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being mightily amazed with the gliſtering of the Flame (for they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it came towards them, and gave a great Light over all the Sea) cut their Cables, and get out to Sea: In which Surprize, and violent Fear, one of the greateſt Ships, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Hugh Moncada,</hi> entangled with another Ships Cables and forced thereby to a Diſorder, was by the Violence of the Sea, and Force of the Wind, driven aground on the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt, and there the Sea-men and Souldiers, of whom there were in her, beſides thoſe that Rowed with Oars, Four Hundred, hoping for ſome Relief from the <hi>Continent,</hi> held the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> now invading and aſſaulting them with Ladders, in a long Fight, till <hi>Moncada,</hi> and many others, being kill'd, the Ship was taken, and by the ſpace of three whole hours ſpoiled.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Calais</hi> would not ſuffer it to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he might preſerve the Shadow of a Friendſhip, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> not having yet publikely profeſſed himſelf an Enemy to <hi>France,</hi> though it was believed, he had at this time a Deſign upon that very Town. The King loſt there in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money Fifty Thouſand Ducats, and Three Hundred Slaves were ſet at liberty. A few of the Ship-men eſcaped out by ſwimming, and were the firſt that brought into <hi>Spain</hi> the News of the Miſcarriage of the whole Voyage.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fleet,</hi> thus ſcatter'd with a <hi>Panick Fear,</hi> is Rallyed again near <hi>Gravelin,</hi> the next Town of <hi>Flanders;</hi> and though very much gall'd and batter'd with the Guns, and other <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Engines</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet they could not be forced to break their <hi>Orders</hi> any more: In this Conflict chiefly, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Deſign was ruin'd, and brought to nothing; for divers of their Ships being ſhot through with great Bullets, for that they could neither plug up the Holes or Breaches, nor free them from Water by their Pumps, were ſwallow'd up in the devouring and mercileſs Waves; Particularly, one <hi>Biſcayan</hi> Ship, that was very fiercely aſſaulted, while the Captains
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55798:112"/>
within it, between Valour and Neceſſity, diſſent in Counſel even to their Extremity, was immerged in the Sea. Two <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugeze</hi> Veſſels, being brought into the Mouth of the <hi>

               <p>The one of theſe Ships was called the <hi>Philip;</hi> the other, was named the <hi>Matthew.

               <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders, thus worſted in ſo many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, and all throwing the blame from themſelves, upon the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> began to conſult about their Departure; although they plainly ſaw, that the danger thereof muſt be overcome with many other Hazards: For back again, all the Narrow Seas were beſet; ſo that there remained but one help, which was to compaſs all the <hi>Northern Parts</hi> of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>

where the Rugged Ocean, not broken by the Land, is not onely boyſterous, but very ſeldom paſſed without the danger of Shipwrack. And if they had then been hindred, ſo great a Fear, both of the Sea, and their Enemies, had ſeized upon them, that it was reported, the Duke of <hi>Medina-Sidonia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to adviſe, whether he ſhould yield up the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and make Propoſitions for ſaving their Lives.

With all which, the Citizens of <hi>Berghen</hi> were nothing terrified, nor were as if they had been beſieged, becauſe both Souldiers and Aid, with all other things neceſſary for Defence, were plentifully brought to them out of <hi>Zeland,</hi> and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Cities of <hi>Holland,</hi> they fought either with Horſe or Foot, as if it had been two Camps one againſt another, many light Skirmiſhes, but never without drawing bloud from the Enemy: Nor was the Souldiers Valour onely exemplary, but the Townſmens Labour, ſpent in fortifying the place, was notable; but moſt laudable of all, was the Concord between the Captains and the Magiſtrates, whereby they raiſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without grumbling by extraordinary Taxes.

               <p>Thus imagining there had been caution enough uſed, and that having ſlighted their own, they would not decline the Aid and Protection of Strangers: Upon this Confidence therefore Three Thouſand Men, and among them many of great quality, were drawn out to undertake the ſeizing of the Caſtle; The Gate was open, till fifty were entred, and thus far the Event made good their Promiſes: But then preſently a Port-Cullis, the Ropes that held it being cut, was let down, and all that were come in, were kill'd or taken; nor did the <hi>Spaniſh Keepers</hi> mind the killing of the two bound Traytors, being amazed with ſuddain fear, and dreading the Fury of preſent Revenge.

So that the main of their ſtrength either conſiſted under the pretence of the Kings name, or the affections of the vulgar, which are mean ſupports, and of no duration, where there is any experiment of utility on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. And the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have within themſelves, the whole ſtrength of that one People; ſo that they diminiſh their own Authority by tyrannizing, and wholly looſe what is ſpent in revenge. And the very Commons, though highly offended with the differences in Religion, yet when once they became ſenſible of the miſeries of War, were not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of revenge as Peace.</p>
               <p>Hence proceeded thoſe Edicts of Peace ſo often haſtned, ſo often withſtood by the now divided affections of the People, who might rather be ſaid to lay aſide War, than to make and obſerve a Peace; for being weary of a long War, they were driven to force and treachery, by the impulſe of others, not their own obſtinacy, and being always accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Kingly Government, they might have been compoſed before, if the one King, famouſly knowing in the Arts both
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55798:126"/>
of War and Peace, had tempered himſelf and his Laws, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrength and prevalence of parties. They who were newly gotten into power, being ignorant how to uſe the time, nouriſhed diſcords by variety of evill deeds, while they of a more active Spirit, or ſuch whoſe Riot inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated them, either got or loſt all, and this was the only hindrance of Peace. But on the other ſide, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a King that wiſhed the ſame things in hatred to the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> liberty, and who was now grown old in the enjoyment of his <hi>Territories,</hi> by the keeping abroad ſo great Forces, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver feared the <hi>Netherlandiſh Solitudes,</hi> eſpecially having Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, both in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> that where they could not ſubject into <hi>Provinces,</hi> they ſhould ſettle Colonies. But the <hi>French</hi> were highly offended with the pride, avarice, and cruelty of this forraign Nation, the very <hi>Catholikes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who had never faltered in point of Religion, diſliking their Cuſtoms, ſome of whom having been before circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and deluded with the hope of better things, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an example to the reſt, that they would with all violence exerciſe their malice, as miſtruſting the breach of Peace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion, to hide their revenge.</p>
               <p>Thus a War, no leſs cruel than civill Wars uſe to be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, but ſtill looked as forraign. But Count <hi>William</hi> in <hi>Frizeland,</hi> ſtraitned the City of <hi>Groning,</hi> not able to reſiſt the greatneſs of his endeavours, by ſcarcity and death, having waſted all their Proviſion about the Country; he got alſo <hi>Reide,</hi> a Peninſula of a very convenient Scituation between the River <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now the <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Commanders</hi> of the <hi>Garriſon,</hi> as it were out of an over-curious Care, more from the Uſe and Cuſtom of Diſcipline, than any Neceſſity they thought of, had relieved the Guards, and appointed every inferiour Officer to his Poſt. Thus the Duty of ſearching the Boat, by the Negligence of many, was wholly thrown upon the <hi>Corporal,</hi> who likewiſe being careleſs, according to the Example of his <hi>Superiour Officers,</hi> viewing the ſame very ſlightly, made no more ado: And by good chance it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned, that the Cold had not forced any one to Cough, which at another time they could hardly have refrained. The <hi>Speech</hi> of one of the Souldiers, upon that occaſion, deſerves never to be forgotten; who fearing, leaſt by his violent Noiſe in Coughing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (though he did repreſs it) he ſhould, together with himſelf, betray his Companions: <hi>Kill me</hi> (ſaith be) <hi>Fellow-Souldiers, leaſt we be all killed.</hi> But to proceed, after the ſearch, the very <hi>Souldiers</hi> of the <hi>Garriſon,</hi> drew the Boat into the Caſtle, that it might have Water, in regard the Ice was too thick abroad; by which means, they came into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Hazard, becauſe the Danger ſo near and imminent, had put them all into a fear; ſo that they were ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of <hi>Herangier,</hi> as one who, deſperate of his own Life, had brought them to the ſlaughter.

By the working of the Pump, the Enemies Ears were ſtopped, ſo that they all went out, and not one of them diſcerned by the <hi>Sentinels,</hi> which was almoſt miraculous.

               <p>Theſe were kept in hope, to the very utmoſt, by <hi>Paulo Antonio Lanzavecchia,</hi> who was <hi>Deputy-Governour</hi> of <hi>Breda,</hi> under his Father, a young Man, and utterly ignorant in Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems of War. <hi>Odoardo Lanzavecchia</hi> the Father, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had cauſed to ſtay at <hi>Geertruydenburg,</hi> three miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Breda,</hi> ſeeming as if he would draw thither his <hi>Fortes,</hi> and <hi>Carriages;</hi> and, to that purpoſe, ſome were ſent

under the notion of Spyes, who by ſpreading a falſe Rumour, ſhould make them inſenſible of the Truth: And ſurely, the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was very much over-ſeen, who had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted two Towns to one Man's keeping, when one Man is hardly able to defend one Town, and let other Rewards, without Danger, be for ſuch as deſerve well therein.</p>

But they were ſoon vanquiſh'd by them, who could not at that time be overcome, and himſelf ſorely wounded, moſt of his men being kill'd, he fled back the ſame way he came. By this time, they heard a Noiſe of People, fighting within the City, and the Townſmen came to break open the Caſtle Gates that <hi>Heraugier</hi>'s Souldiers might not drive away with their Shot out of the Gallery above the People, and clear the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Parts.

               <p>About this time, there came alſo an Embaſſie both from <hi>Colen</hi> and <hi>Leige, Bojoarus</hi> was Biſhop of both places: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>States,</hi> not medling with the cauſe of <hi>Truxius</hi> his <hi>Quarrel,</hi> they complained of many things againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, whoſe unaſatiable Avarice took Confidence onely from the <hi>Spaniſh Greatneſs</hi> aſſiſting him: However, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to <hi>Colonian</hi>'s Safety and Peace, if (as ſtanding in the middle) they would onely converſe with Parties, as Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: But the Condition of them of <hi>Leige</hi> was far different, having both done and ſuffer'd, by connivence, many Acts of Hoſtility: Againſt them alſo was objected, the puniſhment of ſuch as were innocent, under colour of vindicating Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and afterwards, when the reſt of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> were poſſeſſed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intermixedly, they ſo openly ſet out for them <hi>Winter-quarters,</hi> and raiſed <hi>Summer Proviſions,</hi> that, if we may not plainly ſay, it was a Voluntary Act; yet we may well ſay, it was not Compulſory: And therefore, to hope for Peace, where they had ſo deſerved; and in the <hi>interim,</hi> upon <hi>Order,</hi> to ſend away their <hi>Priſoners,</hi> there was little Reaſon.</p>
               <p>It would not be amiſs, or any ways abſurd, to dive further into theſe Matters; that both the Reaſon of War, againſt the adjoyning Cities, and what Peace they may expect, may be underſtood: And indeed, after this, there was Freedom ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55798:135"/>
both for <hi>Rapine</hi> and <hi>Injuries,</hi> as every <hi>Province</hi> inclined hither or thither, out of fear of Danger, or ſometimes out of Deſign. They hardly ever took a Voyage free from Arms and Force, while both endeavouring to get away, by that very means drew on the Enemy. Thus, in ſeveral renewed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies, there was nothing but the ſame over again heard at ſpoken: But the <hi>Hollander</hi> yielded up ſeveral ſtrong Holds, as deſired; but, in truth, becauſe they were ſo far diſtant, that they could not eaſily be maintained, or defended; and that they might thereby heap upon the <hi>Spaniard</hi> Envy, if not bring upon him a War, becauſe he would perform none of thoſe things, which before he had agreed to: And there were ſome in the <hi>German Dyet,</hi> who would have nothing but Force and Arms uſed againſt them, for neglect of performing their Promiſe.</p>
               <p>But the other Princes and Biſhops, who continued all in one Society of the <hi>Catholike Religion,</hi> or were otherwiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to one another, broke the ſtrength of that Deſign to uſe Force, by procraſtinating Conſultations, and the hope of a Pacification with the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> And now ſome were ſent from the <hi>Confederate States</hi> to complain, that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by the Treachery of their Enemies, and the careleſs Sloth and Neglect of their Friends; They having given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from themſelves the Rewards of their Pains and Charge in the War, (for as yet <hi>Truxius</hi> did not appear) while <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> yet unqueſtion'd, kept poſſeſſion of all the Cities near the <hi>Rhine:</hi> Nor could they obtain of the <hi>Emperour</hi> any whit the leſs every year, to forbear to aſſiſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> with Arms, though he ſaw them averſe to the deſired Peace. At the end of the year, the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> returning from <hi>France,</hi> was afflicted and vexed with many things, though he brought with him the Honour of having freed <hi>Paris</hi> from a cruel Siege, and bringing his Army Home ſafe, from among ſo many dangerous and mortal Enemies: For both himſelf, and his Army were hated by the <hi>French Commons,</hi> and the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:55798:135"/>
Cities would not receive Garriſons of his Men, for fear of <hi>Forreign Servitude;</hi> ſo that here all <hi>Philip</hi>'s hopes were bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and he found there was no relying on ſuch uncertain Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Another of his Vexations, was, That by the Enemies Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, moſt of the Fortifications, through the whole <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> had been Reduced; That <hi>Verdugo</hi> in <hi>Frizeland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </gap>e</hi> (a place in <hi>Gelderland,</hi> near the <hi>Maes</hi>) ſtartled him; for they being perplexed with the tedious Evils of a double Garriſon; firſt, by the help of the <hi>German</hi> Souldiers, drove out the <hi>Italians,</hi> and afterwards taking more courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came too ſtrong for them, and turned them out. Beſides an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Sedition grew more violent among the ſelected men, haſtned through <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Mansfeldt,</hi> to hinder Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his Progreſs, becauſe he had provided for the new raiſed men, part of their wages, and debarred the reſt from any: This <hi>Mansfeldt</hi> was an old Commander in the War, &amp; that made them rage againſt him more furiouſly. Thus being about <hi>Herentals,</hi> and other adjacent Towns of <hi>Brabant,</hi> as if they had been Enemies, they ſpoiled all that part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is called <hi>Kempenlandt,</hi> yet pretended themſelves the Kings Souldiers; and if any reſiſtance was made againſt them, neither Rapes, Murthers, or any other villany, was by them accounted unlawfull.</p>
               <p>Thus while they haraſſed the Fields, though the pay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, yet their number that demanded it, was increaſed. But the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> ſaid, that he ſuſpected, the Souldiery ought to have been diſperſed into ſeverall fortifyed Cities, and there mixed with the new raiſed men; Indeed, it was time to ſhut the Stable-door; when the Horſe was ſtollen; And this Counſel coming too late, ſerved to little purpoſe otherwiſe, for ſurely, the onely removing of the miſchief to

               <p>And now alſo, that anniverſary plague of mutinous parties returned into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and that with the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, becauſe the Mutineers not only wanted their pay, but were pinched with the miſeries of Winter. Some that were quartered about the Cities of <hi>Colen</hi> grew very outragious, as looking upon <hi>Germany,</hi> as able to yield them booty enough; But ſuch as remained about <hi>Leige,</hi> and the Country near thereto, after they had by a long ſtay waſted all the Country about, part ran away to other parts, but moſt of them periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

either by poverty or Diſeaſes; and if any yet continued healthy, they were ſo accuſtomed to diſcord, that they would range far and wide to waſt and deſtroy; and by this meanes, more was to be maintained, yet there were fewer to defend it. But the Land, under the United States, was more reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having for defence in moſt places, Rivers running round about it, and the Sea ſecuring another part. Beſides the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and vertue of the Citizens was well known, that they who were raiſed in the inner part of the Country, would help to defend the furtheſt parts thereof, and be faithful Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the Regiments abroad. Hence it was, that there was a deſire to go out with ſome part of the preſent Forces, while the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was not yet returned; and if they had made haſt, without doubt, many of his men wearied with Travel, and worn out with Battels, and then alſo coming from a ſtrange Country in the Winter, would not have been able to have encountred half the number of their Enemies. But laying aſide talk, they began to think of action. <hi>Holland</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon the Siege of <hi>Gertruydenburg.</hi> But the <hi>Frizons</hi> were preferred before all, that the proſperous beginnings of the laſt year might be perfected in this, themſelves alſo offering their own Souldiers, of whom they never need to fear a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, if there be a War continued for any time: And indeed, theſe were the main ſtrength of the Union, as long as the other Regiments attended the War in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time, ſome Letters written by the <hi>Groningers,</hi> to Count <hi>Mansfeldt,</hi> were intercepted, which declared the neceſſity of their condition, and how want of all things grew upon them: Moreover, they ſent ſome ſelected <hi>Deputies</hi> to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> to tell him, they had not fled to the greatneſs of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> when they were free, that now they ſhould be left undefended to the Government of <hi>Deputies,</hi> and laid open to the injuries of their Enemies: ſhould they never be ſo happy, as to ſee their General and his Army, at leaſt for example ſake, that no people might ſeem to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

the fortune of that great Houſe, without Reaſon, or unadviſedly? Which complaints being ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced yet no other effect, than Exhortations to fidelity, and great promiſes, that an Army ſhould come, and cut open their paſſages with the Sword. One Regiment was added for defence of thoſe places held beyond the <hi>Rhine.</hi> And while <hi>Verdugo</hi> endeavours by all means to encreaſe his Forces, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Count <hi>Heremberg,</hi> daring nothing further, infeſted only the leſſer Fortifications about <hi>Iſsell,</hi> from whence the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants took an occaſion to contract, that they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the ſudden brunt of both ſides, and that they ſhould enjoy by the levelling of the Caſtles, a common poſſeſſion of their Lands, untill both Armies had decided their quarrel by a pitched Battel in the Field. At this time, as it were on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to hinder Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his March, the newes of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> Factions came to his Ears, for that unquiet City had not yet forgotten thoſe differences in Religion, which were begun in the Earl of <hi>Leiceſters</hi> time: And <hi>Zeland</hi> lying far from the reach or defence of his Sword, began to deny the payment of their Taxes and Aſſeſments; but theſe being all by him eaſily and with ſpeed compoſed, in that ſame Spring he marched out, not with any new raiſed Bands, but for his ſupply and recruit, he had ſent Orders to ſeveral Captains: And thus he did muſter of <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Frizons,</hi> eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot very near, and five hundred Horſe, and of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, greater and leſs, fifty.</p>

               <p>The difficulty of the Enterprize, very much incited Prince <hi>William,</hi> as well with the hope of Honour and prayſe, at the preſent, as of terrour and dread for the future: The Leaguer was well fortified, wherein there was not only an abundance of Victuals, but the ſame was very cheap: Then the paſſage was cut off by many turnings, by which means, the Souldier went as it were, under coverture, and defended againſt the Shot of the Town; Sometimes the Beſieged made Sallies, and not altogether without ſucceſs, while for the moſt part, they found the Beſiegers either drunk, unarmed, or half aſleep; but this did not happen very often, becauſe the infinite da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the beſieged Souldiers, and the State of Affairs in the Town, could not be learned by any fear or threats, no not from ſuch as were taken Captive.

And there were ſome, who, not long before, did fore-tell either the Duke's Death, or Reſtraint. The truth is, many Things began to be diſcover'd, that manifeſted the King to be ſuſpitious of, if not highly diſpleaſed with him: For he alone was looked upon, to have hindred his Kinſman <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neze,</hi> from being Elected <hi>Pope;</hi> And of late had commanded, <hi>That the Duke ſhould not take up any Money at Intereſt, unleſs by the Counſel and Conſent of thoſe, who were ſet up rather as Spies or Guardians, than Counſellors.</hi> His <hi>Phyſitians</hi> ſaid his Diſeaſe proceeded from the hard ſwelling of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> and <hi>Hydropical Humour,</hi> between the Skin and the Fleſh; of the growing of which Diſeaſe, it appears he was ſenſible, for that be abſtain'd from Wine, and accuſtom'd himſelf to drink Water: and for avoiding the Gout, and other pains of the Joynts, he drank little of that too, or elſe it may be he was ſuſpitious of Poyſon: Moſt believe, that he had Poyſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him more than once: But herein <hi>Authors</hi> very much differ.</p>
               <p>Thus dyed <hi>Alexander Farneze,</hi> even in the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time of his Age, being but ſeven and forty years old, of which he had ſpent fourteen in the managery of this War: his laſt five years had much decayed his Reputation, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did he uſe the like diligence then as formerly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether that after the buſineſs of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> as being glutted with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he gave himſelf over to pleaſures, or that being advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>Philips</hi> jealouſie, he ſought by ſloath and ſtupidneſs, to procure a Remedy to allay the greatneſs of his fame; He was deſcended from a Family, as potent as antient, drawing his Originall and greatneſs from Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third; At firſt, being a young man, under his Mothers tuition, he ſpent his time in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> without any honourable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and was ſo contemned, that he was ſaid to be of a heavy Spirit.

In the Bank, which contains the water (for

But the Northerly blaſts of the Spring, by tempeſt upon the Lake, had broken down that part of the Bank, it being weakened before by digging: And again, the ſame way (for there remained no other) the Darts and Shot out, of the Caſtle, which the Enemy yet held on the neighbouring Bank of <hi>Dungen,</hi> infeſted all that attempted it; This was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult in the acceſs, but a kind of hurdles being made, and covered with Loam, were put there, that they might cover, and be as a Trench for ſuch as ſhould aſſault the place. And out of the Iſle of <hi>Dungen,</hi> which is hard by, were made many Shot, and at the ſame time Count <hi>Hohenlo,</hi> leaſt freſh men ſhould be ſent out of the Town to ſupply the Caſtle, invades the narrow and ſtrait paſſage (a happy adventure) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was ſurrendred.</p>
               <p>In theſe labours, and fortifying the Camp, almoſt a month was ſpent before <hi>Mansfeldt</hi> approached.

Wherefore from this action, Honour was to be gained to the new Governour, and they hoped from hence, is to purchaſe glory to the one, ſo to ſtrike terrour into the other. Neither did any ſuſpect the immenſe largeneſs of the Fields, in regard there were ſuch incertain bogs, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Moores</hi> ſcattered up and down among them, and they were ſo incloſed, that as the place yielded not room for the Armies to fight, ſo the Fords and ſhallowes afforded no place for ſtratagems or Ambuſcadoes. Wherefore obſerving, I ſuppoſe, the face of the Siege, and in what manner the War was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, he thought fit only to venture with a few, becauſe the other part of the Camp did not merit the like fame, either in the danger or event; and truly this firſt example of his, was given with a very true conſideration, in praiſing the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of the Antients, who ever made uſe of all things to the purpoſe, rather than for oſtentation.</p>

               <p>Before this time, there was no Obedience given to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; for, it ſeems, he that properly was the Governour of the Town, was then abſent, being gone out a little before the beginning of the Siege, and there was none other in the place fit for that Employment: From whence it came to paſs, that Works were often erected, and as often thrown down, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wavering Counſels of the ſeveral Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; of whom, two, to whom the <hi>Government</hi> of the Town had been committed during the Siege, dyed before; and now the Third, while he runs to meet the Noiſe of Terrour before-mention'd, being kill'd with the ſtroke of a Stone, clearly made an end of his <hi>Government.</hi> Thus there was no

They are the perſons, in whom thou may'ſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire fidelity and modeſty; Their Authority with the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar is very great, by reaſon of their Sanctity of Life; and becauſe they inſtruct Youth in Learning, and the Precepts of Wiſdom, without taking any Reward for their pains: They have their Provincials in every City and Nation, and there is one Superiour over all the reſt throughout the World, who is for the moſt part a <hi>Spaniard:</hi> They command with great Wiſdom, and obey with equal Fidelity: They follow not the common Cuſtom of other Orders to live all together: It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med too poor to include within Walls their growing Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; They Baptize and ſolemnize Matrimony; and the firſt thing they are taught, is, To lay aſide all Humane Affections, and to caſt away the fear of Death: They chiefly take into their Society none but ſuch as are very eminent, either for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, Bloud, or Riches; and they reap a great benefit from all thoſe things: For, firſt, they diſtinguiſh Ingenuity no leſs prudently, than they chuſe it, pitching always upon ſuch whom they hope will grow famous, either for Eloquence, or digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pious Meditations into Writing.</p>

                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:55798:180"/>And it appeared by the Event, that by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant allowance of <hi>Pillage</hi> and <hi>Rapine,</hi> the Strength ſent for ſupplies were haſtned, both with great damage at home, and other hazard: And that the Enemy came not into the very heart of <hi>Holland,</hi> during the ſudden and moſt ſharp Froſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, was not the ſucceſs of their Counſels in their own defence, but the evill Fortune and Diſcipline of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. For Sedition had ſpread it ſelf all over the Kings Army, and the end of one mutiny, was but the beginning of another.</p>
               <p>This madneſs, as well for the generality thereof, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the remedies applyed thereto, far ſurpaſſed all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; becauſe the Tumults began not in ſingle Regiments, but ſeveral Nations at once: not in the Borders, but in the very Bowels of the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> for now hatred had enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Souldiers avarice, which is the prime cauſe of all ſuch extravagancies: The <hi>Italians,</hi> a <hi>Nation</hi> by <hi>Nature</hi> emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſpiteful, obſerving that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges payd them, in regard there was likewiſe at the ſame time, pay due to them, preſently imagined themſelves ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and affronted: At firſt a few of them onely complained, That then they loſt the eſteem of their labours and blood, when the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> the chief columne of their party, and a moſt juſt rewarder of vertue in all, dyed; but although he were dead, yet from him the <hi>Spaniards</hi> poſſeſs the benefit and Grandeur, that at preſent makes them inſolent: That they were now as deſpicable, hurried from place to place, at the option of a few, who make a ſtalking-Horſe of <hi>Erneſtus</hi> his good Nature, and the Kings Wealth: But it ſhould ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly appear, that they had Arms, wherewith they could challenge their due againſt all thoſe that defrauded the King of his Treaſure; neither ought they (the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) to be diſpleaſed at the Example, ſince they themſelves firſt broke the Ice: And if any one reſiſted them, he ſhould find, what

               <p>Theſe firſt threats were now ſeconded, not onely by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals and inferiour bands of men, but the valianteſt of their Commanders began to ſpeak the ſame Language: with which incouragements, as if they had been poſſeſſed with ſome ſudden frenzy, all the <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers marched with their Colours to <hi>Sichenen,</hi> a Town of <hi>Brabant,</hi> which, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of its ſtrength and Scituation they ſeized, from whence they fetched in booty all about, even as far as <hi>Bruxels:</hi> with theſe, many Souldiers of other Nations joyned, as <hi>French, Iriſh, Epirots,</hi> and even from <hi>Italy,</hi> ſuch as had formerly been in ſervice for the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> and all under pretence of peace, and hope of rewards, they refuſing to entertain none but <hi>Spaniards</hi> onely.</p>
               <p>At all theſe diſturbances, the Officers were preſent, which, in tumults of ſuch nature, is very rare, as if they had now been about to conteſt the honour of their Nation, not by any right of Authority, but ſo prevalent more or leſs, as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved themſelves notably active in heading the Souldiers rage. New men were daily liſted, and enrolled in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies: the mark and badge of their faction, was a ſwarm of Bees, before which ſtood the King, and this by a military jeſt, and facetious quip, they called the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> They impoſed Tribute upon Lands, and exacted Toll of all things that were carried out of the Country. Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> politickly fomented this Sedition, for fear, leaſt if they ſhould reunite, they might receive thereby ſome unlooked for damage; and the rather, becauſe there was a very great Froſt, which had continued rear ſeventy dayes, and had covered with Ice, both the Marſhes and Rivers, that they would bear the greateſt and moſt weighty Carriages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:55798:181"/>Thus while the Enemies Country, was tormented on one ſide with the <hi>French</hi> War, on the other ſide with mutinies of their own Souldiers, firſt precluding all places to reduce them to poverty, and afterwards, by raiſing all Proviſions to an exceſſive price; The Treaſury was taken into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and therefore they being graciouſly heard, who were ſent to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> declaring, that they were not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by any right of Country, Kinred or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance, but only ſerved them for pay; which not being given to them, they ſuppoſed themſelves no longer tyed to their defrauders. And if any ſhould come to aſſayl them, they would make uſe of the Law of Nature, which hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to all Creatures, even by inſtinct, ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Thus a Truce was made with them, but when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Tribute in the Land of <hi>Cuycke,</hi> where the Prince had ſome paternal Poſſeſſions, <hi>Herman</hi> Count <hi>Heremberg,</hi> was ready to defend the Country people denying the ſame, if the Prince upon his Requeſt would have permitted him. But here alſo the Souldiers neceſſity, who could not ſo much weaken one ſide, was more prevalent, than all the Reaſon of the unarmed multitude, which things, when they came to be related at Court, as they were by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> repreſented to the worſt, there was a diviſion in Judgments thereupon, ſome averting a neceſſity of mercy; but others replyed, that although in ſome Caſes gentleneſs was neceſſary to be uſed towards Souldiers, yet theſe being grown moſt inſolent, and having alſo a national hatred, were to be made exemplary, leaſt the Souldiery ſhould make it a Cuſtom to mutiny, and throw off their obedience, as often as they ſhould fail of their pay, ſo ſoon as it was due. Beſides this, the neceſſary of the time did incite and provoke the moſt moderate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, becauſe otherwiſe, when there was the greateſt occaſion for them, they would obey no orders or Commands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:55798:181"/>Among all theſe advices, it was not concealed from them, what further rigour was thought upon for them; for they, according to the ſubtlety and craft of their <hi>Nation,</hi> had hired Spies, who gave them <hi>Intelligence</hi> of all that paſſed. Nay, and ſome of the <hi>Noblemen</hi> did voluntarily favour the <hi>Italians,</hi> out of hatred and impatiency of bearing with the <hi>Spaniards. Victualls, Ammunition,</hi> and all things elſe fit for War, were reaſonably provided for them, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> come into the ſame <hi>Province</hi> with a ſtrong patty of Souldiers: at firſt they diſſembled the cauſe of their coming; but when they were not able to come near the <hi>Italians</hi> in theſe Arts, they marched out ſeriouſly to ſhut them up in the Town, and being ſo incloſed, by Famine to reduce them to Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Anon greater numbers are gathered together, and ſeveral Caſtles aſſaulted, with the loſs of much blood, and ſo much cruelty was uſed, that they are reported to have been pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately ſlain in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Camp, that either by foreſight, or other affection, repugned thoſe Counſels. But now none would ſuffer it, that they ſhould come to puniſh a fault in others, whereof themſelves but lately, yea, and often before, had been guilty.</p>
               <p>Thus on both parts, they ſhewed a moſt pernitious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Theſe, in that they would ſavagely ſhed the blood of thoſe who had been mutually engaged with them, and were bound by the ſame ſacred tye of an Oath: Thoſe, that being taken for Enemies, they deſired Ayd from Enemies indeed. For though they made their firſt Addreſs to the King of <hi>France,</hi> yet he commended them to Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> as nearer, that ſo keeping the Sedition a foot, he might, when time ſhould ſerve, have ayd from them, and enjoy the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſo many Couragious Men; whereupon, Pledges being delivered on both ſides, they confirmed the Truce formerly made.</p>

As ſoon as he had gravely declared the great pains he had taken for the making Peace, in all other Things he deſired their Counſel: Whereupon <hi>Areſchot,</hi> a Noble-man of the firſt Rank in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> is Report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have made a Speech in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Fore-Fathers, in precedent times, not in any manner byaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Hatred, but onely becauſe they were commanded, took up Arms againſt moſt valiant Nations, but chiefly the</hi> French; <hi>nor were they ever frighted at the Dangers, or ſtarted at the Evils
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:55798:184"/>
that follow Warre, while they fought in Defence of their Princes Greatneſs: And therefore they brought to paſs the most difficult. Matters by their Valour and Wiſdom. But now our Arms and Counſels are at little uſe, our Miſeries and Calamities are the things wherewith we are beſt acquainted: And this War, which is nick-named</hi> Civil, <hi>certainly cannot be believed ſuch, eſpecially in the contemplation of the Mortall Jars between Fellow-Citizens, and Countrey-men: What then! Do we deſire Peace? Certainly, it had behoved us long ſince to have cared for that, while thoſe things we would have had preſerved, had yet remained in being, before our Cities were burned, our Fields waſted, and a generall want had ſurprized our Families, which is like (for ought I ſee otherwiſe) to lye upon them even to Futurity: But if yet, after thirty years continual ſlaughters, we have not deſerved rest, yet at leaſt free us from another War? Must we go againſt the</hi> French? <hi>firſt let us ſecure our Backs from the</hi> Hollanders: <hi>But if it ſeem more convenient, to take Vengeance on thoſe firſt, and that ſurely is very neceſſary; let us not blow up our hopes with too much ſelf-conceitedneſs, leſt while we court what belongs to another we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger what is our own. But you will ſay, Peace is now offered to us: I anſwer, It is ſo indeed: But, pray conſider, what cauſe of War hath the</hi> French? <hi>And how do the</hi> Hollanders <hi>drive of Peace? No ſurely, I rather believe, they are ſenſibly diſpleaſed, as well at ours, as their own ſufferings. They cry out, let the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Souldiers be all ſent away, for they are full of cruelty and pride, and utterly diſcordant to our Cuſtoms, who have no ſhew of Modeſty, nor more Fidelity or Conſcience, than to ſerve their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: We ſay, theſe things are ſpoken maliciouſly, and by Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; true: yet thoſe things we ſuffer by them is little elſe, than what Enemies uſe: Ask the people of</hi> Artois; <hi>Inquire of thoſe of</hi> Henalt, <hi>and other Provinces near thereby, to whom the Proprietors impute the Dearth of ſuch Fertile Countries: They will tell you, 'tis true, the</hi> French <hi>took away a little, but the</hi> Spaniards <hi>robb'd us of all; and the like may be ſaid of all other Forreigners, who,

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:55798:185"/>
could not reſiſt the Storm; the Count <hi>de Bulloin</hi> waſted all round about, nay, and ranged even to places far diſtant with Fire and Sword: But yet the Enemy met with four Troops belonging to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> which they either kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or put to flight, being circumvented by Ambuſhes, and the overflowing of the Rivers; and afterwards, in a greater Battel of Horſe, the Victors proſecuted their good Fortune: Againſt the more potent Cities, Policy was rather uſed than Force, yet the Succeſs was not therefore anſwerable: There was Chance, which really might have increaſed more Parties to the War, and made it break out in all the <hi>Borders,</hi> if there had not been more difficulty in keeping, than acquiring; of which this is compaſſed often by Boldneſs and Temerity, but that muſt be maintained with Care, and many excellent Policies. <hi>Hoye</hi> is a Town of the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Leige,</hi> which <hi>Authors</hi> believe to be the Remains of a greater, and more Cities ſpoiled of old by the <hi>Incurſions</hi> of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and the <hi>Scituation</hi> perſwades this, from the running of the River <hi>Maes</hi> through it, which a Stream breaks into, that runs with more violence, than ſcantineſs of Water maketh ſhew of; this Brook gives Name to the place: The Soil, that is all about it, is very rugged by reaſon of Iron Mines, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the Nature of the People: It hath an Arched Bridg, the Riſing Bank, on the right ſide, is over-looked by a large Caſtle, ſeated upon a little Hill: It is a choice place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for the Biſhops, in regard of its pleaſantneſs; and no leſs difficult to be Aſſaulted, becauſe of its ſteep Aſcent. But while it was aſſured, both by Peace and Right, thoſe few that by there in <hi>Garriſon,</hi> and ſpent their time in Riot and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and did their <hi>Souldiery Duty</hi> as a Work of <hi>Supererogation:</hi> and by the like neglect all the Buildings Erected upon the Rock, were equal to the Foundation of the Caſtle. One of theſe Houſes, by the conſent of the Owner, <hi>Heraugier,</hi> the <hi>Inventor</hi> of ſuch <hi>Stratagems,</hi> who was <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Breda,</hi> by him taken, commanded to be fill'd with Thirty Souldiers,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:55798:186"/>
who, in the Night, by the help of the Window and Ladders, going out, and firſt uſing ſilence, then by continual beating of Drums and Shouting, hindring the Proſpect, they took the <hi>Keepers</hi> of the Caſtle, and bound them; in help of whom, while it was yet but the Dawning of the Day, their Captain came with ſix hundred Horſe, and one Thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot: But the Townſmen, though at the beginning of the Tumult, they ran to their Arms, when they ſaw ſo many Souldiers at their Gates, and others over their heads, affrighted with that double <hi>Terrour,</hi> loſing their <hi>Courage,</hi> they ſubmitted. Then <hi>Heraugier,</hi> placing therein a <hi>Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> ſent his Horſe abroad into the Fields, and the Country within the <hi>Maes,</hi> which were ſubject to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>Tribute.</hi> This Exploit of War, committed againſt a Prince who was at Peace; and however he did not affect the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> yet in regard there had been no Hoſtility decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt him, according to the Cuſtom of War, might with more facility be anſwer'd to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> than excuſed to him. Not was it altogether unlike that of <hi>Bonne</hi> and <hi>Berck,</hi> which being formerly taken in War, ſhould be retained, now that the whole <hi>Archbiſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Colen</hi> was in peace. When therefore <hi>Bojoarus,</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Leige</hi> and <hi>Colen,</hi> had ſent to examine the matter, and it was anſwer'd by the <hi>States, That it was rather out of preſent Neceſsity, than any Right they claimed; neither would they do any Damage to his Government, or Subjects; but onely having taken a Town from the publike Enemy, they were ready to reſtore it, when Arms were laid down on both ſides: And that</hi> Bojoarus <hi>did not deal juſtly with them, in ſuffering the</hi> Spaniard <hi>to enjoy it; and thereupon the Conditions were refuſed, wherewith they were ſollicited to Renditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being in themſelves very reaſonable, but that the conveniency of the place perſwaded the contrary; for that Caſtle was a great Safeguard to their Journey, that the</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> French <hi>Forces might the more ſecurely meet; and in that Town they intended to place thoſe</hi> Italians, <hi>which had formerly deſerted the War, being

The greateſt part fled into the Neighbouring Caſtle. But from the next Hill, which the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> had neglected to poſſeſs, being higher than the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Caſtle, it was ſorely batter'd, and below it was undermined: For there was preſent a great Number of the <hi>Native Inhabitants,</hi> who, being accuſtom'd to dig for <hi>Mettal</hi> in the Iron Mines, were very skilful in the Art of undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

               <p>It might be diſputed indeed, whether Peace can be made; the ſame needs not be queſtioned as to War; At laſt, after all this, there was another fear added, leſt the People of the United Provinces, vexed with the endleſs toyl of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſhould chooſe a new Prince, wherein 'twas uncertain, whether they would admit a forreign Power, or content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Vertues and Valour of ſome Domeſtick; there was yet ſome hope, that a vacancy in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſhould not be admitted; but if they once pitched upon a Prince, the War would either be inexplicable, or peace, if ever gotten, attained with loſs and infamy.</p>

               <p>This year, and the ſubſequent time for a while, all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the United Provinces to War, proved unſuccesful, as if by a ſhort contempt of their plyant fortune: The whole Spring, and part of the Summer, was ſpent by them in idleneſs, onely ſome few of their Souldiers warring in <hi>France;</hi> but their own diſcords hindred the motions of their Forces in Other places, though often called upon by <hi>Buzenual,</hi> for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.

Neither did the ſucceſſes in <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> anſwer expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for though ſeveral Forts and Caſtles were aſſaulted raſhly and taken, yet neither was the Enemy much damnified, or the Victors any thing advantaged thereby. But after King <hi>Henry</hi> by making a great Progreſs in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> had drawn thither the Forces of his Kingdom, the Earl of <hi>Bulloyns</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being exhauſted, who by an oſtentous defiance, had brought the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army againſt him, he was not onely not able to perform his threats, but alſo unable to defend himſelf, he ſaw the <hi>French</hi> Borders pillaged, himſelf being only able to aſſiſt them with a helpleſs and ſorrowful look; By the irkſomneſs whereof, and becauſe the Souldiers began to grow inſolent, through hunger and thirſt, having nothing but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to drink, <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> much againſt the Earl of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyns</hi> will, made haſt to return, but by a contrary way to that, he went out, for that the Enemy had blocked up.

which they themſelves wanted, even againſt the Enemy; and ſhortly after, divided them, ſome under new Officers, others into Garriſons.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Forces were hardly at any time greater, or more numerous than now, yet being far diſperſed in ſeveral parts, were never able to compaſs any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; In <hi>Burgundy,</hi> under <hi>Velaſius,</hi> was a ſtrong Army: In the Confines of <hi>Artois</hi> and <hi>Picardy,</hi> after the departure of <hi>Charles Mansfield Varembonius</hi> was quartered, to bridle <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi> and by making excurſions into <hi>France,</hi> to revenge Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine by Rapine. <hi>Mondragonio</hi> attended Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> to obſerve his motions, and in time to meet or prevent him.</p>
               <p>In this lying about <hi>Hulſt,</hi> there were four thouſand Armed men. <hi>Verdugo</hi> with ſix thouſand Foot, and fifteen hundred Horſe, being Commanded, drew near to <hi>Ferte,</hi> to drive the Earl of <hi>Bulloin,</hi> who had leſs Forces, out of <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> and to recover the Towns by him taken.</p>
               <p>The Walls of this Town of <hi>Fert,</hi> by continual Batteries, and breaches, lay open, yet a great power of the <hi>French,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent to help the Town by a fierce and violent Aſſault, did repreſs and beat off the Beſiegers; But this Town thus freed from the Siege, being ſoon after by accident, for the greateſt part burned and ſpoyled by Gunpowder, by the Earl of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyne</hi> himſelf, was diſmantled and ungarriſoned.

and becauſe he was raiſed from nothing, to great Honours, being born of a Houſe not ignoble, though impoveriſhed, he remembred his former Fortune, as much as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>The Cities of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> made it their general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to <hi>Fontayne</hi> at laſt, that he would ſtick cloſe to the Siege of <hi>Cambray,</hi> offering him a great ſum of money, and alſo Souldiers, becauſe while neither the City was cloſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, nor the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army reduced thereto from their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcattered up and down, they were ſpoiled by both; But he of his own accord, that the time of his Government might not paſſe away without ſomething memorable, and that be might ſupply the empty Treaſury, he ſends to <hi>Varembonius</hi> his Camp, and increaſeth his Forces, to make them up twelve thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe; With this Army, he ſecured all the adjacent parts from the <hi>French,</hi> and that done, he took <hi>Castellat,</hi> being firſt much weakened by Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and afterwards forced them to ſurrender, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated into the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>This is a Town in <hi>Vermandois,</hi> near the Head of the <hi>Scheldt,</hi> which another <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> had appointed for a defence to <hi>Cambray;</hi> and if any invaſion ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen out of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> for a frontire Guard to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time, <hi>Hanen</hi> a Town in the ſame Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was taken by force, with ſuch variety of chances, as have made the Relation wonderful, and brought it almoſt within the compaſs of fabulous.

                  <hi>Fontayne,</hi> drawn out, he was overcome, together with his two Brothers: his Mother, and his Kinſman, <hi>Orvillier,</hi> ſtill remained to the Garriſon, with the danger of which deareſt Pledges they were threatned, unleſs they forthwith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>The Woman between fear and affection, conſented; but <hi>Orvillier,</hi> being nearer to the incenſed <hi>French,</hi> by ſecret Meſſengers, ſent to the Earl of <hi>Bulloyne,</hi> and the reſt of the Kings Commanders, who then reſided in <hi>Picardy,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being admitted into the Caſtle, all the whole day after, there was a ſharp conflict with the Towns, wherein there were twelve hundred Souldiers <hi>Spaniards, Walloons, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> nor was the Diſpute ended, without the loſs of ſome Noble Blood; for <hi>Humerius</hi> a great Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, well experienced in the Art of War, and beloved of the King, was ſlain: At laſt, they hewed out their paſſage by fire and Sword, and they who with <hi>Orvillier,</hi> ſurvived the Fight, were delivered for Pledges, according to Agreement, to prevent the <hi>Spaniards</hi> threatnings; But the Captives, by the treachery of their Keepers breaking Priſon, brought the Caſtle into that danger, that they were fain to be diſcharged by Articles.</p>
               <p>Thus by <hi>Orvillier's</hi> want of Courage, the <hi>French</hi> obtained the Caſtle, which he had reſolved before to keep for himſelf; And <hi>Fontayne,</hi> becauſe the Town being taken, he came too late, changing his fame into fury, brought the Governour before the Walls, even ready to die under the hands of the Executioner; There he in a weeping tone, now beſeeches his Mother, then his friend, if they had any mercy, any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his blood, that they would not imagine while he ſtood under the ſtroke of death, to raiſe to themſelves Trophies of Honour and Dignity; And when they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was not in their power, becauſe the <hi>French</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed both the Town and Caſtle, he was immediately ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before their faces.</p>

But ſuch was the blindneſs and ſimplicity of that Age, that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved a great ſupport of future Right and Juriſdiction, if the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority and Conſent were obtained; and he who never beſtowed <hi>gratis</hi> upon any man ſo much as words, gave to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> the Dominion of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but ſo, as he ſhould be a Feodary of the Church, and pay to the ſame a certain Tribute: But the following Kings refuſed to make any ſuch Payment; pretending, That the Peers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi> had never conſented to it.</p>

But the Queen, after the breaking forth of this Rebellion, began a more fierce War; Not for her Allies, as before was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but for her own ſake: And therefore ſhe ſent out out <hi>Drake</hi> a perſon well known in the <hi>Weſtern World,</hi> with a great <hi>Fleet</hi> prepared, partly at her own Charges, and partly at the coſt of private Men, with hope to ſeize and take the Wealth gather'd together and laid up in <hi>Porto Ricco.</hi> But the News of their coming being gotten thither before them, all the Wealth being carryed thence more into the Land, the <hi>Port</hi> it ſelf was incloſed and ſtopp'd up by the <hi>Spaniards:</hi>

               <p>Here the day was darkned with Clouds, and the Ice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for a long ſpace, which the cold North wind, with equall danger, both tumbles together, and caſteth aſunder. A long time they were in ſuſpence, whether they ſhould make any further ſearch towards the end of the World; At laſt, with much ſtrugling, breaking forth thoſe unknown, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth bounds, where they begun to withdraw themſelves from the Land, with a direct courſe to the South-Eaſt, from thence they ſailed towards <hi>Scithia,</hi> by the outmoſt part of <hi>Zembla,</hi> in the one hundred and tenth degree of the <hi>Equator,</hi> untill they conjectured, they were paſt that Sea, wherein the River <hi>Obis,</hi> coming out of the <hi>Sarmatian</hi> Mariſhes, is ſwallowed up in the Sea.</p>

               <p>This was done the Summer before this year: And ſo much ſatisfaction was received from this firſt Aſſay, that it was concluded, more Ships ſhould be ſent to make further expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment not towards <hi>Zembla,</hi> but by the <hi>Naſſavian</hi> Sea, which way carryed with it more of hope: So had they ſaid at firſt, of that which runs between <hi>Waygats</hi> and the <hi>Sarmatians.</hi> But

here delay, a frequent impediment to the greateſt Affairs, ſteps in, ſo that the Ships going out later in the year, than they ought to have done, found the Sea impaſſable: ſo cruel and vehement a cold, and, which in that Clymate was rare, had turned all into Ice.</p>
               <p>They who came back from both the Voyages, declared the nature both of the Sea and Soyl, the unheard of forms of Birds and Beaſts, as they found and ſaw the ſame. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved alſo the prominent Capes, Bayes, Culphs, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, with the Scituation of the places, together with the names of the Country, Prince, yea and of the very people: they told alſo of many little Iſlands, and what was ſpoken of by the Ancients, that they were ſo variable, by the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, that now they would appear to be really Iſlands, and anon, they would ſeem parts of the Continent.</p>

argue, that in former Ages they did eat mans fleſh; which if we allow, there are theſe to be numbred among thoſe people, whoſe lives were ſo mollified by age and example, ſhewed an apt inclination of mankind, to leave off their old and cuſtomary barbarity: At the firſt coming thither of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they were fearful meerly our of ignorance, they provided for their ſecurity, either by Arms or flight: But after they had tryed out innocence, and received ſome triviall Preſents; (two ſacred tyes) they called to witneſs the Sun, and their own poverty, that they were even againſt their wills, overcome by good turns; And if at any time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Fortune ſmiled upon us, we were altogether behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the affections of thoſe People which border upon the Sea; though it were very neceſſary, that Caſtles ſhould be built in thoſe paſſages, to preſerve the uſe of that new found Sea, and where Ships may have ſhelter and Harbour, if any ſudden accident ſhould happen.

                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:55798:221"/>In the mean time, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> brought in by one ſide, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Horſe by the other, filled the whole Country about <hi>Hulſt,</hi> with ſudden fear and ſlaughter: The <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> had the greater ſtrength, and as oft as the water over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the Fields, they paſſed backward and forward with their ſmall Veſſels unmoleſted. Then between the Town and the Caſtle adjoyning to the Town, which looketh toward the <hi>Scheldt,</hi> and ſo to the Enemy, ſlighting their Fortifications, they laid themſelves open, by which mock or ſcorn, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being provoked, as they purſued them ſeeming to fly, were cruelly ſhattered, and beaten by the Townſmens ſhot, and alſo a more compact and well ordered Sally: It was manifeſt, that theſe things happened for want of Cannon; without which no good could be done; and there was no ſmall difficulty in the wafting them over the River: the more mariſhy places were by little and little, made firm with Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, and other bluſhwood.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Eſtuary,</hi> ſeveral Ships were bound, and tyed one to another ſo ſtrongly, that they were as good as a Bridge, and at the furtheſt part of the Bank, ſerved the Kings Forces like a Sconce, framed into the ſhape of a half Moon; from hence the great <hi>Artillery</hi> battered-both the Town and Caſtle. But at that time there were two, which had been brought at the firſt coming, into the very Iſland, and as any of the reſt were brought over, they were planted immediatly againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Afterwards, many others were brought thither, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the former, and <hi>Rouce</hi> attempted to take from the <hi>Hulstians</hi> a Fort, which was (as we ſaid) to ſecure their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions) and to cut off the uſe of the River from the Town, yet make it advantagious to themſelves, which after it had not ſucceeded by ſeveral mean aſſaults, at length, with the Thunder of Cannons, and the noyſe of Trumpets and Drums, whereby (as he openly confeſſed) he intended to ſtrike at the ſame time, terrour into the Enemies, and infuſe Courage into his own men, at midnight, he commanded the <hi>Italians</hi> to
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:55798:222"/>
go and break through the middle bank, poſſeſſed by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which led from the Caſtle to the City. The darkneſs of the night was ſpent in wounds and ſlaughters, with a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed noyſe, while the doubtful ſtroaks fall among the Croud, and there is no poſſibility to foreſee or avoid them.</p>
               <p>In the morning, the Garriſon was driven out; And in this interim, the <hi>Germans</hi> of the ſame ſide, that they might by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy aſſiſt them in the aſſault, with great labour paſſing through the mariſhy and unguarded places, had won the outer Trench of the Caſtle, and cutting down the Palizadoes, fell upon the Watch, and killed them, not thinking of any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from abroad: Thus keeping one part from the relief of the other, he became Conquerour of both, and all that day battered the Caſtle with his Cannon, which as it was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ſtrengthned with a Bank of moiſt plaſhy Earth, ſo was it eaſily beaten down; the Beſieged therein, were no leſs than eight hundred, yet although the breach was not made wide enough, and they were ſenſible of no force near to aſſault them, feared nevertheleſs, the Bridge taken by the Enemy, and many other doubtful and unſeaſonable events of chance, but chiefly, by the commixture of thoſe, who flying from the Battel in the night, and mingled themſelves among them, and would not ſuffer one among them to remain honeſt and juſt: And throwing down their Arms, with horrible cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and threats, and force againſt their Commanders, if they could not conſent forthwith to ſurrender.

               <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> having thus ſooner, nay beyond his hope, obtained ſo eaſie an entrance againſt all ſtops, drained all the ground near the Trench, and from thence, what with Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:55798:222"/>
and what with force, he ſorely battered all the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications encompaſſed with the Trench: and alſo by the help of the Fort, could now ſecure the River, draw his Forces round the Town, and take order for encamping them: and which was as much as all this, by reaſon hereof, the prices of all things were abated, which the difficulty of tranſporting before, had made ſo ſcarce, that the Souldiers were much pinched with hunger.</p>
               <p>The Beſieged laboured, and earneſtly ſtrove, by breaking down ſome water, to have let in an inundation upon their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but they found means to prevent the ſame, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all thoſe Banks which they had gotten from the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to ſerve againſt them for preſent uſe: But they bending their whole ſtudy to procure eruption of the Water, made a Cave under their Walls, whereby they might drown them unawares; and after much ſlaughter, ſome Enſigns and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners were taken, without harm to the Aſſaylants, while they took the Souldiers, either idle in their Quarters, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at play at Dice, which of late is become the paſſe-time of Military retirements and leyſure; or, if they were forewarned by the Sallyers out-cryes, that a greater number came out, they would ſhun the danger, either by fighting at diſtance, and waveringly, or elſe by a lingring and flow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. The Cannon aid the greateſt damage, together with Granadoes; for againſt all perſons that came towards the City, there were empty Baskets ſet out for blindes, as well to hinder their ſight, as to keep off their Darts; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all which, not onely they that were fain to expoſe themſelves to danger in their continual attendance upon the batteries, were ſlain, but alſo not a few of the Commanders were in like manner killed; and among theſe, <hi>Rones,</hi> by whoſe advice all the noble actions of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> atchieved in <hi>France,</hi> were managed, but that both the Archduke <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Fontayne,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> took the glory thereof to themſelves, by commanding the ſame things,</p>

               <p>Thus there was nothing cover'd, but their filthy biding places under Ground, or which lay under the Covert of the lofty Rampire: Count <hi>Solmes</hi> being wounded with a Shot in the Thigh, perform'd the Duties of his Command by <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,</hi> and <hi>Conference</hi> with the <hi>Collonels:</hi> And Prince <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> himſelf, from the Neighbouring Shore, had an Eye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Things; ſo as whoever were wounded, or unable to bear Arms, being near fifty every day, were taken out of the Town, and plac'd in Hoſpitals, in the ſeveral adjacent Cities and Iſlands: <hi>Piron</hi> alſo a Collonel of <hi>Zealand,</hi> by continuall labour, and ſtudious vigilancy, weakned and fallen ſick, was licenſed to depart. Supplies, and all other Things neceſſary for War or Proviſions, were brought thither alſo from the ſame place firſt by the Care of <hi>Erneſtus</hi> of <hi>Naſsau,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by Captain <hi>Dorpius:</hi> And the <hi>Garriſon,</hi> by little and little, increaſed, till there were in the Town 36 Companies, and in <hi>Naſsau</hi>'s Fort 6 Companies: Beſides, ſuch plenty of Corn, that when they could not conveniently keep it within the Town, part of it was laid up in the Ships: But this was
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55798:223"/>
hardly to be indured by the Enemy, that Ships ſhould ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently paſs to and fro, as in Trade, while he lay there in Siege: And therefore againſt the Port, they raiſed ſeverall long Works, ſometimes extending one way, anon turning another way, that ſo they might from thence infeſt the Haven with their Artillery; but for the moſt part in vain: For by the interpoſition of the Mariſhes, and long diſtance of place, the Shot was ſpent, before it came to the place, which it was intended to batter: And beſides, the Enemy lay within reach of the Shot from <hi>Naſſau</hi> Fort. And the flowing of the Sea, growing more violent, prov'd to them both an hindrance and damage. From thence, the <hi>Italians,</hi> under the Leading of the Marqueſs of <hi>Trevigiana,</hi> attaqued the Fortification, which Count <hi>Solms</hi> had lately made before the Gate of the Town, looking towards the Camp: Firſt, they begun with plain and open force of <hi>Pioneers;</hi> but as ſoon as appearing out of the Trench, they found themſelves gall'd with Shot, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſing two Breaſt Works, they incloſed their Flanks, and then began to ſhoot furiouſly, and the <hi>Italians</hi> ſoon after, climbing up to the very bottom of the Fortification, were thrown down in Fight; from whence again riſing, by the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the <hi>Zelanders,</hi> thick ſhowrs of Bullets, and caſting of Wild-fire, they were totally put to flight. They had joyn'd to them ſome other Aids of other Nations, which ſtood every one ſeparated by themſelves, that ſo their Valour might be the better diſcerned. Nay, and a proper Band of Voluntiers was commanded to go forward, with not onely Military En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns diſplay'd before them; but ſuch as were wont to be uſed at Proceſſions, and Solemn Times of Prayer appointed by the Church.</p>
               <p>This was an ordinary thing with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of old, as often as they had War againſt any Profane or Barbarous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and becauſe it is a Nation much addicted to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Religion, there is no ſurer way can be deviſed to encourage them. On the other ſide, the ſeveral Regiments
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:55798:224"/>
by turns, took care of the Guards, and the whole multitude of Towns-people became ſubſervient to the War, bringing Darts to the Souldiers, and Faggots, Fire-Brands, and other Materials, both for Offence and Defence. Thus for three days, one after another, continued a ſharp Fight, but with the greateſt ſlaughter of the Aſſailants; for as the Souldiers of the firſt Rank, by reaſon of their heavy Armour, were like a Wall to the reſt, their Arms not being penetrable by Shot, ſo if they were kept nigh at hand, for the avoiding of ſtroke, by their ſtanding ſtill, they hindred both themſelves and others. At laſt, they fell from Force to Stratagems; the one, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to undermine; the other, to countermine; ſo as the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage yet fell equally: There were ſome for the <hi>Aſſailants,</hi> who, partly by the plainneſs of the overturned Ground in one part, and partly by the riſing thereof in another, were helped by the Slaughters both of their Friends and Enemies: But then did Death appear moſt terrible, when the Ground, made uneven by daily Graves, and ſlippery with Bloud, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch as ſtagger'd thereon, that they could neither avoid to tread upon the ſprawling Limbs of their Fellow-Souldiers, nor keep themſelves from being annoy'd, though in the heat of Fury, by their dying ſpurns. Notwithſtanding all which, the increaſing Enemy drove the Defendants to Extremity; and leſt, being the leſs follow'd, they might at once break through the Bulwark, which already began to lye open by Breaches, made with continuall Battery, there was raiſed more inwardly, by the Providential Care of Count <hi>Solms,</hi> a new Work in form of a Half-Moon, and with a deep Trench, whither was drawn together, a great ſtrength of Souldiers to make reſiſtance: Neither did the <hi>Spaniard</hi> keep long the uſe of that Fortification, which they had obtain'd with ſo much Labour and Bloud. For whatever remain'd thereof, the <hi>Beſieged</hi> threw down by the force of Gun-powder from a Mine; and beſides, in the void place, which lay between that and the Rampire, they had made a little lurking Hole,

from whoſe obſcure mouth they ſhot againſt the Enemy, who hardly detecting the fraud, yet at laſt when diſcovered, they ſtopped it up, from doing further miſchief; but when the Beſiegers had ſtopped it up behind alſo firſt throwing fire therein, the repreſſed force thereof, at length burſt out with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>The great Guns that were planted againſt them, as they ſailed over the River, they clogged, becauſe they could not bring them away, and preſently after ſo beat down, and worſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral Troops of Horſe, and eight hundred Foot, that came to relieve their Fellows, or revenge their deaths, that they returned with very great Honour, and little or no da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>

                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:55798:225"/>And after this, they made from other parts of the Town, many ſuccesful Sallies: yet for all there things, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> continued to batter the Walls, and in one place had made a breach in the Bulwark, where there was not a more inward Work, though <hi>Prince Maurice</hi> had commanded one to be made there, the neglect whereof was excuſed by them that were guilty of it, by the Townſmens poverty, and Souldiers inability to undergo ſo many and great labours at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albertus,</hi> according to the Cuſtom of War, ſent another Summons to the Town, being in this Condition, denouncing againſt them great threats, unleſs they would ſurrender.

Therefore he endeavours to undermine the <hi>Rampire</hi> and <hi>Bulwark,</hi> but without any certain hope, ſo long as they daily ſaw freſh men brought into the Town; but Fortune ſoon after ridded them of this trouble; for ſome did adviſe, ſuſpecting the lying ſtill of ſo furious and active an Enemy, that they ſhould endeavour to get from the Beſieged, ſome Iſlands and Fords, whereby they might command the <hi>River</hi> and <hi>Ships;</hi> Others, that Ambuſhes ſhould be laid to break into the City from the Trenches, whereby not onely the Front as heretofore, but the backſide alſo ſhould be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unſafe; or elſe to give ſudden Aſſaults upon the breaches: Thus fear inventing many things, firſt conceived in the breſt of one, is afterwards made publick by voyce and

Do you look for an Army to come, to drive the Enemy out of their Trenches and Leaguer, whom they could not keep off?

               <p>The Cardinall <hi>Albert</hi> was received with extraordinary applauſe of all his followers, becauſe the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family was not barren of Valour and Vertue, and that he being the reſtorer of <hi>Flanders</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> limits, after ſeven years, had then perfected their returned felicity with a treble Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and once more made their good Fortune permanent to them.

               <p>The Charge of the <hi>Fleet</hi> was committed to the Lord <hi>Charls Howard,</hi> the Admiral thereof; both of them had equal power and authority; which Thing hath ever been obſerved preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to Enterpriſes of that Nature, and to have damnified them, and hindred their Succeſs. They were both of very unſuitable Diſpoſitions; <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in a Youthful Heat of Bloud, ſeeking to get to himſelf both the Honour and Name of Chief Captain, was wont to force the Queen into Arms, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of Danger; though ſhe her ſelf, as a Woman, endeavour'd to avoid Expences: And, that the <hi>Fleet</hi> might

the more honourably proceed, he expended therein no ſmal matter of his own Eſtate; himſelf ſhewing the way to his Relations and Familiars, that they might follow his Example. <hi>Howard</hi> being a perſon more wary of managing Affairs, by reaſon of his Age, tended to the contrary, and endeavour'd by all means he could, to delay the going out of the <hi>Fleet:</hi> And when it was ready, he had perſwaded the <hi>Queen, that ſhe would admoniſh</hi> Eſſex <hi>by her Letters, that he would deſiſt from that dangerous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking and that ſhe would re-imburſe him what he had laid out.</hi> But he becauſe he was not plainly forbidden, anſwer'd, <hi>That he would proceed in his Voyage, and doubted not his good Fortune.</hi> Nor did he refuſe his <hi>Emulator,</hi> to be equal with him in Command, knowing, that his own Authority was greater with the Sea-men; and that he, upon any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, ſhould be leſs blamed where all Things were done with a Companion. And beſides, under pretence of Honour, he had won as many Noble-men as he could to go with him, who, he knew, had no kindneſs for him; leſt, in his abſence, they ſhould do him greater damage at home. There were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to both of them as Counſellors, ſeveral great Souldiers, and no Order ſhould be effectual, but what was approved by the conſent of the greater part of them.

               <p>The Ships ſet out by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>League</hi> were in number 24. the greateſt part of which were well fitted and prepar'd for War; the Admiral whereof was <hi>John Duvenvord Warmondt,</hi> to whom, next to the Prince, the chief Command, in Sea-Affairs, through <hi>Holland</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.

               <p>All the hope and preparation of this Fleet, was rather to look after Prey, than to fight; becauſe being far from Home, far from any Aſſiſtance, among their Enemies Countries, the danger of the Sea, and their Paſſage ſubject to Storms and Tempeſts, no delay could be ſafe enough. Nor do old Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles alone teach this, and the <hi>Portugall</hi> Voyage not long ſince undertaken, but the ſucceſs of the very former year in <hi>America,</hi> which fell ſo far ſhort of expectation: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thoſe Things ſeem'd rather to be put in Execution, which would, by their ſuddain violence, in no ſmall manner, terrifie and break the Enemies ſtrength; and they were not reſolved in what part to ſet upon them, a little before they came to <hi>Cadiz.</hi> At length, by private <hi>Letters,</hi> all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy was commanded to meet there: Theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> cloſe ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſigned, the Captains received, with this Order, <hi>The they ſhould not open them, unleſs they were by foul Weather ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Fleet.</hi>

At this day, it is beholding to a Bridge, which they call <hi>Suaca,</hi> for making it no Iſland; for that joyneth it to the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeparated there from onely by a ſmall Inlet of the Sea: On which ſide, the Name of the Region teſtifies, that formerly the <hi>Vandals</hi> inhabited there: Beyond is that Streight, where firſt the Ocean broke in upon, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Land: On this ſide is a convenient Bay, for the Reception and Safety of Ships: And then, by chance, a great Fleet lay under the Defences of the Iſland, which was partly prepar'd for the <hi>American</hi> Voyage, and partly furniſh'd for War, which had not ſo much increaſed the difficulty for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to land, as it had their Expectations, to the hope of a moſt plentiful and rich Booty. There were four Galeoons, two of <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> every one of them carrying fifty Guns, or more, and near 700 men: Of the Kings own Ships of War, there were 21. and as many Merchants Ships, which carryed 20 Guns a piece: Three Frigats, each of them beating 18 Guns, and laden with more for uſe of the Fleet, that was at <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and other Ports of <hi>Spain;</hi> for this Fleet here was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Third Part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Naval Force. There were then alſo 50 Sail of other Ships belonging to private perſons, come both from <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and other parts, which were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unarm'd, or but weakly furniſh'd: And not far off from the City, lay 21 long Ships more. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> earneſtly deſir'd to fall upon them, while they knew not what to do, and before their fear ſhould decay or grow leſs, leſt he might give them time, either to take counſel, or gather ſtrength; which if he could have perſwaded others to effect, (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were willing to have aſſiſted him) they had then gotten infinite Honour, together with an ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Booty.</p>

Thus, by delaying the time, they loſt their Opportunity. The next day, being the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> the Ebbe of the Sea hindred them, that they could not come to fight. Upon the left hand, as you enter into that Streight, is the <hi>Royal Port,</hi> ſo called; hither the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships had withdrawn themſelves, excepting onely the Galeoons, and Long Ships, which remain'd nearer to the City, where the Shore runs out into <hi>Linga,</hi> which the Inhabitants call <hi>Punta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

there in ſervice, urged and inſiſted on the contrary. After the Sea-fight, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the day now declining, landed his Souldiers at <hi>Puntal</hi> without reſiſtance; and the <hi>Holland Mariners</hi> having taken a Caſtle that lay upon the Sea, ſet up their Enſign thereon. Others alſo were ſent, to break the Bridge <hi>Suaca,</hi> leſt any Relief ſhould come that way, which accordingly they performed: All the <hi>Spaniſh Noble-men,</hi> that lived thereabouts, came to the Defence of the City with 600 Foot, and as many Horſe: Againſt whom was ſent <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> with 400 Spear-men, and a Band of <hi>Engliſh Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers;</hi> nor was the Fight long againſt them, being unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd to Matters of War: At the firſt Onſet being routed, and flying to the City in no order; They were follow'd by the <hi>Conquerours,</hi> who, while the <hi>Terrour</hi> remain'd freſh, entred the City, part over the Walls, and other part by the Gates, which they had how forced open.</p>
               <p>The People of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> at the beginning truſted to the Tops of their Houſes, which were flat, from thence caſting ſtones down upon the Enemy, as they were ſcatter'd in the Streets, not a few at a time, but as it were by whole Loads. Anon, when the Court and the Market-place were poſſeſſed, here the Townſmen all ran together into the Caſtle; there two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Souldiers follow'd, but ſtaid not long in it, becauſe they underſtood the Paſſage to them was ſhutting up by the Bridge, which we before mention'd: Whereupon the chief perſons of the City being given for Pledges, they redeem'd their Lives onely for One Hundred and Twenty Thouſand Ducats: And theſe <hi>Pledges</hi> being ſoon after carryed into <hi>England,</hi> in regard the Queen would not ſuffer them to be Ranſom'd, being provoked with new Injuries, dyed in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>There was alſo a Treaty between the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and one <hi>Peter Herrera,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh Merchant,</hi> for redeeming the Town and Ships from ſpoil, for the Sum of Twenty Hundred Thouſand Florens, whereto <hi>Eſſex</hi> was conſenting, as diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

the Prey would be imbezill'd and waſted by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſerve for the future to no purpoſe; but the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> would not allow of that <hi>Agreement,</hi> being the <hi>Superviſor</hi> of all the adjacent Coaſt, chuſing rather, that the King ſhould be deſpoiled of his <hi>Fleet,</hi> and Ten Thouſand Citizens outed of their Eſtates and Fortunes, ſuppoſing that then to be Gain in the midſt of Damage, if nothing after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward accrewed to the Enemy: and therefore the Town was ſpoiled, no ſmall Damage alighting upon the Merchants of <hi>Holland</hi> thereby; many of whom were by long Voyages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled with the Enemy, who eſteemed this Loſs at Three Hundred Thouſand pounds. And moreover, a <hi>Holland</hi> Ship, which came over to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> upon the Credit of <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> had Fifty thouſand Florens taken from her, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that it was the Enemies Money. And the <hi>Americas Fleet,</hi> well laded with Merchandize, and conſiſting of Two and Thirty Sail, was burned by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> together with ſome Ships of War that were for their Convoy.

As an Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all which Loſſes, that old Evil of Uſury, eat up all the publick Revenues: For <hi>Philip,</hi> Twenty years before, having much impair'd his Credit, while he was yet intangled in the <hi>Dutch</hi> War, not depreſſing his ambitious Things, after the Kingdoms belonging to others, nor comparing his infinite Disburſements, with his ordinary Income, by nouriſhing too covetous Endeavours, wherein <hi>Fortune</hi> proved various, he brought upon himſelf Poverty. For the greateſt part of the King's <hi>Creditors</hi> ſuſpecting his potency, onely ſome <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> of <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> much improved their Money, by the hazard of <hi>Commerce,</hi> and dealing with him, To theſe were given in <hi>Pledge</hi> as Security, almoſt all the Cuſtoms, who reckoning all the Hazards, both of War and the Sea, the incommodiouſneſs of Tranſportation, and alſo infinite Uſe and Extortion for their Money, did, for a long time, prevent the coming in of the <hi>Revenues</hi> to the King's uſe.</p>
               <p>Thus, his <hi>Treaſury</hi> bring beſieged, as it were by his <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> from whence he ſhould place and diſplace Officers, or at leaſtwiſe bear the Charge of his Wars, nothing came to the King, until ſome <hi>Polititians</hi> of his <hi>Court,</hi> rather careful for the preſent, than provident for the future, invented a way, though
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:55798:232"/>
not very honourable; which Advice, the King laying hold of, in the Moneth of <hi>November,</hi> he ſet forth an Edict, wherein declaring, with many Circumlocutions, the grievouſneſs of the Uſury he ſuffer'd; inſomuch that Husbandry ceaſed, and Merchandizing was left off: That the Cuſtoms of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Tenths of Prieſts, granted to him by the Pope, and the Tributes of ſeveral Nations, were all detained by moſt unjuſt Covenants, which the fear of worſe Evils had extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And in regard that ail his many Labours, in behalf of Chriſtianity, would be perverted, unleſs ſome ſpeedy courſe were taken, to ſupply or prevent thoſe Neceſſities. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without any other pretence of words, he declared, <hi>That whatſoever had been by him pawned, or laid to pledge, was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free from every ſuch Obligation:</hi> So that he preſently laid hold of all his Poſſeſſions, leaving to the <hi>Uſurers,</hi> at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nothing but hopes: Adding withall this Proviſo, <hi>That whatſoever had been paid above lawful Intereſt, ſhould be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Principal.</hi> In the mean while, a great many were ſtripped of their Wealth, though ſome, under a falſe pretence of Poverty, abuſed it to great advantage: And this ſame Calamity, for the like Reaſons, fell alſo upon ſome in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Arch-Duke hereby was ſurprized with ſuch a want of Money, that the next year he ſuffer'd by it moſt inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Damage: So that at laſt all came to his wonted courſe; not ſo much for ſhame of the <hi>Creditors,</hi> who cryed out, <hi>There was no Faith left,</hi> if the Royal Power would take upon it ſelf the infringement of Covenants; as becauſe the Names of the Revenues coming in were various, and where hence Money ſhould be brought, the Ways were infeſted with <hi>Thieves,</hi> and the Charges of the War required a preſent Remedy. But this could not be obtained, before the Promiſes and Engagements were renewed by the Reſtauration of the Pawns, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to pay every Moneth Eighteen Thouſand Duckets, and adde to the old Bank Four Hundred more; the Third Part

of which to be paid in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Reſidue in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> by Bill of Exchange. But, among the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as the Dearth and ſcarcity of Proviſion in <hi>Italy</hi> decreaſed, ſo did their Revenues, both publick and private: For ſupply where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> beſides their old Taxes, lately increaſed an Eighth Part, impoſed a new one, whereby they might reſtrain Riot and Exceſs daily increaſing, or elſe bring the Gain thereof to the publick Advantage. There was a Rate ſet upon all thoſe that ſold Silk, and other ſuch like pretious Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities for Garments. But when as the <hi>Collector</hi> began to put in Execution the ſaid Tax, at firſt the People began to rail with ſcurrilous Language; but afterward they fell to open force and blows. They, who without grudging, underwent the burden of daily Proviſion for Extraordinaries, yet ſtrove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, as if it had bin for their Liberty. But this ſeem'd a Reproach, not a Tribute; for the Contumacy of ſome ſo witſtood the publick Authority, that it appear'd unſafe, to incline to the contrary: But, in <hi>Frizeland,</hi> they who had the charge both of the Cities and the Country, not yet agreeing, while every one defends his Poſſeſſions againſt the payment of Tributes, they made it evident, with what Diſeaſes chiefly the Common-wealth may be afflicted, where there is not likewiſe a common profit. But the chief care of the Nobles, was bent to ſettle and confirm a League between themſelves and the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for hitherto they had given Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance one to the other at requeſt, and their own pleaſure; which had ſometimes been the cauſe of Complaints among them, and on all ſides produced Threats, tending to the breach of Peace. But the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who had perpetual cauſe of War, and, as for the moſt part, ſuch Alliances overſtrain the Inferiours, while their Forces were at War in <hi>France,</hi> or at Sea with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> loſt <hi>Hulſt,</hi> and all the Tributes grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> no man caring for their Griefs or Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

And their Courage was heightned from <hi>de Maiu,</hi> and others of that Faction, who had preferred the King's Pardon, before the Commerce of Foreign Pride: And now the great Council of the whole Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſummon'd at <hi>Roan,</hi> there appear'd the lawful Face of a Kingdom: Nor was there any great averſion in King <hi>Philip,</hi> from hearkning to Pacification; which as it was true, ſo that he ſhould marry the King of <hi>France</hi> his Daughter, was firſt onely a <hi>Spaniſh Device;</hi> a little after ſtrengthned with a falſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Counts of <hi>Bulloin</hi> and <hi>Sancy,</hi> being ſent Embaſſadors to her from <hi>France,</hi> at ſuch time as <hi>Albertus</hi> had taken <hi>Calais,</hi> at firſt ſhew'd her ſelf very ſtrange towards them, as if ſhe could very ill ſpare to lend them five and twenty thouſand Scutes: But ſhortly after, taking a nearer view of the danger, of her own accord, ſhe not onely kept the Embaſſadors with her, but treated with them of a more ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led League, the Conditions and Articles whereof were then begun to be diſcourſed of. In the interim, the talk of Peace more and more increaſing, the King ſignified to the <hi>

But for all this great oſtentation: when, at the Siege of <hi>Hulſt,</hi> a little after, ſuch an Action would have been moſt acceptable, the <hi>French</hi> never ſo much as made an offer to ſtir.

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:55798:234"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> for concluſion of the League, was detained Three Moneths: And there was at this time a Truce agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Garriſons of <hi>Calais</hi> and <hi>Bulloin;</hi> all which Things the <hi>French</hi> excuſed thus: That they were not able to bring forth their Army, becauſe the <hi>French Nobility</hi> are always wont to reſt themſelves from all Actions Military in time of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt; and not onely ſo, but the <hi>Netherlandiſh Border:</hi> alſo were viſited with the Plague; That the League was delay'd onely, while it might be fully deliberated in all the <hi>French Parliaments,</hi> and that the <hi>Truce</hi> was quickly broken off. But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had more to do with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who now, for two years together, had required them to come to an Account, and re-imburce her Money; enumerating, the Succeſſes of the War, not without a ſhew of Emulation, and the ſtately ſtructures of their Cities: And, on the other ſide, declaring her own Neceſſities, which ſhe could not ſupply with continual Veins of Mettal, as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> did, but only from the Love and Benignity of her Subjects: And the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, as it inforced the new raiſing of Money at Home; ſo likewiſe it neceſſitated her to call in what ſhe had abroad: On the other ſide, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadors, firſt rendring many Thanks, beſeeched her to ſtand to the League; complaining, That they had had but a ſhort Benefit of thoſe Things, which had bin agreed 12 Years before: And that the Covenants did not ſet down any ſet number of Souldiers; whereupon they, who as they never had ſtagger'd in their Fidelity, nor had inclined to the War with wavering Counſels, yet had bin, by the uncertainty of Forces, oftentimes revolved unto vain <hi>Attempts;</hi> and that this was very unſeaſonable in the heat of War, to expect that, which did not begin to be a debt, until there were a Peace ſetled, as by the Agreement will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: That their Condition was not ſo much alter'd, but that they ſtill deſerv'd rather Pity, than Envy: For beſides the rich Cities of <hi>Brabant,</hi> they had loſt certain Towns at the <hi>Maes,</hi> and particularly, thoſe which were moſt convenient both by
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:55798:234"/>
Sea and Land, for raiſing and collecting the <hi>Flandrian Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</hi> Nor had they bin at a ſmall charge, after the driving away the <hi>Spaniſh Fleet</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> in ſo many Naval Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and to what end had they aſſiſted <hi>France,</hi> but that the War might be repelled, and the Seas be kept open, while the Enemy was imploy'd at Land. Hereto was added the Shipwracks they had ſuffer'd, the reſtriction or taking of their Ships, the breaches of their Banks by the Sea, and other daily Evils they had undergone, by Misfortunes and Caſualties. Concerning theſe Things, there was a long Argument with <hi>Bodley,</hi> who was <hi>Leiger</hi> for the Queen among the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> concerning the <hi>Dutch Affairs:</hi> Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all which, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> grew every day more obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, till at length ſhe was mollified by procraſtination, but chiefly by the Supplies they ſent to her for the <hi>Cadiz</hi> Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>But no ſooner was the benefit of that Kindneſs conſum'd, but preſently the ſame Conteſt was again renew'd, and <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Loſe, James Valquy,</hi> and <hi>Abel Franken,</hi> being ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors into <hi>England,</hi> the Queen gave them this ſhort An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; <hi>That, that was not the intent of the League, that the</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers <hi>ſhould prolong a War against themſelves, on purpoſe to delay, without meaſure or end, the payment of thoſe Charges, by others disburſed for them. And as to the Peace they hoped, if it proved diſadvantageous to them, neither had it been profitable to her thoſe</hi> 12 <hi>years, having both for that time, and hitherto e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what kind of Alliance muſt that be, whoſe very Branch muſt depend upon the pleaſure of another?

Therefore, this Debate of Right being in vain, and but for a ſhew made uſe of, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ran back to their old Guard, ſhewing the danger they ſhould incur from all their Neighbouring Dominions, if the ſtrength of their Cities already weakned, ſhould be utterly dejected by ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and ſo much both of Wealth and Power by Sea added to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> But above all, when the dubious ſtate of the matter, and ſo diſcordant in the ſetling the Account of Receipts and Disburſements, had almoſt brought them to a Non-plus: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> urged the payment at leaſt of ſome part of the Debt; and, for the future, not to ſeek a Remedy againſt growing Danger, from old Covenants, as by Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but rather to merit new Favours by their Gratitude and Thanks for the former. The Embaſſadors, with many hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Intreaties, offer'd, That there ſhould be an Annual Portion paid, notwithſtanding all their preſent ſtreights, and the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, at the end of the War; which the Queen ſlighted as inconſiderable, while in the interim, a great fearſpread it ſelf, ariſing from a Rumor, that there was Hoſtility intended againſt her in <hi>Spain;</hi> and that the preparations there made, to that purpoſe, were greater than ever before. Hereupon the Wiſe of thoſe times, began ſeriouſly to conſider of both Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and judged, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were not ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with Poverty, but that it would oblige them to the Queen in a ſtrict Alliance, eſpecially conſidering the danger of ſo great a Loſs, and that the Queen might at ſome time want Money, they might well bear, unleſs their Counſel could put the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> now tyred with importunate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, in mind of her Power, it being not to be ſuffer'd, that her Debtors ſhould raiſe themſelves to a more proſperous Fortune by Foreign Amities.</p>

common people; while the labour it ſelf being without hope of preferment, and certainly attended by poverty, was the cauſe of penury, both in the teachers and learners.

But this man, by the infection of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſters</hi> party, was carryed ſo far, that he forgot not onely his Studies, but even the duties of a private perſon, and a ſtranger, and from thence went away to <hi>Altorf:</hi> For inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Manners and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries and dilucidations of Antiquity, was <hi>Juſtus Lipſius,</hi> who added both to his own fame, and the Honour of the place by his Learning, a perſon, who by the pleaſing gravity of his behaviour, was honoured beyond his Profeſſion, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring moſt men to delight in him, by the ſweetneſs of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; for ſince Nature had denyed him neither <hi>Rhetorick</hi> nor <hi>Oratory,</hi> he rather choſe that conciſe manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is intermingled with mirth, which was in truth, a new mode of Speech, but yet in ſome ſort reſembling Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; which when ſuch did ſtrive to imitate, as were not equall to him in wit and Judgement, they deviated into the moſt corrupt conceptions: But when publick fear, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate injury had forced <hi>Lipſius</hi> to change his party, there was ſent for out of <hi>France, Joſeph</hi> the Son of <hi>Julius,</hi> who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Family of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> from which he was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not onely Nobility, but the vertue of paternal Wiſdom,

But the ſame God who had often before prevented them in the like endeavours, now again ſhewed his power; for in one night, forty of their Ships were caſt away upon the Sands and Shallowes, with the loſs of five thouſand men, and a great Sum of Money.</p>
               <p>The greateſt harm to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> was his own diffidence; for the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Officers, which they had taken into the Fleet, admoniſhing them to go another way, they compelled with drawn Swords, to follow the ill preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Signs of them going before: At length among the hindermoſt of the Ships, a certain Seaman of <hi>Holland,</hi> was believed, who eight years before, having great Rewards for preſerving many of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by ſo much the more faithfully he now again performed the like Office.

They found it the greateſt help to them, to imitate their own Country Stoves, or elſe to warm their beds with exceeding hot Iron or Stones.</p>
               <p>Now did Foxes occupy the empty places left by the Bears (for the Bear is a Creature, whoſe ſight being more dull, and therefore afraid of the darkneſs, had hidden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Caves.</p>
               <p>Theſe Foxes being taken by Traps, ſerved them both for Victuals and Rayment.

               <p>By which Argument, many have been induced to believe, that the Ice was brought down cut of the River of <hi>Scythia,</hi> and that the violence of the cold is encreaſed, by the vicinity of the ſhores, rather than of the Pole; for the heat doth not preſently abate as much as you back from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial: wherefore they were forced to take their Journey in this open Sea, under the very North Star, if any for the future durſt make an attempt there after them. Another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this Opinion was, that the Iſland which we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned formerly to be green, lay below <hi>Zembla</hi> in regard <hi>Zem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla</hi> it ſelf, nouriſheth nothing green, and therefore in all that Land, there is no Creature bred, which uſeth ſuch Paſture. But now the Marriners in vain, delayed the egreſs of their Ship, yet detained by the Ice, and by this procraſtination, the Victuals which hitherto they had moderately diſtributed every day man by man, began to fail, and their drink being corrupted, and ſpoyled by the Froſt, compelled them to melt Snow to aſſwage their thirſt, and if they ſhould ſtay any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Winter would again return, and together with it, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mine: hereupon, they ſpeeded forwards, their Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats, and although moſt of them were ſick, (for poverty, and the many great miſeries they had undergone, had even worn out all their ſtrength:) yet neceſſity, which is ſtronger then any Diſeaſe, ſo did encourage them, that they hewed the Ice riſing into great Hills, untill they had made it level, and then drawing their little Veſſels that way, at length they got a float, yet had they not then an end of their Labours; for
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:55798:243"/>
being often ſtopped with Ice, and ſcarcely eſcaping away by the help both of their Oars, Sails and hands, they were compelled to go thence to the next Coaſt, for meer hunge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the interim, they among them that were ſick, being expoſed to the Rain, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of the piercing Ayr, dying, were a great cauſe of grief to their Companions, if not of envy, when they looked back upon their own condition, trembling to think what end, Fortune, or rather Providence would allot them.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe that dyed, was <hi>William Barent,</hi> the Maſter of the unfortunate Ship, who was no leſs worthy to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in the Catalogue of famous men, then was <hi>Veſputius</hi> and <hi>Columbus</hi> though in diſpight of Fortune.

               <p>Thus while their Labour increaſed, and their ſtrength de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd, an auſpicious Wind brought them, even now fainting, and able to work no more, to the utmoſt Skirts of <hi>Zembla,</hi> oppoſite to our Ocean.

Return of that good Fortune, which had, ſince the Honour atchieved at <hi>Groening,</hi> been at a ſtay. For the Arch-Duke <hi>Albertus,</hi> having freed the <hi>Borders</hi> of <hi>Artois</hi> from fear of the <hi>French,</hi> had put his Souldiers into <hi>Garriſons;</hi> yet leaving the greateſt part thereof in <hi>Brabant,</hi> wherein there were four Regiments of old Souldiers, and ſome freſh men, for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies: ſo as they were above four Thouſand Foot, and five Troops, containing five hundred Horſe, which all quarrer'd in and about <hi>Turnhoult.</hi> This is a conſiderable Village of <hi>Brabant,</hi> having round about it open Fields, formerly much delighted in by the Princes, when Hunting, and innocent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, diverted their more ſerious Thoughts: Then it was choſen for concealing of Counſels, becauſe the place being of equal diſtance to many places, yields no ſhew of a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>This, in regard of its incertainty, made the <hi>Hollanders</hi> more fearful, while he was ſuſpected in the next Towns of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and the Iſles of <hi>Zeland,</hi> eſpecially by reaſon of the Ice, whereby the Rivers, which are the ſtrongeſt Defence of thoſe parts, being Frozen, ſhewed them an eaſie Paſſage to go whither they liſted. And the Conjecture was not much diſſonant from their Actions, which ſuppoſed them to be there quarter'd, that they might, in ſtead of Pay, waſte and plunder the Fertile Country adjoyning.

But beſides this, the flying Horſe had cauſed a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall terrour, and the Regiments themſelves were not advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly ordered; for the great Bodies of Pikes, made up out of all the Bands, did not defend the reſt, but ſtood here and there, thin and diſperſedly, ſo that the <hi>Naſſavians</hi> might with eaſe break in among them, and that the more ſafely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Musketiers had diſcharged their ſhot, not by turns, and one after another, but in a manner, all at once.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Baſta</hi> afterwards accuſed, that he had not rather maintained the Rear of the Foot, ſhewed Count <hi>Warras</hi> his Orders to him. Of the <hi>Naſſavian</hi> Aſſaylants, four onely were killed, and ſix hurt, this day yielding a Noble docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of new fighting. For Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had not armed his Horſemen with Lance, according to general Cuſtoms, but with <hi>Carabines</hi> (for ſo is that ſort of Gun called.) Therefore the Darts which were firſt thrown, being avoided, before the Spearmen could get time and place, for uſe of their Spears, they were ſo ſuddainly and furiouſly wounded, that they were neither able to weild their Arms, or keep themſelves in any order. And when they were thus routed, and brought into confuſion, they had no room to fly away, becauſe the Woods and Waters which were a defence to them fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were turned to their great hindrance and prejudice, as they fled; ſo that the <hi>Victors</hi> by their too much confidence, were like to have fallen into danger; for while ſome of them continued the ſlaughter, and others were fallen upon their Prey; <hi>Basta</hi> accompanied with a few of his men, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:55798:246"/>
that all the narrow Streights and Paſſages of the wayes, were ſtopped, he feigned boldneſs out of neceſſity, he turns his Bridle, and runs back upon the Enemy.</p>
               <p>This unexpected and ſudden chance, made many of the <hi>Naſſavians,</hi> who were wholly minding the ſpoyl, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Waggons, to turn their backs and fly (for that kind of People are for the moſt part full of fear.) But the chief <hi>Commanders</hi> of the Horſe, part of which had followed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in a great and ſlow moving Body, by Fortune, then came in to ſtop thoſe that fled, and encourage thoſe that were afraid, threatning withall, that unleſs they turned head upon their Enemies, themſelves would become their Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners: And with this fear, ſome Priſoners, who ſtood about the <hi>Prince</hi> begging for their lives, doubting a change of Fortune, were run through with Swords, and killed; But the <hi>Prince,</hi> careful to prevent the like for the future, had newly appointed as a ſafeguard to themſelves and the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, four Troops then before exempted from danger: yet the Captain of one Troop being commanded to lead up his, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Command in evill part, had intermingled them all in the Fight, being indeed of themſelves, more ready for pillage then obedience; yet flocking at laſt to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief, they eſpecially, who were moved either with the ſenſe, or reverence of Duty or Reputation, they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the danger; and the Enemies once more put to flight, were equally afflicted with their own ſlaughters, and the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the wayes: having all this while, ſcarce ſullyed the Victory with the loſs of ten of the <hi>Conquerours:</hi> The Foot came in onely to part of the Soyl.</p>
               <p>After this Fight, here were buried above two thouſand of the Enemies; there were five hundred taken Priſoners, and a great number of Enſigns: ſome dyed of their wounds. Next day the Caſtle of <hi>Turnhoult</hi> well encompaſſed with <hi>Trenches</hi> was ſurrendred. The Foot being returned into <hi>Garriſons,</hi> and the Horſe Commanded forthwith to depart, leaſt the Enemy
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:55798:247"/>
ſhould rally any of his Forces, and in the night ſet upon them wearied with the purſuit. Thence the Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing among the joyful gratulations of the People, he hanged up in the Counſel-Houſe at the <hi>Hagne,</hi> eight and thirty Foot-Colours taken from the Enemy, and one <hi>Cornet</hi> of Horſe, which had been <hi>Drakes:</hi> Nor was the Reputation of the Victory any thing leſſened by this, that Count <hi>Warras</hi> himſelf, being at the very firſt, ſtruck down to the ground, his breathleſs Corps was ſent together with Letters to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus,</hi> who returned great thanks for the ſame, and when of late, a Horſeman or Trooper belonging to the Prince, being hanged by the Enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had been vindicated by the like pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> for the future, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed faithfully, to obſerve the Laws of Arms, himſelf being naturally a great ſtranger to all cruelty.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt Experiment Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> who had now for ten years been General, received of him by Letters. Nor did there grow a Confidence in the Souldier onely, againſt the Enemy, from the Event; but likewiſe it made him more cautious of what might happen, in regard he had ſeen that the Diſcipline of the Army, was not ſufficiently ſupported againſt ſudden accidents, and the War proved du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, upon any ſlight turning of mens minds, and that there was ſo much danger, even in the obtaining of Victory.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Albertus,</hi> being at once oppreſſed with the want of Money, and ſo great a ſlaughter of his men, fell to Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion night and day, but yet was hardly able to procure a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to either of theſe miſchiefs.</p>
               <p>He was exhauſted alſo before, not by payment of debts, but giving of Gratuities, ſo that at the one Siege of <hi>Hulſt,</hi> he gave away more in Rewards, then the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> ſpent in three years, by which means, from that time, there had been a failer of payment of the Souldiers Wages: Thus he who before by extraordinary Gifts, had allured many to come over from their own party to him, was now very much

by which the Perculliſes, the ſtayes that held them up, being cut, as is uſual in time of danger, might be ſupported a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a fall. The Keepers of the Paſſage were eaſily killed, either with the Weapons that were hid before, or thoſe that were gotten by the firſt ſlaughter; and by the ſpeedy run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in of thoſe, who lay hid in certain places near the City, a way was made for the following Companies; By chance, in that very Punctillio of time, (for it was <hi>Lent</hi>) a certain man in a Sermon to the People, laying before them their ſins, and altogether ignorant of the deſign, ſaid, they were worthy to fall into the power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſo they did. For although the City was both ſtrong and populous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by no leſs then fourteen thouſand men, yet did it not long reſiſt, whether from the ambiguity of their Allegiance to the King, or being grown voyd of Valour, from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſecurity, or wanting of Government, is uncertain; but this is ſure, that the Count St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Governour of the Place, hearing the Tumult, fled out of the Town another way: Things thus ſecured, the Garriſon was augmented, all things that adjoyned to the City burned, the Citizens diſarmed and ſpoiled, yielded a great booty, as well to the Souldiery as the Commanders, eſpecially the Arch-Duke, becauſe the King a little before had ſent in thither a great number of Artillery, and all other Furniture for War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albertus</hi> ſent a Meſſenger to King <hi>Philip,</hi> with the news of this good ſucceſs, affirming, that it was one, and that the chiefeſt of the Cities Scituate on the River <hi>Samar,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly poſſeſſed by the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> untill the <hi>French</hi> extorted them from their Heyr, a fatherleſs Virgin; and therefore now, what was gotten by War, he ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſtill to retain, if at any time thereafter, a Peace ſhould happen to be concluded.</p>
               <p>This produced a great damage to the <hi>French,</hi> but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome benefit: For the Citizens of <hi>Amiens,</hi> being uſed hardly by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> made even thoſe in <hi>France</hi> that were
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:55798:248"/>
of the Catholick Religion, more obedient to the King, and not to refuſe Gariſons as before they did. The King himſelf, the thoughts of Peace being ſhaken off, ſpent all his time with his Allyes, ſo that now he ſeemed ready to accept the ſame Conditions, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had offered before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Calais.</hi> In the mean time, the Fortune of one day, made the <hi>French</hi> a long work to recover what was loſt; whereupon, the Horſe being Quartered all about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from thence <hi>Biron</hi> encreaſed his Forces by all means to beſiege <hi>Amiens,</hi> untill the King himſelf came before it, and being allured to try his turn, he unfortunately attempted <hi>Artois,</hi> by blowing up the Walls with Gun-powder, and Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Ladders: Nor had the <hi>French</hi> any better ſucceſs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Cambray</hi> or <hi>Dorlens:</hi> And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> likewiſe loſt their deſign upon <hi>Gravewaert,</hi> an Iſland within the diviſion of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and alſo upon <hi>Steenwie,</hi> againſt which there were a thouſand Foot out of the Garriſons, &amp; twenty and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe gathered together by ſeveral marches. Theſe in the dead of the night, having cut down the Paliſadoes that ſtood in the way, endeavoured to come up to the Rampire. And as they had much forwarded their firſt attempts by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſo that the terrour might by reaſon of the darkneſs, be greater, they aſſaulted divers parts of the Walls, with a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Outcry and Singing; but the Sentinels not troubled with bare noyſes, expoſed themſelves to the danger, and that advertiſed others that ſtood not far off; (for moſt of them were in ſmall covered Huts near the Rampire:) part of whom without their Cloaths, as they leaped out of their Beds, threw down Stones upon the Aſſaylants heads, as they climbed up the Walls; Others half Armed, killed the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies retiring from the Rampire, or elſe by their ſhot, driving away ſuch as came on afreſh, and purſuing them when they fled.</p>
               <p>Thus the Aſſaylants, though divers times gathering freſh Courage, yet at length were beaten off, ſtriving to hide the

But the other Ship, laden with an hundred Souldiers, was hindred by the ſlacking of the wind, and a Ford or Shallow in the River, in which time, the day-light fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, the Townſmen aſſembled, and with great labour ſtopped at firſt the inner Gate; then their number encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they drove away thoſe that kept the Skirts of the Town, being not above fifty men. And as they ſled, they were wounded by the Seamen from <hi>Leige.</hi>

               <p>In this third Experiment of his Valour, was ſlain <hi>Matthias Holly,</hi> yet no leſs worthy of Honour there then at <hi>Breda</hi> and <hi>Nordam.</hi> With him alſo fell <hi>Schalque</hi> the Captain of the Ship.

One who had delivered, or rather betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gate by a Politick confidence running about the City, affrighted as it were with the common terrour, and not being known, eſcaped away on the contrary ſide of the Town. Moreover, ſome Souldiers being ſent with a Fleet to the Coaſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> returned, having effected nothing.</p>
               <p>In this mean while, the Count of <hi>Bulloyn,</hi> with a ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, waſting and plundering <hi>Henault,</hi> and the Country about the <hi>Maes,</hi> never reſted long in one place; and Prince <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>'s Horſe, being by their late Victory grown more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, going out of their Garriſons in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Gelderland,</hi> were both of them, though in ſeveral places, ſurpriſed by the

At this time, ſome diſcords begun to grow among them, although not ſufficient to make a breach of the League, yet the more ſuſpected, becauſe they fell out at that time.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Groeninge,</hi> and they that inhabited the open Country, between the Rivers <hi>Emes,</hi> and <hi>Lecke,</hi> breathing out inveterate and cankered hate one againſt the other, were not eaſily united or reconciled, while the City obſtinately urgeth thoſe things, which the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had granted to it, when it followed the Kings Party, not by a ſetled and perpetual Law, but in the manner of an Interloquatory Edict.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, the Boors brake the antient League with it, and refuſe all Society, as if the City had endeavoured a diminution of their liberty, whereas they would manage their own buſineſs ſeparately; It was true, that as formerly all the People of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo likewiſe the <hi>Frizons,</hi> had diſtinct Dominions, that no Conſultations ſhould be held, but by their Conſent; But the Country beyond <hi>Lecke,</hi> and ſuch as were diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Dorpes,</hi> had agreed by Article, to joyn their Forces with thoſe of the City, which was their Neighbour, as well againſt foreign, as domeſtick evills; to whom likewiſe flouriſhing in Merchandiſe, and Reverenced for Sanctimony of Judgment, they had given great Authority in the ordering both, and all the Neighbouring People wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offered them thereby, the Reward of their Allyance, being accuſtomed there to proclaim all their Solemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions: But that which at the beginning was free, by long uſe, and many Covenants, had now paſſed into the force of Law and Right; yet this was not the time, that all Bonds,

however ſtrictly tyed, ſhould be looſed; 'Tis true, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> looked upon it, as a main part of his Potency, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the diviſions of his Subjects, by giving no definitive Sentence between them; But the Strength of the United States was augmented by Concord, and therefore they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Judges for the deciding theſe Controverſies: At firſt, three, and when the Country-People were offended at their Judgment, nine others were added, whoſe Decree was allowed and confirmed in the Counſel of the General States.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe, the Deputies as well for the City, as the Country, are Commanded to make one Body Politick out of both, to Govern as one Common-wealth, and all matters of the greateſt Concernment, were to be debated in that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; but things of meaner quality, to be diſcuſſed by the Deputies. To their care was committed, all the common Tributes and Taxes, and whatſoever had belonged, either to the Prince or Prieſthood, that in all equal ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Many other things there, were of like nature compoſed, which although at firſt moved with high Conteſts, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But now the contention of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Zeland,</hi> was ſo much the more grievous, by how much the Unity of the entire Body was maintained by the Wealth of theſe: The difference was about Cuſtoms, which were raiſed by Tranſportation of Commodities, either to Foreign Nations, or the Enemy.</p>
               <p>This the ſeveral Provinces looked upon, not as a peculiar Propriety, but the common Stock of the League; for bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Charge of the Naval-Affairs, which if it fell ſhort by any means, they were for the publick good to make up out of their private Purſes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Zelanders</hi> ſtretched this further, compelling all ſorts of Commodities that were brought out of <hi>Holland,</hi> and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their Iſlands to other places, to pay another part of Cuſtom with them, which becauſe it could not be hindred, was by a temporary Agreement between the two Provinces confined; But the <hi>Hollander</hi> renounced this Convention, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon an Edict of the United States, which declared, that where Carryage was taken in, there the freight ought to be payd; Beſides this, the <hi>Zelanders</hi> were accuſed, that by diminiſhing the Cuſtoms and puniſhments, they had reduced the common Stock into their hands, as of right, and by that meanes, and the like deceits, they had converted all forreign Trade, and the advantages thereof, to themſelves, againſt the Faith and Agreement of ſo neceſſary an Allyance: whereto when they anſwered, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> by their Covetouſneſs, obtruded the name of the States, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where the name of the Prince and Senate, that they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled in one, many Controverſies: Nor did they both ceaſe to prefer their own merits, in the management of the War before thoſe of the other, objecting to each other, ſloath and neglect, and if the League ſhould be diſſolved, they could among themſelves have ſufficient ſtrength to maintain and defend their private Affairs. Nay, to ſuch a height, was
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:55798:251"/>
the <hi>Zelanders</hi> fury riſen, that they denyed to pay any Tribute to the League, which afterward, other meaner and leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable People taking into example, it was ſcarce agreed at length, that ſome Commodities of <hi>Zeland</hi> being relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, for the future, their Authority ſhould be preſerved in the great Counſel of the General States.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were in Agitation, ſeveral Forreign Embaſſies were heard, where were at large diſcourſed, the benefits and prayſe of Peace, with the miſeries and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of War, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the interim taking care, not ſo much to obtain Peace, as to throw the Odium of the War upon the <hi>States,</hi> as denying and being averſe to peace; Among theſe Embaſſies, the ingrateful Speech of <hi>Paulus Dialius,</hi> ſent to them from <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> was taken notice of, who in a Latine Speech thundring aloud, when he talked much of the duties of Subjects towards their Princes, he threatned to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> certain ruine from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> greatneſs, unleſs they acknowledged their fault, and deſired Pardon, offering the King his Maſter as a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; but on the contrary, he highly extolled King <hi>Philips</hi> goodneſs and fidelity, and that before the Sons and Kinſmen of the Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> and Count <hi>Egmonde:</hi> no leſs were the names of Chriſtianity, and that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Power, though at ſuch diſtance, hung over their heads with terrour, the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Poland</hi> to redeem its fear thereof with Peace, having withdrawn it ſelf from the common War. Nor was it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the <hi>States,</hi> how the <hi>Polander</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> were linked together, both by neceſſity and Allyance, and which was the neareſt tye of all, the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> reſidence in the Kings Court.</p>
               <p>To this it was modeſtly anſwered, as to cauſe and danger of Peace, and that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> waged more cruel Wars againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> than the <hi>Turks,</hi> cut of an exceſſive am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Soveraignty. Whereof <hi>Sigismund</hi> ought rather to take care before any domeſtick Conjunction. And when
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:55798:251"/>
He notwithſtanding this, yet grew more cholerick, as if he intended to break off all commerce, they who treated with him, affirmed, that they were in no more need of the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Harveſt, if the Laws of humanity ſhould be violated, then the <hi>Polanders</hi> were of their money.</p>
               <p>At this time alſo, the <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the chief City, ſent to require Audience of a moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Embaſſie, which the <hi>States,</hi> ſuſpecting the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo great an Authority, excuſed: whereupon, they ſent other <hi>Letters</hi> by <hi>Charles Nutſelius,</hi> queſtioning with ſome bitterneſs, whether that were the Reverence they bore to the <hi>Germane</hi> Allyance, and whether they would return this thanks for all the benefits they had received, to deny to them their Friends, what was granted even to Enemies among all Nations: Nor would it be ſufficient for the <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> onely to treat of Peace, which yet, that it might be without Fraud, and ſecure, if any occaſion ſhould be given, they ſhould diligently take care, but alſo of many other weighty Affairs, which concerned the <hi>Hollanders</hi> no leſs, than the <hi>Germans:</hi> This <hi>Nutſelius</hi> interpreted to relate to the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the old Leagues, proteſting not without threats, that no man ſhould deſpiſe the Majeſty of the <hi>Empire</hi> unpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed.</p>
               <p>To this, the <hi>States</hi> with great Humility replyed, that they did this onely out of Honour and Reverence to the <hi>German</hi> name, that they might be premoniſhed, leſt they ſhould put themſelves to the trouble of a vain and fruitleſs Embaſſie: There being no perſons in the World, that could better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their Affairs, and what was expedient for them, then themſelves.</p>
               <p>With a little more ſeriouſneſs, came from the King of <hi>Denmark, Arnoldus Witfeldius,</hi> the <hi>Preſident</hi> of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and <hi>Chriſtian Barnicavius,</hi> the ſame King, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by moſt, doing this, rather becauſe he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, than of his own accord; for he had been a Fatherly

Friend, both to the Houſe <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and the People of <hi>Holland,</hi> and beſides, proſeſſed the ſincere and reformed Religion, and therefore would require nothing, that might ſeem fraudulent, either to that or them. But becauſe in Peace God might be more purely worſhipped, and both publick and private Affairs, conſiſted more ſafely without the chances of War, he hoped they would not look upon him as an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, or uncapable Authour of ſo great a good; To theſe ſo many and great Adviſers of Concord, the <hi>States</hi> in effect gave one and the ſame Anſwer, the words onely vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but they wrote to the <hi>Dane,</hi> with more civility than any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>I will here briefly relate the Reaſons of this their Reſolve ſo often before-mentioned, leaſt that paſſe for currant with the Reader, which they began by often hearing, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame things to nauſeate. They inſiſted, that both by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Allyance, and afterwards by the great vertue of Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> they were ſo obliged, that they could not in private, either accept, or ſuffer any Articles of Peace, which as it would be wicked, ſo likewiſe would it be dangerous for them to think, becauſe the thoughts of Peace, though frivolous, yet makes all men more remiſs in matters of War, and for the moſt part, from the liberty and Leagues of Cities, ſprings, diſcord and hatred. And at this time, were certain <hi>Letters</hi> written by <hi>William Clement,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the <hi>Emperour</hi> diſcovered, which did ſet forth ſuch hopes, and that the <hi>Germans</hi> had onely gotten envy from the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> by their motioning of Peace: And then were added, the examples of divers things done at <hi>Breda, Gaunt, Colen,</hi> and in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> which had much promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Enemies ſnares: After which things, they averred, that they could never hope for an end of the War from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> infidelity, but by the goodneſs of God, the onely Ruler of Armies, if perchance then the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent might prevail.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="595" facs="tcp:55798:252"/>A word or two now for the cauſe: how and under what neceſſity of labouring, they were compelled to thoſe things, whereof no agreement could make them ſecure; It was the Intereſt of their Neighbours, leaſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being eaſed of ſo great a War, ſhould grow greater by the addition of thoſe Forces, which ſhould by Peace become ſubject to him, which if he once attained, he might have alwayes in readineſs, an Hundred Thouſand Men. Now to oppreſs and enſlave one, anon another. That it was a frequent Speech in the mouths of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that the <hi>Hereticks</hi> were to be Conquered by the blood of <hi>Hereticks;</hi> nor did they by that Name, comprehend the followers of the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is called; but alſo thoſe of the <hi>Augustane</hi> Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, both by their own and the <hi>Popes</hi> Judgement, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that name is no leſs hated now by the <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> then of old was that name of King, among the moſt puiſſant <hi>Romans;</hi> and yet there remain ſome tracks thereof, with thoſe People which affect ſuch a Soveraign Dominion, as is next of all to liberty; neither is that Form of Government, which the <hi>Polanders</hi> publickly maintain; ſo much grounded upon the Right of Birth, as the conſent of Election, whereof alſo, the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Dane</hi> retain a Similitude, giving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame account of their Governments; They ſay, the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> were never enſlaved, but had alwayes a moderated Empire bounded by Laws; That the care of the Laws was committed from their Anceſtors, to ſuch as gave particular Teſtimonies of Valour and Vertue. That the Inclinations and Affections of Governing by Juſtice, paſſed from Father to Son; for then there was no infinite, unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Arbitrary Power, but it was kept within Aſſemblies, which made the Name of King, be wholly unknown. Then both Prince and People, had a Confidence and Faith of each other, untill <hi>Philip,</hi> not onely by perverting Judgement, and exacting things never granted, violated the Oath he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:55798:253"/>
but alſo on the other ſide, he contemned and ſaid aſide, contrary to all Juſtice and Equity, the true intents of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies, dipping his hands in the blood of innumerable Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents. That which Nature Commands all Creatures, which is the Principle of ſelf-preſervation, we have done, and not promiſcuouſly as <hi>Libertines,</hi> but under the Conduct of a worthy Prince, the Prince of <hi>Aurange.</hi> In the interim, many Supplications were made to <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Neighbour-Princes ſolicited him to mitigate the ſeverity of his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; But after that Treachery and Revenge were found to lie hid under the pretences of his peace, We removed (which is no new thing among Subjects) him doing by his power, ſuch things as were contrary to his duty as a Prince, and this by a publick Decree, wherein were ſet forth all the Cauſes and Motives thereof.</p>
               <p>And then again it ſeemed good to ſome, to Elect for their Prince the King of <hi>France</hi> his Brother, while others ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the power of the Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> which they had no ſooner done, but forthwith he was aſſaſſinated by <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Treachery, and the Succeſſion of Government by his death, devolving to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> who now being ſupported by the Allyances of ſundry great Princes, defendeth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth our limits by Arms. I have in this manner declared theſe things, that among Remote Nations, the Report of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs then might be known from the uſe of matters at preſent.</p>
               <p>Nor were the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſatisfied, to ſhake off the offers of Peace, but that they incited others to take up Arms, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting againſt the <hi>Spaniard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In this Voyage, ſome ſmall and open Towns were burned by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as alſo a Carack coming from the <hi>Indies,</hi> was fired by her own men, to prevent the falling thereof into the Enemies hands.

They related alſo, the dangerous ſedition of the Marriners, notwithſtanding all theſe dangers: together, with the perſidious natures of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> whom the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> brought up every where, but eſpecially in <hi>Java,</hi> that under the pretence of peace, they might the better hide their murthers and depredations. From hence proceeded as well fighting as delayes: Not were the <hi>Hollanders</hi> free from fault, for they that were ſent thither by their Kinsfolks or Friends, being ſuch as were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from their own Country, either by debt, or their own wickedneſs, yielded to the <hi>Barbarians</hi> nothing but an evill pattern to follow. Nay, ſo great was the ſtupidity of ſome of them, that among all the people at noon-day, they ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the depth of the Haven at <hi>Bantam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Java</hi> is an Iſland almoſt as big as <hi>England,</hi> and not as ſome believe, a part of the <hi>South</hi> Continent, as appeared by the Circuit. It hath many Kings, a part of them according to the Cuſtom of their Fathers, worſhip falſe Gods, the other part
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:55798:256"/>
not long ſince have received the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doctrine. They ſaw alſo <hi>Sumatra,</hi> the greater <hi>Java,</hi> and a little Iſland called <hi>Balis:</hi> and in their return another, which is called by the name of <hi>Helena,</hi> fruitful in the product of many things, but not inhabited by any men:</p>
               <p>From hence the <hi>Hollanders</hi> then firſt began to fetch Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and other Fruits, the uſual growth of thoſe warmer Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, which kind of Trade had of old been very gainful to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> by <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tranſportations; but for the ſpace of an hundred years, ſolely uſurped by the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who diſcovered that Ocean, and claimed the ſame as their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their long Navigations, and the gift of the <hi>Pope.</hi> The firſt Voyage after many difficulties, being free from da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, yet for the future, gave hope of better advantage, and invited many others out of <hi>Holland, Zeland,</hi> and exiles of <hi>Brabant,</hi> to attempt the ſame with a greater number of Ships.</p>
               <p>From the beginning of the Spring for many moneths, had the Siege of <hi>Amiens</hi> been delayed, while the King, though with a ſtrong Army of fourteen thouſand men, yet ſparing of his own Souldiers blood, and not greedy of his Enemies, onely fortified his Camp againſt all force, as well inward as outward. And firſt he endeavoured to raiſe a Confederacy among the Citizens, and when that was diſcovered, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to fill up the Trenches, undermine the Rampire, and to do other things, which though they coſt little blood, yet they took up great expence of time, eſpecially the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers being unexperienced in ſuch works, and the Beſieged wanting neither Valor or Policy to withſtand the ſame, and to protract the Siege in hope of getting Relief, and having turned out of the Town, above ſix thouſand Citizens, whom they ſuſpected. Beſides, while the Enemy was gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether his force, a Body of Horſe entred the Town, thereby both ſtrengthning and augmenting the Garriſon. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were infeſted with the Plague, yet they made
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:55798:257"/>
frequent Sallies in defence of their Walls, with various For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; in ſeveral of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>, divers eminent <hi>men</hi> on both ſides were ſlain, among whom was <hi>Portocarrera,</hi> the main Author of all their Stratagems: Yet the Townſmen, by cutting their Bark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> turned the River upon the Enemy. And after many Repulſes, cauſed by neglect of ſuch as were ſent to enter the City, the Arch-Duke in <hi>Autumn,</hi> with his new and old Forces, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to antient Cuſtom, having raiſed the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Nobility, which were modelled into Horſe and Foot, came thither with more Fame than Hope. At the firſt ſight, he perceived, that it was not poſſible, either to force the King's Works, nor to draw the coming Enemy, though more than ordinarily cautious, to the hazard of a Battel: Onely ſome few looſe Bands encountred. But now <hi>Picardy</hi> being waſted by War, was firſt afflicted with ſcarcity of Victuals and ſoon after with Sickneſs. Theſe Things forced the Arch-Duke to depart, overcome almoſt with Sorrow, for loſs of the City, which (a Truce of eight days, according to Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elapſed, which was, that if in that they were not relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with above a Thouſand men) was deliver'd up to King <hi>Henry;</hi> &amp; <hi>Albertus,</hi> that the King might the leſs perſiſt in his Succeſſes, by ſcarcity of Victuals, and fear of the Winter, left the Siege of <hi>Dorlens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after that, <hi>Albertus</hi> ſent part of his Souldiers to block up all the Avenues of <hi>Ostend</hi> with Forts, at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Flandrians;</hi> for as yet having ſent Spies to ſeated the ſtrength of all Fortifications about the place, as well to the Seaward, as Land, and conſcious to himſelf of his own weakneſs, he durſt not attempt the Siege of it. In the mean while, Devaſtations being hindred, Sir <hi>Edward Noris</hi> being made Governour there, raged ſcot-free all over the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, being grown more terrible to the Enemy, becauſe he had lately taken <hi>Alvares Agilarius,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> priſoner, with ſome other booty. Here I have a mind to draw all Affairs into one Series, until the end of the Year,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:55798:257"/>
that I may not place what was done during that time by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> or continued by them apart.</p>
               <p>They were quiet the greateſt part of the Summer, while <hi>France</hi> detained their Money, and <hi>England</hi> their Souldiers, either expecting other buſineſs, or hoping ſome Sedition among the Enemies. But now <hi>Albertus</hi> his Forces being all recalled from <hi>Amions,</hi> there was a neceſſity for ſome action, but not reſolved whither to carry the War, their Affections wavering towards divers places, until at length it was left to the Judgment of the Prince, Count <hi>William,</hi> and the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;</hi> who thought it convenient, to drive the Enemy out of the Garriſons in <hi>Overiſſel,</hi> whereof the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remained, but they which were, were governed and kept by <hi>Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Heremberg,</hi> that ſo the War being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved within the <hi>Rhine,</hi> all that part of the Country that lyes beyond, might be exempted from payment of Contribution to the Enemy; and that they might compaſs this with the more ſafety (for they had not equal Forces at Home to cope with the Enemy; and, it might be doubted, leaſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> might alter his Counſel, and come back) they thought fit to put off the Journey to ſome following time, with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands where the <hi>Rhine</hi> might be paſſed: The ſame thing alſo proved famouſly advantagious, for the ſafety of the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and that there might be a ſafe Paſſage into <hi>Germany</hi> opened, which was now ſhut up by the Enemy, to the great damage of Trade, while it is prohibited to carry through Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers what was taken at Sea, and to carry back other things in lieu thereof.</p>
               <p>At this time <hi>Henry Frederick</hi> entring into the 14th Year of his Age, having till thoſe years ſpent his time at <hi>Leyden,</hi> in the ſtudy of the Liberal Sciences, was firſt taken to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Rudiments of War: With which Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and many others of the ſame Houſe, the Prince, and the reſt of the Commanders, having privately held a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:55798:258"/>
go towards <hi>Gravewaert,</hi> ſo that the Enemy might not be aware, to what place chiefly they intended. He had Seven Thouſand Foot, and Twelve Hundred Horſe, who paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> in little Boats, and the <hi>Wael</hi> by a Bridge of Ships faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, carrying along with them their Waggons and Baggage. But the Ships, by force of the Wind, were carryed up the Rivers, wherein were contained forty great Guns fit for Battery, and the reſt of the Proviſions proportionable. The Army marched along the Banks, which of old was called the <hi>Gallick,</hi> or rather the <hi>Romane Cawſey,</hi> and in their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, upon ſight of the Army and Artillery, Fort <hi>Alba,</hi> a Hold of unreaſonable ſtrength, was without delay ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and the ſame Evening, ſome Horſe were ſent out to encompaſs <hi>Berck.</hi> There are ſome who would have this Town to be the <hi>Tiberiacum</hi> of the <hi>Antients,</hi> and that there yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſome glimmering of the ſame in the word <hi>Berck,</hi> as it is now contracted. It is a ſmall Town, but rich in Cuſtoms; for lying upon that Bank of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which as we ſaid, is beyond <hi>Xantem,</hi> which is alſo known by the Name of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracaſtra,</hi> being a place famous in former Ages, for the Siege of the <hi>Legions,</hi> and the War of <hi>Holland:</hi> A little upon the one hand appeareth <hi>Weſel,</hi> near the back of <hi>Gelderland;</hi> but both ſides of it are incloſed by the Regions of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Juilliers.</hi> It is within the Juriſdiction of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Colen;</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> under pretence of the <hi>Truxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> War before-mentioned, after much conteſt, ſeized and poſſeſſed it; for ſafety whereof, beſides the ſweetneſs of the place, and the Antiquity of the Fortifications, there was kept in it a Garriſon of no leſs than a Thouſand Men, part <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders,</hi> part <hi>Germans:</hi> In the upper part of the River, there is an Iſland three miles in compaſs, adjoyning to the Town, and ſeparated onely by a River. Hither the Prince ſent a ſufficient number of men to guard it, and made a Bridge over the Channel, that there might be a ſecure Way
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:55798:258"/>
for Paſtures, and other Proviſions. Afterwards he pitched his Camp chiefly in two places, although at that time the Weather was very raging; and that no place might be left open, a Line, with a Trench, was commanded to be drawn on both ſides the River all along. Thus the Town was ſhut up, many ſhips ſtopping the paſſages of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> And all Forts, whether in Ways, or upon meaner Rivers, were ſtrengthned and maintained by the Guard of the Beleaguer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by turns; which afterwards being laid aſide, there was another great Work raiſed againſt the Town, for the ſecuring Paſſages from place to place; nor had the Beſieged either Valour or Confidence enough to diſturb their Enemies Work by S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>llies, they onely vindicating themſelves by ſhot at a diſtance, having the greateſt plenty of Ammunition, though indeed they wanted nothing elſe; for there were found in the City almoſt fourſcore great Guns, with theſe they had furniſhed the Fortifications, to reſiſt any thing that might oppoſe the Town. The chief Defence againſt all ſuch Damages was a Tower, which raiſed its height ſomewhat above the Palace, and ſo infeſted all the places near the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; from hence aroſe Pity, Fear, and Wrath, to many falling in the Camp; for <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> was ſhot in the Thigh, and the Prince himſelf was not free from danger, for by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident his Tent was overthrown; yet the Beſiegers began to ſet in order their Canon againſt the Town, whereby the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned Tower was ſo weakned, that none durſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main or ſtay therein: Hitherto all that was done, was by ſnatches and intervals, as it were at a breathing. Afterwards the Trench was filled up, and although the Weathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="508" facs="tcp:55798:259"/>
manifeſt to them, that thoſe Threats were not in vain, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they beheld and felt the Fore-runners of a Storm; yet could not all their Prayers at the preſent, prevail to obtain a Truce, the Battery continuing all that day, with the expenſe of Two Thouſand ſhot.</p>
               <p>In this interim alſo, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> had aſſaulted and taken an Half-Moon Sconce that lay upon the River, the Defendants being beaten out thereof by violence of ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now alſo was the Courage of the Beſieged utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by a ſharp Summons, whereby they were adviſed to prevent Extremity; and that if they ſhould yet continue in their Obſtinacy, they ſhould be exempted from Mercy. Thus on the Tenth day was <hi>Berck</hi> deliver'd, the whole Garriſon marching forth with all that belonged to them. All the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Stores of the Enemy, together with the Artillery and Ships, were (according to Cuſtom) deliver'd to the <hi>Conqueror.</hi> Some there are, who lay the fault of this Surrender, upon a too ſuddain fear, eſpecially for that <hi>Herman</hi> Count <hi>Herem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> Governour of <hi>Gelderland,</hi> came to the Garriſon, either becauſe the Commander in Chief there was blame-worthy, being an immoderate Boaſter, and before the appearance of danger beyond meaſure inſolent; or elſe that the Souldiers were equally criminal, whom preſently after their going out of <hi>Gelderland,</hi> many reprehended as growing Seditious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Town: This thing done, <hi>Legates</hi> were ſent from the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Colen,</hi> and the Colledge of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to the Prince, with Command to go from him to the <hi>States,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the re-delivery of that being a Free Town, and not obnoxious to their War.

               <p>With theſe Words the <hi>Legates</hi> were diſmiſſed; nor did the <hi>States</hi> as yet fortifie this Town of <hi>Berck</hi> as their own, for they onely repaired the Breaches made by the Batteries and Aſſaults, and placed therein for Defence of the place a Regiment of Foot, with a few Horſe; and that no part might lye open to the Enemy, they levelled <hi>Mutelen</hi> to the ground, becauſe it ſeemed too far off, to fortifie and defend the ſame ſufficiently. <hi>Camillus Sachino,</hi> who was in Command under the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> had raiſed that Caſtle upon the Bank of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in an excellent ſcituation, and as was believed, in the very place of old <hi>Duysburg:</hi> the original of which Town the old <hi>Germans</hi> refer to the fabulous Wandrings of <hi>Ulyſses.</hi> And being the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Countrey-man, gave the Name to this place, as promiſing to himſelf wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But the following Age participated of leſs Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the uſe of more Policy; nor, as before, were the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of War run upon at adventure, to the deciſion of a Quarrel at a Fight, but by fortifying againſt intervening Dangers; and, on the contrary, when a viſible ſtrength is found either near or far off, to lay open all fenced places, dry up all Fenny and Mooriſh Parts, to fill up Valleys, and level Hills: Which if any one would ſift out and Value, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Experience of the Times and the War, no Land before our own could ſhew the like Patterns, where a man might find Cities either more ſtrong, or more frequent.

                  <pb facs="tcp:55798:261"/>For at this very time the chief Dukes, Counts, and Great Commanders, as well out of <hi>Germany, France, Britain,</hi> as from other more remote Parts, follow'd the Prince in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the War in <hi>Over-Iſſel.</hi> Himſelf went beyond the River <hi>Lippe</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> but the Ships were conveyed through the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and ſo into the <hi>Iſſel,</hi> till they arrived at <hi>Doesburg.</hi> A little further inward lies <hi>Grolle,</hi> within the Juriſdiction of <hi>Zutphen,</hi> which having been beſieged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly about two years ago, though in vain, did ſeem to be a Reproach to the Prince, unleſs it were taken. The Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Town were not ordinary, boaſting the Care of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth for their ſtrength and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. There were five great Bulwarks ſtanding out from the Rampire, with ſuch Flankers, as commanded on every ſide any that ſhould venter to aſſault it: The compaſs of the City is but ſmall, and under the Government of <hi>John</hi> Count <hi>Strumbo,</hi> with a Gariſon of eight hundred Foor, and three Troops of Horſe; nor had he omitted, when he heard of the Prince's Approach towards him, to amend and make thicker his Works: But the Prince nothing affrighted therewith, but eſteeming it very advantageous, that the Enemies Horſe ſhould be ſhut up, which otherwiſe might poſſeſs and infeſt the Ways, ſtraight with more than ordinary diligence, to prevent any ſuddain Sallies, by one continued Trench with interpoſed Forts, in one Night he quite incloſed two parts of the City, Eight hundred Souldiers were deſigned to the Work, and were guarded by Two Thouſand others in Arms. The next Night he encompaſſed with like Expedition the two remaining parts; in the day time the Works were made more ſtrong and compleat; from thence towards the Towns, the way was broken by many Turnings and Windings, which while they were made, and ſoon after, the Water brought thither, which before had been contained in the Town Trenches, they were quickly fill'd up with Earth. The
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:55798:262"/>
Beſieged were very obſtinate, in their denying to ſurrender, by all means endeavouring to revenge themſelves with their Guns, and by their frequent Sallies, until Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his Gunners ſhot fire into the Town; which taking, and expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating it ſelf to the burning of above Threeſcore Houſes, made them turn all their Care from the hindring of the Prince's Works, to the preſervation of themſelves, and what belonged to them: Nor yet did faint, although they were afflicted with Fire and Wounds within, and with the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fear of unknown Miſeries from abroad, having in two places begun ſome inward or ſecond Works, for their better Defence, in caſe the old Works before them ſhould be beaten down and become uſeleſs. But afterwards, when the Prince had wrought ſeven Galleries, unto the very Rampire of the Town, which he commanded to be undermined and blown up; and likewiſe that Four and Twenty Pieces of Canon ſhould be drawn down for Battery, that ſo the Town might on all ſides be laid open by Breaches: The Gariſon recant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Obſtinacy, and craved Pardon, which was granted to them. This was the 17th Day of the Siege; ſome were appointed, to conduct the Enemy marching off with his Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Colours, and Waggons, and Ships to carry away ſuch as were ſick; but upon all was laid this Reſtriction, <hi>That within three Months they ſhould not bear Arms about the River</hi> Maes.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="515" facs="tcp:55798:262"/>Nor were other Things provided with leſs Care; The Wall being of very antient Work, was ſurrounded with a very deep Trench, which was the Work of <hi>Martino Roſſem,</hi> when he made Wars in thoſe Parts Fourty Years before: Three hundred Souldiers were ſufficient to maintain the ſmall Circumference of the Works about this ſmall Town. But it was reported, that both theſe, and the Townſmen, were in Conteſt, and had a difference with the <hi>Governour,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Gardoto,</hi> by which means greater ſtrength was added to their fear of our extrinſick Terrour.

               <p>But Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> perſiſting, the Souldiers were much troubled with the appearance of ſo great Labour, and the vaſtneſs of the Mariſhes more offended, than their daily Conflicts with the Enemy; eſpecially, becauſe they were ignorant, what Sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when the Prince had with great Diligence uſed all the Arts formerly tryed at <hi>Gertruydenberg,</hi> and <hi>Coeverden,</hi> all theſe Difficulties were by Experience mollified; And himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came hoth an Adviſor and Director of the Work, ſending put of the Forces under Count <hi>Solmes,</hi> and Col. <hi>Brederode,</hi> into thoſe places that anſwer'd to the Gates; that which lay in the middle towards the <hi>North,</hi> being the moſt difficult, he reſerved to himſelf.</p>

Thus, upon this made Ground, Hurdles being ſet upright, with Earth between them, at ſmall diſtance, ſerved both for Blinds and Defence, by this means a Breaſtwork was brought even to the Hill hard by the Town, but much helped by the ſingular induſtry of the Sea-men, whoſe continual being in danger makes them fearleſs: There was erected a Platform for Twenty Canon, and ſo much pains was taken in eight days, that they were gotten to the very Trench of the Town: But there was no Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient found to drain the Water from thence, for that the daily Rains, and the lower Springs in all that open Country, ſtill more and more ſupplied and filled it. This, together with the Promiſe of Count <hi>Frederick Hereinberg,</hi> to ſend Three Hundred Souldiers to their Relief, through the Shallows, ſo heigntned the Confidence of the Beſieged, that they yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſurrender: Whereupon now the whole Camp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Storm, nor were the Captains backward, eſpecially the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who having loſt many of their men, were inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Prince and incouraged, that at length after their Toilſom Labour in digging, they ſhould be rewarded with the bloud and ſpoil of their Enemies: Proteſting, ſince the Enemy had had ſo many Examples of his Clemency, which he had refuſed, that now he ſhould feel the ſeverity of their Revenge.

               <p>Wherefore the Prince beginning his Batteries, had beaten down with his Artillery the Towers and Steeples, at alſo the Tops of the Bulwarks and Fortifications; among which, the Rampire without the Gate, having been long batter'd, at laſt was taken; And the Beſieged defended the Ruines of their Lines and Works with their Bodies and ſtrength, throwing down upon the Prince's men, as well great Bullets as Stones: The Trench alone kept off the Aſſault till this time; but now a Bridge of Cork prepared not far off, was ſoon brought thither: And this being a Work full of danger, was undertaken by the Sea-men; for they, not waiting for the Word of Command, began to undermine the Rampire, not ſo much as minding their own Weapons, which they had carryed thither with them. At the ſight of the Bridge, as ſome ſtupendious Wonder, the whole People of the Town were affrighted, ſo that they could neither agree in Labour or Deſign for a ſpace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But at laſt, leaving off all other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all flocked to that part: But when they ſaw their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies advancing with certain ſteps, and in a plain and even way, and others to ſtand behind with gliſtring Enſigns, fierce Looks, and threatning Weapons, and that the noiſe and whiſtling of Bullets had now taken away all the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Opportunities of Speaking or Hearing, they ſhewed up and down their Heads, and the Coverings thereof, which were a ſure token that they ſought for Peace: Whereto, when Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s men gave no other Anſwer than Wounds, then flying back into the Caſtle yet intire, they left to the Rage and Fury of the Purſuers, a miſerable Company of Women and Children, who falling upon their Knees with elevated Hands, although to an angry Victor, yet either their Sex or Age procured Mercy. About Seventy were killed in

               <p>Soon after this, the Army marched in a Rainy, Seaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through a dirty Country, into <hi>Over-Iſsel,</hi> now filled with Warre, the Terrour whereof had already gained many Towns, though indeed there were few there comparable with the former; for <hi>Gouen</hi> was deſerted of it ſelf, and the Garriſon of <hi>Euſchede,</hi> part of them were met and ſlain in the March; and they that remained, affrighted to ſee and hear ſo much, removed away their Guns, and that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them. From hence the Army was divided to go part of it to <hi>Otmarſen,</hi> and part to <hi>Oldenzeel:</hi> It is ſuppoſed, that both theſe Towns drew their Original from the <hi>Marſi,</hi> and the <hi>Salii</hi> (ſometimes noble Nations of <hi>Germany</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet appears ſome Glimmerings in their Names. And now is <hi>Otmarſen,</hi> which we related five years ago to be loſt and taken from Us, re-taken by Us in an inſtant: For the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers made no delay, but demanded it of the Enemy, batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Walls with their great Guns, to make them believe the neceſſity of their Surrender the greater. <hi>Oldenzeele</hi> held out three days, for there were three Rampires and Trenches round about the Town, and ſix Companies fill'd up the Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and the reſt of the Works; though the number of the Town Souldiers did not anſwer the Report made of them, yet were they ſuch, as having been old Souldiers, might well ſupply the place of a greater number. Theſe, to ingratiate themſelves with the Townſmen, urged a ſpeedy Surrender of the Town, leaſt the houſes, by any pretence of delay; ſhould be batter'd down or ſpoil'd.</p>
               <p>Thus did theſe two Town; fall into the Prince's hand at once; and, by <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Deputies</hi> of <hi>Over-Iſſel,</hi> the Works were thrown down and diſmantled, becauſe they did not think them worthy of Repair, and were afraid, leſt if they

                  <hi>For if three Nations, which are at this day powerful at Sea, if the</hi> Hollanders <hi>be joyned to the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>it is much to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that</hi> England <hi>afterward will have a hard Task to cope with them, eſpecially ſince the Sea and their Navies are the main, if not ſole Defences of the Kingdom: Beſides, none will be then equal to match</hi> Philip <hi>in Wealth, if his Revenues out of the new World, and the</hi> Indies, <hi>ſince the Conqueſt of</hi> Portugal, <hi>till this time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted with War, be once brought to a certain and ſafe Return.

               <p>The Conſultations upon this Matter, in the Queen's Court, were various, and both Opinions had ſtrong Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters; to know whoſe Behaviour and Affections, will not be from the purpoſe, that it may appear how the Perſwaders Authority bore ſway in the Publike Counſels.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Eſsex,</hi> as we have elſewhere declared, being a young man, and burning with the deſire of Glory, was a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Giver, beyond the Ability of his Eſtate, wholly ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in compaſſing the Love of the Nobles, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and Souldiers, having no hopes in Peace but putting great Confidence in the Friendſhip of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and therefore, he, being General of all Forces in <hi>England,</hi> was for the War with <hi>Spain;</hi> affirming, That it could not be put off, unleſs at once, both the Queen's Security, Credit, and Charges, ſhould all be hazarded.

Counſels, what was the moſt pious and honeſt to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd; He ſaid, [That a preſent Commodity ought to be preferr'd before the Incertainties of Suſpition, and that Peace would not be more profitable to the Enemy, than to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and is the ſtrength of out Countrey ſo little known, that it cannot be ſafe, but at the pleaſure of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> when, in the mean time, the <hi>French</hi> out of common fear, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> themſelves out of their Care of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are tyed with ſtronger Bonds againſt Danger by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; than by a League?

               <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> either really wavering in her Mind, or elſe willing to expreſs all other Things by her fear of Peace, made Anſwer in a very temperate manner. [That from the beginning ſhe had done nothing without the Advice of her Allies; that it was acceptable to her, that they had declared their Minds ſo freely, yet there were many and great cauſes, both for her Self, and the <hi>French,</hi> that moved them to deſire an end of the War, and to make her truſt to Peace, by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or disbanding her Armies; for ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> old hopes have been croſſed, by the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> abjuring him, the loſs of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo many other ſlaughters and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, if he ſhould think fit to re-aſſume his Arms, the ſame God that had helped them before, would, ſhe doubted not, aſſiſt them again, to maintain their Right by the Sword; but if they thought fit to continue in Arms, things more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ought to be offer'd.] This thing the Peers of <hi>England</hi> interpreted thus: That there was no Fault more heinous, than to defraud the Queen of her Rights and Duties, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Cavillings, otherwhiles by deceitful Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Pretences of Poverty, which the Wealth of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Holland,</hi> and their well-ſtocked Treaſury, openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="553" facs="tcp:55798:281"/>Nor was it more to be endured, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould loſe the Trade of <hi>Spain</hi> for them, and yet they preferr'd their own Gain, before the famiſhing of their Enemies, and ſo make Merchandize of the War.</p>
               <p>At laſt, this Delay was put to the Pacification, that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors from both ſhould go to take notice of the <hi>French</hi> Affairs: And, to that purpoſe, by the Queen were ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the before-mentioned <hi>Cecil</hi> and <hi>Wilks,</hi> with whom the hopes of Peace was grown dead, by being at the Treaty at St. <hi>Quintins;</hi> for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> preferred, by the Name of Allies, thoſe whom the <hi>French</hi> Peace would advantage, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out at laſt, that they onely ſhould be included in the Treaty, who obſerved the <hi>Romane Rites</hi> in point of Religion: The Embaſſadors from <hi>Holland</hi> came a little later, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of contrary Winds. The King, at this time, was at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geires,</hi> buſie in pacifying <hi>Bretayn,</hi> which is otherwiſe called <hi>Armorica;</hi> which, as yet, Duke <hi>Mercury,</hi> one of the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> Princes, (the Fury of both Parties being aſſwaged) forcibly detained, having deliver'd to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the Port of <hi>Blavette,</hi> that they might with more eaſe land with Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. But he ſeeing the King's Army prepar'd on the one hand, and a Pardon offer'd in the other, and knowing well that when an end is put to a War, all ſubſequent Offences are with ſeverity puniſh'd, obtains for himſelf, and his noble Conditions, and an Augmentation of Honour.</p>
               <p>The King, at this time, was happily without a Wife, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> being divorced from him; but though his Body was exerciſed in Military Matters, yet his Mind was liable to the Darts of Love, for he was abſolutely taken with one <hi>Gabrielis Estraea,</hi> a Noble Woman, but led aſide from the Embraces of her vowed Husband: This Woman, what with her Beauty, and what with her ſweet Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and alluring Arts, had ſo vanquiſh'd the King, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing her to the Title of a Dutcheſs, which was then a
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:55798:282"/>
Novelty in <hi>France,</hi> ſo heightned her Pride, that though but a Concubine, ſhe aſpired beyond the Greatneſs and Authority of a Wife: And ſhe alſo was numbred among the Cauſes, that induced the King's Mind to be inclinable to Peace, that he might the more ſecurely enjoy his pleaſures with her. She had a Son by the King that was four years old, and at that time called <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whom the King, with great Obteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, gave in Charge to <hi>Mercury,</hi> (this Woman had alſo by the King a Daughter very young) and appoints to the ſaid <hi>Mercury</hi> a great Allowance of Money, and beſtowing upon his Son the Dukedom of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> and the Government of <hi>Bretaign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the Embaſſadors of <hi>Holland</hi> juſt arrive, and find the King puffed up with theſe Matters, together with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pacification; and yet, if by chance that had failed he had called a Council of the <hi>Brittons,</hi> to conſult about the Siege of <hi>Blavette.</hi>

And, among the choice of the King's Council, it was
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:55798:282"/>
debated, how much more ſafe and honourable would it be, to make an Example to Poſterity of this Enemy, whoſe Treaſury was drained, and Mind perplexed, with the waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obedience of his Subjects; witneſſed, by his ſeeking for Peace, as well his fear, as the inconveniences he ſuffer'd out of this League of ours to deter, for the future, any from thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting after the Dominions that are belonging to another.] There were preſent at this time the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who now more freely commemorating the many Benefits they had done him, and how unworthy an Act it was to lay aſide his ſworn Faith for preſent Utility, helped forward the Speech made by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſometimes by their Silence, and ſometimes by applauding Speeches, not forbearing to demand the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which had been lent to him. The King, on the other ſide, dealt plainly, confeſſing his Neceſſities to be ſuch, as would not bear ſlow Remedy: And that he doubted, for all this Noiſe of Peace, whether the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would deliver up to him, either <hi>Calais</hi> or <hi>Blavette;</hi> which if he did not, he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them he would continue the War; giving them Thanks, that they had ſo freely offer'd their Aſſiſtance. The States Embaſſadors replyed, That if the King reſted in that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yet they hoped their coming and Offers would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to <hi>France,</hi> and cauſe the Enemy to make larger Conceſſions, than perhaps otherwiſe he would: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they pray'd, on behalf of their Maſters, that if a Peace were concluded, yet the Alliance might continue between them; by which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> might m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="556" facs="tcp:55798:283"/>
future Times, when the King, no leſs intent to keep, than to get Money, gave ſo much ſcope to the defence of Liberty, as the Kings of old would hardly have afforded to any People, unleſs with a Deſign to intrench upon it. The firſt Liberality given to him was two hundred and forty thouſand Florens, which after, in the Years following, was increaſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as his Neceſſities required: For now remembring the Monies he had received from his Allies, and at what time, he reſolved how he might repay the ſame, that it might not ſeem altogether as the payment of a Debt; but as if it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed along with it the grateful ſhew of a Remuneration: Here the King carefully excuſing his own, highly applauded the Counſel of the States, that they would ſtand upon their Defence, ſince (which few Kings could boaſt of) they could, upon occaſion, be on a ſuddain in a readineſs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any new Neceſſity would forthwith put the idle Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude into Arms.</p>
               <p>For maintaining this Friendſhip with the King, becauſe <hi>Levinus Calward</hi> dyed there in performing the ſame, <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Arſen</hi> was left in <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Father <hi>Cornelius</hi> wrote the Chronology of the States.</p>
               <p>And now it appear'd, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had by many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments perſwaded the <hi>French</hi> to lay down Arms, being contented, rather to have the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtill their Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than to make a Peace with them upon equal Terms: And this was the cauſe, why the <hi>Holland</hi> Embaſſadors in <hi>France, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stire Naſſau,</hi> and <hi>Olden Barnevelt,</hi> went thence into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> neglecting thereby a while their former Embaſſie, and aſſuming a boldneſs, till that time dreaded; where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd themſelves in Terms, to this effect, That if the Queen would follow the <hi>French,</hi> there ſhould be no hazards of Peace ſo great to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that they would not rather hazard, than ſingly to undergo the unſupportable Burden of the War.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="557" facs="tcp:55798:283"/>And theſe Diſſemblers thus uſed their Art, as believing that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would yet diſturb the Pacification, if they ſuppoſed the <hi>Hollanders</hi> could be drawn to it: But they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the Queen all manner of Aſſiſtance, if ſhe would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to continue the War; and the hope of perfecting the ſame with Expedition, though ſhe had hitherto for a time ſurceaſed, as being moved rather to incline to Peace.</p>

But for the Oblivion of Injuries, and continuance of mutual Concord for the future, that if War were made upon either of them, the other ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help againſt him himſelf, nor ſuffer any belonging to him to intereſt themſelves; and if any thing of doubt aroſe between them, that it ſhould be argued, neither by Violence

               <p>All Things, on both ſides, being thus done, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Peace, which yet was repined at by ſome, whoſe Valour and Hopes was nouriſhed by other Mens Evils; but all the Commons rejoyced at it, not ſo much for that, hereby much Chriſtian Blood would be ſaved, as for that the Law was reſtored to its power, by which they ſhould with ſecurity enjoy their Poſſeſſions, reap the Rents and profits of their Lands, and the Ways be all open for free Trading. Then was the firſt day, that <hi>France</hi> could boaſt of a ſolid Peace, after it had been for 36 Years waſted with War, and bathed in her own Blood, then was reſtored to this moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Kingdom its priſtine Face of Beauty; and all by the King's Care, that the <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Order, himſelf growing powerful, by the Excuſe of the <hi>Catholikes,</hi> in regard of the Times, that he might by Fear or Force compel the Profeſſors of another Religion; when, in the interim, the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> were left in Arms, that they might not onely loſe the Hopes of Peace, but any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val or ſolace from their Neighbour's ſufferings: Yet the King ſent back Mounſieur <hi>Buzanvale</hi> to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> by which Witneſs of his Friendship, and ſecret Converſe, he

might confirm his Peace, even while there continued by publike Declaration a Forein War.

And certainly, it would be a ſufficient Cauſe for all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to envy and hate them, that they have been, and are, the onely Obſtructers of the Peace of</hi> Europe: <hi>But God, ſhe hoped, would not ſuffer, that being deluded by ingrateful Determinations, ſhe ſhould be a Pattern to Princes, to abſtain from helping ſuch a People, who bear no Reverence to their Superiours, nor take care for Advantage, Reputation, or Safety, of any but themſelves.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>States</hi> now thought themſelves, at one blow, almoſt overwhelmed, both for their former and future Charge: yet, that, the Name of an Alliance with <hi>England,</hi> was of ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to them, that they would ſubmit to ſuch Conditions, as the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> being their Superiour in ſtrength, would lay upon them: Wherefore, ſending them who had been employ'd in both the former Embaſſies, together with <hi>Andrew Aſcel,</hi> who had private Inſtructions, which gave him power of Treating, concerning the Monies due to her, and concluding about the ſame, even to the Sum of a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Florens. At this time, there were divers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions offer'd themſelves to the Queen, who already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended great Fears, whereby ſhe was diſſwaded from War.

               <p>As ſoon as this man was dead, and <hi>Eſsex,</hi> for the avoiding of Envy, declined to come to the Council-Table, the Court ſoon appear'd empty of Care and Counſel, in Defence of its own Right: Whereto the <hi>States</hi> Embaſſadours being often admitted, they excuſed themſelves, by reaſon of the Times, for their not paying of the Queens old Debt due from them; profeſſing, <hi>That as to what related to the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Negotiation, they did not intercede, whereby the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>if they pleaſed, ſhould be hindred more than the</hi> Dutch, <hi>from making uſe of the Name of any People being in Peace, unleſs they believed it more profitable to compaſs what they deſire by Arms, than by Commerce or Trading.

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were in the <hi>States</hi> Service already, or hereafter ſhould be Liſted for their Service, ſhould be raiſed onely in their Name, and ſhould fight under their ſole Command, and at their Charge: And from thenceforth, the ſo much envyed Authority of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadour, was abſolutely taken away: Yet ſtill the Queens Priviledge of nominating an Aſſiſtant to ſit with the <hi>Senate,</hi> was reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: If the Queens Enemies ſhould invade her, either by Land or Sea, or the Queen ſhould think ſit to make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Enemies, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> upon notice, ſhould add to her Fleet 30 or 40 luſty and ſtout Ships; together with an Army of Five Thouſand Foot, and Five Hundred Horſe. Upon theſe Articles and Covenants, a firm Agreement was made; but reſerving to the Queen her Right, that ſhe might vindicate her cauſe againſt the <hi>Netherlander,</hi> under the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Juriſdiction.</p>

               <p>There were divers Speeches concerning this matter, and they diſagreeing among themſelves, as is uſual in ſuch Caſes: Some accuſed this as an Evil Cuſtom, that the Heads of Free-men, or any private Service, ſhould be rated and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued: That it was onely uſed by <hi>Barbarians,</hi> to give and beſtow Dominions: For of what value was a Prince among them, who never knew what belonged to Lordſhip: But to them that make a diſtinction between Right and Wrong, it is nothing ambiguous; becauſe the matter belonging to the People, makes the Government, from thence, be called a <hi>Commonwealth:</hi> The ordering whereof, as it is in ſome places, committed to the Nobles or Senate; ſo, with moſt, it is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led under the Tuition of a Prince.

               <p>In the ſame manner did the Prince of <hi>Aurange, Areſchet,</hi> and <hi>Haurech,</hi> write to Prince <hi>Maurice, That he would, by his Authority, prevail as much as he could with the</hi> United States, <hi>to ſet an end (ſo much deſired) to the War; That it would be not onely to his Renown at the preſent, but to the everlaſting Honour, and advancement of the Houſe of</hi> Naſſau <hi>for the future.</hi> At this time was heard alſo one <hi>Daniel Molain,</hi> a private Merchant, but of great Repute; who, reported himſelf incited thereto by his Brothers diſſembled ſickneſs, and came to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and from thence was brought to <hi>Bruxels,</hi> to the ſpeech of <hi>Richardot, Aſſonville,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Marol, Haurech,</hi> and at laſt of <hi>Albertus</hi> himſelf: The ſum of all his Diſcourſe was tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Peace, ſo alſo were all their Counſels; and there was nothing omitted, that might obtain Credit among the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi>

All the Princes proteſting, <hi>That their Religion ſhould not be medled with; that the Government of the Commonwealth ſhould remain in the hands of themſelves, and their Poſterity; and that King</hi> Philip <hi>had ſuch eſteem of Prince</hi> Maurice <hi>his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that he would detract nothing from his Honour, but deſtin'd for him the chief Command of the</hi> Hungarian <hi>Warre.</hi> But the <hi>States,</hi> although before they were reſolved for War, yet grew more indurate and averſe to Peace, by reaſon of ſome <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi>'s by them intercepted; wherein the manifeſt contrary to all theſe former Offers was diſcover'd. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, the Treaſon of <hi>Peter Danny</hi> of <hi>Ipre</hi> was found out at the ſame time: He was a man of a ſlothful Nature; but ſuch are generally the moſt ready Inſtruments to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the moſt impious Attempts.

               <p>In all this hurli-burly, the Deputies of the Magiſtrates, brought no other Comfort from <hi>Albertus,</hi> beſides Excuſes of the publike Poverty; ſo that for want of Remedy, this Mutinous Licentiouſneſs continued until the Year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the Souldiers, in the Caſtle of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> were a little more modeſt; for being content with their own Number, they would not receive any that came from other places, which, in this time of common Diſturbance, ſeem'd a great part of Honeſty.

               <p>Now upon Debate of the Matter in the <hi>Senate,</hi> and with the moſt skilful, and underſtanding Collonels, it was though fit, that the Army ſhould march beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> either for the invading of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> or elſe, that they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do what Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had done; who, in the former years, in the ſetling of <hi>Frizeland,</hi> had finiſh'd one part of the War for the <hi>United States;</hi> where the Country being large and open, on the backſide towards <hi>Germany,</hi> and but meanly it engthned with Towns, he ſhew'd-many notable Examples of good Conduct and Induſtry, in laying hold upon all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Opportunities.</p>

But as the Arch-Duke was proceeding in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Prague</hi> that he might communicate ſome of his ſecret Counſels with his Brother the Emperour; and, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, upon the hopes of attaining the Name and Honour of King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which is next of all to the Emperour, he was overtaken by <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> who brought him the News of King Philip's death. The Relation whereof, as it hapned, was thus.</p>
               <p>His weak and crazy Body was broken with old Age, but chiefly from the laſt fore-going Spring, with ſharp pains of the Joynts, but in the Summer his ſickneſs began to inceaſe: To whom, that he might have ſome eaſe, by the Relaxation of his Mind, he commanded his Servant to tarry him in his Horſe-Litter to the <hi>Eſeurial,</hi> a Palace which he had ſumpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly builded with extraordinary Coſt; while, in the imeirm the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Affairs languiſh'd, and lay gaſping for want of Money: This Palace is reckon'd among the moſt famous Inſtruments of this Age. Then being unable to endure the toſſing of the <hi>Litter,</hi> and the thickneſs of the Air, as ſoon as he was repoſed, he fell into a Feaver, his Sinews being more contracted than ordinary, and at the ſame time the Poyſon that lay hid in his Bowels broke cut; in which, and in his Legs, being inflamed through pain, he was likewiſe afflicted with a ſtopping in his Breaſt. Theſe Things being removed by Phyſical Adminiſtrations, he fell into a <hi>Frenzy</hi> and, at the ſame time, ſad to tell, he was follow'd with an infinite quantity of Lice; ſo that by the labour of many hands about him, he could hardly be kept clean from the ſilth that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from them: Apon after, when his weak Body was not able to indure any longer ſuch handling, as was neceſſary to make him clean, his Bowels were eaten up with a filthy Contagion; but with ſuch an invincible Courage bore the
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:55798:293"/>
Torments, that they perceived he was yet alive, but retired himſelf to Meditations of his End: So commanding the Crown to be laid cloſe by him, and afterwards ſhewing his Lims to his Son and Daughter, he inſtructed them in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Frailty; and particularly, read a Lecture of his own Weakneſs, who had been of ſo great Eſteem in the World. Then he commended them to Brotherly Concord among Themſelves, and to the maintainance of the <hi>Romane Faith;</hi> with great ſeriouſneſs adviſing Them, <hi>That when he was dead and buried, they would remember thoſe their Fathers dying words.</hi> Then while Divine Prayers were ſinging, he received the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction; and now drawing on to his Death, he embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſame Crucifix, which his Father before at his Death had alſo done. Then giving in Charge, what he had in his Mind concerning Religion, and commending to them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Examples of Clemency, on the 14. Day of <hi>September</hi> he dyed; which day he had fore-told to be fatal to him, from the Dictates of an <hi>Astronomer.</hi> This was the End of that moſt potent Chriſtian Prince, who was the richeſt in his Time: He was of the Age of 71 Years, and had Reigned 43. He was of a middle ſtature of Body, and well compos'd, onely his Fore-head was ſomewhat high; his Lips were large, and hanging down, after the manner of all who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in Bloud to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> His Countenance carryed the Lineaments of a <hi>Netherlander,</hi> though his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were altogether <hi>Hiſpaniolized;</hi> you would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him to have been of a mild Nature, for that he was, eaſie and affable in acceſs, and did not fall raſhly into paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but as often as he was acquiring, or looking after Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he did rather prefer his Fame, than his Clemency. He was not ſo cunning and ſubtle as his Father, but Age and Diligence ſupplyed that defect; for being very moderate, both in Sleep and Recreations, he did more Perſonally, than by his Servants and Miniſters; which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the higheſt, equalled his Praiſe with <hi>Solomon:</hi> He

ſo well knew the uſe of Money, that he would renounce what <hi>Emperours</hi> or <hi>Popes</hi> he pleas'd almoſt, and with that Key unlock'd the Secrets of all Kingdoms, bearing both <hi>Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Adverſity</hi> with an equal Countenance and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; but being given much to <hi>Diſſimulation,</hi> he indulged to himſelf the Liberty both of <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Jealouſie;</hi> unſatiable in his Hopes, and in his Ambition and deſire of Rule, to be matched with any of the <hi>Antients;</hi> moſt obſervant of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which he ſhew'd even in his outward Actions: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Rules of Government excuſable, as walking by the <hi>Pattern</hi> of <hi>Princes;</hi> and in thoſe Things wherein he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended as a private man, laudably modeſt. He maintain'd Wars continually, even from his Childhood; yet beſides that in <hi>France,</hi> which he onelay ſaw when he was young, he was never perſonally in any, but managed them all by his <hi>Deputies:</hi> He merited variouſly, as to his <hi>Progenitors</hi> and <hi>Succeſſours,</hi> whoſe <hi>Empire,</hi> as he augmented by the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Treaſures,</hi> and the Acceſſion of the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſo he leſſen'd it by the loſs of the Kingdoms of <hi>Goleta</hi> and <hi>Tunis,</hi> and by his Tyranny over the <hi>Dutch:</hi> At Times it was obſerved, that divers Things hapned untowardly in his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Dominions;</hi> but not in the Age of thoſe men, by whom his Fortune was upheld, but when he had Women, Children, or weak Emulators, or Enemies.

One of the principal Leaders, in this Sedition, was <hi>Gruny,</hi> a man famous in his Family, and of great Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, being Kinſman, among others, to Count <hi>William:</hi> He was of Kin, by the Father's ſide, to <hi>John Funquio,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had preſided the <hi>Belgick Affairs</hi> for the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and, not long ſince, under pretence of private Buſineſs, had come among the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> But being detected, to have brought <hi>Albertus</hi> his Commands to <hi>Edſard,</hi> and asked what they were, anſwer'd, <hi>Nothing elſe, but to deſire Paſſage for the Spaniſh Forces through that Country:</hi> Although it was believed, and indeed more congruous to received Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>that he came to treat of an Exchange, concerning the very Right of that County with others in</hi> Burgundy, <hi>or elſe of Goods in</hi> Luizenburg.

To which purpoſe, the works about <hi>Herenberg,</hi> ſhould be thrown down, and the Gariſon withdrawn.

Iſland, that lay on the right hand of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> not far diſtant from the diviſion of the River, and the further Bank of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Cleves,</hi> winding about the Town of <hi>Sevenaer,</hi> ſets bounds to the Juriſdiction of <hi>Zut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen:</hi> On both ſides, they had Bridges made of Boats, for the more commodious paſſage over the River, as well of their great Guns, as their Horſe. And as ſoon as the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was gathered all together into one part, the reſt of their fears vaniſhed, ſo that now the Souldiers were called from <hi>Oſtend, Nimmeghen,</hi> and the furtheſt parts of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> to ſupply the want of thoſe Forces, whereof the Army had been drained by the Garriſons. Theſe were brought to the <hi>Prince</hi> by Count <hi>Hohenlo,</hi> whoſe diligence and labour was very remarkable, in furniſhing all the Cities of <hi>Over-Iſſell,</hi> while the Enemy lay every where ſcattered among them, with great Guns, Engines of War, and all other neceſſary things for the defenſive part, and beating off an Aſſaylant near at hand, or at a diſtance. Then the <hi>Prince</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it neceſſary to be provided againſt all imminent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, by knowing what number of men he had with him, upon muſter of his Army, he found, that he had fifteen hundred Horſe, and ſcarce ſix thouſand Foot, too ſmall a number publikely to meet the Enemy in the Field with, yet ſufficient to repel them, yea, and fight with them upon occaſion, where they might be helped by the Policy of the General, and advantage of time and place; And therefore underſtanding by ſome Priſoners, that <hi>Mendoſa's</hi> Proviſions were coming to the Town of <hi>Geldres,</hi> he made haſt back with ſome Troops, and the chief Officers of the Army to the <hi>Maes,</hi> in hope of intercepting the Enemies Relief, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, between <hi>Venloo</hi> and <hi>Moers;</hi> But the River being paſſed, the <hi>Spanyards</hi> firſt ſuſpecting, afterward learned the deſign, and ſo eſcaped the danger. Thus being diſappointed, they every one went to follow their Commands at their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments: Now there began ſome Skirmiſhes upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,

by the more then ordinary confidence of ſome few runawayes, who being brought in a Carriage-Boat, ſhould, as if it were by chance, ſtrike againſt a long Boat of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> lying upon the watch at <hi>Rees,</hi> and ſo overwhelm it with Darts.</p>
               <p>In this Interim, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army every day increaſed more and more, by the new coming of freſh forces, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that now their multitude became burdenſom to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while they devoured all the Proviſion that could be brought to them far and wide, beſides what came from <hi>Colen,</hi> and the Neighbouring Towns; by which means, Proviſion grew very dear, which happened not through any want that there was thereof, but from the Souldiers want of pay; and as evils ſeldom go alone, this dearneſs of Proviſion in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, was waited on by a plundering of the Fields and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages about <hi>Ments,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> that border upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but their malice was chiefly vented upon thoſe who were averſe, or ſeemed Enemies to the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the beginning of Rapine and plundering, and if either the Souldiers of the place, or the youth of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, offered to reſiſt their injurious extortions, there was no more then a word and a blow, which was the cauſe of many promiſcuous ſlaughters; yet could not the Souldiery be kept within their obedience, for all this liberty they took to themſelves; but ſometimes falling into extravagant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of money, as if they had been weary of idleneſs, or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous blood, would turn their madneſs, either againſt their Captains or Companions, ſo that <hi>Mendoſa</hi> himſelf could hardly ſo interpoſe, as to pacific the <hi>Walloons</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> fallen together by the ears, in a ſudden tumult, but that they would even before the Generals Tent, have encounters even to blood-ſhed, and ſpoil their Captains, even in his ſight: Beſides, the Noblemen differed in Counſel, out of envy one to another.</p>

               <p>Count <hi>Heremberg,</hi> paſſing to the right hand, marched a ſafer way as far as the <hi>Eemes,</hi> taking eaſie poſſeſſion of a Country, where there were no Forces to reſiſt him: or elſe, as if becauſe he had known the Country, he had as it were, come thither to challenge the <hi>Prince</hi> to fight; and becauſe he did not meer him, ſtudied nothing but revenge in their daily ſpoils: And this might be believed the Reaſon, why his Son being at that time in the Army, was called the <hi>Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matian Count.</hi> Of all which things, the <hi>Prince</hi> being informed as well by intercepted Letters, as by Intelligence of ſome Souldiers that were come over from them to him, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the City of <hi>Embden</hi> of the danger, wiſhing them to be very vigilant in their own defence.</p>
               <p>Now began grievous complaints every day to be made at the Duke of <hi>Cleves</hi> Court, the Rulers of <hi>Moers</hi> envying the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and with doleful outcryes, beſeeching the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> or <hi>Officers</hi> of the Army, to intreat <hi>Mendoſa</hi> on their behalf, that he would let them have ſome eaſe and reſpite, though not in peace, and the enjoyment of their own, which becauſe they had loſt by their ſluggiſhneſs and cowardiſe, they were ready forthwith to leave their Families, deſert their Country, and freely go with them, being ſtronger then themſelves, onely they requeſted, that their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might be permitted to leave that antient Seat of their Fathers, that they might not be ſlaves to the vileſt of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and be unworthily vexed with contumelious words, and ſcornful behaviour, whereas otherwiſe they would not enjoy their liberty, though to that purpoſe they lived in baniſhment: which things were very grievouſly taken by

Not were they that were ſent to the Emperor more backward to importune him with prayers; and in like manner were ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited all the Biſhops reſident about the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as alſo the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> who all for fear the ſame evil ſhould at one time or another creep towards them, were ready to be drawn into a league of defence: And the <hi>Colonians</hi> were dehorted, that they ſhould no more ſerve the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with proviſions, leaſt thereby they ſeemed to encourage them in their deſign of common ruine. Some alſo were commanded to go to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and to return him thanks, that he had hitherto main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the war with ſo little damage to the borderers, and to deſire him to proceed to convince the enemyes abominable villanyes with his valour and vertuous actions, and that he would not take in ill part any injuryes that ſhould be done to him or his unwillingly, but rather that he would look upon them with an eye of pity and mercy, hoping that he would rather revenge himſelf upon the authors and cauſers of the injury, then the patience of a weak people; That they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it would be acceptable, both to Himſelf and the States, becauſe formerly they had fought it; that ſince the Laws were in vain, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> inſolence was increaſed by impunity, the <hi>Germans</hi> would now joyn in arms with him: and they ſaid, That ſince they were compelled to deliver all that they held in the German ſoyl, they were promiſed that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould be forced to do the ſame, if they would not do it voluntarily; which ſince it had not been perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and that rewards were given to injurious oppreſſion, and modeſty uſed with con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="601" facs="tcp:55798:305"/>
at laſt underſtand what they had ſo often by experience found, after ſo many acts of hoſtility done by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they would never find a more opportune ſeaſon to joyn with their neighbours and friends, juſtly to ſubvert their encroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tyranny, then now, that old King <hi>Philip</hi> was dead, and the Army was full of diſcord and poverty. But <hi>Mendoſa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned anſwer to thoſe ſent to him, That it was uſual ſo to do, when rebels could not be otherwiſe repreſſed, nor would be intreated to give a better anſwer. Nay, he proceeded ſo far in the contempt of Juſtice, that he would not vouchſafe to inquire what might be pretenſively ſaid, either from the Antients, or at preſent for the Auſtrians againſt them of <hi>Cleves.</hi> In the interim, the Spaniards were daily more and more afflicted with freſh miſchiefs, themſelves ſuffring what they indeavoured to inflict upon others, for on this ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi> by continual Rapines, all the fruits of the ground were conſumed, the husbandmen driven away, and the woods felled, ſo that the Countrey far and wide was in a manner left naked, nor did proviſions come to the Camp as is uſual, becauſe they that brought it, were ſo often pillaged, and hence proceeded great famines among them, which made the Souldiers daily run away, not by one and one at a time, but by whole Companies in a day, ſome of which intending to go to the <hi>Moſelle. Mendoſa</hi> ſent ſome horſe after them to bring them back, whom they ſaluted ſo diſcourteouſly, that they were glad to return without doing what they were commanded. There was another accident alſo that increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their penury, which was this, The <hi>Rhine</hi> being very rough with tempeſtuous winds, had broken their bridg of Boats, the ignorance of the Smiths having not well faſtned them to the banks, ſo that by this means their commerce was cut off from one another. <hi>Mendoſa</hi> admoniſhed by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, certainly decreed the Siege of <hi>Bergh,</hi> which before this time they had but threatned; and this he did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Iſland there, the Blockhouſes upon the River, the
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:55798:306"/>
firm paſſage; and the reſt were not kept without loſs and infamy, the poſſeſſion of all which might be more juſtly, and with leſs trouble reteined by the title of a victorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: and therefore it was much admired, that he defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this care above a moneth, while the enemies were weak and far diſtant, unleſs by that delay he ſought a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence to ſtay in thoſe parts, for which now a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occaſion preſented it ſelf, becauſe the States being often required to redeliver <hi>Bergh,</hi> would neither ſurrender it as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers, nor fortify it as their own. At the beginning of the year, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Colen</hi> reiterated his demands of reſtitution, by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> the ſon of <hi>John,</hi> proteſting the equity thereof in very friendly words; ſo anſwering the pretence of charges, which was the States only Argument, that he ſaid they were the firſt that uſurped upon the City, whoſe example the <hi>Spaniards</hi> followed, yet they had often promiſed they would leave it, until at length they continued their delayes ſo long, that they were prevented from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance by a Siege; but if they expected to be repaid their charges of the war, and their damages, there is nothing more juſt, than that every one ſhould vindicate and maintain their own. And if he ſhould be permitted to reckon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Hay which he returned, how much more unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable is it for any man to interpoſe his authority in accounts of war? Beſides, he ſhewed that the town was only a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and charge to them that kept it, and would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Enemy, for that the River could be paſſed more commodiouſly in other places; which principally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the United States, in a Council of the Provinces held to that purpoſe, to weigh the great diſtance of the place, the poverty of the Souldiers, and the extream labour in fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: And although they diſcourſed no more of charges, yet it pleaſed them, being even out of hopes to keep it, to think that by the ſurrender of it they ſhould get ſomewhat more then thanks: And therefore they anſwered, That they
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:55798:306"/>
had often found, that whatever they gratified their friends withall, had become a booty to the Enemy; Wherefore they hoped it would be no injury, if they did faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that they would not in a hoſtile manner invade any part within the bounds of <hi>Germany,</hi> nor do any act to diſturb the trade or paſſage of or upon the <hi>Rhine:</hi> And if any thing were done to the contrary, that the ſaid Biſhop of <hi>Colen,</hi> and the other Electors about the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſhould appoint and order how, and what ſatisfaction ſhould be made for the ſame: He on the other ſide requiring ſtricter conditions, when an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement was almoſt concluded, would proceed no further, as knowing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were preparing a revenge, whom he was ſuſpected to have ſtirred up to deal in other matters controverted between himſelf and the Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> By reaſon of this kind of treaty before mentioned, the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> had ſcarcely any time to prepare for a defence of the Town, before the danger was ready to fall upon it.

                  </gap>e to think of fortifying, and beſides the evils they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, there was another happened whereof they never had a thought; for the Peſtilence beginning within the ſmall compaſs of the place, on a ſudden, burſt out more violently in a furious contagion and wonderful ſlaughter. The cauſe of this ſorrow was beleived to proceed at that time from the unuſual dryneſs of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> for the very channel lying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water, had infected the Ayr with thick vapours, which alſo by the unſeaſonableneſs of the foregoing Autumn had been corrupted; from thence ſprung ſo great an infection among the people, that whoever was touched therewith, was forthwith ſhut up from all humane ſociety. And of the Souldiers left in the garriſon, who had ſcarcely any victuals, nor a ſafe place to hide their heads in, ſcarce ſix hundred men remained alive of a far greater number: Nor were their bodies more waſted by the Plague, then their minds were afflicted with the miſery of ſo ſad a ſpectacle. The
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:55798:307"/>
Governour of the place, by name <hi>Seafy,</hi> lying alſo ſick of this terrible diſeaſe, receiving Letters from <hi>Mendoſa,</hi> only writ back this, <hi>That the ſurrender of the Town was unſeaſonably mentioned, becauſe the States had lately made Articles for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery thereof to the Archbiſhop of</hi> Colen. By the modeſty of this anſwer, the <hi>Spanyard</hi> preſently conceived raſh hopes of treachery; wherefore he ſent other Meſſengers, and by them offered great rewards both to him and his wife. In this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, the Prince ſuddenly commanded three Companyes of Foot to march by Land, becauſe the winds had taken away the uſe of the River, and their often being ſent, and as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent return, though ſtill to no purpoſe, had made the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my negligent; theſe three Companies were to guard and keep the Iſland, that was hard by, but not to mingle with the infected multitude of the town, unleſs upon fatal neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. The Fortifications of this Iſland were very weak, and the enemy prevented them in perfecting their deſign, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating on every ſide the thin rampire with the bullets of the Artillery which he had brought thither. And at the ſame time, ſome horſe, where the River ran more ſlow, got over at a ford, ſo that now danger was come even to their poſts, when by the command of the Governour, the new Souldiers being brought over (ſome great Guns and ſmall ſhot being diſpoſed about the rampire of the Town, by whoſe defence) the very laſt of them got ſafe into <hi>Bergh,</hi> leaving behind ſome fire ſecretly to burn their huts. And now <hi>Mendoſa,</hi> that the Enemy might not be able to interrupt the ſiege, put garriſons into divers Towns of the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves</hi> lying below <hi>Bergh.</hi> Many ſubmitted voluntarily; but the Inhabitants of <hi>Burick,</hi> dating at firſt to oppoſe the empty name of peace to the violence of war, he quickly made ſubmit by ſetting fire to their gate; Souldiers alſo were thruſt into <hi>Alpen</hi> and <hi>Moers,</hi> although this belonged to <hi>Nienarius</hi> his Widow, and that to the Widow of the Palatine, to both whom, <hi>Albertus</hi> had given his faith, That they ſhould not be diſturbed by the
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:55798:307"/>
War: But the like happened to more beſides themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Covenants and Promiſes being of no value, where all Laws are trodden under foot.</p>
               <p>About this time, the Ayr was very Cloudy, which much forwarded the Beſiegers, ſo that in ſhort time, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached near the Town in three places; yet for all that, were not come to the Trench. And now ſome Guns being planted, both in the Iſland and Continent, threatned from thence a continual Battery. At which time, <hi>Alfonſo Avales,</hi> commanding the Horſe, and Chief in managing the Siege, according to the Military Cuſtom, ſent a <hi>Herald.</hi> The Townſmen adviſe'd, that leave ſhould be deſired, of ſending a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but the <hi>Souldiers</hi> diſliked of that, as being a palpable confeſſion of fear, but ſent back a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late anſwer, being angry alſo at this, that he ſhould ſend to the <hi>Governour,</hi> as inferiour to him, becauſe in greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Soon after this, an Aſſault was made by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> upon the outward Bulwark; but they were beaten off vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anily, and that with ſo much the greater ſlaughter, by how much they came on raſhly, without any Adviſe or Conduct.

But within the Town, when as any one durſt go into the vacuities, there they found, (what was enough to astoniſh mens Ears in the hearing, and to make their Eys drop tears in the ſeeing) torn and diſmembred Bodies, Heads, Arms, Legs, and other parts ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered over the whole place.</hi>

               <p>The fifth day, the Siege was ended, and Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi>

               <p>And this certainly was, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have wiſhed; nor was his Endeavour therein wanting, that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould not be ended at One, but deferred from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to Council.</p>

               <p>While theſe things were arguing <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> before the <hi>Deputies</hi> of the five Countries, at the meeting of the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Moſelle,</hi> the Counſels relating to War, went but ſlowly on; nor were ſome wanting, that eſteemed it convenient at that time, to joyn their Forces with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> being men well experienced in Military Affairs. But the greater part thinking it ſufficient to receive back their own, refuſing to engage <hi>Germany</hi> into a long War, many of whom ſo dreading either the hatred or diſpleaſure of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the great mens power, that when there was any debate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fore-mentioned injuries received, they ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly avoyded to mention the name of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King, or People: But the States laboured moſt earneſtly, to gain to themſelves Aſſociates, from whoſe diſſentions, as they reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſadvantage, ſo from their good ſucceſſes, they might gain the power of making peace at pleaſure. The principal Authours for bringing this Expedition to maturity, were, the <hi>Count Palatine,</hi> one of the ſevere <hi>Electors,</hi> the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Brunswicke,</hi> who undertaking the Affairs in their own Names, and with their own Forces, which they had raiſed to a great number the laſt Winner; but a contention ariſing between <hi>Heſſen</hi> and <hi>Brunſwicke,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the chief Command in the War, hindered it, the <hi>Palatine</hi> alſo deſirous of reſt and peace, received for himſelf the defence of the inner parts, and the charge of all publick Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Weſtfalian Romaniſts,</hi> making uſe of this diviſion, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being more hateful to them, then to ſee the <hi>Proteſtant Princes</hi> in Arms, by offering a three months Tribute, equal to that given to the <hi>Turk,</hi> that their <hi>Governour</hi> might be made

               <p>The <hi>States</hi> paſſed this Winter in great care and fear, in regard the Rivers were twice ſhut up with Froſt, but yet, without loſs or damage; for Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and Count <hi>William,</hi> dividing their Forces, He took care of all on this ſide <hi>Iſſell</hi> from <hi>Arnheym,</hi> and this reſided at <hi>Meppell,</hi> for the Guard of the further parts, continual Meſſengers with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence paſſing between them; At this time, ſeveral plots were detected againſt <hi>Breda, Nimmeghen,</hi> and <hi>Devinter,</hi> Which did but increaſe the care and coſt in the defence thereof; Now alſo were the <hi>Mauribian</hi> Souldiers more then once Conquerours over their Enemies, and by the ſlaughter and plunder of a certain Garriſon, recompenced the honour of thoſe Soldiers that were hang'd in the <hi>Territory</hi> of <hi>Juliers,</hi> or <hi>Gulicke;</hi> though it is confeſſed, to be the worſt Cuſtom of all Martial Diſcipline, that for neglect of the publick execution of the Law, permits Captains to take their own private revenge.</p>
               <p>The Town of <hi>Emmeric,</hi> which we mentioned to be freed by Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> was now again ſurprized by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> who under pretence of their marching away in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> had brought thither Cannon, to the great terrour of the Magiſtrates, though both the Souldiery and the Citizens were couragious enough, and the paſſage beſides ſo difficult, by the increaſe of the Waters, that they were forced to come in with Boats.</p>
               <p>In the ſame place, ſoon after, the falling of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Houſe by the decay of a Pillar, was by many looked upon as prodigiouſly ominous to them: And Count <hi>Bucquoy,</hi> the <hi>Governour</hi> of the Garriſon there, was taken priſoner, while he followed a ſmall party cunningly ſent out to get booty,
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:55798:319"/>
until he fell into the Ambuſh, which <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> had prepared for him; And the truth is, about this time, the Kings Affairs ſuffered many and frequent damages, but none of any great concernment; for at the approach of the Spring, the Horſe being Quartered in divers places; <hi>Paulus Emilius Martinengo</hi> became a Priſoner; <hi>Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Herem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge</hi> alſo narrowly eſcaping the danger, all his Friends and Companions being taken: likewiſe the Guard of the Port at <hi>Antwerp</hi> was forced, and great ſpoyl carryed away: and at Sea a Ship carrying Arms from <hi>Hamburgh</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> was taken. As yet they had no money, but at laſt, three hundred thouſand Ducats, was taken up with the Merchants at exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Uſury, meerly to ſtop their mouths for the preſent.

Theſe ſtrong attempts of the Enemy did not terrify the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> but made them rather be more intent then before, with courage to employ both their Wealth and Forces, for they were about for the increaſing their treaſury, to ſet a tax or impoſt upon all ſales, contentions and Inheritances, which was taken very hardly; but the two hundredth penny was more burthenſome, and therefore continued but a ſhort while, although the cuſtome thereof was of old much commended among free people for the equality thereof. But the Riches of many were unknown, or elſe by reaſon of traffiquing uncertain, and the ſuſpected Faith of Profeſſors hindred the ſame: And this highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the common people, that the moſt wealthy men, if they gave two thouſand Florens for their two hundreth part, they were eaſed for any further burthen by reaſon of their Trade or Profeſſion, which was given, partly for the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of envy, and partly for the eaſe of the Nobility, as the poo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> ſhewed them, <hi>That the Enemy might more ſafely be eluded otherwiſe, and the matter comming to be diſputed by a fight, would do no great damage to the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Souldiers, but among the people, the leaſt wounds were great cauſes of terror.</hi> Count <hi>William</hi> being preſent, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded this prudence, being always averſe to raſh and hot-headed Counſels.

Wherefore the <hi>Germans</hi> thought fit rather to reduce <hi>Rees,</hi> that ſo they might have Supplies of Victuals from the <hi>Hollanders</hi> nearer hand, or any thing elſe that they ſtood in need of. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was come <hi>Herman</hi> Count <hi>Heremberge,</hi> by Command of Cardinal <hi>Andrew,</hi> he might lay the blame of his own men with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> ſpun out much time, with the hope of reſtoring cert in places; and thereupon reſolutely anſwer'd, <hi>That the States had rendred up many Towns, and more Forts, without any Conditions, and that they ſhould not, by an unequal Compariſon, ſeek to hide their Crimes:</hi> And being asked, <hi>If he had brought Money wherewith to ſatisfie ſo many People of the Damage done to them; and what Caution ſhould be given, that the ſame Evils ſhould not afterwards be re-acted, when the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo many Towns, and the waſting ſo many Fields, made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that the King's Promiſe and Seal were but Feeble Pillars for them to truſt to, or rely on.</hi> But Deeds differ'd from Words; and therefore the Commanders, by waſting Time in Diſputes, and the Souldier growing effeminate more and more by Idleneſs, began to commit Rapines, and other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Acts, doing nothing againſt the Enemy, but daring to act over again thoſe Villanies, which They were come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to puniſh and revenge.</p>
               <p>At the very Siege of <hi>Rees</hi> there was no Hoſtility; but, as in Deriſion, the <hi>Germans</hi> were invited to Drinking; and ſome there were that went, ſhook Hands with them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſafe; until this private Colluſion of the Souldiers, was at laſt changed into a Truce for certain Days. Without all doubt, the <hi>Confederate States</hi> expected many and great Things from this <hi>German Commotion,</hi> which produced them no other benefit, unleſs that while ſo great an Army grew ſtupid through Idleneſs, Count <hi>William</hi> being ſent from <hi>Bommel</hi> with ſeven Troops of Horſe, and fifty Companies of Foot to <hi>Doetichem,</hi> taken by <hi>Mendoſa</hi> the Year before, and re-took it

from the Enemy within three days, although the Seaſon were very wet, and the Beſieged made ſtrong Defence by ſhooting, and otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> being ſent towards <hi>Grave</hi> with ſome Troops, though the Enemy over-matched him in Number, yet he purſued their Party, and by provident Conduct, through the narrow Paſſages of the Journey, and by the ſide of the <hi>Maes,</hi> brought back the Booty, which the Enemy had taken in the Country. And by this time the Truce was ended at <hi>Rees,</hi> yet was no progreſs made in the Siege; for the truth is, the Commanders were not skill'd in thoſe Affairs. And the <hi>Pioneers</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> that came thither, choſe rather continuance of ſmall Wages, and long Work with Safety, than great Wages, and ſhort Work with Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. There were ſcarce any ſhew of Guards or Sentinels throughout the Camp, ſo that their freſh Souldiers came into the Town with Relief: And now Winter drawing on when, according to the Cuſtom of War, a Herald being ſent too inconſiderately by the <hi>Beſiegers</hi> with a Summons, the <hi>Beſieged</hi> retaining the <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> ſuddainly ſally'd out upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided and unwary Enemy, of whom they ſlew near 200, and carryed off with them ſome of their Guns, which ſtrook ſo great a Terrour into their weak and Cowardly Hearts, that they not onely raiſed the Siege, but deſerted their Camp, in an unworthy and almoſt unparallel'd flight, leaving behind them both their Boats, and all ſorts of Proviſions; part of which, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> carryed away; other part, the <hi>Germans</hi> themſelves, who were on the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s Party.

for the Relief of <hi>Rees:</hi> Scarcely were <hi>Orſeo</hi> and <hi>Emmerie</hi> preſerved by a mean Party of Souldiers, before this ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful failing of <hi>Germany,</hi> it had often been in Agitation; that throwing aſide all diſſembling Vizors, they ſhould publikely make a <hi>League</hi> with the <hi>States,</hi> and receive Aid from them; or that the Charge and Command of the War ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> who was very expert and knowing in Warlike Affairs. But it was not fit to ſend to the <hi>States,</hi> becauſe their Care was taken up in the Defence of their own Borders: Beſides, the Terrour of the <hi>Spaniſh Fleet,</hi> made them ſtrengthen their Sea-Coaſts; and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> poſſeſſed with the ſame Fear, required their Men, in the <hi>States</hi> Pay, for their own Guard. Nor was the Prince, finding by Count <hi>William,</hi> who was ſent before, to ſee how the <hi>German Affairs</hi> ſtood, over-haſty to thruſt himſelf into Dangers, and to take Souldiers under him, that would neither learn <hi>Obedience,</hi> nor any other good <hi>Arts.</hi>

                  <pb n="638" facs="tcp:55798:327"/>We have elſewhere related, that while <hi>Philip</hi> the Second Reigned, he permitted the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to Trade freely into <hi>Spain,</hi> even in the heat of the War, but under the names of other People, yet ſo, as that it was apparent, to be a piece of great prudence, to be willing to be deceived, whether the hopes of their returning to their obedience, made him tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that benefit to other <hi>Nations,</hi> or that he had found by the event. It was not ſafe to cavil with People prevalent at Sea, leſt they ſhould keep all that Commerce from <hi>Spain,</hi> Which they would maintain free to all the reſt of the <hi>World;</hi> But as for the moſt part, thoſe Counſels are irkſome to a <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> wherein before he was unconcerned, ſo here, the Son of <hi>Philip</hi> diſliked his Fathers notions, and as if deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of peace, turned all things to a pitch of ſeverity. It was evident enough to the whole <hi>World,</hi> that all the <hi>Hollanders Wealth,</hi> was drawn out of the Sea, and raiſed by <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> and that the greateſt profit by them gotten, was from the <hi>Spaniſh Trade,</hi> becauſe they carried thither, not onely their own <hi>Wares</hi> and <hi>Commodities;</hi> but alſo <hi>Sarmatian</hi> fruits, and other things, and bringing from thence Gold and Silver, whereof as there is plenty with them, being <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Indies:</hi> ſo there is great uſe among <hi>Merchants,</hi> and dealers in Trading and Traffick; and therefore the Nerves and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of the <hi>War,</hi> being taken away, it was hoped, that the <hi>War</hi> it ſelf would ceaſe of its own accord: To this purpoſe, all <hi>Holland Stamen</hi> found in <hi>Spain,</hi> were taken up and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, part of them being put to great torments, and puniſhments, and others either thrown into priſon, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Galles.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Netherlands</hi> alſo, an Edict was ſet out in the Name of the New Princeſs <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſtuffed with many railing Speeches againſt the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> who, as ever before, ſo now, changing their <hi>Government,</hi> and being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from <hi>Spain,</hi> refuſed peace, when offered to them, and ſtirred up others to <hi>War,</hi> their ſo great pride and arrogance

proceeding from no other Fountain, then that <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Merchandiſing,</hi> which her Fathers too much indulgence, had hitherto allowed them.</p>
               <p>Many of the <hi>Brabanders,</hi> and <hi>Flandrians,</hi> withſtood this <hi>Decree,</hi> and would not have the <hi>Netherlandiſh Exportations, Importations,</hi> or <hi>Tranſportations,</hi> taken away, becauſe of the great want they had of the <hi>Holland Commodities:</hi> But wrath and ſpleen prevailed, and hopes of ſupplying their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties out of <hi>France,</hi> ſo that by the ſaid <hi>Decree,</hi> all ſecurity was taken away, even from <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> whom they had till that time, ſpared in the heat of <hi>War:</hi> This matter did not a little trouble the <hi>States,</hi> becauſe hereby, two of the Peoples chief Supports were taken away, from whence it was feared that the <hi>Seamen</hi> would have mutined, and the <hi>Merchants</hi> have left them to have found out places of a better, and more free Trade. Yet they did not degenerate from their <hi>Pristine Counſels;</hi> They had learned from Society and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that there was nothing in all the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Dominions, leſs to be feared than <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf; all its <hi>Kings</hi> putting their chief confidence in this, that no peace ſhould be left to any other Nations within themſelves; and they conceived it neceſſary for themſelves, to have ſome <hi>War</hi> at Sea, for the keeping at home their <hi>Marriners,</hi> and that it would be very glorious, if they ſhould bring upon <hi>Spain,</hi> denying Traffick, that penury wherewith the <hi>Spaniard</hi> threatned them. Therefore by a contrary <hi>Decree,</hi> repeating all the facinorous acts which formerly the <hi>Spaniards</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and now of late in <hi>Germany,</hi> and all other things that might make them be envyed and hated, they forbid all their People to carry into <hi>Spain</hi> any Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Merchandiſe; and if any ſhould be found doing to the contrary, they ſhould be looked on as Enemies, and Factors, and Abettors of their Enemies: the <hi>Fiſhermen</hi> alſo were prohibited, to purchaſe impunity, or Licenſe, from the Enemy, adding, that they would take care to keep the Sea

free for them; and if any one ſuffered any damage, it ſhould be lawful to them, to take ſatisfaction by the waſt and ſpoil of the Enemies Country. A Copy of this <hi>Decree,</hi> was ſent to ſeveral Kings and People, that none might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ignorance thereof. Of which, the King of <hi>France</hi> took particular Cognizance, proteſting, <hi>That if any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould within ſix moneths ſail into</hi> Spain, <hi>the State ſhould incur no danger by their wilful breach, but it ſhould wholly light upon themſelves, but all the reſt paſsed it over in ſilence.</hi>

               <p>This done, they prepared a <hi>Fleet,</hi> raking together, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever publick money could be raiſed by <hi>Tributes,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, undertaking a great hazardous Affair, and ſcarce ever accompliſhed with any indifferent ſucceſs, as is manifeſt by divers Examples of Antiquity; for when <hi>Hanniball</hi> was drawn out of <hi>Italy, Scipio</hi> became <hi>Conquerour</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Agathocles</hi> having waſted <hi>Africa</hi> a long time, yet at laſt, the <hi>Athenian</hi> Wealth was overthrown by the <hi>Scicilians</hi> Arms, And there was a freſh Example of the like nature, eleven years before this time, in the great <hi>Fleet</hi> of King <hi>Philip,</hi> when it was plainly, as it were, ſet out by fate, that the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould by turns find, how uncertain the hopes of thoſe things were, which are committed to the Winds and Waves. At the beginning of <hi>Summer,</hi> they ſet out a <hi>Fleet</hi> of threeſcore and thirteen Ships, carrying eight thouſand <hi>Seamen</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Peter Douſe</hi> the <hi>Admirall,</hi> who was a Noble man; but as if he had had no Honour from his Birth, attained to this heighth of Command, by long Service, and many gradations: they received Command to deſtroy the <hi>Fleet,</hi> which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had been a great while in building, for want of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Cordage, and Marriners; and this was one cauſe that induced the <hi>States</hi> to make ſo much haſt, that done, to ſpoyl the <hi>American</hi> Ships, and waſt all the Coaſts of the ſaid Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Dominion.</p>
               <p>This unuſual and daring attempt, carryed with it, great

terrour, ſo that the Shores were left deſolate, all flying from thence; for there were <hi>Letters</hi> ſent before out of <hi>Holland,</hi> that mentioned the coming of the <hi>Fleet</hi> into theſe parts, as if it had been learned from ſome Captives.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fleet</hi> begun by King <hi>Philip,</hi> lay at <hi>Corunna:</hi> At firſt, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> came and lay by them, but they not daring to truſt the naked <hi>Fleet</hi> to their Enemies mercy, got under the protection of a ſtrong Caſtle; and then the Cannon thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering from the Ships, Caſtle, and Fort, which was hard by, took away all their hopes of aſſaulting, either at diſtance, or near at hand: Wherefore, having ſeen enough here, that that <hi>Nation</hi> which boaſted it ſelf Lady of the Ocean, had with their <hi>Fleet,</hi> ſought a hole, and hid themſelves in their Docks, rather then to fight at Sea with Honour. When they came to the mouth of the River <hi>Tagus,</hi> ſome were greedy and violent, for the taking of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> either for Honours ſake, or in hope of a prey, urging, the antient diſcords of their Neighbour-hood, the hated Dominion of the <hi>Caſtilians.</hi> And laſtly, the <hi>City</hi> it ſelf, which in the Expedition of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> was found to be but weak, though it were very large; and if that <hi>Nation</hi> took it then, that went to manage a <hi>War,</hi> not to ſeek for Booty, without doubt, it will be as eaſily done now. On the other ſide many were of Opinion, that in ſo long a Peace, the King had repaired and made good all defects, and that it was not to be expected, that a <hi>Fleet</hi> ſo long looked for ſhould do any good againſt ſuch great <hi>Cities,</hi> wherein, as well the care, as the fear of the <hi>Governours,</hi> makes them diligent.

It is lawful onely for their Kings to marry their Siſters, as among the <hi>Inchas</hi> of <hi>Peru:</hi> Private men may, if they will, have more Wives than one; This alſo is a <hi>Scythian</hi> Cuſtom, that the King, or chief Lord, ſhould have the Virginity of every new marryed Bride; The Gods they worſhip, are the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> above whom there is one Judge, they ſay, of good and evill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and therefore, that there is another life after death: Infants are with ſolemn Rites, purified with water.

By whoſe death, all the common rabble were ſo troubled, that their hopes began utterly to droop, and ſoon after, the cry of all was, to leave that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious place; and when conſultation was had concerning revenge, It was thought ſufficient that they intermingled their Enemies deaths with their own dangers. The body of their Admiral <hi>Douſe,</hi> that it might not after their departure be made a laughing ſtock, they buried very deep under ground, all the ruines of the whole Town lying over him, they brought away their guns, and ſome Merchandiſe, and preſently went to Sea; but yet they had not loſt the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they had left the place, for the Ayre changed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlowly, and by degrees; and the poiſon of a diſeaſe, being once imbibed, will for a long time follow the infected; nay, the contagion and peſtilent ſtench of the ſick within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs of ſhips, made the diſeaſe more and more ſpread, inſomuch that in fifteen dayes they loſt above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men.

They were perplexed alſo with Tempeſts, which brought them into more then ordinary danger, in regard all the perſons belonging to the Fleet were by reaſon of their weakneſs, unable to govern or manage them. Of all the number of Captains, only two ſurvived, and ſome Ships did not bring home above ſix ſound men apiece in them; not that there were ſo many ſick, but that the reſt were either conſumed with diſeaſes, or thrown over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board into the Sea. Part of the Ships came and gathered new forces in <hi>England,</hi> others being diſperſed, according as they were furniſhed with Sails, Tackle, and Marriners, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home almoſt at the end of Winter: one Ship was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſerted for want of men, another being brought to <hi>Scluys,</hi> was taken by the Enemies. And this was the event and Succeſs of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Fleet, that had been ſo great a Charge to the Commonwealth for ſo long time, and at its return, filled whole Families with lamentations.

               </p>
               <p>About this time, <hi>Frederick Spinola</hi> brought ſome new aid to King <hi>Philip</hi> conſiſting of ſix great Ships, which were to be uſed againſt the <hi>Hollander,</hi> Covenanting to have all the Spoil he could take from them to his own uſe: for he was a man, Ambitious to equal in Warlike glory, his Name, and Houſe, which was famous among the <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> and wealthy among his Countreymen of <hi>Orens,</hi> who had increaſed both their Wealth and Honour by Arms. This part of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> Fleet was to come againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> if the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> with great care and high threats, which carryed much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terror, had not diverted them otherwhere; Therefore they came apart, after a ſhort ſtay in <hi>Pontoyſe,</hi> a Port in <hi>France;</hi> the weather exceedingly favouring them, for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were forewarned of them, and had ſent ſome Ships into the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Narrow Sea towards <hi>Calais</hi> to intercept them; but they paſſing by the ſhore, came ſafe to <hi>Flanders,</hi> being favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both by the Winds, and their own Fortune; yet they
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:55798:333"/>
were forbidden to go into <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and therefore they went to <hi>Scluys,</hi> having in them one thouſand ſix hundred Souldiers; from thence they threatened the Merchants and Coaſts of <hi>Zeland;</hi> and theſe new kind of Veſſels, that in theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes had never been ſeen before, did no ſmall damage, firſt in their charge about ſtopping up all paſſages, afterwards by ſmall loſſes ſtriking ſo great a terror far and near, that many fled out of <hi>Zeland,</hi> and ſought new places to dwell in. But the event abated the fear; for although ſoon after <hi>Spinola's</hi> Ships, making uſe of a ſerene calm, and great ſilence, had taken one Ship of War belonging to <hi>Zeland,</hi> they being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both with Native and hired Souldiers, that carrying ſcarcely threeſcore Marriners, yet did for the ſpace of two hours defend it ſelf on every ſide with that courage, that for twenty or thereabouts that were killed or wounded, there were two hundred and fifty ſlain on the other ſide, which caſt a great fear on the Aſſailants part. And again ſetting upon ſome other Ships of War, miſtaking them for Merchants Ships, with continual ſhot for ſix hours together, they were ſpoiled, and almoſt torn in pieces, which was a joyful ſight to <hi>Fluſhing</hi> (ſo near was the conteſt to them).</p>
               <p>But <hi>Albertus</hi> the Archduke having finiſhed his Nuptial Ceremonies in <hi>Spain,</hi> as he returned through <hi>Italy,</hi> the Pope Preſented to him a Conſecrated Sword, by vertue whereof he might the more boldly proceed againſt his Enemies on all hands.

At <hi>Antwerp</hi> the Souldiers in the Caſtle required money. At <hi>Hamond</hi> (a free Town in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Leige</hi>) and the places about, ſome Troops of Horſe, and Regiments of Foot gathered Tribute both out of the Towns and Countrey, which was exacted from them with the threats and terror of Fire and Sword. The Garriſon of Fort-<hi>Andrew</hi> having privately obtained a truce with Count <hi>Erneſt</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> who kept the oppoſite bank, ſent great threats to <hi>Boiſledue</hi> and the adjacent places, unleſs they would pay them the Arrears of what was due to them for many years ſervice. All theſe miſchiefs the Princes found a foot when they came into the Countrey, and by their preſence were ſo far from ſetling them, that new evils rather ſprung up. The Nobility being inraged, that both in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and habit, the Princes were ſo <hi>Hiſpaniolized,</hi> and would be ſaluted by the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> with bending of the knee.

The <hi>United States,</hi> to whom but newly redeem'd from Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:55798:336"/>
was accrewed an Ample Dominion, made all their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to be but ſtricter Bonds to connect them; being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by ſucceſsful Arms; although they had, ſince that, been reduc'd to no ſmall Neceſſity, out of their Old Diſcipline retrain'd their Courage againſt their Enemy, but not equally their Concord and Modeſty. On both Sides then were great and ſtrong Endeavours, while, for above the ſpace of Thirty Years, they contended to put an end to their Labour; with which hope they have proſuſely waſted their Forces even to Extremity; as if Victory had ſtood before their Eyes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Reward to them that could hold our longeſt. And, firſt of all, the <hi>Winter</hi> being Froſty, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> eſcaped great danger, by reaſon the Rivers were all paſſable upon the Ice, from the Enemies ſeditious Mutinies, which they turn'd to their Advantage: For <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Naſsau,</hi> marching with great privacy out, with a ſelect Party of Horſe and Foot, broke into <hi>Wachtendone,</hi> a Town not far from the Borders of the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves,</hi> formerly taken by Count <hi>Mansfeldt,</hi> after a Two Moneths Siege, when the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had drawn the <hi>States</hi> Forces another way: The Horſe, which had lately been added to that Garriſon, for the preſerving thereof, were then, by chance, abſent, forraging about the Borders of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Colen;</hi> yet there were the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Among the <hi>French,</hi> that fought for the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> was one <hi>Breautee,</hi> a Gentleman of good Birth and Bloud in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> who, vaunting in his Youth, had challeng'd to fight 20 of <hi>Grebendoncks</hi> Troop; the chief of whom were infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, for the Treacherous Delivery of <hi>Gertruydenberg;</hi> and therefore certainly, this was an unbeſeeming Conteſt for a Perſon of Honour: Each of them, with an equal Number, came out into a Field not far from <hi>Shertogenboſch,</hi> the <hi>Grob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendonkians</hi> being better Armed, but <hi>Breautee,</hi> more exact in his place and order: At the firſt Charge, <hi>Breautee</hi> kill'd the Enemies Leader, who was named <hi>Abraham,</hi> but was known in the Camp by the Nick-name of <hi>Cook;</hi> and ſo ſharp was the Fight, and the Shot directed ſo rightly oppoſite, that in the firſt Conflict, on both Sides, the one half of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders</hi> fell; but, by the flight of the <hi>French,</hi> whoſe Courage began to fail, in the continuance of the Danger, <hi>Breautee</hi> being left alone, having oftentimes changed his Horſe, and afterwards fighting on foot, at laſt overpreſſed with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Enemies, yielded himſelf: The <hi>French</hi> affirm he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticled for his Life; againſt which the <hi>Brab under</hi> ſay, <hi>That by Agreement, the Conquered were to expect nothing but Death:</hi> But, certainly, being Priſoner, he had prevail'd much, when ſome, ſent out of the City, kill'd him with 30 Wounds, while he onely begg'd they would let him dye Armed, and like a Man. A Wickedneſs fit onely to be committed by ſuch ignominious Perſons, and yet a good Leſſon for magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Youth; That they ſhould not, under the falſe Title of Honour, affects thoſe kind of Conflicts, from whence can

The Work about the Fort, augmented by <hi>Mendoſa,</hi> were now finiſh'd by Prince <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice:</hi> From thence he went to the Fort <hi>Andrew,</hi> where the <hi>Germane</hi> and <hi>Walloon</hi> Souldiers, thruſting out their Captains, openly acknowledged a Sedition; and ſending <hi>Balotte,</hi> who, under pretence of an Expedition, ſhould allure them out, they eſcaped the Fraud, yet they held that ſtrong Fort, not without hope of pardon, as a Pledge for the Arrears of Three Years Pay due to them; and for this they were more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate againſt the Enemy, becauſe a leſs price was offer'd them for their coming over, than they hoped to get, and yet ſaved both their Oath and Honour. There were ſome great Guns left there for reſiſtance; the Rampire it ſelf was like a Caſtle, wherein were two Fortreſſes or Batteries upon the <hi>Maes,</hi> and two upon the <hi>Wael;</hi> the fifth looking towards <hi>Harwarden:</hi> About the Trench, and beyond it, were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Galleries, and then again a Trench, within which the Rivers were contained: In the ſtrength of theſe Works, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſo great Confidence, that <hi>Albertus,</hi> in his Letters and Diſcourſe, boaſted, <hi>That he poſſeſſed the Mouth of the Rivers, and that he had put a Yoke upon the Necks of the</hi> Hollanders.

               <p>The Souldiers in the Town of <hi>Shertogenboſch</hi> kept up their hopes, by giving frequent Signs by Fire, and endeavouring to carry in ſhips, but in vain. The Army alſo came under the Command of <hi>Velaſco,</hi> threatning great Things; but they could find no way to their Companions, the Fields being cover'd with Water, and the Forts oppoſing them. And now much of the Mountain Snow being melted, by the approach
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:55798:338"/>
of the Spring, and after their Rivers returned to their bounds, the Pioneers began to fall to work, eſpecially, in the night, and when the Moon grew old; At length, they came to the Gallery, which we mentioned to be encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a Rampire. When the Souldiers, though they had not ſuffered the utmoſt extremity, yet being out of all hope of Relief, and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> haſtning to redeem the time, they came to Conditions, and one hundred twenty five thouſand <hi>Florens</hi> were payd part of their pay due from the Enemy, which they divided man by man; For this price was that famous and well-builded Fort, bought, ſtanding moſt conveniently for the defence of <hi>Holland,</hi> then the Cannon, and whatever elſe was therein, and one thouſand two hundred Souldiers coming over to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who performing (according to Cuſtom) all the Sign of joy, even They Themſelves, tryumphed over Themſelves. Theſe men afterwards, did very good ſervice, when giving over their licentiouſneſs, they returned to the Diſcipline of War; yet they were for this thing proſcribed as <hi>Traytors</hi> by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which together, with hatred, and fear of puniſhment, put them in an exceſſive rage. If theſe things were not to be approved, before rigid Judges, certainly, theſe are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable then the <hi>Gertruydenburgers;</hi> for they, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of all their pay, for a long ſeaſon, yet had ſtood out againſt a Camp, and a two moneths Siege, they do not complain upon juſt Cauſes, ſince they alter their obedience to good advantage.</p>
               <p>About this time, the <hi>States</hi> ſet out an Edict, that no one ſhould reproach theſe new Souldiers for their tranſition, or coming over, as well underſtanding, that even for ſmaller cauſes, an Army hath ſometimes fallen to inteſtine diſcords, as of late during this Siege, two Souldiers, the one a <hi>German,</hi> the other a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> quartelling at Dice, ſell to fight, when of a ſudden, each of their Country-men coming in to take parts, had like to have been the cauſe of great ſlaughter and
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:55798:338"/>
blood-ſhed; for ſcarcely could the conteſt be ended, even by the interpoſition of the <hi>States.</hi> About this time, the long pertinacy of the City of <hi>Groningen,</hi> having juſtly enraged thoſe that emulated it, made the reſt of the <hi>States</hi> fall upon ſharp reſolves, ſuch as is ſcarcely uſual among free people: the common people being in their own nature fierce, and having gotten <hi>Governours,</hi> that were exiles, during the rule of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and therefore be having themſelves with the greater confidence towards the people, diſdained to live under ſeverer Laws now, then thoſe that oppreſſed them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King, by whoſe connivence, they had obtained to have their Houſes Tax-free, and ſome other things beneficial indeed to themſelves, but prejudicial to the Inhabitants: who remembring theſe things, by the Decree of the <hi>United States,</hi> to whom they had ſubjected themſelves, they would not agree, that many of the Priviledges they had nominally uſed, ſhould be taken away from them: Beſides, they had neglected for three years together, to bring their <hi>Tributes</hi> into the <hi>Treaſury;</hi> and ſince, they could not without a moſt pernitious example, ſuffer their Judgments to be contemned, and their undertaken care to be depraved. Count <hi>William,</hi> though prone to mercy, is commanded with a party of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, by force, to reduce the Townſmen to their duty; but he moderated with prudence, the ſharpneſs of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by reſtraining the Souldiers from doing injuries, and taking no notice of the words of the incenſed vulgar. Yet diſarming the <hi>Citizens,</hi> leſt while they remained in their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they ſhould as formerly, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true, theſe things are uſual with ſuch as rule by force, nor could any thing more have been done to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: It was time certainly, to lay down the Arms which
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:55798:339"/>
they had taken up againſt Caſtles, if the Authours of liberty would rather chuſe to imitate, than revenge ſuch things: And they alſo deſired, that part of the reſt might be remitted to them; but the remembrance of old faults, had baniſhed their long offered Clemency, eſpecially conſidering at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, their contempt and diſobedience; yet the event mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, and abated the envy of this action; for the movers of theſe troubles, were afterwards carryed onely to the <hi>Hague,</hi> without any other puniſhment; and the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> being tranſlated to People of more peaceable temper, their right of ſuffrage in the Council, was reſtored to them, and all things afterwards tranſacted with equity.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Frizeland</hi> alſo, a great contention aroſe concerning Taxes laid upon <hi>Cattell</hi> and <hi>Pastures,</hi> the Townſmen urging it, and the <hi>Country-People</hi> that lived all over <hi>Eaſtergoo,</hi> and <hi>Weſtergoo,</hi> gainſaying it, ſo that ſoon after, out of an ambition of eminent Offices, which as is uſual, nouriſhed the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, came to that heighth, that part went to <hi>Faniker,</hi> while other part of them remain at <hi>Liewert,</hi> and both under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of publike Counſel, diſtracted the <hi>Common wealth,</hi> and drained the Treaſury: in which Affairs, Count <hi>William</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing himſelf, and firſt calling the Authority of the Judges, and then taking Arms againſt thoſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, did not eſcape the envy of having affected the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> beyond the allowance of the Laws: At laſt, when the Aſſociated <hi>Provinces</hi> all interpoſed themſelves, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the appointment of the <hi>Deputies,</hi> was re-ſetled in peace, according to the old form; as an addition to thoſe evils, a ſorrowful <hi>Meſsenger</hi> arrived, bringing tydings of a <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> between the <hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> (to whom the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had left the managery of the Affair) and the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> were then met together at <hi>Bulloyn.</hi> The truth is, both of them had cauſe enough to deſire peace: the great undertakings, and bold attempts of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> terrifying King

               <p>After three moneths, it was perceived that the <hi>Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> could not be drawn to agree, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> refuſing to be preceded, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hating to have any equalls; Nor was there any better progreſs by intercu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus they parted at that time, and the Affair was left to be treated of in Writing, untill the <hi>Queens</hi> Death and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, as we ſhall ſhew in its proper place, put an end thereto. In the interim, <hi>Embaſsadors</hi> came to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> from the <hi>Emperour,</hi> becauſe the <hi>States</hi> had ſent <hi>Letters</hi> to meet them by the way, as to their Reſolve concerning peace.

not without deſert, <hi>That the loſſes ſhould be imputed, and the places taken for defence, be laid to the fault of them that firſt brought an Army into a peaceable Country; and if that were to be pardoned in the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>they hoped it would not make them more guilty, having been neceſſitated to do the like:</hi> As to the Iſlands of <hi>Gravewaert,</hi> and concerning Peace, they gave the ſame anſwer, which they had often before done; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had relinquiſhed <hi>Rees,</hi> it ſeemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to them, that <hi>Emmeric</hi> alſo ſhould be delivered, that ſo the Enemy might the more juſtly be blamed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of <hi>Bercke;</hi> Some Diſcourſe there was at this time, of matters of leſs moment, a mention of a Truce being thrown in by the by, which the <hi>States</hi> gently denyed, as not ſuitable to the times.

And though there was a neceſſity of aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating as many as poſſible, for that otherwiſe the number of the forces would be too ſmall, yet ſtill there remained a fear of their ſeditious humours, but at laſt being won by prayers and promiſes (which is often ſoen in War), that they would lend their helping band to the repelling this common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they yet retained their diſcords, yet ſo as that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould not rob them of their reward.

               <p>The blame of this wicked Cruelty he caſt off from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Seditious Souldiers; and this was done, either
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:55798:343"/>
to make them hated and odious, or elſe theſe diſobedient men really thought to make amends to their Prince, for their dubious Fidelity, by their perfidious Treachery upon their Enemies: It was Night, when the Report of this matter came to the Prince's Ears, and the <hi>Terrour</hi> thereof frighted the reſt, who had foreſeen nothing leſs: Nor do I ſuppoſe them diſ-ingenuous, who believe that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Affairs, had not for many years, been in the like danger: 'Tis true, there were Forces, which were, without doubt, conſiderable to their Party; yet the gallantry of the Captain was more than the greatneſs of the Forces: All the Country round about was Hoſtile; and now the Enemy was at hand, it was too late to fortifie the Camp; nor indeed would it avail them, who were ready daily to be ſurpriſed with Hunger: for Proviſions could not be expected from <hi>Oſtend</hi> when the Enemy would lye between it and them: To fly into <hi>France,</hi> would be no leſs baſe and cowardly, than doubtful and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: And if they ſhould ſtay for the Enemy drawing nearer and nearer to them every minute, the Souldiers being diſperſed in the Siege, ſo that the very Port might be taken from them, it would rather ſeem to be a Slaughter, than a Battail: Yet for all this, the Prince laid hold on one hope, which onely remained, by the Opinion of all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Chief, and other Officers, (the great and famous Day for Battel being not yet come) ſent Count <hi>Ernest</hi> with 10 Companies of Foot, 4 Troops of Horſe, and 2 great Guns, that by taking the Bridge at <hi>Leffingen,</hi> which one ſingle Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was ſtit open, the Enemies paſſage might be ſtopped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: but if that could not be effected, they ſhould yet make them for a while delay their progreſs, until he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his Army, and took Counſel further what to do.</p>
               <p>But Count <hi>Erneſt,</hi> though ſpeeding all he could, found the Enemy paſſed thoſe Streights, and out of hope onely to wear out ſome time, with the two great Guns he had brought with him, commodiouſly planted to that purpoſe, be aſſailed the

               <p>This Slaughter (as it often happens) was the means that all the reſt of the Army were ſaved: For while the Enemy was buſie in following the Chace, and pillaging the Field, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> got time, firſt to tranſpoſe his Horſemen, and afterwards his Carriages, into that part of the Sea-Coaſt, which looks towards <hi>Oſtend:</hi> During whoſe paſſage, if the Enemy had come upon them, there muſt needs have follow'd a very great ſlaughter: But he being grown more ſlow by his Security, and meaſuring the whole Event by the former Fight, ſent <hi>Meſſengers</hi> into the Neighbouring Cities, that a great part of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Army was ſlain in the Fight, and himſelf, with the reſt, incloſed by Them.

their Conſciences: That it now lay in their</hi> (viz. <hi>the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Armies) hands, to make their Prince as great as they would have him, for this one day would fully reſtore his Dominion to him, if they would ſtrive for the Victory; nor ſhould there be any further occaſion of War, for this would be the firſt and laſt Battel: 'Tis true indeed at</hi> Turnholt, <hi>they kill'd ſome of the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Army; but, what were they? ſuch as choſe rather to run away, than to meet the Enemy; neither, at that place, was there either a Battel, or an Army, or a Prince; whereas, at this time, he, for them they fought, ſhould be a Witneſs of their Valour, whoſe great Victories at</hi> Calais, Hulſt, <hi>and</hi> Amiens, <hi>they ſhould call to Mind, and each of them take Example from his Valour, Conſtancy, and Industry.</hi>

               <p>Theſe were the general <hi>Exhortations</hi> uſed by the Nobles to all; but to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> they were more particular, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating to them many famous Acts, both of antient and later Times; inciting them, by the Honour of their Anceſtors, who were not content with <hi>European Victories,</hi> but proceeded in their Conqueſts to unknown Worlds, and made another part of Nature by their Arms, whereby their Empire might become immenſe and boundleſs, by their Duty to their <hi>King,</hi> whom they ſhould believe preſent in perſon with all his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to atteſt their Deeds, and deſire them not to relinquiſh his Siſter, nor his Kinſman poor and contemptible; but that they ſhould go on cheerful, and fill'd with hopes; that it might be made manifeſt, that there wanted not Courage, but Enemies, which had cauſed the protracting of ſo long a War, againſt one ſingle Province.

Nor are they at this time, brought ready to fight by any thing more than an over-heady raſhneſs, which being once ſpent, and repreſſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually languiſheth, till at laſt, it becomes nothing: Have we not found the very people, in the ambiguity of Affairs, wavering, in adverſity fearful, and in proſperity neither to be kept in awe by Law or Juſtice. Wherefore now, let us revenge our ſelves, if not for revenge ſake, yet becauſe there is a neceſſity that exacts it; On this hand is the Ocean, whoſe Waves are mercileſs, and will ſpare none: On the other, ſtands the Enemy, breathing forth cruelty and perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs; and therefore you muſt either overcome that Foe, or reſolve to periſh: Laſtly, coming to the <hi>Frizons</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> he exhorted them to remember the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> which had been built and cemented with the blood of their Fathers and Kinred, and of late increaſed by ſo many great Victories: And as the proud domineering of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was obvious to their Eys; how much more intolerable would the ſlavery be to them, when conquered, than of old, when they were yet unbridled. The Conteſt was not at this time for their own; or their Anceſtors glory (though there may be a Reaſon why valiant men ſhould ſet a light eſteem thereon) but for ſafety; nay what was to be preferred before ſafety or liberty; for now they fought for their Wives, their Parents, their Children, their Country,

their All; For at this time, were all theſe to be vindicated Having thus ſpoken to the Souldiers on every part, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately prepared to begin the Battel; and to that purpoſe, commanded two of his ſix Cannon to be carryed and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a hilly Ground, which the Seamen, a People uſed to labour, preſently with great force applying themſelves to, brought to paſs, notwithſtanding their great weight, the troubleſomneſs of the Sea, and ſteepneſs Of the Cliff, lay for a platform under them Hurdles and Planks: No leſs haſt, did the Enemy make to bring his Cannon which were eight in number, and to plant them upon the ſhore: which done, at the Thunder of their diſcharge on both ſides, the Waves of the Sea danced, and the Neighbour-ſhore trembled with the horrour of the noyſe; The Bullets, which could fall in no empty place, glutted themſelves with a plentiful ſlaughter; yet Prince <hi>Maurices</hi> Men ſuffered the leaſt loſs for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Artillery ſtood upon plain ground, and had little bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by their Carriages: The <hi>Holland Fleet</hi> alſo offended the Enemy with their ſhot from the Sea, which when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the ſhore now growing narrower, becauſe the Tyde of Flood came in, he drew his Battel more inwards towards the Downs; all the whole Coaſt and Fields, are full of little Sandhills, for a long ſpace of Ground, which make the place uneven; to which part, the heat of the Fight was transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which for a great while, continued bloody and dubious, as either the advantage, or diſadvantage of the place, helped or hindered; but afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Captains on both ſides opened their Battels as much as the ground would give leave: the Vallies and tops of the Hills, were poſſeſſed by the Infantery, in the plainer part of the ground, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more diſtant, was the Cavallery ranged: But <hi>Albertus</hi> that he might extend his Forces, the middle Battel being commanded to march forward, what before was the Van-Guard, became now the Right Wing, and the Rere-ward the left-Wing; For putting his greateſt confidence chiefly in

the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and next them the <hi>Italians,</hi> hoped the Enemy would not be able to ſuſtain the Force of that double Band; But the Prince oppoſed againſt the Enemy towards the Sea, Sir <hi>Frances V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Horſe killed under him, and was mounted on another; and upon the Arrivall of his Brother, Sir <hi>Horace Vere</hi> with freſh Forces, magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly brought his men ſafe off. At this time, the Enemies Horſe (which had been placed as Wings for ſtrengthning the Foot) violently falling into the Flank of the <hi>Stateſmen,</hi> made a great ſlaughter: whereby it happened, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> Courages were encreaſed, and the <hi>Naſſavians</hi> began to faint; upon which ſight, the Enemy falling on more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, ſuddenly a Panick fear and flight, ſurpriſed all on that part of the Army, with ſo inconſiderate trepidation, that many of them for fear of the Enemies Sword, ran into the Sea, and there met a ſhameful and certain death; But the conſtancy of the reſt, and the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelf, who was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of all things, quickly reſtored that want of Courage. The <hi>French</hi> came in opportunely, to ſupply thoſe that were in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; and for the better doing thereof, were divided into two Bands, by the care of the Count <hi>Solmes,</hi> and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>Ommerville</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi> And theſe falling on at firſt at the puſh of Pike, had good ſucceſs by the help of the Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, who ſtanding in the higher places, powred their Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets unceſſantly upon the Enemies Pikes ſtanding below,
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:55798:348"/>
which wounded and galled them infinitely. And when an intire Body of <hi>Netherlanders</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Souldiers</hi> advanced againſt them, Count <hi>Solmes</hi> commanded the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> of <hi>Fort-Andrew,</hi> to give on upon them, which they did with great Courage, and while they were in the heat of Fight, he ſent both the <hi>Batavian Regiments,</hi> to wit, one of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> the other of <hi>Holland,</hi> to their aſſiſtance, and laſt of all, the <hi>Germane</hi> Souldiers put themſelves into the Fight. For Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> thought it convenient to aſſault the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with ſhot, and to renew the Fight in as many places as they could, ſo as they that were tyred in the Fight, might have time and place to retreat, and freſh men ſtill come to ſupply their places, and this very thing broke the Enemies ſtrength, and made the other not to be Conquered; for there was room reſerved for recruiting the Forces in Fight, ſo that the Enemy ſtill encountred with freſh men, as often as he offered, unwarily to purſue any that fled; But among the Hills, there was one continued Fight, eſpecially where they grew leſs; and alſo beyond, by intervals, the Fight was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed: When the Foot met at firſt, <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> with ſix Troops, which were followed by three others, fell in, and routed the Enemies Horſe: At which time, one Gentleman, who Commanded the <hi>Princes</hi> Guards, perſuing thoſe that were routed, had paſſed all the Enemies Forces; And three other Horſe Commanders, led their Troops againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards:</hi> Nor did Count <hi>Lewis,</hi> who was diligent to lay hold upon all occaſions to get advantage, neglect to take ſix Troops of Cuiraſſiers, and with them, to charge the Enemy afreſh.</p>

that imminent danger. In the mean time, they who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly gone out of the Battel, to be refreſhed and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, came in again, and began the Fight anew, whoſe both appearance and Fortune, (the Battel being in many places) was various and different. Sir <hi>Horace Vere</hi> in the Playn, at the end of the Hills, with ſix Companies fighting the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and others in other places, as every one found, or could get an advantage; ſo that it ſeemed, as if the Fight had been every where ſcattered, and as freſh Forces, or a new Enemy, met on either ſide; ſo did the Victory as yet continue uncertain, now inclining to one party, anon to the other.</p>
               <p>But among the Horſe, the quarrel was ſooner deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it eaſily appearing, that the <hi>Mauritians</hi> would be Victors, even from the Courage of the Commanders, for the Enemies beſt Souldiers were abſent, as <hi>Contrera</hi> in <hi>Spain, Landriano</hi> by reaſon of ſickneſs; And now the <hi>Spaniſh Lancters,</hi> turning head, ſled to <hi>Newport,</hi> the <hi>Naſſavians</hi> purſuing them in the Rear: yet for all this, the Foot kept their ground, and fought ſucceſsfully enough, even among the little Hills, from whoſe tops they beat the Princes Men, coming even to their Cannon, which were placed upon a little Hill not far off, as is before related: Three hours did the <hi>Battell</hi> continue with equall Courage on both ſides, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all which time, there was nothing ſeen but death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the moſt hideous ſhapes of horrour, great effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood, and both near at hand, and far off, nothing but terrible ſpectacles of horrour and dying: And then at length, the fury began to abate; and becauſe at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Fight, moſt of the Souldiery was fighting, through extremity of labours their Bodies began to grow faint, onely the <hi>PRINCE</hi> infuſed Courage into his men, from the hopes of Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="682" facs="tcp:55798:349"/>Here he buſied himſelf in rallying ſuch as were out of order there, as often as any Enemy appeared to be made ready, freſh Bands to encounter him; and in another place, he was not wanting to incite all, undantedly to go through the reſidue of the fight. At laſt, towards evening, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to conclude the Battel with the Horſe, in that part of his Army being irreſiſtable: to this purpoſe, he ſent two Troops, to ſtand upon the Sea-ſhore, near the great Guns; one of theſe belonging to Sir <hi>Frances Vere,</hi> the other to Captain <hi>Bale:</hi> Theſe he directed to charge the Enemy, nor did his hopes fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the great Guns thundered upon them with that fury, that they were forced to retreat, with a great ſlaughter both of Horſes and Men; yet fetching a compaſs about the next Hills, and running further, returned to the Sea-ſhore, until the <hi>Mauritians</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the <hi>Artillery</hi> with great fury again, powred ſhot upon them as they advanced. By which means, the Enemies Horſe being utterly beaten off, preſently the Foot-Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſet upon, and rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On the other ſide, the unwearied Valour and Vertue of the <hi>Prince,</hi> his preſent Counſel; yea and his very counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, made his Souldiers <hi>Conquerours,</hi> while he would not ſuffer them to be overcome: which when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſaw, who fought in the middle Battel, although they were yet equall, or rather more ſtrong than the other, being terrified with the fortune of heir friends, ſtood very tremblingly: nor were they wearied out onely with the common troubles of a Fight; but by the provident care of Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> had more than they could bear. Their eagerneſs of ſpirit; by the abating of Courage, being wholly eaten up by fear. For the Sun which was oppoſite to their faces, was made uſe of
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:55798:349"/>
to blind them; ſo was the Wind, which was higher than ordinary in Summer, to drive into their faces, the ſmoak and the Sand: 'tis true, they endeavoured to have gotten that benefit of the Heavens to themſelves; but Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> being every where ready to prevent them, hindered their deſign, and by this means alſo, their Guns were uſeleſs to them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mauritians</hi> during the time of the Battel, had ſo beſtirred themſelves, and loſt ſo little time, that each of them had made thirty ſhots; and they which were at the Planked battery, did as much harm as thoſe that were upon the firm ground: The Enemy had not the ſame advantage, and their Cannon being neither raiſed nor well planted, by their own weight and force were fixed, until at laſt the Sands giving way, they were removed. Beſides Counſel and Policy, Fortune alſo aſſiſted the <hi>Naſſavians,</hi> the Enemies Powder being blown up, wherewith they ſhould have charged their Guns: And Victory being cryed out, though before the time, yet was a good Omen to foretell a true one.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Duke <hi>Albertus,</hi> while any hope remained, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through the whole Army, was reported to advance with thoſe of <hi>Dieſt,</hi> againſt the Enemy, with his Face uncovered, that ſo his example might be the more famed; in which action, 'tis ſaid, that his Ear was ſtruck by the top of a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Souldiers Lance: There was one who had laid hold of his Horſe Bridle; but was immediately killed by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent fidelity of thoſe that guarded his Perſon. At length, doubting the Fortune of the Field, he departed out of the Battel: It is believed he might have been taken, if the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers at <hi>Ostend</hi> had ſallyed out upon them as they fled; or they which were ſent to <hi>Leffingen-Bridge,</hi> had durſt to have remained there; but part of them being ſuch as eſcaped the mornings ſlaughter, being mindful of what was paſt, and dreading what might happen in the future, were timorous; but the Horſe, whereupon the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> rid, being eminent
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:55798:350"/>
for his Color, (but changed, for that he was tyred) became afterwards a Prey.</p>
               <p>The General being fled, they which till now had fought with equal Valour, betook themſelves to their Heels, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Backs to be harryed by their Perſuers, till by little and little all had left the Field, but Four Thouſand <hi>Germans,</hi> who keeping their Orders, fairly Retreated with Honour: Nor did the Victors delay to follow their flying Enemies, as they were ſcatter'd over the Mariſhy and unpaſſable parts of the Country.</p>
               <p>But the Prince, after Thanks given to God, the greateſt part of the Day being ſpent, he withdrew ſome choice Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments and Troops from the <hi>Battel,</hi> to be a Safeguard and Reſerve againſt any ſuddain Chances of War; which done, in the very place of the Fight, with the chief of the Captive Lords, he took his Supper and Repoſe that Night, as the ſole Support of the Victory.</p>
               <p>All round about were ſcatter'd Arms, and diſmembred Limbs, both the Hills and Valleys were cover'd with bloud, and the place a Receptacle of Dead Bodies: Some found fault, that while the Victory was yet warm, they did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently proſecute the Reliques of the Enemy.

Authority, to object the Prince's Anger, and ſome Speeches of the Vulgar; as if they, being valiant enough among ſafe Counſels, had, for their own ſakes, onely engaged ſo many Armed Men, and the Prince himſelf in ſo great Dangers.</p>
               <p>The three firſt days, after the Fight, were ſpent in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating concerning Things of greateſt moment on both Sides, while the Prince adviſes part of his men to go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> that ſo a Paſſage might be opened into the very Heart of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and other parts, to return to the Siege of <hi>Newport.</hi> Now began the Weather to grow Turbulent, both with great Winds and Rain, which cauſed a procraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Delay in the Tranſacting of many Affairs; beſides, the Souldiers began to be refractory to Command, either grown timorous, by the Review of the great Dangers they had lately paſſed through, or elſe embolden'd by Victory; for they quarrel'd, and ſometimes fought about the Priſoners, whom ſome, out of Reſpect to the Law of Arms, or that they might not loſe their Ranſome, endeavour'd to preſerve: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially the <hi>Scots,</hi> offended for the loſs of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, or pretending the like Wickedneſs from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in ſome Caſes, without any Reſpect to their Officers commanding the contrary, openly ſlew them.

to <hi>Newport,</hi> whither afterwards Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> came, but could not perfect his Siege, by reaſon of the unſeaſonableneſs of the Weather. At which time, firſt five hundred, then two thouſand men, conducted by <hi>Barlotte,</hi> got into the Town; by which means, they were ſo well able to defend their Walls, that they could make frequent Sallies, and many times ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully enough. Which Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> perceiving, the Twelfth Day after he came thither, he led away his Army, and, with like difficulty, attempted to beſiege one of the Forts about <hi>Oſtend,</hi> ſcituate among the Meadows, and call'd by the Name of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Hither alſo <hi>Claudius Barlotte</hi> came, and did his beſt and laſt Endeavour, being there ſlain with a Bullet, He was a Man of a noble Courage, a <hi>Lorrainer</hi> by Birth, and skill'd in the Art of <hi>Chyrurgery,</hi> by which he got his Living; but afterwards, by ſome unworthy Act, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Count <hi>Mansfeldt,</hi> whoſe Wife he was ſaid to have attempted: But ariſing to Honour, he ſo behaved himſelf, that he was eſteem'd worthy of greater Honour every Day; by which means, his Death was much lamented by his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and as much rejoyced at by thoſe who envyed his new and upſtart Riſing.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> being out of all hope of making War in <hi>Flanders,</hi> by reaſon of the difficulty of the places, and the recruited ſtrength of the Enemy, at length hoyſted Sayl to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> carrying no other benefit with him of his hard-gained Victory, beſides the Glory thereof: Before his departure, he commanded Fort <hi>Albertus</hi> to be demoliſh'd, but the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my quickly repaired it. And as the <hi>Fleet</hi> went away, the Weather, by chance, being Calm, <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Ships ventur'd to ſet upon ſome ſtraglers thereof, as they lagged behind: But the Winds on a ſuddain riſing, they could ſcarce get ſafe away with all their Oars, the <hi>Fleet</hi> purſuing them, until they were hindred by the Shallows: Some <hi>Attempts</hi> of Count <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Naſsaw</hi> into <hi>Brabant,</hi> about this time, came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:

The reſt of the Year, being almoſt the half thereof, was ſpent in quiet, as if equally divided between theſe two great Enemies; the one, contenting himſelf in the happy Event of his ſucceſsful <hi>Battel;</hi> the other, in the deſerved Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſaving <hi>Flanders</hi> from Ruine.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Flanders</hi> was thus involved in War, an Aſſembly of the <hi>States</hi> was ſummon'd at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> according to the old Cuſtom, but of late omitted; being perſwaded hereto, becauſe they underſtood the Diſpoſition of the <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> and he was adviſed alſo, to put on a moderate Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and to uſe perſwaſive Language; and, under pretence of asking Counſel, to require Money.

But the</hi> Archdukes <hi>are bound to the</hi> Spaniard <hi>by Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſhonourable to the repute and fame of the</hi> Netherlands. <hi>And the</hi> Brabanters, Flandrians, <hi>and other States are in like manner obliged to them; of what validity therefore will any Agreement be that is made with them, who live under Lords, commanded by Castles, and kept in awe by Souldiers, ſo that they are not Masters of themſelves.</hi> The <hi>Archdukes</hi> people an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>That they came to Treat of Peace, not to make a defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor would it be just that themſelves ſhould lay aſide their Arms, while others keep armed; but whatever was agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the</hi> States, <hi>the Princes would ratify.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things being heard and ſpoken by the Arch-dukes people, and imagining that they muſt utterly throw away all hopes of Peace with the <hi>Hollander</hi> ſo late a Conquerour, fall to examine, the Charge of the War, and after a long debate what every Province ſhould pay, becauſe the old form ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the <hi>French</hi> Wars, by reaſon the Forces of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces were altered, and Arms inferred on other places, could not be obſerved; at laſt they agreed to lay certain Taxes upon all Chimneyes and other things, and thereupon promiſed, thirty thouſand Florens Monethly for the next year, but it continued for the future. That every of the Garriſons ſhould pay their own Souldiers, and that no Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen ſhould be compelled after that to give any Souldier a gratuity: That part of the Forces ſhould be commanded, and part of the places governed by <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> and that the Treaſury ſhould be ordered by the States; part of which the Archduke denyed abſolutely, other part he never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, though he gave hopes thereof by promiſe. Many alſo were much offended at certain Letters brought by <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico Guſman</hi> out of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein the King called theſe

The ſame endeavoured to make an inquiry in the Merchants Accounts, if there had been any dealing with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> (for this is uſual in <hi>Spain</hi>) or if any money could be ſpared from the <hi>India</hi> Companies, but by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> this project came to nothing.

And the <hi>Dunkerkers</hi> being exaſperated with the puniſhment of many of their complices, added their own malicious fury to this command of the Archduke. And therefore they puniſhed this ſimple ſort of men (for ſuch generally is the Religion of Fiſhermen, that they think it very unjuſt to repel force by force), ſometimes by burning, other times boring ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> brought out againſt them a conſiderable ſtrength, divers of theſe Pirats were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and expiated their inhumane Villanies with their heads, and the reſt were glad to retire into their old dens and lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king holes. Their Chieftain himſelf, named <hi>Wakeney,</hi> with ſome Ships eſcaped his purſuing Enemy through the Narrow Seas by <hi>Bulloin,</hi> and got to <hi>Biſcay</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and afterwards having committed ſeveral Pyracies upon the Coaſt of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> at length hated by the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> and the greateſt part of his Seamen conſumed with want, himſelf dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miſerably. Againſt <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Galleyes, that they might be able to fight them in any weather, at <hi>Dort</hi> was built a great Ship (ſuch as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had none before) and was

furniſhed both with Men and Guns: the firſt men put into it were hired with wages, afterwards Malefactors were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to row therein, becauſe Chriſtian piety would not ſuffer ſuch as were Priſoners of War to be put to that ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. And the device very happily ſucceeded, for that alone being put to Sea, made many of the Enemies fly, carrying only with it a ſmaller boat. And in a ſhort time, ſo great was their confidence, that adding only a few Cockboats, and chooſing a peculiar night, the <hi>Holland</hi> Galleyes ſilently row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the <hi>Schelde,</hi> between the Forts of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> whence paſſing to the very walls of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> at firſt unawares they took a ſhip with three tyre of Guns, and ſeven leſſer Veſſels, and afterwards by force and ſlaughter of the Defendants, carryed them away. The City raiſed with the outery, and running to the Walls, looked upon their own loſs, and to their high diſgrace, ſuffered it to be carryed away unrevenged, for the Conquerors went away ſafe, and loaden with ſpoil, after they had founded a well known tune in praiſe of <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> not without ſome affection of the Citizens, remembring former occurrences.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of this year, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were filled with the hopes of a <hi>French</hi> War to be made by King <hi>Henry</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who being allyed to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as having Children by his Siſter to whom he was marryed, was believed would undertake nothing without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. The cauſe of the quarrel was the Marquiſate of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzza,</hi> which the <hi>Savoyard</hi> had taken from <hi>France</hi> while it languiſhed under inteſtine troubles. And the Pope, who by the Peace of <hi>Verbin</hi> was appointed Arbiter in theſe and like caſes, undertook the hearing of the buſineſs, but delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Judgment, untill the <hi>Savoyard</hi> at the inſtance of the <hi>French</hi> King came perſonally to <hi>Paris,</hi> and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand bribed the chief Miniſters of State, appeaſed him alſo with fair promiſes and obſequiouſneſs; but the non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:55798:354"/>
at the day appointed, made <hi>Henry</hi> proclaim War, and by force to aſſault ſeveral Cities and Caſtles of <hi>Savoy.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Fontaine</hi> (who had ſometime ruled in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and then governed <hi>Millain</hi>) gathering very great Forces, wherewith all the people round about ſuſpected the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would make War in <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe alſo from hence ſometimes deſigns were laid againſt ſeveral <hi>Venetian</hi> Caſtles, otherwhile new plots were diſcovered upon ſome Cities of <hi>Low Germany.</hi> But a ſudden peace put a ſtop to all the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi> troubles, it being agreed.

               <p>And now King <hi>Henry,</hi> that after Peace abroad, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions in Religion ſetled at home, and ordered by good Laws, he might eſtabliſh his Kingdome in a right Heir, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that the Pope would ſuffer him to be Divorced from <hi>Margaret Valois,</hi> long ſince diſaffected by him, having been of no good fame; and beſides that, for many years barren: which was ſoon granted, and he Marryed to <hi>Mary</hi> the daughter of <hi>Francis</hi> late Prince of <hi>Etruria,</hi> a Lady of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition, and which by her more mild temper ſhould purge out of <hi>France</hi> all envy againſt the Name of <hi>Melices.</hi> And the ſame Prince confirmed a League of Amity with <hi>England</hi> by new Conditions, wherein was concluded, <hi>That the boldneſe of Pyrats ſhould be reſtrained by ſevere Judgments and Pledges.</hi>

Some old Ships alſo were ſent to <hi>Dunkirk</hi> Haven, where being full of ſtones, they were ſunk, on purpoſe to choak it up: But as oft as the Sea ebbed, the wood being cut away with Axes by the Townſ-men, at the flood by the violent beating of the Waves, the place was again cleared of all.

<pb n="697" facs="tcp:55798:356"/>
of a Marriage between Count <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and Count <hi>Broakens</hi> Widow, himſelf came to <hi>Arnheym,</hi> and then making no delay, he ſpeeded to <hi>Bercke</hi> with above a hundred Companies of Foot, and Thirty Troops of Horſe, of which Place <hi>Jeronimo Lopez</hi> had the Government by the Arch-Duke's Commiſſion: wherein were of <hi>Walloons, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Mariners,</hi> almoſt to the number of Three Thouſand Men, ſufficient Proviſions, Six and Thirty great Guns, and the Works well augmented, over what they were, when <hi>Mendoſa,</hi> aſſiſted by the Plague, had taken the Town. And while Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> with his wonted Prudence fortified himſelf againſt Force from abroad, <hi>Lewis Bernardo Avila,</hi> not ignorant otherwiſe, but grown more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert by late practice at <hi>Bommell,</hi> raiſed a Work without the Trench, and comprehended therein a place for Paſture to feed Cattel, becauſe Salt was wanting for the preſerving and powdering of Fleſh, beſides, he ſpoyled his own Ships leſt the Enemy ſhould get them: But the Prince diſpoſed the Fleet which he brought, partly in the <hi>Rhine</hi> as far as <hi>Colen,</hi> and part of them he kept near himſelf, The Iſland, which lay near the Town in the River, being ſtrengthened with a mean Fort, yet quitted at the firſt battery, was ſtrengthened with more Works, and joyned by Bridges to both Banks: Then appointing ſeveral Quatters or Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers, in every place where there was any likelihood of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, pitched his Camp in three parts, one of which himſelf was reſident in, being ſcituate in the higher places next the Town: The Charge of the ſuperiour Bank he committed to Count <hi>Erneſt</hi> of <hi>Naſsau:</hi> And the middle Camp to Colonel <hi>Giſtell:</hi> Commanding in two places Trenches to be made againſt the prominent Works without the Town, with ſtrong Guards all about, becauſe the Works were often hindred by Sallyes. The firſt of which was of about a Thouſand or more Men, by the way that leads to <hi>Caſsells,</hi> this brunt was

ſuſteined and repelled by the <hi>French,</hi> whoſe Commander in Chief, <hi>Caſtilion,</hi> a young man, vali<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="2 letters">

               <p>While theſe things were doings, News was brought, That <hi>Albertus</hi> had beſieged <hi>Oſtend,</hi> which drove the <hi>States</hi> into no ſmall difficulty: for it was diſhonourable to leave the undertaking they had begun; and on the other ſide to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Works againſt ſo ſtrong a Garriſon as was within the Town, and to keep the Paſſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="699" facs="tcp:55798:357"/>
ready, entred the ruines and poſſeſſed the place, though the Enemy not long after valiantly aſſaulted them. In ſhort, all the reſt of the Works being by the like art or force taken, and part by fear deſerted, they preſently and directly by means of Galleries, got beyond the Trench under the very Bull-work of the Town, which the beſieged fearing, and becauſe they wanted Chyrurgions to dreſs many of their wounded men, they came to conditions, and that the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they might article for the ſafety and honourable marching away as well of the Renegado's, whereof many were in the Town, as the reſt: This acceſſion was at firſt very acceptable to the people of <hi>Over-Iſsell,</hi> who preſently refuſed to pay Tribute, which for fear of plunder they had hitherto done, the very Boors being commanded to go to Arms and run to their Colours. This Siege was begun in the middle of <hi>June,</hi> and finiſhed towards the end of <hi>July,</hi> when at the ſame time <hi>Oſtend</hi> had been begirt by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Five and Twenty dayes: But before the Prince would come from thoſe parts with his whole Army, he reduced <hi>Moers,</hi> a Town, as we have ſaid, given to him into his own power, the weak Garriſon being ejected, which the Duke of <hi>Cleves</hi> had put therein, clayming the ſaid dominion in Fee, as returning unto him by the death of the right Heir. But he was accuſed on the other hand, by Patronizing many Wickedneſſes, to have violated the Laws.</p>

                  <hi>Oſtend,</hi> (whoſe Siege for many Ages will be famous, and which I ſhall Commemorate as a peculiar Warr) is a choſen Seat for Fiſher-men, and ſcituate between <hi>Scluys</hi> and <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> but poſſeſſing a ſmall tract of Land on the Sea-Coaſt of <hi>Flanders;</hi> yet begun to be ſtrengthened with a Port and Palizadoes, ſo that at the very beginning of the Civil War, it became an habitation for Pyrats, who had filled all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with great fear of them. And afterwards when the
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:55798:358"/>
                  <hi>States</hi> Wealth began to increaſe, by the <hi>Peace</hi> made at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> this Town joyn'd it ſelf to the <hi>League,</hi> to which it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly adhered ever ſince: But ſoon after, the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> having taken <hi>Newport</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> was diſappointed here of the <hi>Terrible Siege</hi> he threatned; and afterwards <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi> having gotten into the Town, but beat out again, not onely added to their Fame, but increaſed their Care of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying themſelves, which was augmented, for that <hi>Scluys</hi> was loſt, and nothing more remained on all the Coaſt of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> beſides <hi>Oſtend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Front of the Town looking towards the <hi>North,</hi> was waſhed by the open Sea: On the left hand, which is towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> runs the River <hi>Iperlede</hi> into the Sea, which makes the Port or Haven, which is ſuch (as the reſt of <hi>Flanders</hi>) not able to receive any Ships but at the Tide of Flood: Now they have, by great Labour, cut off the River, yet the Haven remains intire: The <hi>Eaſt</hi> part of the Town is full of Sand-Hills, and uneven; but of later time made much more even, leaſt thoſe Neighbouring Heighths ſhould advantage the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Thus all things being removed, that might hinder or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie them, and the Sea, of its own accord, making a great Eſtuary of an hundred Foot wide, in the Plain next to the Walls, whoſe deepneſs was daily increaſed, by the Receſs of the Sands, which, at the coming in of the Tide, was a vaſt Lake; but, when the Water was at loweſt, it exceeded two Pikes length in deepneſs, and being ſomewhat more Forda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the very Entrance, and beginning thereof: All the Ground that lyes backward towards the <hi>South,</hi> being full of Ditches is ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, were reduced
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:55798:358"/>
into as much perfection, as the Nature of the place would bear; which Refinement began, when <hi>Albertus,</hi> returning <hi>Conquerour</hi> from <hi>Calais,</hi> and <hi>Hulst</hi> threatned a Siege here, which had been deferred till this time. That which is call'd the Old Town, was now nothing, but a great Abyſs of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and empty Ground, looking towards the Sea; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Line of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> they had filled the Sea-ſhore with five convenient Forts: From hence began a Trench com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the New Town, into which the Water could be let in or out at pleaſure by Sluces: This place was divided with two Walls, the inner of which had Eight Bulwarks, to which the outer anſwer'd with as many: Where the Stream paſſed by, there was a more flight Work; but at the Back thereof a ſtrong Rampire, and, as it were, a Threefold Line, with a New Trench intervening.</p>
               <p>This is the Circuit of the Towns, of about half an hours Journey: Beyond, were ſeveral diſtinct and ſeparable Forts, and which, if Neceſſity requir'd, could be deſerted without damage or prejudice to the Town: One compaſſed about with Palizadoes, beyond the Eſtuary, at the end of the right ſide; and others in the Fields, cloſe to the backſide of the Walls; or elſe not far divided from them, by the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Marſhes and Lakes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Flandrians</hi> growing weary of the Excurſions of this Town whereby the whole Country was waſted; and finding by Experience, that the Charges of Seventeen Forts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Oſtend</hi> was then incloſed, would be without end; that the Licentiouſneſs of the Souldiers waxed more grievous, and almoſt equal to the damage received by the Enemy; and of late a new Mutiny bringing their Fidelity in queſtion, urged the Arch-Duke, <hi>That he would no longer ſuffer this moſt excellent Province of all his Dominion to be made unprofitable by one ſmall part thereof:</hi> Although there wanted not ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaders, who, from the ſtrong Fortifications about the Town,
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:55798:359"/>
and the Sea being always open to it, ſaid, it would not be a Siege, but an unprofitable and long abode of the Army in one place. But Hope overcame all theſe Difficulties, which alſo was much advanced by the <hi>Flandrians</hi> Promiſes of large Sums of Money; and the Enemies Reſidence at <hi>Berck</hi> made the occaſion ſeem more fit to be embraced, eſpecially ſince new Forces were arrived both from <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> under the ſeveral Commands of Collonel <hi>Trivultio,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Braccamonte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, the fifth day of <hi>July, Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Herem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> ſate down on the right ſide of the Town, and ſoon after <hi>Jeronimo Montiregio</hi> on the Left, at firſt approaching very near; but the Cannon quickly commanded him to a greater diſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles Nott</hi> then had Charge of the Town, which was furniſh'd with ſufficient ſtore of Victuals, and other Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for War, beſides One and Twenty Companies of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; to whom, upon the firſt notice of the Siege, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another Regiment, ſent by Collonel <hi>Ucterebrook:</hi> And now the Garriſon quickly began to ſhew their Valour, in their firſt Salley ſlaying divers Noble-men, among whom <hi>Montiregio,</hi> and above five hundred Common Souldiers. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> came into the Town, not ſingly as Governour, but as General, with his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whoſe Number was augmented by new Supplies lately come out of <hi>England,</hi> forthwith it was ſeen, that he took care, with ſtrong Guards, to ſecure what ever was of any ſtrength without the Town, and alſo to extend his Works further out; one of which, for all that being ſcarce finiſh'd, the Enemy took, notwithſtanding it was defended by 40 men: But from the back-parts of the Town, the <hi>Beſiegers</hi> being Repulſed, with his greateſt Force came to the left ſide of the Town: In the places that were overflowed with Water, he raiſed a <hi>Battery</hi> by a new kind of means, the praiſe whereof is wholly
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:55798:359"/>
due to himſelf, though moſt of the other late Inventions were found out by the Devices and ingenuous Contrivances of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and it was this, They bound together Faggots Twenty Foot long, and little leſs in compaſs; wherein likewiſe were contained Planks and Boards, that they might the more firmly, by their Weight, prevail againſt the Waters; they were call'd Stuffing: Theſe, by little and little, moved forward, and, by the ſtrength and weight of Engines, preſſed down into the Old Haven, ſoon took away the uſe thereof, that no Ships could come in that way: But out of the Eſtuary or Gollet, which we ſaid flowed on another part, by digging a little on the Shore, a Channel was made, which preſently emptied it ſelf within the very Works, and afterwards became a better and more ſafe Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>This way there came in and out oftentime a hundred Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, to carry out wounded men, and to bring in Guns, Wood, Victuals, and whatever elſe was wanting, either to prevent the Injuries of the Weather, or the fear of Diſeaſes: Nor could the Enemies, though from the higher Ground, prevail any thing againſt it, their Shot being aimed thither at ſuch diſtance as made them uncertain; inſomuch, that becauſe of its freeneſs from danger, a great number of perſons came thither onely out of a deſire to ſee it, <hi>to wit;</hi> Of Forein Noble-men, the Duke of <hi>Holſatia,</hi> Brother to the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and, out of <hi>England,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who view'd, with admiration, the ſame place, famous for all the Politike Devices of War: Wherefore, the Enemy find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Terrour of his Cannon-Bullets to be of no force, left off ſhooting, and fell to throwing in Bags of Sands, and great Stones, to choke up the Gollet; but that Deſign alſo prov'd vain, the violence ſwiftneſs of the Waters being too preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="704" facs="tcp:55798:360"/>Now when they ſaw they had no hope of keeping out all kinds of Relief, Collonel <hi>Catrick,</hi> who lay on the <hi>Weſt</hi> part of the Town, making Approaches and Batteries with great Violence, aſſailed and ſhot at the Work on that ſide, of which there were three cloſe together, which were named the <hi>Porcupine, Helmont,</hi> and <hi>Sand-hill,</hi> formerly part of the Old Town, but now a great heap of Sand in ſeveral little Riſings; one whereof being more eminent then the reſt, had on the Top thereof two ſmall Forts, one joyning to another, beſides other Works round about, that thoſe weak parts of the Town, might, from thence, be the better defended. To this place were ſo many great Shot directed by the Enemy, that it ſeem'd wholly to be made of Iron, yet got they not any benefit thereby equal to that vaſt Expence; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was beat down, was eaſily repaired, and as ſoon as they were killed or wounded, freſh men were ſent into their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Among thoſe killed here by the Enemies Shot, was young <hi>Caſtilion,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Collonel, and Nephew to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Captain <hi>Coligny,</hi> from whoſe Vertue and Valour be no whit degenerated; General <hi>Vere</hi> himſelf was wounded, for the Care whereof he was forced to go out of the Town into <hi>Zeland,</hi> from whence, not long after, he returned ſafe and in health: Nor were the <hi>Beſiegers</hi> free from like hazards, for within a few days <hi>Catrick</hi> and <hi>Bracamont,</hi> both Collonels, were kill'd.</p>
               <p>In the Town, that the Bullets and Granadoes might be the leſs feared, the Ground was every where thrown up into thick Heaps like to Walls; and to hinder the Enemies aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting the Rampire towards the Sea was their chief Care, becauſe by their Approaches, they give cauſe to fear the ſame; therefore, the Bank that was builded for keeping out the Sea, was with ſome heſitation and danger thrown down, and the Event proved ſucceſsful againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whoſe Trenches, Huts, and Batteries, made of Oſyers, were drown'd
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:55798:360"/>
at a great diſtance, when the Winds made the Waters grow boyſterous and Raging, ſo that the Guards were forced to fly to the high Banks which they had raiſed thereabouts, for the bringing their Carriages.</p>
               <p>The Sea being thus let in, incompaſſed <hi>Oſtend</hi> like an Iſland, which ſometimes was a little offenſive to the Town, but with Palizado's, Stones, and other Ingenuity of that Maritime People, the greateſt force of the Waves was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Four Moneths were ſpent, wherein the <hi>Beſieged</hi> made ſucceſsful Sallies, and the <hi>Beſiegers</hi> many fruitleſs <hi>Attempts</hi> againſt the Walls: Some Souldiers alſo frequently running from one ſide to the other, and ſome priſoners taken fill'd both Parties full of vain Rumours: And within that time a Traytor was diſcover'd, who had promiſed the Enemy to blow up the Town Magazine of Gunpowder. The Arch-Duke <hi>Albertus</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> were many times Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of the ſlow progreſs of their Siege; both Officers and Souldiers, in the preſence of their Princes, ſhewing great Alacrity, ſome binding together more of thoſe long Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots and Planks, which they wrought into the Faſhion of Globes; and rolling theſe whither they liſted, conſolidated Moory places, and added new Works to thoſe before raiſed; others endeavour'd to connex and joyn together Works and Ways far diſtant each from other; and ſome began to dig a great Ditch, that all things might, with the more eaſe, be brought to them from <hi>Bruges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>United States,</hi> having loſt their Deſign of invading <hi>Flanders,</hi> after the taking of <hi>Berck,</hi> weary of ſuch vaſt Diſburſements, and chiefly minding <hi>Oſtend,</hi> paſſed over the <hi>Summer,</hi> and much of <hi>Autumn,</hi> doing nothing at all: But when they ſaw the Siege was like to be protracted, and that they did not ſo much fear the Danger of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> as the vaſt Charges they muſt needs be at in Defence of the ſame, they
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:55798:361"/>
propoſed, either to make the Enemy draw off thence, or if he would ſtay there, to fall upon thoſe parts of the Country that were unguarded.</p>
               <p>A long time it was diſputed, in what place they might probably get the eaſieſt Victory, and with the moſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them: At length, <hi>Shertogenboſh</hi> was Reſolved on, which ſince its Defection from the <hi>League,</hi> had never been attempted by open War: Neither was there, at this time, any greater Garriſon, than two Companies of Foot, and as many Troops of Horſe, which were all Commanded by <hi>Anthony Grobbendone,</hi> the City being always very ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, that they might not be ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> powred by the Souldiery: 'Tis true, the City were of a generous Reſolution, ſo were the Magiſtrates and Clergy, of whom there was no ſmall Number very zealouſly affected: Theſe, <hi>That their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Religion, Altars, Images, and beloved Saints, might not be forſaken, or contemtuouſly violated.</hi> Thoſe, <hi>Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heroicall Actions of their Anceſtors, whoſe Valour had ſo often driven the</hi> Geld<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ians <hi>from the Limits of</hi> Brabant: Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto, their own preſent Example: For every Night they ſet out Lights, and took Order by Edict, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Victuals ſhould in no manner be inhanced, and that all kind of Deaths ſhould be taken notice of by proper Marks, ſet forth at the door of the deceaſed. They Erected likewiſe a ſtrong Redoubt, for the ſafeguard of the <hi>Fuchten</hi> Gate.</p>
               <p>On this ſide, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> pitched his Tents; on the other, over againſt him, the Counts <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Erneſt</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw:</hi> On both ſides the Way, lying through low Fields, made the Paſſage very eaſie, for <hi>Pioneers</hi> to come to the Town.</p>
               <p>This Conveniency, and the Cities being no otherwiſe Fortifyed, or re-inforced, than ordinarily it was, gave hope of ſhort Work about it; when otherwiſe, the Moneth of
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:55798:361"/>
                  <hi>November,</hi> and approach of <hi>Winter,</hi> would have been enough to deter them from beginning ſuch an Enterpriſe; beſides, the number of the <hi>Beſiegers,</hi> were not ſufficient to environ the vaſt Content of that City, being onely 73 Companies of Foot, and about 30 Troops of Horſe, <hi>Oſtend</hi> requiring the beſt part of the Army.</p>
               <p>But they feared not any Sallies from the Enemy, who had enough to do to defend their own, being not uſed to ſuch bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and all the Plain round about being Marſhy, was ſhut up with Forts: They found alſo a Way to make the next Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Brooks overflow their Banks, by making Damms therein, the more fully to drown the adjacent Parts: But this was not ſo well done, but that the Souldiers for all that twice broke into the Town: And, at the Requeſt of the <hi>Braban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Heremberg,</hi> with ſome Foot, and a ſtrong party of Horſe, was ſent thither by <hi>Albertus,</hi> a Rumor being firſt ſpread over all the parts near, and all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, as if he intended to fortifie the Village of <hi>Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> by which means, he ſent into the Town at firſt almoſt Three Hundred, and ſoon after a Thouſand Men, the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers</hi> knowing nothing of it; and when they came to the knowledge thereof too late, they onely kill'd a few ſtraglers in the Rear. Great was the Care and Diligence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and People in the Town to prevent fire, which they greatly fear'd from the Red hot Bullets ſhot into it; for they ſtrowed the Floors with Sand, took away all Weapons from ſtrangers, and kept in readineſs all things that were fit to quench fire: And the more to encourage them, the Arch-Duke ſent and promiſed, <hi>That what Damage ſoever they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteined in their private Eſtates, ſhould be made good upon the Publike Account.</hi> In the interim, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> haſtned his Approaches, which being brought to the Trench under the Walls, there wanted onely Galleries, and the laſt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities uſed towards Cities.</p>

               <p>And firſt of all, for a tryal of his Forces, he commanded eight hundred choſen men by night, to aſſayl the Walls of the Town that lye towards the Sea-ſhore, which they vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly put in execution, burning up the Palizadoes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming all things of defence towards the Sea for a great ſpace. But the Tyde of Flood in a ſhort time beginning, cauſed them to depart, leaving behind them not a few of their own number, which had been either killed or wounded before by the ſhot; yet they reſolved, having received new Supplies into the Camp at once, with all their force to ſtorm the Town on both ſides, as well that part which looks back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the Fields, as that which abuts upon the Sea; as alſo the <hi>Porcupine</hi> and <hi>Sandhill,</hi> the Principal Forts in that part. Of which, General <hi>Vere</hi> having Intelligence by a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and fearing the ſmall number of his men, without any adviſe of his Officers, but led by his own ſingle Judgement, very few knowing thereof, made a ſhort Truce with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and ſeeming, as if he intended a Surrender, both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and gave Pledges.

               <p>In this interim, a proſperous Gale brought out of <hi>Zeland,</hi> five Companies of Men into the Town, when immediately, General <hi>Vere</hi> declared both to the <hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> and his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,</hi> that he had been driven by neceſſity, to deſire a <hi>Treaty;</hi> but now, in regard Supplies and Relief were come to him, he could proceed no further, without breach of his Oath; yet that he hoped, if he ſhould in the future, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extremity, by the <hi>Arch-Dukes</hi> Forces, the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of ſo great a <hi>Prince,</hi> would vouchſafe to hear him.</p>
               <p>This Affront, (for ſo was it looked upon) highly enraged the <hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> becauſe all <hi>Flanders</hi> were in a manner, come together, to ſee the delivery of the Town; yea, and the ſame of this <hi>Treaty,</hi> was flown into Foreign Kingdoms: Neither was this deceitful kind of Policy altogether excuſed by the <hi>States</hi> themſelves, who looked upon it as diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in it ſelf, and carrying with it more of danger, than neceſſary convenience.</p>

that there was a great breach made in the Works, the ninth of <hi>January</hi> in the Evening, at the ebbe of the Sea, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Town to be ſtormed on all parts; but eſpecially on that part. Two hundred Souldiers under two Captains, were ordered point blank to fall upon <hi>Sand-Hill;</hi> as many more upon the left ſide of the Bulwark, and the like number upon the Curtain running before it. Theſe were ſeconded by <hi>Durange,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colonel, with four hundred men more, whoſe directions were to put Garriſons of Men into all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as ſoon as they were taken, and to that purpoſe, they were furniſhed with Victuals and Gunpowder, and what other things are neceſſary either for the new erecting, or repairing of Fortifications.</p>

the Gun-powder was ſpoiled, which every Souldier carryed for his own uſe, but many by force of the waters were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away into the Sea, and there drowned; beſides, the Seconds not coming on according to order, they who were in the firſt Aſſault, were compelled to retreat, wherein they met with a twofold Death, the one from their Enemies Weapons, the other from the force of the Waters. And <hi>Bucquoy,</hi> putting what he was commanded to do, in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too late, performed leſs; for while he delayed the Tyde of Flood increaſed, whereby his way was precluded. The defences on the backſide of the Town, and other ſlight Works, General <hi>Vere</hi> took no great thought for, while the Enemy made this Aſſault, knowing that ſome threatning offers might be made on purpoſe onely to divide the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; for it would be of ſmall benefit to the Enemy, if he had them, in regard they could with caſe be retaken: which the event proved true.</p>
               <p>There lay ſcattered every where about the Rampires, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, and Trenches, the dead Bodies of Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, ſome nearer, ſome at more diſtance, as every mans Valour, or care had put him forward, or kept him behind; and many were carryed into the Sea, as is before related.</p>
               <p>Upon account the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> wanted near eight hundred men, for the taking up and burial of whoſe Bodies, a Truce was deſired for four hours, and granted: In the Town were near forty killed, but more wounded, among whom was the Generals Brother, Sir <hi>Horace Vere,</hi> while he excellently performed the duty, both of a good Leader and Souldier. Among the Bodies of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was found a Woman, who had diſſembled her Sex, both in courage and a military Habit, as if he ſhould have accuſed Nature, for not making Her a Man.</p>
               <p>The unhappy ſucceſs of this Storm, together with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of ſtarving <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and the terror of lying all Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a wet Camp, moved many of the Commanders to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade

By this time there were come to <hi>Albertus</hi> the moſt ingenious Engineers from all parts of the World, who all aimed, even with emulation, to choke up the <hi>Gollet;</hi> and when in the night ſome fixed a Cable with great Veſſels and Anchors under Water, from one Bank to the other; the Beſieged likewiſe another night would with little difficulty cut away all that fixed the ſame. About this time one <hi>Pompey Targon</hi> invented a frame of Wood like a Caſtle, which being placed in Ships, would carry Great Guns, but upon tryal it quickly appeared too weak to bear the concuſſion of the Waves, and that the ſands would yield to the weight that was underneath in the belly of the Foundation; by the ſame alſo were made a kind of Boats, by the joyning together of boards and bundles of ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Wood, which ſhould altogether be carryed by the Tyde, but by the ſhot of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Artillery, theſe were more

The beſieged likewiſe made proviſion, That if the Enemy ſhould hinder them of that entrance into the Town, which at preſent they enjoyed, to have a New Haven between the <hi>Gollet</hi> and the old Haven by the old Town: for the United States were mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with a deſire of Glory in defending that part of the Sea, making a Decree, as if they foreſaw the Siege would continue a long time, that every ſix moneths the Garriſon ſhould be relieved and changed, and accordingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> General <hi>Vere</hi> was ſent for out, and one <hi>Frederick Dorp</hi> made to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, by whom the ruines of the Town were repaired, the Fortifications augmented, and money continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to pay for the pains and labour therein taken: When <hi>Albertus</hi> his Souldiers could not get their pay, which bred the ſeeds of mutinies and ſedition, which is for the moſt part the Mother of diſobedience; the very Government it ſelf was full of fear, and hatred, the Horſe being appointed to drive on the Foot upon dangerous enterpriſes, or force them back when they took themſelves to flight, as if they had been bruits without the light of reaſon to direct them.

And the States did not think it fit to proceed judicially againſt a Priſoner, guarded by the Laws of War. But becauſe there was a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference made between the Ranſome of Commanders and Private Souldiers; after long debate, it was agreed, <hi>That whoſoever of the People belonging to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited States were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, either in the</hi> Netherlands, Spain, <hi>the</hi> Indies, America, <hi>or elſwhere under King</hi> Philips <hi>obedience, ſhould all be ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for</hi> Mendoſa; and either the Kings reſpect to <hi>Mendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> or future Generals, ſo prevailed with him, that he agreed to the ſaid Articles. And accordingly it was performed, for there returned from all parts of the World, both Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Marriners, whom the Enemies rage for hope of gain, or the Prieſts hatred for difference of Religion, had carryed and kept there, part of whom had their very joints eaten off with their Chains, and now with joy remembred the darkneſs and filth they were wont to endure, others grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledging their deliverance from the bitter ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Galleyes under moſt cruel Tyrants. And this was a matter of great moment, to incite the common people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by a freſh memory of their old inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and for winning their love to the Lords, whoſe clement and popular action was applauded with many exultations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they eſteemed the liberty of their Subjects before great ſums of Money which they might have had. Thus the Agreements being in part performed, and Pledges being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the reſt, <hi>Mendoſa</hi> was ſet free, ever after giving a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Character of the Commonwealth of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which he now came to know by a near converſe, and from thence forward, became a perſwader of Peace, rather then War to both parties. And from theſe more certain Rules

               <p>All this Spring the United States did ſpend in raiſing a greater Army then ever they had before, their Minds and Reſolutions being augmented with the memory of <hi>Newport</hi> Battel, and the new ſeditions of the Enemy, from whence they hoped, before the Souldiers expected out of <hi>Italy</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> either to renew their Glory by the ſlaughter of the Enemies, or by a Land March through <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to go to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and there raiſe the Siege. But Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> unmoved with all this noiſe, reſolutely affirmed, <hi>That it was ſafer to uſe wary and cautelous Counſells, then to run on in raſh and adventurous attempts.</hi> But the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi> approved the Opinion of the States, perſwading them to go on with greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, becauſe they aſſiſted them with men and money. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a great ſtrength of <hi>Germane</hi> Horſe was hired, and very well furniſhed, with other very great preparations: And in the Moneth of <hi>June,</hi> Publick Prayers being firſt made by command, though later then was neceſſary, the Expedition was begun, at the ſame time when the <hi>Italian</hi> Forces arrived at the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> borders. And Letters were ſent into divers places, as <hi>Artois, Brabant, Flanders,</hi> and the Deputies of other parts.</p>
               <p>The United States wrote magnificent things concerning their Affairs and Aſſiſtance by Forreign Princes; they ſpoke alſo of the Souldiers ſedition on the adverſe party, and of the waſting and ſpoiling of Cities, what was too much truth, and what reward had they for all theſe miſeries, but that which is the laſt and greateſt of all miſeries, Servitude? for it was not unknown, what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> formerly prepared, and that a falſe Pretence, or the bare Name of Archduke might no longer deceive any body, they ſhould ſee in whoſe hand was the Government of the State, and the publick
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:55798:368"/>
Power of Peace and War. If they deſired the Glory of their Anceſtors, or the Liberty of their Poſterity, they ſhould then joyn with them, or at leaſtwiſe aſſiſt their ſtrong endeavors by ſome moderate Levyes. Let the Archdukes go and ſeek more peaceable Kingdoms. That it was eaſy to drive out the few <hi>Spaniards</hi> that remained in Garriſon in ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and then they might put the State both Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, into what form they would, and that it would be no great pains and labour to attain to the chiefeſt felicities of Peace and Liberty: This was the effect of their Letters, which were quickly followed by Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> who divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Army into three parts, which he commanded to March three ſeveral wayes; the whole number whereof, was Five Thouſand Horſe, and Eighteen Thouſand Foot, and almoſt Two Thouſand Carriages; the middle <hi>Tertia</hi> was led by Count <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> That on the right hand by General <hi>Vere,</hi> and the laſt by Count <hi>Erneſt</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw;</hi> yet at no greater diſtance, then that they could eaſily meet and joyn upon occaſion, however thus divided, they could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with more eaſe and celerity. The whole rabble of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, and other inferiour people that attended the Army with Mills, Furnaces and other neceſſaries that were uſually ſent by Sea, now followed the Army by Land, with no ſmall difficulty.</p>
               <p>Paſſing the <hi>Maes</hi> at <hi>Nimmeghen,</hi> from thence the Army marched through the Countrey of <hi>Leige,</hi> by the place where <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Father, held his Camp with his Army, which was conquered by Famine, not the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Arms; which miſchief, becauſe he would avoid, by terrible threats he compelled the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Towns, which of their own accord were more inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to bring in Proviſions daily to the Army, and to ſell it at a reaſonable rate, and yet was ſcarcely Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals enough found, to give ſufficient to ſo great Forces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="719" facs="tcp:55798:368"/>The fifteenth day the whole army ſate down at <hi>Centron,</hi> a village in <hi>Leige,</hi> not far from <hi>Tielmont,</hi> where <hi>Mendoſa</hi> then lay: for the Arch-duke hearing of this preparation of the States had ſent him from <hi>Oſtend</hi> with forces, having left there <hi>Don John de Rivez</hi> to guard the Camp and fortify it round about. They that lay at <hi>Waert,</hi> laying aſide their ſedition for a while, were perſuaded to come to <hi>Mendoſa,</hi> and increaſe the number of his forces, ſo that now he had five thouſand foot and four thouſand horſe. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> Count <hi>Spinola</hi> was ſent to joyn with theſe, with eight thouſand <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> more, which he had new brought into the Country, in hope of winning honor, and to aſſiſt his brother's endeavours at Sea and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> affairs at land, with this ſelect band of men. For he covenanted with King <hi>Philip</hi> to be reimburſed his charges, and therefore at preſent he paid his men out of his own revenues; and although <hi>Mendoſa</hi> had the chief command as General, yet he directed and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his own men; and as he kept them from the want which the reſt ſuffered, ſo he would not give a licentious liberty, but kept them in a ſtrict diſcipline: by which means it came to paſs, that no ſouldiers ever behaved themſelves with more quietneſs and civility, yet ſeldome was there any ſeverity uſed towards them. By which example it was evident, that the ſtrength of military go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment conſiſted in money. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> lying near them, drew his ſouldiers out of the Camp, provoking and chalenging the Enemy to fight: But <hi>Mendoſa</hi> kept his men within their trenches, either becauſe he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal in ſtrength, or elſe broken by his captivity, he yet feared his unlucky fortune, and having once received a great blow, for the future it made him only fight by delay. Theſe by all means avoiding fight, and objecting to themſelves the danger and terror of a battel, made the
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:55798:369"/>
Prince perceive that all theſe glorious and great begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings would come to nothing; for it was not poſſible for them to goe into the inner parts of that Country with ſo great an army, through ſo many narrow paſſages, among all the Enemies towns, and where the Enemy himſelf was ready to attend them upon all occaſions: wherefore he thought meet the ſooner to make his retreat &amp; get to the rivers, and the rather, becauſe Victualls began to grow ſcarce, and the harveſt was not yet come; yet that the year might not paſs away ingloriouſly after ſuch great deſigns and oſtentations, turning his thoughts to things of leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he preſently ſate down before <hi>Grave,</hi> a town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the territories of <hi>Cuick,</hi> hard by the <hi>Maes,</hi> reaſonably well fortified, having therein a ſtrong garriſon &amp; all other things for the enduring of a ſiege. Hither being come the eighth day after a tedious march through the parching heat of the Sun, the Prince pitched his Camp in three ſeveral parts, where many of the new ſouldiers unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſuch toil and labour died. On the upper part of the river lay General <hi>Vere,</hi> on the lower himſelf, and on that part where the fields grow marſhy towards <hi>Brabant</hi> Count <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau.</hi> That done two bridges were built upon the river, one hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen foot long, and whatever was within the Camp, as alſo on the other ſide towards <hi>Gelderland,</hi> was incloſed with one continued breaſt-work, before which were very deep and broad trenches, for the clearing whereof ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral forts and ſconces were erected that were well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Cannon. The great Bulwark which the Townſmen held beyond the river being deſerted, as not tenable againſt ſo great force as was uſed about it, proved afterwards a great aſſiſtance to the beſiegers. In the interim <hi>Mendoſa,</hi> although the moſt active of his Colonels perſuaded him to purſue forthwith the Enemy
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:55798:369"/>
marching away, and to intercept him in his deſignes, fearing not onely his fortune, but the blame of any miſcarriage that ſhould happen, and beſides being needy as well of mony as of all things elſe almoſt, he had rather adviſe with the Arch-duke, in this notable juncture of time. But the Arch-duke returned no certain anſwer, onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing him to be carefull, left going too far with the army, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould ſuddenly with their Fleet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Flanders.</hi> From which direction <hi>Mendoſa</hi> fearing to recede, in all his motions depended upon the Enemies counſells: yet however, preparing in readineſs at <hi>Roer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> what he thought neceſſary, at length he alſo pitched his Camp near the <hi>Maes</hi> below <hi>Grave</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice.</hi> Many thought that he erred therein, for that he ought rather to have choſen the ſuperior part of the country which is called <hi>Raveſteyn,</hi> by which means he might have forced all his proviſions from the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and likewiſe have kept the like from coming thence to the Prince, becauſe he had lain in the Enemies country. But now his Camp being fixed, it was very dangerous to paſs by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> leaguer, and too late to goe round about, becauſe Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> being diligent about his work, had in many places made approches and galleries even to the Town-ditch, by the commoditie of the banks, which were placed on both ſides the river to guard the ſame, and yielded a ſecure and eaſy way to the Pioneers. Neither had the <hi>Spaniards</hi> any hope now, but to break through the open places, which were very large, between the Prince's and Count <hi>William</hi>'s Camps, and ſo to get into the Town. To this end ladders were prepared, together with ſhovells and mattocks, either for the more eaſy climbing up of works, or demoliſhing them, as occaſion ſhould preſent: theſe were conducted by Colonel <hi>Thomas Spine,</hi> being a thouſand choice foot, which were followed
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:55798:370"/>
by many others. But the Guards and Sentinells being very diligent and watchfull, although they ſet forward in the night, together with the breaking of the day, among the tedious paſſages of the mariſhes, made their attempt, how daring ſoever, vain. Whereupon <hi>Mendoſa,</hi> being aſhamed that he was thus beaten off from his hopes of relieving the Town, withdrew both himſelf and his army, that they might not helpleſſely look on and ſee the City taken, privately departing to <hi>Venlo.</hi> At this time the States taking care for <hi>Berck,</hi> ſent Count <hi>Erneſt</hi> thither with ſupplies. But <hi>Antonio Gonzales,</hi> Governor of <hi>Grave,</hi> with whom were in garriſon fifteen hundred men of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral nations, having in the ſight of their companions wearied the beſiegers with frequent fallies, would not yet deſiſt by many valorous experiments to protract the time to his advantage, although all hope of relief was utterly taken away. After a two months ſiege, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> drew near to the ſluces, which kept the water in the town-ditches, the <hi>Friſons</hi> alſo on another part bringing a gallery even into the trench, and ſome of the Princes Pioneers being ready to undermine the walls, after the loſſe almoſt of ſeven hundred men, the garriſon was ſurrendred upon honourable conditions, the ſouldiers marching thence with their armes and baggage. This town of <hi>Grave</hi> at firſt belonged to the Province of <hi>Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre,</hi> but was afterwards annexed to <hi>Brabant,</hi> and taken as a pledge by <hi>Maximilian</hi> Count <hi>Buren,</hi> whoſe ſon-in-law <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> bought it, and though loſt in war, by the peace made at <hi>Gaunt</hi> the Garriſon of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> being removed, had the ſame delivered to him. But about eighteen years before the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> having gotten it by the careleſneſs or cowardice of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> now regained and took poſſeſſion of this his Patrimonial inheritance, as he had done before
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:55798:370"/>
of <hi>Breda, Lingen</hi> and <hi>Moers,</hi> which he made ſubject not for his own advantage onely, but the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; by which means he obtained a great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion about the <hi>Maes,</hi> with very great advantages.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were doing, ſome ſouldiers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged becauſe they had but very little or no pay, leaving <hi>Mendoſa</hi>'s army, betake themſelves to <hi>Hamont.</hi> He, to prevent the increaſing of their number by impunity, haſtens thither a convenient ſtrength; where having taken ſome great guns, he forced a few foot-ſouldiers to ſurrender themſelves, but the horſe got away, not to be moved with prayers or threats; and having in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted other places, at laſt they ſeize the Caſtle of <hi>Hoch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraten</hi> by the conſent of the Garriſon, (this place is not far from <hi>Breda,</hi>) wherein a ſhort time being much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by a continual reſort of old ſouldiers, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired their arrears, and new ſouldiers, that expected no other thing then a licentious freedome in villany, chuſing themſelves a Head, they elect a Senate and ſettle a Councel-houſe with divers laws, expreſſing therein more care and diligence then is uſually found in the meetings and aſſemblies of ſetled Cities. They would not ſuffer any rapines or plunders to be committed, unleſs by publick order and for the common cauſe; and if any upon their own account durſt doe otherwiſe, they were puniſhed like thieves according to the laws and cuſtomes of other places. Wherewith the Arch-duke being highly diſpleaſed, and fearing the example becauſe of his want, gathering together what mony he could poſſibly get together by any means, he perſuaded thoſe who yet remained in their obedience, to puniſh the others rebellious perſidy, and to that end prepared to beſiege them. They perceiving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not to be looked upon as mutineers, (which in thoſe parts is no new thing) but as abſolute enemies,
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:55798:371"/>
begin to tread unuſual paths, deſiring and obtaining from the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Victualls, Armes and Artillery. And this they did the more willingly, becauſe theſe troubles of the Enemy were very advantagious, and to make theſe differ among themſelves, to a great expenſe of their treaſure, would ſecure them againſt the like evils. But this reſolution of <hi>Albertus</hi> was ſoon altered upon the arrival of the news that <hi>Grave</hi> was taken, for that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be afraid of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s army: yet for all this he would not hearken to the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> States, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time being called together concerning the raiſing of tributes, perſuaded him to appeaſe and win the offended Souldiery with money: But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Noblemen and Commanders diſliked thereof, averring it was more fit to take ſome new forces into pay, but to puniſh thoſe Rebells with all ſeverity. And ſo at laſt threatnings of actions being turned into words, an Edict was ſet forth, wherein all that were in <hi>Hochſtraten,</hi> unleſs they came in and deſired pardon by a certain day, were proſcribed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards promiſed to any that ſhould kill them, their goods confiſcated, all that furniſhed them with proviſion ſhould be puniſhed, and their wives and children baniſhed: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding above all the reſt of their crimes, that their Sedition had been the cauſe that <hi>Grave</hi> had not been relieved. But all this threatning ſerved to little purpoſe, for ſo much were they contemned, that they publiſhed an anſwer filled with many ſouldierly taunts, objecting to <hi>Albertus</hi> his fear of a battel, and that <hi>Grave</hi> had been in vain looked after long before their receſs; and finding fault that while the Army was ready to ſtarve, he feaſted and revelled at Court without any moderation of charge; and repeating on the other hand the praiſes of ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders as were courteous and affable to their ſouldiers. But what wonder could it be, if, after ſo many others,
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:55798:371"/>
they required what was due to them for their ſervice, or fled to ſuch aſſiſtences for recovery thereof, which though unſeemly in themſelves, yet were made juſt by the laws of a fatal neceſſity? Subjoyning at laſt, that they were and would be ſafe againſt the puniſhments of that cruel Edict, partly by their arms, and partly by their poverty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Octavio Frangipane,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Legate, endeavored to appeaſe this Sedition: but they would hearken to no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, untill that ignominious Edict was revoked and made null. And now the greateſt part of Autumn being paſt and Winter approching, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed his <hi>German</hi> horſe, diſpoſed the reſt of his forces into Garriſons: the like did <hi>Albertus,</hi> whoſe Army was grown thin by frequent runnings away to the other party, and the <hi>Italian</hi> ſouldiers decay (being but freſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men) through the extremity of labour. Yet part of the Army was ſent into the Camp before <hi>Oſtend;</hi> ſo were <hi>Spinola</hi>'s ſhips in part ſent to thoſe parts where either the Enemies forces or the mutineers deſigns were feared; and the citizens of <hi>Venlo,</hi> who had hitherto with pertinacy refuſed a garriſon, now were perſuaded to admit ſouldiers, becauſe of the near-adjoyning danger of <hi>Grave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Mendoſa</hi> departed into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he was ſomewhat ſtrangely received, King <hi>Philip</hi> the father being dead, and the ſon prepoſſeſſed by others, who accuſed him for his unfortunate managery of the war, and that he had neither ſufficiently taken care for Peace, nor undertaken or avoided battells as the neceſſity or contingency of affairs required.</p>
               <p>Upon the forces departing into winter-quarters, it fortuned that fourteen troups of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> fell upon eight of <hi>Albertus</hi> his troups, that were without their

At winter, when the ſeditious began to incroach upon other parts, Count <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> was ſent with three and thirty troups of horſe and twelve hundred foot, to waſt all the farther parts of the enemies country that denied to pay contribution; where he took the town of <hi>S.

But for the future to prevent the like damage, a great ſhip of <hi>Portugal,</hi> of the ſame ſort with thoſe they call Carracks, was oppoſed againſt them, laden with precious Merchandiſes, which while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> aſſaulted, and ſoon after took, the reſt eſcaped by flight. And <hi>Frederick Spinola,</hi> being long detained in <hi>Spain,</hi> untill he could have his covenants with the King confirmed, with his ſix remaining galleys (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were nine hundred ſouldiers and fifteen hundred ſlaves that rowed) in the moneth of <hi>October</hi> ſet forth towards <hi>Flanders:</hi> upon news whereof the <hi>Queen</hi> ordered three
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:55798:372"/>
Ships to wait upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> coaſts, and in the narrow Seas; to which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> joyned four of theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe which guarded the coaſt of <hi>Flanders.</hi> The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> firſt getting ſight of theſe Galleys, gave notice to their Companions; but the Galleys making uſe of the clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and calmneſs of the weather, went ſo near the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> ſhore, that ſome of the Slaves throwing off their chains leaped into the ſhallow waters: but the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> purſuing the veſſels, ſometimes by the ſhore, other times in the narrow Sea, not farre from <hi>Graveling</hi> with their great Guns ſorely bruiſed two of them, and twice or thrice being preſſed with the vaſt bulk of their own Ships, they were broken to pieces; the Maſts, Oars, and reſidue of the Ships being torn in pieces floated upon the Sea, but their main bulks were ſwallowed up in the waves. Almoſt two hundred of the men were ſaved, and more of them might have been, but that mercy was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by fear, leſt the conquered ſhould become more in number then the Conquerors. Beſides, one other of them ſuffered Ship-wreck at <hi>Calais</hi> by the unskilfulneſs of the Pilots; two others of them were much ſhattered with bullets, and falling upon the ſhelves in that coaſt of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> got into <hi>Newport;</hi> the ſixth, wherein <hi>Spinola</hi> himſelf was, ſailing up and down in the Sea of <hi>Zeland,</hi> at laſt not without great hazard, and throwing over-board much of their lading, the ſlaves being incouraged with hope of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, arrived at <hi>Dunkerk.</hi> When then <hi>Frederick Spinola</hi> had joyned theſe three with the reſt which he had before at <hi>Scluys,</hi> aiming to repair both his credit and fortunes from the ſpoils of <hi>Walcheren,</hi> he was with-held by winterly and contrary blaſts of wind, and becauſe the Arch-duke, being vexed both with forein and inteſtine Warre, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to denude his Garriſons for the refurniſhing thoſe Veſſels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="728" facs="tcp:55798:373"/>At this time the Fame and Trade of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in the <hi>Indies,</hi> to the great detriment of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes,</hi> who of old having been the firſt Finders, had now for one hundred years quietly enjoyed thoſe Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and out of reverence of the Pope's Donation made to them had extorted and kept the ſame from the beginning againſt both the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> and other Chriſtian Nations, defending themſelves therein by force of Arms. Theſe therefore make addreſs to King <hi>Philip,</hi> as the onely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn and ſupport of that flouriſhing Kingdome, that he would with an extraordinary Fleet defend thoſe revenues which belonged as well to himſelf as to the People. From hence it came to paſs that the Warre, which had hitherto been contained within the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> was now paſſing into another World; for the managing and conduct where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Don Andrew Hurtado Mendoſa</hi> was choſen, who then by chance had beaten <hi>Cunala,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> Pirat about <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar,</hi> having uſed thoſe parts above fifty years, and was now with great applauſe ennobled with a Royal Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

the future, and the hopes of getting honour and favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe Eaſtern people, drew them not onely to fight like men hand to hand, but to undertake the Combat with their great Guns, wherewith the <hi>Hollanders</hi> being very well accommodated did their Enemies very great miſchief, becauſe being onely driven by the winde, and able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat &amp; draw off as they liſted, by their quickneſs of motion they fruſtrated all the intended violence of the <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Thus they fought for ſome daies even without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, until ſome of the Enemies Ships being ſunk, and two of them taken, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> daunted with the novelty of ſuch an unexpected miſchief departed, ſteering towards <hi>Amboyna,</hi> where without danger, there being none to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, they waſted the Town <hi>Iton,</hi> and whatever place elſe adhered to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> with fire and ſword, and the cutting down of ſeveral odoriferous plants. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors in the City of <hi>Bantam,</hi> which they had reſcued from ſo imminent a danger, after a feſtivous reception there, ſoon after went to <hi>Banda,</hi> whence come the beſt Nutmegs, and undertaking the defence of that Iſland, made a league with the People, (for they have no ſetled Government) That they ſhould not ſell their ſpices to any other people; That they ſhould not be injurious one to another concerning Religion, but ſhould leave the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof wholly to God; That every one of them ſhould uſe their own Laws, but neither of them ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any fugitives from the other. According to this form, in progreſs of time, they contracted friendſhip and ſociety with other Kings and People that ſtood in fear of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> tyranny. The chief of all the Cities of <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> is <hi>Achem,</hi> the King of which place the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> four years before, that were moſt potent in the Court, by bribes, gifts, and falſe accuſations of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> had drawn, partly that he would kill all ſuch of them in their
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:55798:374"/>
Ships as under the ſhew of friendſhip admitted them into them, and partly that he would diſpatch all ſuch as ſhould come into the City: and according to this deſign, a great many were ſlaughtered, the Ships that lay in the harbour knowing nothing thereof; moreover, the drink of that Country ſo conſternated their minds that they ſeemed mad; nay, ſo farre did the treachery proceed, that the Ships were hardly preſerved. But the King ſhortly after repenting the cruelty of the fact, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards came thither making certain covenants concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſale of ſpices, diſcovercd again that the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi> had been buying the King's faith from them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, when they found the Agreements they had made would not be obſerved, the <hi>Arabian</hi> Ships being gone out of the Harbour, in revenge of the injuries received from the <hi>Indians,</hi> they ſent aſhore ſome Forces; which thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſonant to the Laws of thoſe Nations, afterwards gave the Enemies matter wherewith to recriminate the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> But the <hi>Zelanders</hi> afterward returning, when the King was ſomewhat eſtranged from the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> they cleared themſelves from that objected crime, and beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the King that he would ſend ſome of his people with them, that they might ſee they were not a company of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, (as they were aſperſed among ſuch as knew them not) but that they were a people famous for wealth and fidelity, having no enmity or warre with any beſides the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This advice pleaſed the King, that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he might be more certain whether he might with more ſafety incline to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> or <hi>Hollander.</hi> In this voyage near the Iſle of <hi>S. Helena</hi> theſe <hi>Zelanders</hi> eſpying a great <hi>Portugal</hi> Carrack, loaded with Pearl and other precious commodities, and putting themſelves between it and the ſhore, after a hot conflict they forced it to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der itſelf, being firſt much battered with the great Guns.
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:55798:374"/>
The men that were in it they ſet aſhore upon the coaſt of <hi>Braſile.</hi> The chief of the Embaſſadours from <hi>Sumatra</hi> (whoſe name was <hi>Abdutzamar</hi>) died in <hi>Zeland,</hi> and was buried with a very decent funeral, having a Monument exquiſitely raiſed to his memory. The reſt that ſurvived went to ſalute Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> then encamped at the ſiege of <hi>Grave,</hi> giving him Preſents from their King. When they ſaw the great number of the Horſe and Foot, and the Works of that bulk as was not onely unknown to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, but ſuch as exceeded thoſe generally in uſe among us, they were even amazed with admiration. The Treaty held with them was by the name of <hi>Arabians:</hi> And the report of theſe things coming as it were into another World, made them not onely ſhake off all vain ſuſpicions, but was prevalent with many rather to entertain the <hi>Hollanders</hi> friendſhip, then to be kept in ſubjection to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> tyranny. The King of <hi>Ternate</hi> (which is one of the <hi>Molucca</hi>'s) publickly owned the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for at his requeſt <hi>Necken</hi> invaded the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> in the next Iſland named <hi>Tidoris.</hi> But when he was about to aſſault thoſe in the Caſtle being ready to make defence, ſome darts and ſhot being ſpent on both ſides, being lamed by the loſs of his hand, and having loſt ſome few of his men, he put off the fight. In <hi>Patau</hi> alſo and the coaſts of <hi>Cauchin-China</hi> and elſewhere, their coming was very acceptable: but in <hi>Ceilon,</hi> one of the bigger Iſlands, where grows the beſt Cinnamon, they found the King (who is called <hi>Fimala</hi>) a great enemy to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> by whom he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been taken and carried away; and <hi>Spilberg</hi> infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them of the <hi>Dutch</hi> affairs, perceived them very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous both of friendſhip and ſociety. The King of <hi>Jora</hi> alſo (this is a Kingdome in the region of <hi>Malacca</hi>) daring to rip up old injuries againſt the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> incited <hi>Jacob Hemskerk,</hi> then having with him two <hi>Holland</hi> Ships, to ſet
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:55798:375"/>
upon a Carrack of an immenſe magnitude that lay in the Streights between <hi>Malacca</hi> a <hi>Portugal</hi> colony and <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra;</hi> which he accordingly did, the ſaid King being both the author and witneſs of the Victory. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> contented with the booty, which was very great, ſpared the lives of all the perſons in it, (being near ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of all ſexes and ages) although there yet appeared many freſh examples of the <hi>Portugal</hi> cruelty. That Ship came from <hi>Macao,</hi> a Town in the Empire of <hi>China</hi> which the <hi>Portugals</hi> poſſeſs by the courteſie of the Natives, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of late ſome <hi>Hollanders</hi> being driven, they were by the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> hanged and put to death, the Magiſtrates of the <hi>Chinois</hi> being perſuaded that they were no other then thieves and robbers. Now <hi>Macao</hi> ſtands upon the River <hi>Canto,</hi> by which onely ſtrangers are admitted a paſſage into the Empire of <hi>China;</hi> as to goe out of the ſame Empire into forein parts, there is no way but by <hi>Cinceo,</hi> a Port in another part of the Country. Thus wealth being gotten from the publick Enemy, and great damage done both to the King and <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage was gotten with honour by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> both in private and publick: yet ſome were found in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and gain-ſeeking Nation, who would refuſe part thereof as not convenient or fitting, being by force of Warre taken from Merchants, and, as it many times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſuch as leaſt deſerve it. And the pretence that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome to this conſcienciouſneſs was the ancient amity with the <hi>Portugal,</hi> believed to be begun four Ages before, when the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> going to <hi>Syria</hi> to the Holy War, conquered <hi>Lisbone,</hi> then the Kingly ſeat of the <hi>Saracens.</hi> From thence great priviledges were granted to the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and no leſs to the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> Beſides, after the beginning of the Warre in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and the Conqueſt of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
                  <pb n="733" facs="tcp:55798:375"/>
by King <hi>Philip,</hi> the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were invited by the <hi>States,</hi> that as they were equally ſubject with them, ſo they ſhould equally enjoy all manner of commerce, and the ſame benefit with all their Citizens. In anſwer of which deſire, not a few of them, out of hatred to the <hi>Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> of old their neighbours, now their Lords, or leſt the power of the Inquiſition ſhould grow high under pretence of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Arabian</hi> Superſtition, came to the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> but they that remained under the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and increaſed his wealth with their own, were by all Law accounted as Enemies, (eſpecially after ſo many injuries among the <hi>Indians</hi>) as without doubt they might be. And that no man might pretend ignorance thereof, the <hi>States</hi> by a publick Edict declared the ſame. And here a doubt ariſing, whether the goods of <hi>Italians</hi> in thoſe Ships that were taken ſhould be eſteemed Prize, the matter was decided by ſetling a moderation between equity and the practice of Warre.</p>
               <p>Hitherto many Companies of Merchants frequented the <hi>Indies,</hi> whoſe emulations ſince they enhanced the price of Commodities there, and here on the Contrary brought them low, and being ſeveral were not able by all their ſtrength and endeavours to reſiſt the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> the <hi>States</hi> taking this into ſerious conſideration, of many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Bodies made one conjunct Society, appointing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls and Factors in divers Cities, that ſhould ſometimes meet together by their Deputies, and publiſhing a Law, that no one ſeparately, during the ſpace of twenty years, ſhould ſail beyond the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> or goe to the Streights of <hi>Magellan.</hi> And now a day was ſet within which all ſhould give in their names that would be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers both in the charge and revenue of that Company, ſo that at the end of ten years new names ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and offers made. At this time there was collected
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:55798:376"/>
threeſcore hundred thouſand pounds: And from this time, a new Warre as it were ariſing in the Eaſt, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Company began to be eſteemed a great part of the Commonwealth, for that not onely a part of all booty came to the publick Treaſury, but alſo the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was exhauſted at the charge of private Citizens, that daily made ſpoil of him, and made him be at infinite expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his defence. But now the long wants of King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> were at laſt in part ſupplied by the arrival of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> Fleet towards the end of this year; when alſo his animoſities againſt the <hi>French,</hi> as if they had not before been violent enough, broke out more clearly, Letters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſperſed over <hi>Brabant,</hi> accuſing the Marriage of the King with <hi>Medices</hi> as unlawful during the life of <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> and that the iſſue ariſing there-from was illegitimate, and ſo paſſionately reproving the King's luſt.</p>
               <p>About this time alſo was convicted of Treaſon <hi>Gonthalde Duke de Biron,</hi> (King <hi>Henry</hi> then warring about the <hi>Alps;</hi>) he having married the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Daughter, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to have <hi>Burgundy</hi> in Dowry, to the hazard of the ruine of the King and his children. Being cited to the Court, when he denied his fact to the King, who till then was inclinable to pardon him, this was the firſt thing that aggravated the King's anger, although he well knew <hi>Biron</hi> had with his own bloud ſecured both the publick and his reign. This great Duke was of an immenſe ſpirit, ambitious of honour beyond hopes of ſatisfaction; but in the arts of Warre and his merits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Country giving place to no <hi>French</hi>-man that ever went before him, until he diſhonoured the glory of his Mareſchals ſtaff by his unhappy <hi>exit.</hi> And thus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two years Ambition brought to a miſerable end two men, that under their Sovereigns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="735" facs="tcp:55798:376"/>
were great Princes. But as <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s attempts were more excuſable, ſo was his death more ſerene and quiet: But <hi>Biron</hi> having conceived a Treaſon in his minde, was ſo farre followed by Divine revenge, that he contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his end with a mixture both of impiety and madneſs.</p>
               <p>Now alſo the people of <hi>Embden</hi> began to blow up the coals of new Commotions, upon this occaſion. <hi>Enno</hi> the ſon of <hi>Edſard</hi> ſucceeded his Father in his <hi>Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſian</hi> Principality, and being preſſed with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of all the States, ſuppoſing that he might more ſafely act apart, he had eaſily wrought upon his Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they would follow the Prince with all equal freedome againſt the Subjects. With the City of <hi>Emb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> a Peace was made almoſt agreeable to the <hi>Delph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zilian</hi> conditions, onely ſome obſcure things fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived were implied. Theſe being drawn to his Party, contemning the leſſer Towns and the Country, he laid upon them a grievous Tax: But the Town of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> reſiſting his commands, he ran to Arms, and was not content to ſet upon them a mulct onely, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly erecting Gibbets, made Citizens paſs under the yoke. Whereupon, calling to minde old feuds with the <hi>Embdeners,</hi> he terrified other places by the example of <hi>Nordam.</hi> He tears from the Magiſtrates the moſt active and ingenious of the Vulgar, promiſing that when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were excluded, he would transferre the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Trade to them; and it was true, that they were friendly received that brought <hi>Enno</hi>'s Letters. This was very terrible to the United <hi>States,</hi> and ſo much the more, becauſe <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> the brother of <hi>Enno</hi> was in pay under <hi>Albertus;</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> another of his brethren, being by the Pope married to <hi>Enno</hi>'s daughter, to whom he was Uncle, advanced the <hi>Romane</hi> Religion in <hi>Pader<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.</hi> And on every ſide it evidently appeared that the
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:55798:377"/>
Count laboured that he might open that large mouth of the <hi>Eems</hi> to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships. But at firſt the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> ſtrength being imployed elſewhere, onely four Companies were ſent to aſſiſt <hi>Embden,</hi> which entred the City at the ſame time when <hi>Enno</hi> drawing near with his Forces hoped to have been admitted by thoſe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but now being kept out thence, he entreth the Villages round about, and erects ſeveral Forts for the ſhutting up of the City and the River. The <hi>States</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed thereof, and now after the taking of <hi>Grave</hi> having ſome leiſure to conſult about their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours affairs, at the requeſt of the City, ſent <hi>Warner Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois,</hi> a Colonel of Horſe, thither with ſome Troups of Horſe, and almoſt nineteen Companies of Foot.

                  <note place="margin">1603.</note>THE <hi>Hollanders</hi> being oppreſſed with the <hi>French</hi> Peace, were attended with a greater evil, which was the death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> about this time, whereby they were more deeply plunged in a Warre, yet had loſt that aſſiſtence which, as it was the firſt, ſo had it continued unto the laſt. She died the third day of <hi>April,</hi> being by the length of daies arrived to the toils of life, from whence ſhe ſuppoſed her old age, which ſhe had ſpun out even to the ſeventieth year, now grew contemptible, and that the hopes and counſels of thoſe in whom ſhe had put her greateſt confidence were turned towards her succeſſor. It was a long reign for a Woman, and famous not onely at home but abroad, which produced many various cenſures; ſome conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at the future according as they were led by fear or hope; others, from the memory of former actions, reckoning what proſperity and adverſity ſhe had ſeen during her long life. Here was remembred the behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of her Mother, and that for no ſmall fault, but onely the ſuppoſed crime of Adultery; whence aroſe thoſe many bitter taunts of her Enemies, as if ſhe had been the Iſſue of an unknown Father. Soon after, when her Siſter fate in the Throne, ſhe was caſt into Priſon, Which was no ſmall affliction of ſo great a ſpirit, until by the means and interceſſions of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom ſhe owed her Liberty, if not her Life, ſhe
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:55798:378"/>
was freed from thence; though afterwards ſhe requited his kindneſs with a long and ſharp Warre. Beſides, her Reign was accounted cruel by the execution of ſo many Noblemen, for no other pretence but that they profeſſed the <hi>Romane Catholick</hi> Religion; and alſo in that no leſs novel then odious example to all Princes, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed excuſable enough from the neceſſity, that by the command of a Woman, not onely a Woman but a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, and ſhe a Suppliant, not as a common perſon but a diſtreſſed Queen, was put to death. Alſo there were ſome that ſtuck not to exprobrate the divulſions of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſeditions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> as if they had been commanded. Certainly, it was the greateſt of her miſery, that ſhe lived ſo long without a Husband, from whence came the incertainty of her Heir: and very various were the ſeveral opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning her; many objecting her love to the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and after him her endearments of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whoſe hot and over-haſty youth, together with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of her decaying and aged beauty, was puniſhed with the loſs of his head; though ſoon after her minde was more changed from hatred to repentance, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had been from love to hatred, ſo that it was by many judged to be the main cauſe of her ſickneſs and death. On the other ſide it was ſaid, that the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of her Government and life manifeſted the ſame to be well-pleaſing to God, and that inſtead of the cuſtomary evils of youth, ſhe had ſhewed great prudence in her carriage and behaviour in the enjoyment of both good and bad fortune. Nor was it ſo great a wonder that her ſecurity was eſtabliſhed by the death of ſome Rebels and by Warres, as that a Woman's Government after four and fourty years had not onely made <hi>England</hi> ſafe, but flouriſhing; nor had ſhe at any time taken
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:55798:378"/>
Arms but for moſt juſt cauſes. Religion was by her reformed to the example of King <hi>Edward,</hi> not by force, or according to her own fancy, but upon debate of the matter in the great Council of the Kingdome, and in a lawful manner. Nor did ſhe rage with cruelty againſt thoſe that were of another judgement, unleſs it were when it was too late, when by the doctrine and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Jeſuites they had thrown off all reverence &amp; love to their Country and Government at once. By her help <hi>Scotland</hi> was vindicated from the <hi>French,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Party from their adverſe faction, and much of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And although ſhe had ſo many great allurements to increaſe her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, yet ſhe remained content with her own, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring from all her victorious atchievements any other thing then the liberty of that Religion by her promoted, and to ſet limits to power that was or might be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly ſuſpected. Thus did ſhe reſtore the Towns which ſhe poſſeſſed in <hi>France,</hi> preſerved <hi>Scotland</hi> for a Child, and rejected the deſires of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> intreating her to take the Dominion over them. And now lately the old Garriſons in <hi>Ireland</hi> being taken, and new ones for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, ſome of the Nobles being taken here, ſome there, their faction was ſo infeebled, and the very ſtrength and pretence thereof ſo weakned, and <hi>Tyrone</hi> himſelf ſo broken, that falling upon his knees before the Lord Lieutenant he humbly requeſted pardon of all his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. (For that exceſs of Honour happened to him a little before his fall.) She had been courted to Marriage not by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> onely, but by <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> brother of the Emperour, and by <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> brothers to the King of <hi>France;</hi> as alſo by ſome Kings themſelves, to wit, <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Ericus</hi> of <hi>Sweden.</hi> That ſhe was thus ſought was her happineſs, but that ſhe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:55798:379"/>
all was her prudence; becauſe as it was unfit for her Greatneſs to marry a Subject, ſo the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were afraid ſhe ſhould marry a Foreiner. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches that were ſpred concerning her took their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from her ſex and the elegancy of her beauty, together with the cuſtomary liberty of Princes, and could onely be refuted by manlike care and diligence. Nor was ſhe onely well skilled in the arts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but was learned in the ancient and modern lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; an excellency rarely found in Women of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate fortune: which made her Name and renown great and famous, and not onely terrible to and admired by her neighbours, but courted by Embaſſadours even from the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Sarmatians.</hi> No man hitherto doubted, but that great Commotions would have ariſen in <hi>England</hi> upon the death of the Queen, who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver declared any certain Succeſſor; for it was believed that although <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> was the next in bloud, yet the ancient hatred of the inhabitants, and the private fear of thoſe that had conſented to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death, would be an obſtacle to him, there being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ready in <hi>England</hi> who boaſted themſelves to be deſcended of Royal bloud. Then alſo the power of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks was feared, leſt they ſhould hope for that by Troubles which they could never expect while the ſetled Authority of the Queen remained; the Pope alſo inſtigating them, as unwilling that a King of the new Religion ſhould be admitted, although he were next in bloud. Nor was that hope onely grown in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who lay at watch for the peoples commotions, but the <hi>Hollanders</hi> alſo, although they had by many good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before-hand pre-engaged King <hi>James,</hi> upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of Religion, yet by tacite wiſhes did gueſs that the imputation of their alliance with him would tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:55798:379"/>
part of the Warre into <hi>Britain.</hi> But it happened beyond hope and expectation, that preſently after the deceaſe of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the old Councel of the Queen, and as many of the Biſhops and Magiſtrates of <hi>London</hi> as were at preſent at hand and in readineſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King <hi>James,</hi> not waiting for the authority of a Parliament, for the danger of delay, and becauſe <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum</hi>'s do many times in the future by new Laws and Covenants diminiſh the grandeur and power of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Thus without any contradiction the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> got the poſſeſſion of <hi>England,</hi> and was the firſt that within the known Records of any Annals enjoyed the whole Iſland of Great <hi>Britain</hi> in one entire and undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Government.</p>
               <p>The United <hi>States</hi> did not omit forthwith to ſend an Embaſſy to congratulate him for his new acceſs of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, having firſt ſent ſome gratulatory Letters. The Embaſſadours ſent by them to the King were Count <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s brother, then a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Councel of the <hi>States</hi> and General of the Horſe; next to him was <hi>Walrave Brederode,</hi> thirdly <hi>John Olden Barneveldt,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Jacob Valcken,</hi> who died before he returned from this Embaſſy. When they were admitted to audience, they ſpake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are come hither, Great King, divided in our ſelves between Grief And Joy: for we have loſt Her, whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benefits to us we are not able to expreſs in words; but we have found You, as the Heir of Her Kingdome, ſo the Imitator of Her Vertues. That which formerly we deſired, and ſince that by publick ſupplications decreed to the moſt happy Meſſengers of Your new-begun Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that now in Your own preſence with hearts and voices we beſeech and begge of God, that this Your reign
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:55798:380"/>
may be happy and proſperous to Your Self, to Poſterity, to Great</hi> Britain, <hi>and to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s. We begge of You, Sacred Sir, one thing, That You would not ſuffer the inſulting</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard <hi>to trample upon the necks of the</hi> Netherlanders, <hi>and from thence by degrees to incroach upon the Dominions of others his Neighbours. It ſuits with Your Religion, to ſave ſo many Aſſemblies of pious men from that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſanguinary Superſtition: it agrees with Your Juſtice, to defend a Cauſe allowed of by ſo many Kings: and it is an act becoming Your Prudence, to drive away thoſe underminers of Kingdomes, and ſupporters of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, by whoſe judgement all that You now poſſeſs is given to them as a Prey. Your Predeceſſor Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>did this, and ſo we hope will You, and that with the greater eaſe, by how much You are in the prime of Your age, have a more man-like Authority, a more ample Power, and a Houſe well ſetled upon the happy foundation of a hopeful Iſſue. Our fidelity ſhall in part ſupply Your Work and Charge, by whoſe proſperity and adverſity it hath been made evident that the</hi> Spaniards <hi>could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. 'Tis true, Peace is a moſt excellent Jewel, and worthy of high eſtimation among Chriſtians; but that that is made with Tyrants and treacherous people is little better then Warre. If all they that are joyned in the Cauſe would unite their wealth, he would be deprived of the</hi> Netherlands: <hi>and if that puniſhment would not yet make him wiſe, he ſhould be driven out of the Sea, and all his maritime Dominions, which would be no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the</hi> Hollanders <hi>and</hi> Engliſh <hi>to effect: and this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would make him glad to come to a true Peace, the beſt maintainer whereof was equality of Forces. Now is the ſiege of</hi> Oſtend <hi>protracted unto the third year, ſo that having endured ſo long a miſery, we humbly intreat You to aid us with ſupplies for relief thereof; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:55798:380"/>
you may make uſe of thoſe ſhips which by the</hi> Queen<hi>'s command were furniſhed and inſtructed with Armes and proviſions by us, being eleven in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and now wait for nothing but your Royal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereto the King very courteouſly anſwered as to the matter of friendſhip, but as to the reſt he excuſed himſelf by the infancy of his Dominion, but in time he would ſee what was beſt to be done, in the interim not concealing, that as much as he could he would prefer all counſells tending to Peace: for hitherto he had had no difference with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and alſo <hi>Philip</hi> had voluntarily offered him his aſſiſtence, if any diſpute ſhould have ariſen concerning his Kingdome; and himſelf being of a mild diſpoſition and well grounded in all kind of Literature, had ſpent his time in ſtudies rather inclinable to Peace then War: And the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke being ſuppoſed to have made war with the <hi>Queen,</hi> not with the Realm, had by Edict forbidden any damage to be done to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſending home beſides all Priſoners they had that were that Countrey-men; and ſoon after he ſent <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Arenberg</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to the King, as alſo the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſent <hi>Don John Baptiſta Taxis</hi> to the ſame, for the promoting a Peace, concerning which the year following there was an agreement.</p>
               <p>When the Embaſſadors of <hi>Holland</hi> ſaw they could not prevent it, they endeavored to delay it, and to give the King ſome hopes that they likewiſe might obtain Peace together with their Liberty, if the King by procraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations or delay would ſuffer the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> counſells, which yet depended upon the event of a few years, to grow towards perfection. And this was the diſcovery of <hi>Olden Barneveldt,</hi> who was throughly verſed in all the
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:55798:381"/>
ſecrets of the United Provinces, producing the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi>'s hand, whom the Emperor <hi>Rudolphus</hi> had acquainted with that affair. But King <hi>James</hi> his haſt was not at all ſlackened in making that Peace: whereupon the <hi>Hollanders</hi> onely contended, that if they could not obtain a ſhew of aſſiſtence, yet that they might not be denied right. Theſe their deſires were ſeconded by the <hi>French</hi> King, who was very ſollicitous for the ſupport of his allies, and to that end he had ſent into <hi>England Maximilian de Rohan</hi> his chief Treaſurer and a Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counſellor. At laſt this Medium was found, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever moneys the <hi>French</hi> ſhould lay out in behalf of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the third part thereof ſhould be charged to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and all accounts to be diſcharged wherein <hi>France</hi> impoveriſhed by her Warrs was indebted to <hi>Britain.</hi> The States were content herewith, although they were offered by Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood,</hi> the King of great <hi>Britain</hi>'s Orator, to be comprehended in the Articles of the Treaty if they pleaſed; which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with great thanks. The reſt of the year King <hi>James</hi> ſpent in performing and receiving the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the Kingdome, and in viewing his new Dominion of <hi>England,</hi> giving audience at Intervalls to the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of other Kings and the gratulations of his own ſubjects; <hi>Tyrone</hi> himſelf, the great Captain of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebells, coming, and upon his humble ſubmiſſion obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardon.</p>
               <p>Concerning Religion ſeveral complaints were offered by two ſorts of people: The one in <hi>England</hi> are called <hi>Puritans,</hi> being a people that do not eſteem the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical State or Church-government there to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently orthodox and ſincere, but requiring therein more purity, from whence ſprung the original of that hated name of Separation. Theſe find fault with many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:55798:381"/>
retained from cuſtome and antiquity, as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Biſhops, ſome Ceremonies added (as they ſay) in the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and others things more tending to Diſcipline then Doctrine: A change, or at leaſt an amendment, of all which they now hoped from hence, becauſe the <hi>Scots</hi> had already rejected the ſame. On the other ſide, the <hi>Catholicks</hi> with high applauſes magnifying the antiquity of their Religion as well in <hi>Britain</hi> as elſewhere, and ſetting forth their fidelity both to the King himſelf at preſent, and heretofore to his Mother, petitioned, that if he would not give them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick allowance, which yet in <hi>France</hi> the King allowed to diſſenters, that at leaſt they might privately and without fear of puniſhment worſhip God according to the cuſtome of their Fathers. But the King rejected both theſe ſuits, ſuſpecting the <hi>Catholicks</hi> for no other cauſe, but that the <hi>Pope</hi> claims power over Kings: but the King was offended at the <hi>Puritans,</hi> becauſe by men of the ſame Faction, under pretence of Eccleſiaſtical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he had irreverently been uſed in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Whereupon alſo he accuſed their perverſeneſs and obſtinacy publickly ſet forth in Print: for he would have each Nation be free to uſe their own Rites which were not contradictory to the Divine Law, but the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority even in matters Eccleſiaſtical ſhould continue in the King. Yet ſomething was ſetled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the deſire of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> viz. That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſme ſhould not be adminiſtred by women or private perſons; that many Eccleſiaſtical promotions ſhould not be accumulated upon one perſon; and that Church-cenſures ſhould be ſtrict and ſevere, both in the inquiſition and puniſhment of errors either in the life or doctrine of the Prieſthood. But the words of the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> became ſo offenſive, that many of their non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:55798:382"/>
Miniſters were puniſhed by Impriſonments, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and abjuration of the Realm. Notwithſtanding which ſome of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> aſſociating others with them who were deſirous of novelty, conſpired to ſet up to the Government the Lady <hi>Arabella,</hi> a Virgin ſprung from the bloud Royal, dividing among themſelves the chief places of honor and preferment through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The authors of this Treaſon were puniſhed with the loſſe of their heads: the acceſſories thereto and ſuch as had concealed the ſame were caſt into priſon, and the fear of imminent death was reckoned to them for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient puniſhment; the King being prone to win repute to his new Government by the fame of his Clemency.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were doing in <hi>England, Enno</hi> Count of <hi>Frieſland</hi> beyond <hi>Eems,</hi> having really lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that he might eaſily obtain from the Emperor both words and threats againſt the City, but that he could not give him a power to put the ſame in execution, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to try the favour of them that were moſt potent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and to that purpoſe he went to the <hi>Hague,</hi> urging many things both privately and publickly in his own defence, and objecting many things againſt the <hi>Embdoners,</hi> as being of a wavering temper in their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, not well knowing either to govern or be governed. At the ſame time were preſent ſome Deputies from <hi>Embden,</hi> behaving themſelves with much obſtinacy and notable irreverence towards their Prince then preſent. At length after many long debates the United States, not doubting the fidelity of the City towards them, bent all their reſolutions for the ſecurity thereof; and it was concluded, that the <hi>Delphzilian</hi> agreements ſhould be obſerved: whereto beſides were added, That for the future there be an Edict of Indemnity and Oblivion for all things already done, nor ſhould the Count exact the
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:55798:382"/>
Penalties ſet by the Emperor's Decree: That both ſhould be reſtored to their houſes and lands, all priſoners be releaſed, and all inſtruments of war and other received profits be accounted for: And that <hi>Enno</hi> ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to ſet free all ſtrangers, being really ſuch, nor ſhould deny his ſafe conduct in writing to all Ships going from the City: That the Tributes impoſed upon the City the third and the fifth year before ſhould all be made null, and that there ſhould be a conſultation had in the Senate of the <hi>Tranſamaſians</hi> for the ſettlement of new; the right of ſummoning which ſhould be in the Count, but if he neglected to doe it, then they might meet by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and conſult of their common affairs: That it ſhould not be lawfull to denounce a War or levy ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers without the decree of that Councel; onely the Count might retain as many as ſhould be ſufficient for the guarding his Caſtles and ſtrong holds, and likewiſe that the City might raiſe ſeven hundred ſouldiers for the defence thereof and maintaining their works: That the <hi>Tranſamaſians</hi> ſhould maintain the ſouldiers, the charge of the works ſhould be born by the Townsmen; and what goods were within a Town ſhould be equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, and whatever was incloſed within any fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould enjoy the ſame priviledges with the City it ſelf: That the Magiſtrates of <hi>Embden</hi> ſhould be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Senate of the City, and that the Count to that creation ſhould adde his authority.</p>
               <p>When therefore the Count and the Deputies of the City had agreed upon theſe conditions, it remained that the whole Magiſtracy of the City and the States of the <hi>Tranſamaſians</hi> ſhould allow of and ratify the ſame: which was very likely to have been done, the Nobility being afraid of War, as that which would waſt their Lands, and ſome being ſent by the United States to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:55798:383"/>
force ſuch as ſhould offer to delay the ſame; the greateſt part of the garriſon alſo was withdrawn, that the fade of affairs might appear more peaceable. But new hopes from the Emperor changed <hi>Enno</hi> abſolutely, inſomuch that it was publickly ſaid that thoſe Covenants were of no force that ſhould diſannull the Emperor's Edict, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Crimes, and grant a power of fortifying Towns, and all this without the Emperor's conſent, whoſe authority in that City was ſupreme. And ſoon after <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> being not a little angry that the affairs of <hi>Embden</hi> ſhould be tranſacted by a forein power, ſent <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> Count of <hi>Cocheine</hi> to the States, who grievouſly accuſing the <hi>Embdeners,</hi> related the cauſes which had moved the Emperor long ſince to declare both to others, and to them the United States, that they ſhould give no aſſiſtence to thoſe Rebells; and that nevertheleſs they had invaded the City with their ſouldiers, begun a War in the Country, and taken booties: for the repreſſing and taking away of which injuries, the Emperor had ſent his Commands by him. Which done, he recited particularly what things ſeemed unjuſt in that laſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. To theſe things the United States, although they were more proudly reproved, yet returned this modeſt anſwer. <hi>That</hi> Enno <hi>came of his own accord to them, and had voluntarily entred into thoſe Covenants: and that it is not uſual to blame thoſe that had uſed their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors in the compoſing their neighbors differences: Alſo that they had as little as poſſibly they could receded from the</hi> Delphzilian <hi>Covenants, which they underſtood plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Emperor: and that they had ſent their ſouldiers into the City, not to offer an injury to the Emperor, but leſt the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>who by the Peace made at</hi> Verbin <hi>had taken to himſelf all the right of Authority in the Country beyond the</hi> Eems, <hi>ſhould ſeize it, being ſo convenient to
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:55798:383"/>
infeſt the</hi> Hollanders, <hi>and at once withdraw it from the</hi> German <hi>Empire. Thus had he taken formerly</hi> Utrecht, Gelders, <hi>and other places beyond the</hi> Rhine: <hi>Thus had he ſeized</hi> Millain, <hi>and ſome peculiar appurtenances of the Empire, and at laſt</hi> Cambray; <hi>and all this without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Nor were the Letters and Meſſengers ſent by</hi> Enno <hi>to the King and other</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Commanders without cauſe ſuſpected by them.</hi> To theſe good words they added ſome gifts to the Embaſſador; however as yet all things at <hi>Embden</hi> were full of hatred and diſſention, every one being ſuſpicious of another.</p>
               <p>This alſo made the <hi>Hollanders</hi> more incenſed againſt <hi>Enno,</hi> becauſe his brother <hi>John,</hi> as we ſaid before, having obtained licence from the <hi>Pope</hi> to marry with <hi>Enno</hi>'s Daughter, to whom he was Uncle, promoted the <hi>Roman</hi> Rites in the Country of <hi>Paderborn,</hi> and did the Biſhop's buſineſs there, breaking into the City upon them who had kept it upon pretence of liberty, raging againſt them with moſt exquiſite torments, among whom the Conſul of the Town was tormented, and afterwards cut in pieces.</p>
               <p>The latter end of Winter the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſuddenly took and loſt <hi>Wachtendonck.</hi> For a Fiſherman being hired brought into the Caſtle fifteen ſouldiers under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Matthew Dulken,</hi> (he was the Governor of <hi>Stralen</hi> not far off) which were covered over with ſtraw; and upon the approch of the Sentinel, that ſtretched forth his hand to help him up, drawing his ſword he thruſt him through; then all the ſouldiers leaped up, and ſtrove to admit their companions that were on the other ſide of the river <hi>Neeres,</hi> forcing the bridges that were kept againſt them, which they did by that time their fellows who lay in ambuſh not far off arrived. But the garriſon of the Town, although the Caſtle and
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:55798:384"/>
the Governor <hi>Rihoven</hi> were taken, began to raiſe a mount and battery againſt it, and with ſpeed to bring thither Cannon. And by chance it happened, that two troups of <hi>Hollanders</hi> that had been abroad foraging rode by, which hearing of the Tumult, entred the Town; and preſently ſouldiers being ſent for to <hi>Berck</hi> and <hi>Moers,</hi> they begirt the Caſtle, and the ſixth day after recovered it being ſorely aſſaulted and withall wanting of proviſion.</p>
               <p>Not long after <hi>Grobbendon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> laying ſome ambuſhes in the Champains of <hi>Brabant,</hi> ſurpriſed five troups of <hi>Maurician</hi> horſe, and though he were inferior to them in number, killed near ſeventy of them: many men and horſes were taken, and the reſt fled. But this damage ſuffered by the horſe was doubly recompenſed by a more famous naval victory. For <hi>Frederick Spinola</hi> weary of an inglorious idleneſs, and haſtning out of the greatneſs of his ſpirit to purchaſe honor and wealth by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of <hi>Zeland,</hi> furniſhed eight gallies of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſort and four leſſer with choſen ſouldiers out of the Camp before <hi>Oſtend,</hi> beſides a great number of ſlaves that rowed; and going out of the Haven of <hi>Scluys,</hi> the wind gently ſeconding his deſires, he got over the Sands, and ſpying the Enemie's Fleet, choſe a place to fight with them in, upon the open Sea. Three <hi>Zeland</hi> Ships of war had beſet the Port, over which one <hi>Juſtus Moon</hi> had the Command, beſides two Gallies, one of <hi>Holland,</hi> the other of <hi>Zeland:</hi> four of theſe (the fifth for want of wind being very far diſtant, and giving no other aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to the battel then with its great Guns) vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſetting forward, <hi>Spinola</hi> ſet upon cloſe at hand with a great outcry, compaſſing ſometimes this, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times t'other, with more violence, as hope led him on, diſtreſſing them with the multitude of his ſhot, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:55798:384"/>
over-powerfull for them, as well by the help of the weather as the number of his Ships and ſouldiers: for in the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Fleet were no more then ſix and thirty ſouldiers out of the Town of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> who were armed with Muskets; but the company of Sea-men, being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclinable to war, skilled in the uſe of their Arms and Guns, both near at hand and at diſtance, freely gave wounds to their Enemies both with their Swords and Javelins. And now the fight grew ſo hot, that the very clouds of ſmoak had eclipſed the light from their eyes, ſo that it ſeemed to be a nocturnal fight, untill <hi>Frederick</hi> himſelf, with great valour and confidence aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one of the Enemies Ships, was killed with ſeveral wounds, and with him above three hundred others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide many hurt: but the breaking of the Oares was the firſt thing that took away all hope of Victory from the <hi>Italians:</hi> hereupon they were ſurpriſed with fear, leſt more Ships coming out of <hi>Zeland</hi> ſhould encompaſs them on every ſide, and ſo in time they retreated to the Fleet. This victory of the <hi>Zelanders</hi> with ſo ſmall loſs, which happened becauſe the ribs of their Ships were more ſolid and compact, and leſs open to the damage of the bullets, made that great terror of thoſe at firſt unknown Veſſels come to nothing, for that it was experimentally found, that they might be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, even in the moſt calm and ſerene wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>There was no War any where untill the midſt of Summer, but before <hi>Oſtend,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> not receiving thoſe aids out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> which they hoped, had enough to doe to defend their own; and the Arch-duke minding to take <hi>Berck</hi> and to paſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> for the perfecting theſe new deſignes, he procures new forces out of <hi>Spain</hi> and
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:55798:385"/>
                  <hi>Italy,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Ambroſe Spinola:</hi> beſides he raiſed in <hi>Germany</hi> foot-ſouldiers, and in <hi>Lorrain</hi> horſe-men; and after they arrived, <hi>Spinola</hi> being left at <hi>Oſtend,</hi> ſeven thouſand foot and three thouſand horſe were delivered to <hi>Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Heremberg,</hi> and his firſt orders were, to drive out thoſe who had violently ſeated themſelves in <hi>Hochſtraten.</hi> This <hi>Philip</hi> had commanded as well for ſecurity ſake at preſent, as for example ſake in the future, and leſt while he turned his Armes to other parts, they ſhould invade the places left deſtitute of defence; for of late they had ſpoiled the Province of <hi>Namur,</hi> taken the Town of <hi>Jedin</hi> and the Governor of <hi>Carpen</hi> Caſtle, and yet returned ſafe and full of booty. At this time they in <hi>Hochſtraten</hi> held a moſt ſevere diſcipline, and worthy of imitation by the beſt ſouldiers: their guards and watches were very diligently looked after, neither was any permitted to goe into a bed or put off his clothes while he took his reſt; no women were ſuffered to come within the Caſtle; to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and to have any ſecret conferences or letters, was a capital offence. Theſe laws were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed and confirmed by puniſhments of offenders without pardon. Theſe underſtanding that they were like to be beſieged, ſent to the <hi>States</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and beſeech and beg their aide, promiſing upon their faith, that they would jointly and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly fight againſt the Enemy; but proteſting that they would have all priſoners they ſhould take at their own diſpoſe, becauſe the laws of War were uſually denied among Enemies to ſuch as were renegadoes. Eight hundred of them were ſhut up in the Caſtle; the reſt, being fifteen hundred foot and above a thouſand horſe, expect Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> who hearing that Count
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:55798:385"/>
                  <hi>Heremberg</hi> was now come, and began to doe all acts of hoſtility againſt the Caſtle, draws together little leſs then ten thouſand foot and three thouſand horſe out of their Winter-quarters, and ſpeeds with them to <hi>Geertruydenberg.</hi> In which City happened a ſad ſpectacle, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> by mutual quarrells among themſelves falling together by the ears, being Nations always emulous of one another: inſomuch that now there began a perfect battel between the whole Regiments, ſome being killed, more wounded, and the Colonel of the <hi>French,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Bethune,</hi> himſelf running in between them to prohibit their fighting, was killed, which much incenſed the minds of his men. Scarcely could the ſight or ſpeech of the <hi>Naſſavian</hi> Commanders or of the Prince himſelf prevail to deterre the further increaſe of this impious and increaſing ſlaughter. Here Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s forces joyning with thoſe of the ſeditious, they marched together, though ſouldiers of different obligations and principles, by a new and ſtrange kind of example. Between the fields and the Enemies Camp was a little rivulet, the ground all about which is very moory: this Count <hi>Heremberg</hi> either by error, or tot ſuſpecting the coming of Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> had neglected to poſſeſs. The Prince having by prepared bridges brought over his ſouldiers and artillery, on a ſudden faces the Enemy with his Army. But Count <hi>Heremberg</hi> kept himſelf within the ſafeguard of the place and the defence of his carriages, which he had placed in form of a rampier, onely the horſe were commanded to advance, which produced ſome light skirmiſhes. Nor did Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> think meet to ſet upon the Enemies entire untill he had tried all places that might be advantageous to himſelf
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:55798:386"/>
or the Enemy. Count <hi>Heremberg</hi> fearing, as other things, ſo to be debarred of proviſions, through the help of the night withdrew firſt his Cannon, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſouldiers, towards <hi>Herentalls,</hi> in the mean while keeping watches againſt the Enemy, that he might be the better able to deceive them. But when the appearance of day-light had diſcovered their deſign, they which were in the Caſtle firſt fell in their rear, where among others was ſlain <hi>Roſney</hi> (the ſon of a famous Commander both in <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>) who at that time commanded the <hi>Lorraign</hi> ſouldiers. But another ſmall river hindred Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> from his intended purſuit of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, for that it was fordable onely with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, beſides the way was narrow and full of water; yet moving on forward with the horſe he found the Enemy newly paſſed the ſtreights, and his Army drawn into battalia in the open fields: and although the <hi>Hochſtrateners</hi> were very earneſt to fight, as well in their own revenge, as in giving a proof of their affection and valour to their new friends, yet it was not thought fit to fight this Army thus drawn up, and ordered without the foot and Artillery, which followed but ſlowly after over the difficulties of an uliginous way, beſides the toilſome grievouſneſs of the weather, which was diſturbed with continual rain and tempeſts. Thus the ſiege being raiſed, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> boldly threw himſelf into the midſt of the ſeditious ſouldiers, that by this great confidence of them he might oblige them to him the more ſtrictly. And now he again reſolved, while part of the Enemies forces were with him, to beſiege <hi>'s Hertogenboſch,</hi> which by the cruelty of the Winter the laſt year he was forced to break off, his confidence reſting onely in celerity,
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:55798:386"/>
if the City could be ſurrounded void of a garriſon, as it then was. But the matter being related to the Councel of the States, the <hi>Zelanders</hi> preſſing to make war in <hi>Flanders,</hi> yet at laſt the Prince was permitted to doe what ſhould ſeem moſt convenient to the Commonwealth, but in the mean while eight days were ſpent. And although Count <hi>Heremberg</hi>'s forces were prepared and increaſed purpoſely to diſturb all deſigns of the Prince, yet he continued in his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, not ſo much out of any hopes of attaining the City, as becauſe he would keep the Enemy buſied in trifling, and himſelf not be compelled to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his own elſewhere, and to depend wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on uncertain events. Some were of opinion that the Townsmen, wearied with the miſeries of war, would either alter their fidelity, or at leaſtwiſe doe that as ſhould make them ſeem ſo moderate to both parties, that they ſhould neither fear nor be feared. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Summer being now well entred, the Prince ſate down at the Village named <hi>Vuchten,</hi> and the <hi>Huhſtrateners</hi> at <hi>Vlimen,</hi> in the way to <hi>Hoeſden,</hi> there being a great diſtance of ground between the two Camps. The third day after Count <hi>Heremberg</hi> drew nigh, and in the woody places towards that part where the City lay open, in the Village of <hi>Dalem,</hi> fortified himſelf, caſting up defences againſt Prince <hi>Maurice.</hi> He, on the other ſide, erected ſome Sconces and Batteries with great Guns, where the ground ceaſing to be plain ſwells up into little hills; and much time was careleſly ſpent in light skirmiſhes and waſting of ſhot. At laſt <hi>Heremberg</hi> was adviſed to erect a Fort without the City, near the way that leads from <hi>Vuchten</hi> to <hi>Vlimen,</hi> to this intent, that the paſſage being ſtopped from Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Camp
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:55798:387"/>
to that of the <hi>Hochſtrateners,</hi> a more hopefull oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity might be expected againſt them being divided, or that by a ſcarcity of Victualls, which were brought from <hi>Hoeſden</hi> to the Camp, the ſiege might be removed or broken up of neceſſity. The charge of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was: committed to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Bella,</hi> Colonel of the <hi>Italians,</hi> with two thouſand ſouldiers, the flour of divers Regiments; which being carried round about the City in the night, had brought the deſigned work to ſome perfection, the ground being thrown up and mingled with faggots to the height of a man: whereof the Prince receiving intelligence, not till it was very late in the night, he with the moſt active and valiant of his men flying thither, excited every one to this no leſs difficult then neceſſary buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> valiantly made the firſt aſſault, and were no leſs courageouſly repulſed; but the <hi>French</hi> ſtrongly ſeconding them, ſoon made the place too hot for the Enemy, and the gates of the Town being ſhut, they having no place of refuge to fly to, nor any relief to aſſiſt them, were ſlain together with their Commander, or drowned in the adjoyning mariſhes: about one hundred and fifty were taken priſoners. It happened by chance about the ſame time, that the Arch-duke at <hi>Oſtend</hi> ſtriving to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the going in and out of the ſouldiers by ſome ſharp and ſevere puniſhments, getting a Ship which ſtuck upon the Shallows, wherein were onely twelve ſick ſouldiers, he hanged them all, pretending they were not taken at land, but upon the Sea, where there are no laws of Arms to be obſerved: the news of which being brought to the Camp, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> eſteeming it an act of great cruelty and wickedneſs, not having any relation to a war at Sea, that he might make the
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:55798:387"/>
Laws of Arms ſetled among all Enemies to be of eſteem, by a return of the like cruelty cauſed twelve, choſen at hap-hazard out of the whole number of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, to be hanged, yet one of them out of pity to his tender age was ſpared; though ſome did not ſtick to averre, that the known and well-approved law of covenants being infringed ſo barbarouſly, ought to be expiated not onely with the puniſhment of the like, but rather of a double number. Certainly it was a ſad ſight, and not to be forgotten among the many evils of war, when young men of good breeding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, and not deſerving any ſuch thing, with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull countenances, trembling hands, and between prayers and ſighs, not ſo much fearing death as the ignominious kind thereof, ſhould draw and look upon their fates incloſed in bits of paper, either of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for anothers fault, or of pardon not for innocencie's ſake, but the chance of fortune. Yet there was one found of ſo deſperate a temerity, who by his own good luck ſet free, yet, hired by another, once more put his life in jeopardy for the ſafeguard of the other. But the Townsmen defended themſelves onely by ſhot: yet it fortuned that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Malaſpina</hi> and one <hi>Oliver Tempel,</hi> paſſing from the Prince's to the <hi>Vlimian</hi> Camp, had both their legs broken at one ſhot. <hi>Malaſpina</hi> was a perſon much knowing in all <hi>Albertus</hi> his counſells of war, and being lately taken priſoner by the <hi>Hochſtrateners</hi> ſurvived, though in a very weak condition. But <hi>Oliver</hi> died of his wound, having fought on the States behalf above twenty years, ſo that now he was Judge-Advocate of the Army, and beſides at that time was ſet over the <hi>Hochſtrateners,</hi> by his reaſon to keep in order their violence. Afterwards <hi>Albertus</hi> himſelf came to the
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:55798:388"/>
City, and trying all things, obſerved that there was a ſlight Sconce built by the <hi>Mauricians</hi> in a ſquare forme, not far from the place where the Marqueſſe of <hi>Bella</hi> was lately ſlain. Of this place the Arch-duke ſaying, it was neceſſary to be taken, (and without doubt for the future it would have been of great uſe to him) news thereof was privily conveyed and brought to the Prince by the intelligence of a ſouldier that fled from them to him. Some days being paſt, one night, a little before the break of day, making as if they intended an aſſault in divers places, their main ſtrength wholly aimed at the deſtined place. Nor did Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> being forewarned of the danger omit at the ſame time to draw down thither the moſt courageous both of his own men, and ſome of the choiceſt of the <hi>Hochſtrateners,</hi> putting out all the fires. The appearance of the day diſcovered a Battery of nine great Guns oppoſite to the Fort, and others directed from the Town-Bulwarks and other Fortreſſes, wherewith the Sconce being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently battered on all hands was ſo ſhattered, that the ſouldiers hid themſelves in the hollow places of the ground; yet the Prince came to them, and threatned ſeverely to hang any that ſhould deſert the place. At the ſame time he placed a circle of musketiers round the whole circumference of the Trench, and commanded three Cannon to be brought out of the Camp, wherewith the Enemies ſtrength being repreſs'd, and the aſſailants forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come defendants, leaving the Boats which they had brought for the more eaſy paſſing the interjacent mariſhes, and ſcarcely ſaving their great Guns, the <hi>Mauricians</hi> took all the Mattocks, Faggots, Hurdles and other things prepared for deſtruction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:55798:388"/>
them all to the repairing and augmentation of their own Works. The Arch-duke deſigning ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt the Enemy, (which indeed was the main cauſe of his coming) commanded three thouſand Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which he pretended ſhould onely march through the Town, to remain there in Garriſon; which made the Citizens complain grievouſly of the breach of thoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants which for twenty years together had been invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olably preſerved. But neceſſity and the fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment quickly made them ſilent; alſo there was a ſtrong Fortreſs raiſed cloſe by the City, which might ſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Caſtle, though it had not the name of one. And at the beginning of Winter, the ground being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhy and full of water, the Armies departed. When the ſeditious, whoſe labours this year had been great and exemplary, deſiring another place of ſafety might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them for <hi>Hochſtraten,</hi> wherein they might have more room, and that lay more convenient for forage; the matter hanging long in debate before the <hi>States,</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of his own accord admitted them into <hi>Grave,</hi> a Town belonging to himſelf, that they might remain within the Walls, and have the command of all the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks about it, but not to doe any injury to the Citizens. And the Covenants formerly made were renewed and confirmed, concerning the dividing of the ſpoil, and that they ſhould not infeſt or ſpoil any of the Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing either to the <hi>Germane</hi> Empire or the United <hi>States:</hi> as long as they continued at difference with <hi>Albertus,</hi> they ſhould not ſpare their beſt pains and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yet ſo as they alwaies ſhould remain ſeparate in all marches, and be free from all ſervile works of digging and aſſaults: that when they ſhould be reconciled, they ſhould reſtore <hi>Grave</hi> and receive <hi>Hochſtraten,</hi> for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof they engaged their faith and gave pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="760" facs="tcp:55798:389"/>Theſe were the tranſactions in thoſe parts, while in the interim about <hi>Oſtend</hi> the Warre greatly increaſed and therewith not the charge onely, but the political inventions and ſtratagems alſo. And now the Winter being paſt, that had ſometimes been offenſive to theſe, other-while to thoſe, as the force of the wind drove the waters and made them more turbulent; in the middle of the Spring a fierce aſſault was made from the Camp upon all the quarters of the Town; and when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants were not able to ſuſtain ſo violent and ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a force, three Forts were taken by the Enemy, (which lying on the backſide of the Town, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the waters, we mentioned before to be ſlightly guarded) and ſome few daies after the beſieged ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſally upon the ſame places, which wanted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, made the Enemy not onely encreaſe the number of his Guards, but to put therein of his choiceſt men. But other ſmall Forts beyond the <hi>Gollet</hi> aſſaulted by <hi>Bucquoy</hi> were ſucceſsfully maintained. Colonel <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen</hi> was then Governour of the Town, whoſe time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent, he was ſucceeded by Colonel <hi>Notte.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle of Summer <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Count <hi>Spinola</hi> came to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> promiſing an end to this hard (and by ſome eſteemed deſperate) work, if he might have the chief command in the Camp. Nor did he undertake this out of any vain temerity, but by the ſound infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of thoſe by whom both the place and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Warre were well underſtood, eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the way was found through the water over great piles of wood, a work onely of time and diligence, whereby the Works of the Town might be taken from them as it were by piece-meal. And this deſire of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> was the more eaſily conſented to by King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> becauſe beſides many eminent vertues of a noble
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:55798:389"/>
minde, whereof he had given certain teſtimonies, he offered alſo out of his private wealth to preſcribe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to the affairs of the Treaſury at that time very much out of order. He was at firſt very greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, becauſe being an <hi>Italian,</hi> and but newly come into the Warre, among ſo many <hi>Netherlanders</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> he commanded at once both the Souldiers and Treaſury: but he diligently minding all things, and following the moſt prudent, by little and little over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came it And preſently removed ſuch as had made a gain of the Treaſury, having prepared his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, becauſe there was need of money to prevent mutinies and running away. Beſides, the hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards had brought thither the moſt famous Wits of Chriſtendome, among whom there was great emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in finding out new waies of approching, batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and aſſaulting Towns, and as any ones inventions came to moſt perfection in the executive part, ſo was the care of the General more ready to gratifie him with a certain reward. No leſs valour or induſtry was ſhewn by the beſieged, for they took care, leſt their proviſions ſhould be ſtreightned, that all commanded allowances ſhould be publickly delivered; and, for their defence, were unwearied in their Watches yea, and ſometimes were confident enough to make Sallies; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, what either the violence of the Enemy or the Sea had thrown down, they employed skilful workmen to repair. To believe ſo great a number of men ſhut up in ſo narrow a compaſs, and obnoxious to ſo many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, wounds and labours, and yet to finde no contagion bred among them, next to the providence of God, muſt needs be attributed partly to the extraordinary care of the Chirurgeons and Phyſicians, and partly to the care of the <hi>States,</hi> which alwaies cauſed the ſick or woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:55798:390"/>
with all diligence to be carried thence. Moreover, beſides the harm they did by burning bullets and hand-granadoes and the like new inventions, they did other great damage to the Enemies materials being now through dry by the heat of the weather. The chief la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Aſſailants was concerning ſome Boats that were built for the carriage of great Guns, by the ſame Engineer which we mentioned before, <hi>Targon</hi> a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> a man of a very ſubtle wit, but altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced in Martial affairs. Part of theſe were ſent to the left hand of the Town, where the Sea was not ſo boiſterous, to the Forts that lay neareſt to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but on the right hand, where the <hi>Gollet</hi> is, the ſhot being unequally levelled, they did little or no harm, moſt of them being ſpoiled by the impetuouſneſs of the waters, becauſe ſtones being bound up in great bundles of wood, the bands thereof quickly breaking, the reſt floated, having loſt the weight that kept it down. Yet was not <hi>Spinola</hi> diſmayed thereat, but ſtill added more Boats to the former, learning new waies of Fortification, from the very experience they gained from their loſſes: And the battery of Count <hi>Bucquoy</hi> being by little and little advanced nearer the Town, it came to paſs that Ships came in and out with more difficulty to bring in Souldiers, Victuals, Guns, or Gunpowder, ſome after that falling upon the Shallows, or being ſwallowed up in the Sea, when they had in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to enter endured the fury of the Enemies Artillery. Againſt the ſhot from the Town the Beſiegers partly choſe the night, partly uſed Works made of earth to keep out the water, wherein were transfixed ſeveral rows of Piles and Faggots, where they had ſetled in places of more ſafety; otherwiſe they ſunk great Veſſels filled with ſtuff underneath the water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="763" facs="tcp:55798:390"/>But in <hi>Spain</hi> with the King, who in the practice of his Affairs did moſt things by the counſel ot Strangers, not his own judgement, ſometimes new counſels were preferred before old, other times the old regained their former repute, as the authority of perſuading or hope of the event led every one. Some averred that it was a great error of State to forbid the <hi>Hollanders</hi> traffick with <hi>Spain,</hi> they being a People potent at Sea, and ſeeking Merchandiſe from the fartheſt parts of the earth, either by Arms or otherwiſe, and going to the <hi>Indies,</hi> to the no ſmall (though new and hitherto unheard of) damage of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> With how much more wiſedome did his Father attain a hope of Peace from that cuſtome of the Provinces among themſelves, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alwaies a convenient number of Ships, as often as occaſion required made ready for him by his very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies? If a remedy ſhould be ſought for preſent and future miſchiefs, it muſt be by taking away neceſſity from the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> for that very thing firſt ſhewed them their own ſtrength. This counſel, in it ſelf not abſurd, was yet found fault with and diſallowed by covetouſneſs: for though Trade was publickly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Edict, yet there was ſo great a Tribute and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, beſides what was formerly, laid upon all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, that it amounted to little leſs then the third part of the price of the commodity; to wit, thirty in the hundred was to be paid to the King's Exchequer. And this was not laid upon the <hi>Hollanders</hi> onely, but all other Nations, leſt otherwiſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould ſhelter themſelves under the names of others; and for ſome private cauſes of hatred againſt thoſe by whoſe aſſiſtence it was believed the Warre was ſupported. Onely ſome immunity was granted to thoſe that lived within the Arch-duke's Territories, or ſhould impor
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:55798:391"/>
any thing into his inland Sea. And this was added as a clauſe peculiar to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that it ſhould not be lawful to import any Merchandiſes made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ſhould any of thoſe things be paid to their Pilots for wages, which they either imported or expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Beſides, they were commanded to take the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke's ſafe conduct with them. Which things being very grievous and unjuſt, did not onely not prevail againſt the United <hi>States,</hi> but much incenſed the King of <hi>France</hi> alſo: ſo that firſt, he laid the like Impoſitions upon the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and when that ſeemed not a ſufficient revenge, he forbade all the <hi>French</hi> to Trade into <hi>Spain</hi> ſo long as <hi>Philip's</hi> Edict remained in force, on pain firſt to loſe all their goods, and after that to receive corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhment. Nor did the Archduke's diſſembled clemency ſucceed any be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The words of this Edict were filled with many fraudulent deceits: for all kinde of Religion was directed to be puniſhed thereby except the <hi>Romane;</hi> and the ſettlement of their Families detained many in <hi>Holland,</hi> as well as the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the gain they made there. About this time the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſuffered ſome ſmall damages by the <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerkers;</hi> among the reſt, they took ſome <hi>Holland</hi> Ships, out of the very <hi>Thames,</hi> being deceived by the Pirates bearing the ſame colours with their Companions.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide the <hi>Indian</hi> Company ſent thirteen Ships to the Eaſt <hi>Indies,</hi> commanded by <hi>Stephen Van Hague:</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> ſent out ſix others, under the command of <hi>Paul Carden,</hi> to ſpoil the coaſt of <hi>Braſile.</hi>

appointed Articles for ſettlement of Peace, and they that refuſed to lay down Arms voluntarily ſhould be compelled by force. The more moderate were againſt the uſing of force, making onely a decree for ſending an Embaſſy to the <hi>States;</hi> and while that was preparing, the Emperour in the mean while ſent Letters, wherein he recited all the evils done to the neighbour-Princes, and what ſeveral Cities had ſuffered, commanding them to make reſtitution of whatever they had taken away by violence. Moreover he laid to their charge, not onely what their own Souldiers had done, but alſo the rapines committed by the <hi>Hochſtrateners,</hi> in regard they had undertaken their defence. Whereto the <hi>States,</hi> excuſing what belonged to themſelves, ſaid that the faults of the ſeditious Souldiers ought to be aſcribed to them that with the danger of others would defraud the Souldiers they hired of their pay. That they had ſought nothing but their own ſafety, and yet as much as they could they had in all Covenants conſulted the peace of <hi>Germany.</hi> But theſe injuries were not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily wiped off by good words, ſince that in the beginning of this year (which we are now entring upon) the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious left nothing undone towards the <hi>Germans</hi> which is uſual towards an Enemy, ſlighting all their threats, ſo long as they proceeded no further then words.

From the River <hi>Ateren</hi> the Army was landed, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was a great over-ſight, that it was not carried into the Haven of <hi>Scluys,</hi> which was the opinion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the <hi>States:</hi> from which if the Prince had not

between <hi>Oſtend,</hi> he ſpread himſelf to the two Rivers which from <hi>Damme</hi> and <hi>Bruges</hi> paſs to <hi>Scluys,</hi> being divided by a ſmall limit, yet ſo different in taſt, that from thence they have attained the names of ſalt and freſh water: but where the Lake named <hi>Merkerk</hi> ſtreightens the way leading thither, (as indeed almoſt all that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is full of water) <hi>Lewis Velaſco</hi> by the Arch-duke's command had fortified himſelf, and going out with a ſtrong Party, Fortune ſmiling upon the Enemies, in the attempt they made upon thoſe they firſt met, before the Horſe that were added to him could come in to his help, he with his whole number was overthrown; five hundred almoſt were drowned, and three hundred ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and thus they came to the Rivers; and although the Enemy had planted himſelf between, on one part diſſembling, on the other ſide finding a paſſage, firſt went over at a Ford, and afterwards over Bridges to that purpoſe builded. Hence grew ſo great a terror, that the Forts were deſerted which lie to the Eaſtward from the Haven of <hi>Scluys,</hi> excepting onely one called <hi>S. George,</hi> which yet was quickly delivered, more out of fear then neceſſity, upon ſight of the Cannon drawn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. The Garriſon going abroad, they found the deceit of an evil cuſtome: a lighted match being placed by the Barrels of Gunpowder, to have blown up the ſame, and ruined all near thereabouts. Then the Prince pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three Camps between the Town and the Sea-ſhore, over which himſelf, Count <hi>William</hi> and Count <hi>Erneſt</hi> had the Command. That which was beyond the Rivers, lying every where under water, he commanded Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Notte</hi> to keep, to that purpoſe giving him ſome Boats, and from thence a Breaſt-work to be drawn as farre as <hi>Ardenburg,</hi> whereon frequent Guards to be kept. But before they were able perfectly to ſurround
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:55798:394"/>
the Town with their Works, the Souldiers twice broke into <hi>Scluys</hi> through the Mariſhes, and in ſo great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, through the Governour's neglect, that it was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they were ſufficient to have defended the Town againſt him; for there was within but little Victuals, and the number of thoſe that eat it was increaſed; and that made <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> with a ſtrong Guard bring provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions into the parts near the Town, which they were to meet him and receive: but the deſign being diſcovered, Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> haſtning with ſome Horſe and Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, drove away the Enemy, and took ſome Carts loaden with Meal, and a few men. Fifty of the Slaves belonging to <hi>Spinola,</hi> that with ſome others had come forth of the City, fled over to the Prince, by whoſe intelligence he was more certainly informed that there was Victuals in the Town onely for a ſhort ſeaſon; that they made a great ſhew of many things, the better to deceive and delude their Enemies. Hereupon a Faſt was proclaimed in the Camp, which is cuſtomary with them going to attempt any difficult and dangerous matter; after which they planted their great Guns, and made a Bridge of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful bigneſs, as if therewith they would goe beyond the broad and deep gulf of the Haven even unto the Rampier: but indeed ſome deſpairing, they ſtayed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pinch the Enemy with Famine, and to that end they were more diligent in ſhutting up all the Avenues, not would receive any more fugitives; in the interim the Horſe plundering <hi>Flanders.</hi>

And although they did not preſently agree, becauſe they would not endure to hear that the prey which they had got ſhould be owned as part of their pay, yet their minds being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by treaty and diſcourſe, and for purging their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer crimes, they turned all their ſtrength againſt the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> or where they had remained in the Arch-duke's lands, they exacted their tributes; and in other things being indempnified, they were reconciled, the <hi>Mauricians</hi> in vain urging their promiſes, whom they deſpiſed as being inferiour to them in number.

There marched out of it three thouſand Souldiers, who had ſcarce left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them any remains of life, part of whom died as they went away.

Many new inventions were at this Siege found out by the beſiegers: of which one was a Bridge, a ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Targon</hi>'s, with brazen wheels, and was drawn by horſes; one part of it was bound together with Cables, that it might not be eaſily penetrated with ſhot: this by the ejection of a beam was lifted up on high, ſo that it might fall down by looſing the ropes that held it up. This they placed upon a platform, which, as we
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:55798:396"/>
related before, was in the form of a half-moon beyond the <hi>Gollet.</hi> But this vaſt and ſumptuous work ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ridiculous, one of the wheels being ſtrucken off with the bullets; afterwards ſome Poles, as high as a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt, being fixed in the trench of the Bulwark, by them that maſſy Engine was broken and ſpoiled: Therefore they turned all their force againſt the Weſt part, and drew ſome lines beyond the old Haven, and on the backſide of the Town. And now the outermoſt Work that joyned to the Town was taken, for part of it being blown up with gun-powder, it was in vain to defend the reſt. Then the <hi>Porcupine</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi> by little and little decayed and were loſt. And now was the whole face of affairs full of horror, for the Enemy to get into the Town, and they on the other ſide to keep him out, were unawares and in the dark intangled one among another in caves and paſſages under ground, and by the uncertain ſigns of fire, oftentimes thoſe devices turning to the damages of their authors. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> being worn out by long dangers, (for every one had his proper ſtation and buſineſs, that it might the more clearly be looked after, and kindle emulation in each other) the <hi>Germans</hi> were inticed with rewards to aſſault <hi>Sand-hill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

From hence they went by ſecret waies under ground into the old Town; ſometimes the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged ſallied, and in ſtead of the Works which they had loſt, they raiſed new ones more inwardly, which out of a vain humour and conceit of the long continuing of the ſiege they named <hi>Troy.</hi> For the freſh ground being in it ſelf looſe, and not ſufficient to reſiſt the ſhot, though it was in the midſt of Summer, as often as the
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:55798:397"/>
wind blew off from the Sea, all things were laid open to ruine. Inſomuch that now the <hi>States</hi> themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider the infinite charge, and the loſſes of the Souldiers not much inferiour to the greateſt Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and that <hi>Oſtend</hi> it ſelf being ſo incloſed with Forts could be of no uſe.

And now the greateſt part of Autumn being ſpent, time was paſt for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to undertake any thing elſe, and Winter was coming, which was both dangerous and dreadful to the beſieged.

Therefore command was given to Colonel <hi>Marquette,</hi> that he ſhould ſet an end to that tedious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon as honourable terms as he could; which was accordingly done. And firſt of all the Ships and other Veſſels were ſent away with part of the Artillery: Then Commiſſioners were ſent, who deſired that all in the Town might freely march out with their Arms and four Cannon, and that all Priſoners ſhould be exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; which <hi>Spinola</hi> eaſily granted, either out of an high eſtee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Three thouſand, marching through the midſt of the Enemie's Camp, came to <hi>Scluys</hi> to the Prince, who received them not as overcome, but gave them praiſes and thanks as Conquerors.

came to ſee the place, for which they had offered up ſo many vows, and been at ſo infinite an expence of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, time and bloud, (themſelves proteſting the loſs of fifty thouſand men, and that a greater number of the beſieged was killed.) They found nothing but an empty and confuſed plat of ground; here full of rude and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen heaps, there falling into great and uneven holes, with ſuch confuſed remains of Fortifications, that by looking thereon, one could ſcarce imagine which were made for the defence, or which for the aſſailing the Town. The Townſmen that lived there before went thence to <hi>Scluys;</hi> and although the Arch-duke granted many Privileges to the place, yet of a long time none would inhabit it, looking upon it as a place of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and defiled with the bloud and bones of dead men, which is generally repugnant to the nature of moſt men.</p>
               <p>Beſides thoſe Embaſſadors which I mentioned before, King <hi>Philip</hi> and the Arch-duke ſent into <hi>England</hi> more: to wit, this ſent <hi>Don John Richardot,</hi> and <hi>Don Lewis Verrcikem;</hi> but he, <hi>Don Ferdinando Velaſco</hi> Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and <hi>Don Alexandro Roverti</hi> a Senator of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n;</hi> both of them very deſirous of Peace, not ſo much out of fear of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as that they might draw the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to reaſon, by taking away their props and ſupporters. Nor wanted there ſome in that warlike Nation that perſuaded to Warre, repeating in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Parliament (which was then met) the ancient al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the many leagues and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, long before <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> unjuſtly drove <hi>Jacoba</hi> married to a <hi>Britan</hi> out of her Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: And the reaſon given for this amity was, that without it the Sea could be ſafe to neither, and it would grow from thence that Trading would be full and free.
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:55798:398"/>
On the contrary, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had no need of Peace, for Warre was more beneficial to them. And it was chiefly to be provided that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould not by extremity be compelled to joyn either with the <hi>French,</hi> the ancient Enemies of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> or the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> Enemies for Religion ſake and the thirſt of Dominion. It hath been evident by too many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that who had the dominion of the Sea would eaſily be Maſter of <hi>Britain.</hi> But the King not at all moved herewith, and ſuppoſing there was ſtrength enough both in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> for that, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Peace, and this, Warre; thereupon refuſing the ſociety of Arms offered againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he agreed to a Peace. Beſides the Articles uſual in Leagues, there were added certain concerning free Navigation, ſuch as was before the Warre, and upon paiment of the ſame Cuſtomes. Nothing was ſpoken of <hi>America</hi> or the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not endure to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was obſtinate to admit none; ſo that matter was left to the deciſion of him that was moſt potent. Concerning Religion it was agreed, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould not be compelled in <hi>Spain</hi> to goe to their Churches: That when they met the conſecrated Hoſt, they ſhould doe reverence thereto, unleſs they choſe rather to goe out of the way. Theſe that follow pertained to the <hi>Hollanders: viz.</hi> That neither of them ſhould help the others Enemies or Rebels, nor ſhould ſuffer them to be helped by any of their Subjects: That the facts of private perſons ſhould be anſwered for by themſelves, but the publick Peace not be hazarded thereby. But the <hi>Britans</hi> denied to deliver the <hi>Briel</hi> or <hi>Fluſhing</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> affirming it was contrary to the faith contained in their Articles: in the <hi>interim</hi> the Souldiers that kept thoſe Towns ſhould be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:55798:398"/>
in the Warre, but ſhould doe their endeavours for pacifying the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and if that were delaied, yet that at leaſt there ſhould be an open and free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> in point of trade: That there ſhould not reſide at one time in the Ports of either above ſix or eight of the others Ships of Warre: That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be forbidden to carry the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> Commodities into <hi>Spain,</hi> or the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes into <hi>Holland.</hi> Thus that Warre being ended, King <hi>James,</hi> that he might take away the cauſe of all inteſtine diſcords, by obliterating the names of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> would have both to be united and grow up into one Kingdome by communicative Laws, and to be called <hi>Britain,</hi> undertaking herein a difficult matter, and which was agitated with great contentions, while the yet freſh differences and emulations would hardly allow thereof, as the foundation of a ſolid good to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. Soon after, according to theſe agreements with <hi>Albertus,</hi> he requires the <hi>Hollanders</hi> not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the <hi>Britans</hi> to come out of the Sea into the <hi>Scheld</hi> to paſs to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> paying Cuſtomes equal to their Subjects. But they excuſed it, by ſhewing that they had good reaſon for their Decree, that none ſhould goe to the Enemy, unleſs they firſt changed their Ships, that ſo they might the more certainly have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things. Nor ought he to take it ill, that they impoſed Laws upon a River within their own Juriſdiction, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> durſt deny the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Seas even to their friends. And ſo that he might convert the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were accuſed as infamous for Piracy, to innocent gain, he forbad any to fight at Sea under a forein command, but conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at any that went hither or thither to a land Warre.</p>

                  <pb n="780" facs="tcp:55798:399"/>By another Edict the Jeſuites and all other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical perſons that received not ſacred. Orders ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of the Kingdome of <hi>Britain</hi> were baniſhed thence, ſetting out for cauſe, that that ſort of men taught that the Pope might abſolve Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their obedience to Kings of another Religion, then which there is not any opinion more dangerous to Government. But at the ſame time the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites were reſtored in <hi>France</hi> upon ſome conditions, from whence they had formerly been baniſhed, when by their inſtructions a young man fought to murther the King. But now the monument was deſtroyed which kept the memory of that fact freſh, together with the Jeſuites infamy; the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> crying out, that by that one work the authority of the moſt honourable Order and the ſecurity of <hi>France</hi> were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted together. But the King, with his own great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as many ominouſly feared, unterrified, merely to gratifie the Pope, admitted and favoured theſe ſtout de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of his power.</p>
               <p>Between this King and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> aroſe ſome new cauſes of hatred upon old diſcontents. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Villeroy,</hi> a perſon highly entruſted and favoured by King <hi>Henry,</hi> had a ſervant named <hi>Hoſtius,</hi> whoſe induſtry and ingenuity (himſelf being much imployed otherwiſe) he uſed in the decyphering and reading of Letters and private Characters. This man, being hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, gave intelligence of all the greateſt affairs of State to one Monſieur <hi>Raffee</hi> a <hi>French</hi>-man, but baniſhed and living in <hi>Spain,</hi> who diſcovered them to King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>'s Counſellors: by which having ſuch inſight into all the private counſels of <hi>France,</hi> it was eaſie for them to gueſs at all things elſe: Some things alſo being diſcovered to the King of <hi>Britain,</hi> had ingendred
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:55798:399"/>
animoſities and jealouſies. This Treaſon being dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>Raffee, Hoſtius</hi> firſt by flight, and afterwards by a ſudden death, prevented further inquiſition. There was alſo at this time another matter ſtirred up by a Woman, which was this: <hi>Henrica,</hi> the daughter of Monſieur <hi>Interaque,</hi> was eſteemed among the firſt for her beauty and pleaſantneſs of wit; wherewith the King being allured, (to whom there was hardly any other crime to be objected then theſe looſe Affections) the better to compaſs the end of his unlawful deſires, had promiſed her marriage, if ſhe bare him a Son; and this promiſe he confirmed to her by writing. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Medices</hi> was preferred before her in marriage, ſhe was compelled, to pacifie the Queen, to deliver up this writing of the King's. Whereupon diſſembling higher deſigns under the pretence of ſolitude and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſhe aimed to compaſs forein wealth, wherewith ſhe might ſecure her Son againſt the Queen's anger and malice, and not onely ſo, as ſhe publickly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, (and as others interpreted it) but alſo that he might therewith aſſert his right and claim to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The King of <hi>Britain</hi> refuſed to give any ear to them for the diſturbance of another's Kingdome; but the <hi>Spaniard</hi> approved her cauſe, and promiſed largely to aſſiſt her therein. When theſe things firſt became known, the Lady her ſelf, her Father and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Count of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> were taken; but King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> pardoned them, acknowledging his own miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in their crime. But <hi>Philip</hi> fearing, leſt <hi>Henry</hi> enraged with theſe things ſhould from thence take a cauſe to make Warre, he ended the quarrel begun about the Cuſtomes, which he had lately raiſed by Edict; and turning his fury againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> commanded all of that Nation to depart out of his
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:55798:400"/>
Dominions, and all Merchandiſe afterwards brought in to be forfeited.</p>
               <p>This year was celebrated in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Funeral pomp for Count <hi>Peter Mansfelde,</hi> who for fourty years had faithfully ſerved the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the higheſt Commands, being then Preſident of <hi>Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenburg,</hi> who, though all his life converſant in Warre, had yet by rare fortune lived even to the extremity of old age.

Such of the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> as affected the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Government believed, and ſo ſaid, having great emulation to the Cities of <hi>Holland,</hi> and malicious inclinations, that they would fall under the weight of that Greatneſs they had drawn upon themſelves, or elſe would become a prey to forein Princes, unleſs they returned to their old obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, whereof for ſo many ages they had had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; onely with theſe additions to the old Laws: That the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Government ſhould not revolve to the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> That the right of Commerce ſhould be free and indefinite; That Religion ſhould not be forcibly or with puniſhments urged, in hope of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a more united Concord; That as well the forein Souldiers, as that plague of mankinde, the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſhould be expelled; That the chief honours ſhould remain in the Citizens, and all affairs of greateſt concernment ſhould be handled in the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:55798:401"/>
of the Provinces; which liberty would continue more ſubſtantial if it were uſed with moderation. On the other ſide, ſome in <hi>France</hi> perſuaded the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> to ſeparate themſelves from the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria;</hi> That the name of Archduke was but a vanity, without power, without authority, his Forces being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the Enemy, his Authority ſwallowed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> and when the <hi>Netherlands</hi> ſhould be exhauſted and <hi>Spain</hi> impoveriſhed, what hopes had they of protracting the Warre? certainly, onely this one, the wealth of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which alſo in time would fail them, and become a propriety to him that is moſt prevalent at Sea. That the twenty ſeveral Mutinies and Seditions of the Souldiers have made <hi>Albertus</hi> his Government infamous; and if while thoſe jealouſies and hatreds encreaſed among them the <hi>French</hi> ſhould have ſtirred, they might have lain upon the Country and devoured the fields, which of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity muſt have produced deſolation and poverty. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould return and unite themſelves to the Body of <hi>France</hi> voluntarily, and of their own accord, rather then be compelled thereto by force; by which means they ſhould remain ſetled in the ancient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned ſeat of their Anceſtors, which muſt needs pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and be loſt if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould be victorious. That there are nine Forts or Caſtles erected for a ſmall reſiſtence of all Invaders, from whence the original of that Nation is extracted, of whom 'tis queſtioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they exceed more in cruelty or pride, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards incloſed by the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſhore of their own Ocean. That the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, grown to a vaſt magnitude, would govern its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with more moderation, and for the future ſettle Peace by a ſettled and hereditary ſucceſſion, according
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:55798:401"/>
to the <hi>Salick</hi> Law: That this ſhould be to them no loſs, becauſe they ſhould enjoy in common all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and benefits of <hi>France.</hi> Some there were alſo in <hi>Germany</hi> who equally conſidered from hence the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> greatneſs, on the other ſide the abſtruſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whoſe fortune was daily bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by Warre; nor could they be concluded by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering. That it were both more honourable and eaſie for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to repel the <hi>Turk</hi> with thoſe Arms he uſeth againſt theſe; or elſe he might compenſate any ſmall damage of his Government by propagating and encreaſing his limits elſewhere. That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> might buy their Liberty for money: for Empires have their ſetled foundations and periods, ſo that when they are arrived to the higheſt pitch of Greatneſs, they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly decreaſe. Of late the <hi>Spaniards</hi> neither deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Tunis</hi> nor <hi>Goleta,</hi> nor did the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family look after <hi>Switzerland.</hi> So alſo muſt he looſe theſe people; and as they chiefly withdraw themſelves, ſo were they to be ſuſpected from the remembrance of the Warre, and by the diſcord of Religion, working great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice even from their example: beſides, part of them were purchaſed from the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> ſo that he may with equal juſtice ſell what he had bought. Theſe were the diſcourſes abroad: but at home, beſides a few in whoſe hands lay the managery of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and by whom all counſels and advices were ordered, the reſt, calling to minde how great the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s pride was, how reſolutely determined never to agree with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> threw aſide all hopes, the Fates having yet kept in obſcurity any glimmering of an end of this ſo great and long a Warre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="786" facs="tcp:55798:402"/>And now the <hi>States,</hi> to <hi>Maximilian Cocheyne</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Emperour's commands, as alſo to the Legates of <hi>Mentz, Saxony</hi> and others deſiring ſafe conduct, free paſſage, and time and place for a Treaty, being all things of moment, and ſuch as uſually work with the common people, returned this Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they were not unmindful what damages they had received by former Treaties: Nor were</hi> Germany <hi>or the Emperour, although names highly reverenced by them, of any power againſt the treacherous dealings of their Enemies. That the</hi> Hollanders <hi>were deſirous of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then that, the fear of Warre being laid aſide, they might enjoy what they had attained with ſo many dangers, and ſo perſevering an induſtry; and therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo long intreated the aid of their neighbours, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Arms imminent over them by a moderate Peace, and having afterwards gotten to themſelves a ſolid and well-ſetled liberty from a fatal neceſsity, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and confirmed by Kings and Princes, they would not change it for a deceitful Peace. That they had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore entred into Covenants with the</hi> Netherlandiſh <hi>Lords, and were now ready to renew the ſame; for it was evidently ſeen how ſmall the authority of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes was, ſince</hi> Spinola <hi>a Foreiner received his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the</hi> Netherlands <hi>by Commiſſion from</hi> Spain, <hi>They never refuſed a ſafe and well-grounded Peace, ſo as Religion might be ſafe, and the Commonwealth not hazarded: But if that opinion remained, that as there ought to be but one Pope for the ruling Eccleſiaſtical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſo for the Government of Temporal matters there ſhould be but one King, and that the Monarch of</hi> Spain; Germany <hi>ſhould ſee that the</hi> Hollanders <hi>would not be wanting either to their own or the publick ſafety. As to
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:55798:402"/>
the buſineſs ſpoken of concerning damages done by them, they would endeavour that their Juſtice and Equity ſhould not be blamed. That they ſhould be reputed very raſh and inconſiderate, if they ſhould deliver up any ſtrong Holds while</hi> Spinola <hi>lay about the</hi> Rhine: <hi>they knew</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <hi>it ſelf might thus be forewarned; if they would conſider</hi> Mendoſa<hi>'s Army, and the contumelious injuries received by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time came forth a Book written by <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Renes,</hi> a learned man and of good repute in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, of which he had deſerved well for writing the Annals thereof in the native Language: this man, the Author, being dead, the Book was ſet forth and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by his friends; diſcourſing of many things as well ancient as novel, and relating the many tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and oppreſſions of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and what treacherous Leagues thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces uſed towards other people, eſpecially thoſe whom the Pope abſolved by a Religious kinde of perjury; and ſetting forth that from thence the danger was equal both to the Catholicks and Reformed people; and that there was no other iſſue to be expected then by Conqueſt, ſince thoſe waies which are abſolutely deſperate to men are yet evident and well known to God.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were minded diſcurſively, the Warre in the mean time is ſpurred on in good earneſt. For thoſe Forces that had been taken up at <hi>Oſtend</hi> made a great acceſſion of ſtrength to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome Regiments came out of <hi>France</hi> to their aid, the King ſending them advice that they ſhould firſt draw out into the Field, for it would be more for their advantage to be before-hand with the Enemy,
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:55798:403"/>
then to let him get the ſtart of them. But in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> Forces were levied and raiſed for both parties with a vendible faith, as they met Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Fortune, or elſe as Religion led any man to one ſide or the other. Alſo the <hi>Hollanders</hi> haſted to raiſe money with all ſpeed; but the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> under the Archduke came to it with leſs willingneſs and more delay, for that the Warre was maintained againſt their will, and they were jealous of the ill managing of the Treaſury: beſides, the United <hi>States</hi> had increaſed their diſpleaſure, by writing to the Nobles of affairs that concerned the common good; which things ſo terrified <hi>Albertus,</hi> that he would not ſuffer a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Provinces under him, though often before and at that time chiefly the ſame was deſired, fearing leſt by his denial of many things he ſhould become unable to reſiſt their envy, or the authority of the <hi>States</hi> being contemned, they ſhould, according to their neighbour example, fall to direct force; his Letters to his friends detecting this his fear, which the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> intercepting ſent to the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Nobles. Therefore <hi>Albertus,</hi> notwithſtanding the waving of his conſent, permitted the Provinces ſeverally to meet, cheriſhing thoſe that were diſcontented in minde with the hope of money from the <hi>Indies,</hi> which the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ſucceſsful <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet had brought, or elſe of an approaching Peace, if the Warre were more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly followed for a little time.</p>
               <p>The beginning of the year among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was ſpent in idleneſs and repoſe among the ſweets and blandiſhments of mirth, while <hi>Don Ambroſio Spinola,</hi> having now the whole command of the Warre, (he was but newly come from <hi>Spain,</hi> where he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the King concerning the method of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:55798:403"/>
thereof) had likewiſe beſtowed on him the honour of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> and before the King of Great <hi>Britain's</hi> Embaſſadour was ſworn to the peace with <hi>Albertus.</hi> Now alſo was the ſettlement of the Kingdome of <hi>Spain</hi> upon the Male iſſue celebrated with pompous Shews and publick Prayers and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings.</p>
               <p>At the height of the Spring, and not before, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> having gathered together his Forces, by the direction of the <hi>States</hi> he undertakes a great work; for he went to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> of old the moſt flouriſhing City of all the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and now, the general Trade being gone to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> retaining their formerly-gotten wealth and renown. A great hope of glory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited him to the gaining thereof; for about twenty years before, in the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s time, while the Affairs of the Union were wholly unſetled, by a long and difficult Siege, ſcarcely grown into a full ſucceſs, yet ſuch was the Victor's vainglorious oſtentation, as made the World believe that in that one City he had gained the poſſeſſion of the whole <hi>Netherlands.</hi> It was ſerious and conſiderate advice, to ſhut up this large and ſpacious City with ſmall Forces, by overflowing all the adjacent plain Fields with the River <hi>Scheld,</hi> and pitching their Camps on the higher ground; but there appeared no ſufficient reaſon of ſeiſing the oppoſite bank of the River on the edge of <hi>Flanders.</hi> Some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to ſend Souldiers through the Country by night-marches out of <hi>Cazant:</hi> but Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> himſelf choſe rather to goe by Ship; which while it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring with great endevour, as fortuned, the Enemy immediately grew jealous, and gave out in ſpeeches that <hi>Antwerp</hi> ſhould be attempted. This News was received with various affections of the Townsmen:
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:55798:404"/>
part of them rejoycing, as if their Liberty was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh; others, imagining a ſcarcity would follow, preſently began to inhance the price of Victuals; and many, gathering together their wealth and riches, thought to betake themſelves to flight. But <hi>Spinola</hi> ſending thither ſome Horſe encouraged ſuch as were afraid, the ſame Horſe behaving themſelves modeſtly, and without injury of the Citizens: then viewed all the coaſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which ſituate over againſt <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> is called <hi>Waeſenland,</hi> and left there three thouſand foot-Souldiers in Guard, that were to wait upon the Enemie's motion; for he was not ignorant that the Enemy could not poſſeſs the River, unleſs by drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Fields and placing Guards he made that coaſt alſo his own. Wherefore, chuſing a particular day, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> with a ſtrong Party went to <hi>Bergen op Zoom,</hi> and Count <hi>Erneſt</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> bringing the reſt of the Souldiers in the Fleet out of <hi>Zeland</hi> came into the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and firſt of all paſſing with good ſucceſs all the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Forts, when he came near <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> among the Enemie's Sconces, although in the night, he could not paſs unſeen, but was forced to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail the <hi>Flandrian</hi> banks through all the Enemie's Shot; but they which kept Guard in thoſe parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred up by the noiſe of the bullets, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the interpoſition of the banks, following the fails, Count <hi>Erneſt,</hi> the wind beating back the Ships into <hi>Brabant,</hi> was hindred to come and joyn his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where he was commanded, being otherwiſe enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to fight at diſadvantage with a reſolute and well-provided Enemy. However, to try his fortune, in ſmall boats he tranſports almoſt four hundred men, that were eaſily routed by the firſt ſhock of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and other part of them were taken; Colonel
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:55798:404"/>
                  <hi>Dorpen,</hi> by the violent purſuit of the Enemy, leaping armed into the River, eſcaped one danger with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Count <hi>Erneſt</hi> being driven back into <hi>Brabant,</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> diſappointed of his deſign, compells the Caſtle of <hi>Woude,</hi> ſituate not farre from <hi>Berck,</hi> within five daies to ſurrender; which was too mean a prize for ſo great an Army to look after, and too ſmall a reward for them that had before them ſo great hopes: yet ſome ſatisfaction it yielded, for from thence the Enemy infeſted the Rivers with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies.</p>
               <p>But theſe great threats happened not onely to be in vain, but to fall out quite contrary, ſo that the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> had not of a long time a more unfortunate year. While Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> ſtaid at <hi>Woude, Spinola,</hi> though at that time the Court there was full of mirth concerning the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadour, was not ſlow to take into his thoughts more ſerious affairs among thoſe pleaſant diverſions, but made a Bridge over the <hi>Scheld,</hi> that went towards the Enemy which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhould turn, by which means he was ready to purſue; and therefore was the more ſevere to thoſe that ſurrendred <hi>Woude,</hi> as guilty of an over-haſty and cowardly fear, ſo that he puniſhed ſome of them with death. Nor did the United <hi>States</hi> a little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and grow afraid at the report of theſe great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces approaching with <hi>Spinola,</hi> not reſolved whether they had beſt aſſault or defend; but the Prince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to remain about <hi>Rhine,</hi> leſt the Enemy that way ſhould invade the undefended parts of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. And his opinion prevailing, command was given to goe into <hi>Flanders</hi> and to call a Councel at <hi>Scluys.</hi> And now they thought fit to beſiege the <hi>t'Zas</hi> not farre from <hi>Gaunt,</hi> where the waters run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:55798:405"/>
from thence fall into the <hi>Hont,</hi> and ſo into the Sea: which if they brought to paſs with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, they threatned ſome Cities; but if not, yet they would retain there <hi>Spinola</hi>'s ſtrength threatning the cruelty of a grievous Warre to other places.</p>
               <p>Not farre from <hi>Yſendike</hi> Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> ſate down with his Army which he had brought by Ship to <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfleet,</hi> whom <hi>Spinola,</hi> ſending ſome part of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before, immediately follows; and at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bucholt,</hi> which was between him and the <hi>t'Zas,</hi> ſettles himſelf, as a fit place either to overſee or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Enemie's endevours. Thus they remained a great while in view of each other, without any thing done by either, ſave a few light skirmiſhes of the Horſe. One time <hi>Pompeio Juſtiniano</hi> by <hi>Spinola</hi>'s command entred the mariſhes, in hope to have bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Sutlers Boats, which lay hard by Prince <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>'s Camp; but being eſpied by the Sentinels he was ſoon met and repulſed. In that Region over againſt <hi>Walcheren</hi> lies the Fort <hi>Patientia,</hi> in the aſſault whereof Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> intended to drive away idleneſs: but <hi>Spinola</hi> took a little Fort that lay in the middle of the way, and joyned it to his Camp with a continued Breaſtwork: but Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Camp lying in a wet and unwholeſome ſoil, what with diſeaſes, and what with runnings away, was almoſt emptied. But Fortune recompenced at Sea this ſlow and protracted Warre at Land; from whence, ſince the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> until theſe very times that which was reckoned among the great burthens of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> (to wit, that his beſt and choiceſt Souldiers muſt of neceſſity be brought afarre off out of <hi>Italy</hi> by long Marches into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> being in the interim of no uſe, though they were an extraordinary
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:55798:405"/>
charge and burthen) was now eaſed by <hi>Spinola;</hi> for he brought by Sea out of <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf into the Ports of <hi>Flanders</hi> what Forces he had occaſion for. Twelve hundred Souldiers, trained up in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Warres by Colonel <hi>Pedro Sarmienti,</hi> were at <hi>Lisbone</hi> put aboard eight Ships and ſome little Barks, the charge of all which was given to <hi>Pedro Cumiara,</hi> whoſe particular inſtruction among others was this, That if he could not get in at <hi>Flanders,</hi> avoiding the coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> he ſhould goe to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſhore, where by the help of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſadour they might have ſafe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and that he ſhould there receive ſuch of the <hi>Britans</hi> as he had hired and purchaſed by gifts. But the United <hi>States,</hi> that they might for the future reſtrain the like bold attempts by terrour, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>William Hauteene</hi> Admiral of <hi>Zeland</hi> to meet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the narrow Sea towards <hi>Bulloyn,</hi> and without any pity to drown all the Priſoners they took in the Sea. Now it is to be obſerved that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not brought in Ships of Warre, but of burthen, ſuch as could with moſt eaſe lurk upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Britiſh</hi> or <hi>German</hi> coaſts. But <hi>Hauteene</hi> with part of his Fleet coaſting about <hi>Flanders,</hi> and with the reſidue going along the ſhores of <hi>Britain,</hi> by this means met with whatever paſſed in the middle of the Chanel. Thus paſſing along at laſt he met his Enemies about <hi>Dover;</hi> who when they would not ſtrike ſail, but voluntarily ſtood in their own defence by ſhooting, part of them were ſlain, the reſt eſcaped either by ſwimming, or the help of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Boats which came in to their ſuccour and took them up. Another Ship, coming even into the harbor, was ſo beſet with two Ships of <hi>Zeland,</hi> that at laſt they all ſtruck upon the Flats and Quickſands: but the <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
                  <pb n="794" facs="tcp:55798:406"/>
as they were leſs in bulk, ſo more light to avoid and eſcape a danger, not onely aſſaulted, but took and brought off the Enemie's Veſſel. The Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, according to command, were thrown into the Sea: the Souldiers and ſuch as had long been in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice much complaining of Fortune, not that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them of their lives, which they knew was but ſhort at the beſt, and whereof they could not in regard of their age hope the long continuance; but that they, being a people ſworn to fight, ſhould not die vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly as Souldiers with their ſwords in their hands, but ſhould be helpleſsly ſwallowed up in the all-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring waves of the Sea. The next day ſome more Ships were taken, and one burned, all the Souldiers ſuffering the like ſevere fate, being tied two together, which upon a ſign given were all at once thrown over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. One ſaying he had no need of the Enemie's hands to haſten on his death, voluntarily leaped into the Sea, who though he was unknown among all that obſcure company, yet was covetous of honor even to his laſt. This ſlaughter conſumed almoſt the one half of the men and Ships; for four of them by the help of the wind got into the Haven, yet were many of the men there wounded and ſlain even by the Enemie's ſhot. But the Souldiers in <hi>Dover,</hi> while theſe Enemies fought at Sea, a great while looking on, at laſt grew angry to have the War brought into their Juriſdiction, and ſhot from the Caſtle in aid of their late Enemies againſt their old Friends. The <hi>Britans</hi> recriminating the <hi>Hollanders</hi> for theſe attempts, were afterwards anſwered, that they did not ſeek for any Ships in the Rivers of <hi>England,</hi> which yet the <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerkers</hi> without any notice taken thereof had done, but they looked rather at their Enemy growing hot
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:55798:406"/>
by the force of Victory, then either the confines or boundaries of Sea and Land. But they could not ſo eaſily purge themſelves, becauſe under pretence of ſearching the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who contrary to the King's Proclamation made War at Sea, they had not long ſince drawn to their ſhore the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, which were take as a prey by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and vindicating King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Embaſſadour, had under pretence of right eluded the force of War. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that lately were driven thither by the deſperate ſtorms of the Sea before Winter, remained there at great charge, which was very grievous to their Maſters; and in the interim, while in a miſerable condition they continued on the bare ſhore in poor little cottages by them erected, either lived in great poverty, or died languiſhing: for not a few of them died of ſickneſs and wounds, among whom was <hi>Cumiara</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now arrived out of <hi>Italy</hi> ſix ſtrong Regiments by their uſual way of marching by Land, beſides new levies made by the Archduke in the neighbour King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: nor otherwiſe came the parties to ſo great ſtrength: for <hi>Spinola</hi> when he was in <hi>Spain</hi> with the King, replete with the honor and authority of taking <hi>Oſtend,</hi> had eaſily perſuaded him, that this lingring War, advantageous to the Enemy, might eaſily have an end ſet thereto, if the King would contract his long-continued gifts; and to this purpoſe he gave for his word, and inſcribed on all his Enſigns this Motto, <hi>Jam aut nunquam,</hi> Now or never. Wherefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind the frequent miſchiefs that had ariſen by Sedition, he required money and two Armies; with the one of which he would defend his own limits, and with the other would invade <hi>Frieſeland;</hi> and to that purpoſe
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:55798:407"/>
provided all things neceſſary in plenty: for the Tributes beyond the <hi>Rhine</hi> being gotten by them would be a great damage to the Enemy; beſides, many Cities now poſſeſſed by the Enemy, which at preſent the Rivers defended, would become a new bound, and there would be need of a ſtrong Army to ſcatter the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And this with the greater hope was to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, in regard from thence the very entrails of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would lie open to them both by Sea and Land. This was wiſe counſel, as the firſt ſucceſſes made it ſeem; but the reſt being not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed according to hope, I will proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
               <p>The Generals yet remaining in <hi>Flanders,</hi> while the Prince at <hi>Scluys</hi> took care to fortify <hi>Yſendike,</hi> and <hi>Spinola</hi> attempted him with falſe alarms, Count <hi>Bucquoy</hi> having with a ſtrong party not far from <hi>Colen</hi> driven the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Ships out of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> (for he had carried with him great Guns) paſſed the River, to the great terror of the <hi>German</hi> Cities round about, from whoſe remembrance the Villanies of <hi>Mendoſa</hi>'s time, and the many indignities they had ſuffered, were not yet baniſhed. At the muſtring of the forces, the Pope's Legate was preſent, ſolemnly praying that their Arms might be victorious, and encouraging them to goe on chearfully, and be deliverers to ſuch as were orthodox, but to take vengeance on the reſt; That it was not ſo much their Prince's as God's cauſe they maintained, whoſe Altars and Temples being defiled and ſacrilegiouſly converted to other uſes, he would they ſhould be reſtored by their hands.</p>
               <p>When they were come to <hi>Keyſerſweert,</hi> (where ſome of old ſuppoſed a <hi>Trojane</hi> Colony remained) they
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:55798:407"/>
begin to erect a Fort on both banks of the River, to ſecure the paſſage. The Bridge that lay over the <hi>Rhine</hi> was made at <hi>Colen,</hi> whence alſo great ſtore of Victualls was brought as long as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> affairs were in a thriving condition, the Senate of that City publickly therein manifeſting their affection. Which things being heard by Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> conjecturing from his own and <hi>Mendoſa</hi>'s former practices, that no man would goe into his Enemie's country that way and leave <hi>Berck</hi> behind him, thereupon he ſent his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> and Count <hi>Erneſt</hi> with four thouſand foot and two thouſand horſe, to whom the <hi>States</hi> added Deputies from their own Aſſembly. Nor did they delay to make it their firſt care to ſtrengthen <hi>Berck,</hi> taking into their Works (which they made exceeding ſtrong) a great ſpace of ground without the Town, whereby the greater delay might be put upon the Enemy, and the Garriſon have the better room. Within theſe they kept the Souldiers, although <hi>Over-Iſſell</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Frieſeland,</hi> and <hi>Lingen</hi> eſpecially, required freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Souldiers, and what other things are neceſſary in Warre. But the care of the Publick here was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by private fear; but at length five companies were ſent to <hi>Lingen.</hi> In the mean while the <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavian</hi> horſe twice met the Enemy and beat him. And while the Summer was yet in its prime, the Marqueſs <hi>Spinola,</hi> leaving in <hi>Flanders Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Heremberg,</hi> (who had the command of ſix thouſand foot and five hundred horſe) himſelf haſted to <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoy</hi>'s men and the reſt whom he had ſent before; and privately obſerves <hi>Roeroort,</hi> a place where the River <hi>Roer</hi> runs into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> fit to be fortified; which he doth. Then calling together all his chief Officers, who till this time were ignorant to what uſe
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:55798:408"/>
all theſe preparations were, he opens his mind to them, and tells them he would firſt goe to <hi>Lingen,</hi> the chief Fortreſs of all thoſe parts, which would eaſily be taken, if he made haſte, becauſe there were but few Souldiers therein, and they unexperienced in Warre. But the chief point of all conſiſted in this, that they might prevent the Enemie's ſupplies which were coming to <hi>Lingen;</hi> and this might be done if they would diligently follow <hi>Berck. Groll</hi> and other Towns, whoſe names were unknown to him. He was not ignorant how contrary this was to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of former Captains, to throw himſelf into the fartheſt part of his Enemie's Country, leaving the whole Countrey behind him Hoſtile; but as matters proceeded, ſo were counſells to be altered, for no precepts would ever ſerve at all times, and ſometimes more advantage is gotten by daring then by too much warineſs. He had now choſen the beſt time, while their fruit and corn was ripe and not yet carried away; and the Towns on the edge of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> would freely bring in Victualls, if they might be paid for the ſame. This alſo he had taken care for. That although it were true that Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> would come thither, yet it would be a great while firſt, for he was not provided for a land-march, and he would goe where neither a Fleet nor the uſual Rivers could bring him; and at laſt when he did come, there were the plain fields which would afford room to fight, which was as earneſtly deſired by his Souldiers, as it would be carefully avoided by the Enemy.</p>
               <p>As to the Forts taken by <hi>Bucquoy,</hi> it was debated whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould be diſmantled, or repaired at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and defended. Moſt were of opinion that it was dangerous to goe into the Territories of others and with
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:55798:408"/>
divided forces to break both their ſtrength and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Spinola</hi> agreed with the fewer in number, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Bucquoy</hi> to take up the cool and ſhady places up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>German</hi> bank of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and for the encreaſe and keeping his Works he gave him ſix thouſand men, which were chiefly new and raw Souldiers, and not able to undergoe a hard march. By this ſhew of an Army, the care for <hi>Berck</hi> taken by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> was a vain, and hindred them from ſending their forces to prevent real dangers, for fear leſt the journey into <hi>Frieſeland</hi> being but pretended, <hi>Spinola,</hi> when the Souldiers were drawn away, ſhould rather draw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his ſtrength thither. He conceived nine thouſand foot and about two thouſand horſe were enoUgh to goe along with himſelf, as knowing Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s forces were tired, and part thereof were to remain in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to reſiſt Count <hi>Heremberg.</hi> The foot marched being divided into three Bodies, to every of which appertained Cannon, to the number of eleven in all. The Flanks were ſecured by the Carriages, wherein were brought the Victualls, Boats and Bridges for paſſing of Rivers and Mariſhes, all which alſo had their guards: but the Front and Rear was defended by the Horſe. <hi>Spinola</hi> himſelf went in the Van, ſending before him Scouts and Pioneers to ſearch the ways and level them: where the country grew more Champain, for haſtning the journey the firſt and middle Battel proceeded on together, the ranks of the Carriages being doubled; and in the ſtead of a Trench were Night-watches, which were defended by great Guns and troups of horſe. In the day-time the middle-ward ſucceeded the Van, and the Rear the middle-ward in certain turns. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hen was it found by a great experiment, that vices however having gotten to a head, yet are eaſily brought
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:55798:409"/>
into order and reformed, if there be but a perſevering care: for the General quickly reſtored that Diſcipline which for a long time had been corrupted by Sedition and licenciouſneſs; becauſe as he was carefull in giving the Souldiers their pay, and bountifull in rewarding every good action they did, ſo he was inexorable to offenders, and would not be obſervant to any ones humor; Not onely thefts and rapines, but without leave to depart from their Colours was a capital offence, the Provoſt-marſhall riding about, and with him the Hangman with a halter: by which means, and the hanging of ſome few for ſmall faults in the ſight of the Army, he cured all the reſt. <hi>Philip Croy</hi> Count <hi>Solre</hi> was ſent to the next Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> by taking away from them fear, to purchaſe favour: for they did not as heretofore run on violently with diſobedience and fury, for their Officers were with them to keep them in awe, and the Souldiers themſelves were accuſtomed to obey, and ſuch as could diſtinguiſh between Peace and War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were neither oppreſſive nor burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the Towns or Country, all they deſired was but Victualls at a reaſonable rate, and that they might have a free paſſage through the Country. Nor did their actions in ought differ from their words; ſo that all kinds of proviſions were plentifully brought to them, and they gained from their neighbors not onely praiſe but thanks, comparing their old injuries with the preſent ſecurity they enjoied. Beyond the Rivers <hi>Roer</hi> and <hi>Luppe</hi> (although ſome <hi>Holland</hi> horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were ſent to cut the Bridge over <hi>Luppe,</hi> but they came too late) the fourth day they came to <hi>Oldenzul,</hi> a Town in <hi>Over-Yſſel,</hi> boaſting the Fortification of former times, and not at all changed from what it was ſeven years before when Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> took it.
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:55798:409"/>
The Enemy thought he might have taken it in his paſſage; yet although they made very great haſt, the Garriſon being timely increaſed, frequent ſallies were made thence, ſo that they put the Enemy in fear not onely of his paſſage but of the want of proviſions. Within the Town were almoſt four hundred men, part horſe, the reſt foot. The horſe iſſued out firſt, and afterward the foot, doing good exercution upon all they met with at firſt; but the approaching Army was too ſtrong for their ſmall number, and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their ſhot, in one night in three places came up to the very Town-ditch; but yet <hi>Spinola</hi> not ſurrounding the Town, with the death and wounding of a few men, he redeemed the time, which is a chief point of War: contrary to which rule Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> acts, whoſe cuſtome is to follow on ſafely, though with leſs ſpeed. In the Morning, upon a ſmall Battery made by thoſe Guns he brought with him, the Town was delivered: When underſtanding by ſome priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners the ſtate of <hi>Lingen,</hi> and that more Souldiers were daily expected thither, commanding the horſe to goe before, himſelf the next day pitched his Tents before the Town. This <hi>Lingen</hi> being fit for a frontier Town, Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> out of affection thereto, becauſe it was given to him, had begun to fortifie at his own charge and with his beſt skill, ſurrounding both the Town and Caſtle with a very deep and broad Ditch and ſix ſtrong Bulwarks and Mounts. But the work being new and in part unperfect, and the Rampier not well ſetled, was the more eaſy for the aſſailants to win. There was in the Town an indifferent number of Souldiers, about ſix hundred, but ſuch as neither durſt make a ſally nor fight at the line, beſides their Commanders were altogether unskilfull and infinitely
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:55798:410"/>
timorous, nor had any one knowledge how to plant or level a Cannon. Therefore while the great guns were preparing and the place viewed, the Enemy without any hindrance or loſs, helped by the Meanders of the Gardens, ſooner then was credible almoſt came to the brink of the Trench: And now four ſeveral nations, from ſo many diſtinct places, haſtned to paſs over, each of them in emulation and forwardneſs ſtriving to outvie the other. Part of them, by drawing the ſmall Brooks in the old chanel of the little River, ſtrove to deprive them of water: others brought the Bridge and placed it upon Veſſells, or elſe bound together Faggots and Oſiers, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention firſt found out at <hi>Oſtend;</hi> which made them ſo ſecure, that ſome of them went unarmed even into the Trench, and there promoted the work. It was now the ninth day of the ſiege, and the <hi>Walloons</hi> had taken the Bulwark oppoſite to them; the <hi>Italians, Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> were partly imploied about the middle Trench, and part of them nearer. The Governour of the Town, Colonel <hi>Martin Cobbe,</hi> being broken with old age and feeble in going, calls all his Captains to counſel, and ſhewing to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other inconveniences the great want of Ball, asked them what was fit to be done. They had no mind to raiſe new works, or repair thoſe that were battered, to oppoſe their bodies to the Enemies ſhot, or ſo much as defend the Caſtle: but they rather admire, that in all that time the Enemy had not ſummoned the Town: but others ſaid that cuſtome was grown out of date, being uſed neither at <hi>Oſtend</hi> nor <hi>Scluys.</hi> The Governor, as if this had been valiant advice, admoniſhed them to defer articling till the Evening, but if that were too much, at leaſt
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:55798:410"/>
not to move it till noon. The reſt were troubled hereat, averring nothing of moment could be done within thoſe few hours, and what they demanded in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ime would be eaſily granted. This their reſolution they put in execution with as much ſpeed as they had agreed upon it: whereat <hi>Spinola</hi> rejoyced, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, though he were in great haſt, yet were prevented with fear of the Enemy. In the mean while Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> haſtning as much as he could upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Expedition beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> gives the cuſtody of the Ports in <hi>Flanders</hi> and the Government of <hi>Scluys</hi> to Colonel <hi>Notte,</hi> and taking from thence five and twenty Companies went to <hi>Deventer;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he drew out from about the <hi>Rhine</hi> ten others, and as many more out of the Garriſons, as alſo eight that were newly raiſed in <hi>England:</hi> but the great Guns were kept back by the croſs winds. Two or three days after the ſurrender of <hi>Lingen,</hi> the Prince was ready to have raiſed the Siege, to that purpoſe having drained the Cities of their Souldiers, when a ſorrowfull meſſenger arrives with the news that the Town was loſt; for which not onely the Governor Colonel <hi>Cobbe</hi> was ere he was aware committed to priſon, and there long kept, but alſo ſeveral of the Captains, where they underwent as well the harſh cenſure of the people as the judgement of their very relations, proteſting them unworthy of favor. The heads of their defence, which they ſent in Letters to the Captains and the neighbouring Towns, were, that there were not Souldiers enough ſent to them, or other things either for the defence or freeing of the Town; and that the Townsmen, though exceeding them in number, yet denying to watch and ward or doe any duty, had compelled them by threats and
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:55798:411"/>
prayers to prevent imminent ruine by a timely agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and compoſition. At length, when time had mitigated the envy of the fact, they, were degraded, without any farther puniſhment.</p>
               <p>During this Siege, <hi>Thomas Filler,</hi> one of them who from the <hi>Hochſtraten</hi> Sedition remained with the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> being a couragious perſon and one that would dare any thing to get booty, fell upon the Count <hi>Solre</hi>'s quarters, and of a hundred horſemen given him for a guard took thirty, and ſlew among the reſt the Baron <hi>Ciacci, Don Richardot's</hi> ſon-in-law: the Count himſelf was wounded, and with much a doe got away. But the United <hi>States,</hi> if perchance <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Camp had been afflicted with want of Proviſions, by publick Edict commanded, that none ſhould carry any Victualls into his Army, and whoſoever ſhould, be found ſo doing, ſhould be reputed as Enemies: Yet for all this there wanted no proviſion, now out of hope of gain, anon by the terror of victory; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſome carried home from the Camp what they brought thither to ſell, it being ſo much more then could be ſpent. <hi>Spinola</hi> ſtaied a while at <hi>Lingen,</hi> and there, as if amazed at ſo good fortune, he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſtrength and rare ſtructure of the Works, and yet for their defence he raiſed other Works beyond the Trench. Which late deſign coming to the knowledge of Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> he followed thither, as if he had intended a preſent ſiege. But if he had choſen rather to get more then to keep what he had gotten, the ſame force and the freſh report of his approach had brought an equal terror upon all places. There were but few Souldiers either at <hi>Coevoerden</hi> or the Fort in <hi>Bourtange,</hi> through which places the Enemy muſt come into <hi>Frieſeland:</hi> beſides <hi>Groeningen</hi>
                  <pb n="805" facs="tcp:55798:411"/>
trembled, and <hi>Embden,</hi> though farre off, yet ignorant a matters of War, was tired with private diſcords; which Count <hi>Enno,</hi> being confident in this Warre of the <hi>States</hi> affairs, increaſed. And now the Enemy lying ſtill awhile, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had ſome vacant time for his Pioneers to ſtrengthen and repair the fortifications of the Garriſons in <hi>Frieſeland</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Rhine:</hi> Himſelf with Count <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> having gathered together, nine thouſand men, be marched to <hi>Coevoerden,</hi> for defence of the interior parts, and that he might be the nearer to follow the Enemy in the very track, adding to that place ſeveral new Bulwarks. Among all theſe publick actions ſome private and clandeſtine Stratagems alſo were uſed, whereof one <hi>Terral</hi> a <hi>French</hi> fugitive was the inventor. This man having tendred his ſervice to the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and being refuſed, becauſe he ſeemed to ask too great honors and rewards, went over to the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> he was of a confident ſpirit, and rarely skilled in all Fire-works and other devices made with Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder. To this man the Archduke, out of the ſupernumerary Souldiers in other places, aſſigned fifteen hundred foot and three hundred horſe under the command, of Colonel <hi>Torricurte</hi> the Governor of <hi>Hulſt,</hi> in hopes therewith to have ſurpriſed <hi>Bergen op Zoom.</hi> Theſe, in the night at the ebbe of the Sea, through the mariſhes got into the Haven, and poſſeſſed two Forts, the one that defended the Haven, the other the Gate, the Souldiers that kept them flying away. And if they had proceeded forward from the Haven, the City would have been indangered, both the Souldiers and Townsmen being unprovided, and ſo in the greater confuſion. But they went to the Water-gate, and there with their Engines throwing
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:55798:412"/>
down two Sluces that lay between them and the Town, the Petard that they hung at the Gate, having in the march caught wet, did no execution; no more did the Hand-granadoes, becauſe they were moiſtned with the dirt, Thus being fruſtrated of their hopes, and the tide of Floud increaſing, they haſtned their return, deſerting all the places they had gotten: and now the multitude of defendants being come together, they not onely ſhot with bullets, but from above threw down upon them great ſtones, wherewith thirty were killed and many hurt. Yet did not this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate event ſo terrify them, but that a moneth after they attempted the ſame thing again with greater courage and more, force: when the conteſt was more ſharp, becauſe their coming being foreknown by ſome Scouts, all things within were prepared ready to receive them. The Enemy, knowing nothing of their intelligence in the Town, came on. A little after midnight, the weather wet and clowdy, and by that means exceeding dark, the ſigne being given, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted three places at once, in two of which they had placed Bridges by reaſon of the water; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were not long enough, yet many ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with their hands and feet got to the Rampier, to the top of which they were no ſooner gotten, but they were immediately beaten down again: for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Town, Colonel <hi>Paul Baxen,</hi> mingling the Townsmen and Souldiers together, had manned all the Works round about the Town, himſelf riding from place to place, and keeping in the Market-place two Companies to be aſſiſting in any place in caſe of neceſſity. But on that ſide the Town towards <hi>Steen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen,</hi> it ſeemed rather to be downright force then any nocturnal Policy: for the Townsmen ſetting
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:55798:412"/>
fire on ſtraw and pitched barrells, made ſo great a light, that they could ſee plainly all that the Enemy did. There with Gunpowder they had beaten down two Gates and a Draw-Bridge, inſomuch that the Enemies beat up their Drums even within the Town-walls; in like manner the horſe ſounded their Trumpets, as if at that very inſtant they had been entring. There was one Sluce yet remaining, which the Townsmen had ſtopped up with Carts and other great pieces of Timber: this, in regard many of <hi>Terrall</hi>'s workmen were killed and ſpoiled in the former places, they endeavored to cut into pieces with their Swords and with Axes: But the Townsmen ſeeing the approching Enemy, threw down fire upon them from the walls, and with their Muskets and great Guns not onely gave them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain wounds but reproachfull language, ſo that at laſt the Souldiers refuſed to be led to the ſlaughter by their Officers. There was no ſlothfull perſon in the City at this time, both the Magiſtrates and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters putting on Arms, and by their preſence giving others not onely exhortations, but example: nay the very Citizens that were of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, if any ſuch were, knowing that a Victory gained in the darkneſs of the night and height of fury would make no difference of perſons, acted with great reſolution, leſt they ſhould ſeem to diſunite themſelves from the common cauſe: the very Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did not ſpare any pains or labour in bringing Calthrops, Bullets, Pitch and Stones in their childrens cradles. (having firſt emptied them of all things elſe) and then in the more retired and ſoft places, upon their bended knees, with eyes and hands lifted up to Heaven, they beſeeched God to aſſiſt the Defendants,
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:55798:413"/>
and to turn the evil of thoſe cruel deſigns upon the authors thereof. After day was broken, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of them returned to <hi>Antwerp.</hi> In the Town there was onely one killed, and very few wounded, for they were well ſaved by the height of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
               <p>In like manner alſo <hi>Grobbendonck</hi> attempted to aſſault <hi>Grave</hi> by night with Bridges and ſcaling-Ladders; but underſtanding that the Townsmen prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, he deſiſted. And now <hi>Spinola</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified <hi>Lingen,</hi> unreſolved what to doe the remaining part, of the year, the Autumn being now beginning. To refreſh his Souldiers in <hi>Germany</hi> would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous and baſe: The Spies that were ſent to <hi>Berck</hi> returned, and brought intelligence that the Works were very great and hard to be overcome. At length, leaving Garriſons both at <hi>Lingen</hi> and <hi>Oldenziel,</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times removing his Camp, he ſate down before <hi>Roeroort,</hi> and making there a Bridge, he erected a Fort on each ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> deſiring that at <hi>Keyſersweert</hi> might be pulled down. But <hi>Roeroort</hi> being a Town in the juriſdiction of <hi>Moers,</hi> in the Enemie's Country, and better ſituated, upon conſultation had about the ſame, it was thought that removal was advantageous.</p>
               <p>At this time a new Regiment came out of <hi>Italy</hi> into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and another, conſiſting of part <hi>Engliſh,</hi> part <hi>Scots,</hi> and ſome <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but all Catholicks. Theſe unobſerved of the <hi>Hollunders</hi> paſſed the Sea to aid the <hi>Spaniard, Britain</hi> alſo rejoycing to be rid of them. With this ſtrength, and what other ſupplies <hi>Spinola</hi> added out of his own Army, <hi>Bucquoy</hi> was ſent to beſiege <hi>Wachtendonck</hi> But Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> fearing ſome treachery attended the Enemie's motion,
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:55798:413"/>
and kept hard by <hi>Yſſel,</hi> leſt he ſhould carry the War thither. When he ſaw <hi>Spinola</hi> ſetled, he alſo pitched his Camp a little lower not far from the Town of <hi>Weſel:</hi> Nor did he ſuppoſe he had at any time a fairer opportunity to dare the Enemy, or make ſome attempt upon him, then while one part of the Enemy was in <hi>Flanders,</hi> another about <hi>Wachtendonck:</hi> and to this end he reſolved firſt to fall upon <hi>Spinola</hi>'s horſe and ſome Regiments that quartered about and in <hi>Mullem;</hi> and if his ſucceſs there anſwered his deſire, then he determined to invade the reſt of the Army; hoping this laudable advice would in one day yield him a great Victory, unleſs God thought fit to repell the long-continued proſperity of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and the honor they had attained in the War, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate and adverſe ſucceſſes: for I cannot with reaſon aſcribe their ſo fatal a fear to any other cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Village of <hi>Mullem</hi> lies cloſe by the River <hi>Roer,</hi> which, although it be broad, yet is fordable in many places: onely it was not paſſable for horſe, becauſe the banks lay ſo high, except they were levelled by main ſtrength. On the contrary bank was ſituate the Caſtle of <hi>Burick,</hi> and all round about were the Fields that lay ſomewhat higher. The Prince made haſte with his horſe, carrying over ſome foot Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Carts: with part of the Troups he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his brother to goe before, and likewiſe by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way with another party Colonel <hi>Marcellus Baxen;</hi> this to goe towards <hi>Roer,</hi> againſt the Caſtle of <hi>Burick,</hi> to ſhut up all paſſages of flight from them being circumvented; that by a narrow paſſage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Enemies, whoſe incloſures were by chance open, as not kept by the Enemy, through the Souldier's
<pb n="810" facs="tcp:55798:414"/>
neglect to whom the charge thereof was committed, that afterwards expiated his fault with his head. Herein was a great Error, that Count <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi>'s horſe did not preſently come to the Village of <hi>Mullem,</hi> but he ſtaied for the coming up of the foot, hoping to find the Enemies ſcattered elſewhere; who in the interim gathered together at the River, and the higher and more open places that were beyond it. And this onely thing made the <hi>Hollanders</hi> afraid that they found not the Enemy unprovided, as they hoped, but without doubt ſtronger then themſelves: hereupon their courages being altogether abated, they betook themſelves to an unworthy flight, no body purſuing them. Scarce could the ſight of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> himſelf and the reſt of the Regiments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from running over their very fellow-Souldiers, nay the General himſelf, ſo much were they affrighted. In the mean while <hi>Baxen</hi> breaking into the out-parts of the Caſtle of <hi>Burick</hi> (the inner parts were held onely by ten Souldiers) met with ſome Troups of the Enemy, which by chance were going out to forage: But he being not affrighted therewith, and moving forward, drove them back; and queſtionleſs they had fled, but that both horſe and foot coming from <hi>Mullem</hi> reſtrained them: and then the Prince's men overpreſſed with number and wearied with long fight, were afreſh encouraged by the ſight of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> whom a few men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from flight followed; ſome others alſo being reclaimed by mere ſhame. Therefore on both ſides they ſet upon the horſe and horſemen intangled in the River: but <hi>Lewis Velaſco</hi> hearing of the danger of his men, ſpeeding with ſome Troups out of <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Camp, reduced the Prince's men into a new fear,
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:55798:414"/>
their courages and countenances yet bearing in them the terror of their former flight. Thus once more brought into an amaze, they fled abſolutely, nor could Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> ſtanding publickly on the other bank withdraw them with all his Forces and great Guns, intermingling exhortations and reproof: now he remembred them of the honor they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly gotten, That they ſhould not be the firſt to fully the Victories gained at <hi>Tornhout</hi> and in <hi>Flanders,</hi> nor loſe thoſe merited praiſes they had won in taking ſo much from the Enemy, and that had made them renowned in ſo many fights; That they ſhould not leave his brother, their Leader, in the midſt of his Enemies: Then calling upon the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Souldiers, that truſted rather to the ſwiftneſs of their horſes heels then the valor of their own hands, Would they onely be diligent in ſorrage, and actively oppreſſive to unarmed people? Then requeſting them to ſtand and face about, Where are thoſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, where are thoſe couragious inquiſitions ſo often by you made to fight the Enemy? acquit your ſelves of this diſhonor offered to your Country and to Me: Be conquered rather when I am abſent, but rather purge your ſelves of this crime by ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy act, that I may hereafter ſee you otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have your ſelves with valour in other things. But all theſe things prevailed nothing, their minds being ſo fully poſſeſſed with fear. Count <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau,</hi> onely accompanied with a few of his domeſtick train, as he was retreating to <hi>Baxen,</hi> being eminent for his habit, was on all hands furiouſly followed; and the Captain of a Troup of the Enemies riding near, that he might not diſcharge his Carabine, being in great fear of a Piſtol levelled againſt him, by and
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:55798:415"/>
by laid hold of the Scarf he wore upon his ſhoulders, which the great Officers of horſe wear for ſhew, but is of great danger in the wearing; yet at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant was redeemed. Which was an act of high merit, whoever did it, which till this time is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned; though the memory thereof be yet freſh. But Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> not ſo ſollicitous now for the Victory as the ſafety of his Army, leſt the begun terror ſhould conſternate all, ſends part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Regiments over the River: And firſt of all Sir <hi>Horace Vere</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> foot beat back the Enemie's horſe, compelled to draw his men into the forme of a wedge, and to fight at puſh of Pike. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merville,</hi> the Colonel of the <hi>French,</hi> followed next, who there honourably loſt his life. Nor did the foot Regiments ſuſtain onely the brunt of the horſe, but ſome of them, following the example of the horſe, beat back many of the Enemies who fled into the Caſtle of <hi>Burick.</hi> And now Fortune was come about: But <hi>Spinola</hi> eluded them a while by a noble policy, beating up his Drums hard by, as if his whole Army had been drawing near, which were indeed far enough diſtant. Then the Prince, doubting that this falſe fear might prove true, as formerly he chiefly relied upon the valor of his horſe, ſo now in their cowardly running away reckoning the greateſt incertainty of the War, founded the retreat, placing his Muskettiers on the inner bank, and drawing his horſe within ſafeguard of them. Of the Enemy was ſlain Colonel <hi>Trivulci,</hi> an excellent Souldier and a good Captain. The ſlaughter, wounds, priſoners and Enſigns taken on both ſides were equal, onely with this equality the aſſailants reaped the moſt diſhonor. <hi>Spinela,</hi> having eſcaped this danger, for
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:55798:415"/>
the future went more prudently to work, contracting his forces into a narrower compaſs: Then going to ſee how affairs were managed by <hi>Bucquoy,</hi> and finding all things to his ſatisfaction, he returned to <hi>Roeroort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bucquoy</hi> had the advantage of a dry Autumn, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſoil would have been very wet. But the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, though they were twelve hundred, commanded by <hi>Richoven</hi> the Governor, and truſting in their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and the ſtrength of their Works promiſed mighty matters, yet never came out of their works, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to delay the Enemy by any ſallies, ſo that making a Bridge over the River <hi>Niers,</hi> and the eighth day getting to the Town-ditch, they drew away the water, by beating down the Sluce that kept it in. Being come to the great Bulwarks, firſt terrifying the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged with Mines, and after that by an aſſault, the twentieth day <hi>Wachtendonck</hi> was delivered.</p>
               <p>During this time <hi>Geldre</hi> was attempted by the Prince, but with as little ſucceſs as the reſt, which Town was diſtant from the Camp four leagues, whither going in the night, he drew his horſe and part of his foot, ſome going before that ſhould make way for them by forcing the Gates with Gunpowder: but when they came to the Draw-bridge, the force of their inſtrument was too weak, and another being ſet to, fell into the trench, which gave the Townsmen time to draw together, who ſoon diſperſed thoſe that were near at hand with their ſhot, among whom was <hi>Philip,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Philip Morney,</hi> Lord <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> being fearleſs of danger out of the earneſtneſs of his deſire to learn; he was the worthy offspring of ſo worthy a Father, whom he followed in the very track, who in his time was famous in a high meaſure as well for his noble and heroick actions as Learning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="814" facs="tcp:55798:416"/>Nor did <hi>Spinola</hi> omit farther to proſecute the good fortune of this year; for ſending <hi>Bucquoy,</hi> he eaſily took the Caſtle of <hi>Cracow</hi> in the juriſdiction of <hi>Moers:</hi> for the truth is, it wanted the main part of its ſtrength, the marſhy ſoil being by the extraordinary drought of the weather void of water. But in <hi>Flanders Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> Count <hi>Heremberg</hi> erected a great Fort hard by <hi>Scluys,</hi> where the two Rivers, known by the diverſities of their ſalt and freſh waters, fall into the Haven. This he did aſſiſted by fraud, and a ſmall party of the Enemies in thoſe parts; becauſe they of <hi>Bruges</hi> pretending to make a Bank as it were for the recovering of the ground, which by an Inundation was torn from humane uſe, had deſired leave to doe the ſame from thoſe of <hi>Scluys.</hi> At the end of Autumn, which was very ſhowry, <hi>Spinola,</hi> ſeeing the Fortifications about <hi>Roeroort</hi> were perfected, firſt diſmiſſed his Army: The ſame did Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> ſoon after, and the horſe returning to their winter-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, meeting in the way <hi>Grobbendouck</hi>'s Troups, routed the ſame, carrying the greateſt part of them away pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, being now reſolute to lay hold on all occaſions whereby they might aboliſh the memory not of their fight, but of their flight at <hi>Mullem.</hi> Nor was there any thing more done at Land; but at Sea the reliques of <hi>Sarmienti</hi>'s men by ſtealth getting through the boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sea, while the wind had driven the <hi>Hollanders</hi> otherwhere, arrived in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Soon after this one <hi>Lambert</hi> of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> a Sea-Captain, ſetting upon one of the greateſt of the <hi>Dunkerkers</hi> Ships, that carried one hundred and twenty men, fought with all ſorts of ſhot, and though fewer in number, yet equal in courage, he would not give place to his Enemies fighting for their lives, he himſelf onely fighting for honor. But when <hi>John Gerbrand</hi> Governor of <hi>Euchuiſen</hi> brought alſo his
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:55798:416"/>
Ship againſt the Enemies, the <hi>Dunkerkers</hi> having loſt among the reſt their Captain, (who was named <hi>Adrian Theodore,</hi> and famous for Piracies) and being tempted with the hope of pardon, yield themſelves. The Ship that was taken afterwards ſerved for War: about three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore of the men were hanged, ſome few got pardon in pity of their youth, ſome as they were led to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſcaped and fled, no one offering to ſtop them; for the long continuance of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> miſeries in priſon had mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified the peoples minds towards them.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe that returned this year from the <hi>Indies,</hi> were ſome that were left by <hi>Hemskerk</hi> beyond the Cape of Good hope, by reaſon of a Leak ſprung in their Ship. This Ship being driven by the wind to the coaſt of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> ſtaid there eight moneths, in great want of all things, and the Sea-men, ſome by diſeaſes, others by War among the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and the reſt by grief of mind, were almoſt all of them conſumed, there onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining alive eighteen of a great number. A like fate drove ſome other <hi>Holland</hi> Ships to the ſame Coaſts, which were bound for the Iſland of <hi>Swans:</hi> but at their meeting thoſe firſt poor men, they were even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded between joy and tears; and to hear the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the dangers they had paſſed, would make any one acknowledge the infinite loving-kindneſs of God towards them. Preſently they began to repair the breaches of other Ships with the fragments of their torn Veſſel, and to tranſpoſe their Merchandiſes; by which means at laſt they returned to their Country, of which they had ſo long deſpaired, and the Factors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an unexpected gain. Beſides two Ships came from <hi>Ceilon</hi> bringing ſad news of the death of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>Sebalde Waert,</hi> who was killed by the treachery of the <hi>Fimala</hi> whom we mentioned elſewhere to be

the King of <hi>Candy,</hi> and ſeemingly affectionate to the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> but his ſuſpicious nature incited him, as is uſual with <hi>Barbarians,</hi> becauſe <hi>Sebalde</hi> gave liberty to the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> whom he had taken priſoners in War, which he, being a ſtranger to the cuſtomes of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> doing, it was by them interpreted to be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of colluſion between themſelves: and he was the rather incenſed to believe this, becauſe among the treaties between him and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Barbarian</hi> about making War upon the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> he adviſed him that he might diligently conſider his Ships, and from thence ſet an eſtimate upon his ſtrength, urging this with more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs then ſuited with the honor of a Prince. He under pretence of officiouſneſs, pretending his ruine to be ſought, to prevent the imagined wickedneſs, took off <hi>Sebalde:</hi> and his Aſſociates, for fear of loſing their Trade, omitted to revenge the death of their Captain. But the King of <hi>Spain</hi> fearing leſt thoſe far-diſtant and weak parts of his Empire ſhould become known to all, by a ſevere Edict forbad any foreiner to ſail to the <hi>Indies,</hi> or any other place under the juriſdiction of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and they who then were in that other World ſhould by a certain day return thence: which for all that did not ſo hinder the <hi>Hollanders</hi> endeavors, but that they ſent to the <hi>Indies</hi> twelve Ships, under the conduct of Captain <hi>Matelifen,</hi> one of the Governors of the <hi>Indian</hi> Company.

               <p>Among the Neighbors, although the name of Peace yet continued, yet many fierce commotions were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to tend towards War: for the Citizens of <hi>Aquis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grane,</hi> the City having alwaies been coveted by the Dukes of <hi>Brabant,</hi> had new Governors put upon them,

Imperial Decrees made againſt them, and (which then was buried in ſilence, but afterwards was manifeſted, by the confidence of a private League with <hi>Albertus,</hi> all) the Ceremonies of the Reformed Religion were both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and privately forbidden; they who had before born the Office of Magiſtrates were not onely accuſed as guilty of Sedition, but as being illegally choſen were contumeliouſly uſed and fined, their Accuſers were of the choiceſt ſort, and whoever undertook their defence were joyned with them in puniſhment. The Biſhop of <hi>Colen</hi>'s Legates, to whom the Emperor had given that in command, under pretext of Reconciliation, publickly declared that profeſſion faulty upon their bended knees, and afterwards laied pecuniary mulcts upon all they denounced guilty, in the name of coſts and charges, and upon moſt the fine exceeded their ability; yet if it were not paid, part were thrown into Priſon, others removed their habitations; whoſe Baniſhment was followed with care and hatred of the Commons againſt the Great men, and pity towards the poor. But by how much at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they were oppreſſed, by ſo much the more violently they would in the future break out.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France,</hi> beſides the reſt of the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it was diſcovered, that Monſieur <hi>Merarges,</hi> ſent from <hi>Narbon,</hi> to exhibite the deſires of that Province to the King, had agreed with Don <hi>Balthazar Zunica</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Embaſſador privately for the delivery of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> concerning which he and one <hi>Brunelle,</hi> a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlander</hi> Secretary to the Embaſſador, were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and with them were taken palpable demonſtrations of their Treaſon. When the Embaſſador required his ſervant, according to the Law of Nations, the King on the other ſide ſet forth the unworthineſs of the fact, and how the right belonging to Embaſſadors was by himſelf
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:55798:418"/>
violated. The Embaſſador replied, If any thing had been done contrary to friendſhip, that ought not to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to him, for the <hi>French</hi> King, contrary to the Peace made at <hi>Verbin,</hi> had openly given aſſiſtance to Rebells and the Enemies of the true Religion; nor had he onely tempted to corrupt the Counts <hi>Heremberg</hi> and others in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> but had ſtirred up the <hi>Moors</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Spain.</hi> With which reproof the King being more enraged, anſwered, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion was more indebted to him and his anceſtors then the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that being untruly reported to be the cauſe of the War in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> becauſe in truth that conteſt was about Dominion: And if he either would pay what money was due to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> or the <hi>French,</hi> who are a people impatient of eaſe, would in theſe parts make War under a famous General, as in the farther <hi>Hungary</hi> and with the Archduke, how much would that reſemble ſo many treacherous deſignes intended againſt Cities, and the tempted fidelity of ſo many great men? Then he repeated particulars, proteſting thoſe things ſpoken concerning the <hi>Moors</hi> to be falſe, and confeſſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by force: And if it were unlawfull for him to allure the Count <hi>Heremberg</hi> and others, who were not <hi>Low-country</hi>-men, but <hi>Germans,</hi> to unworthy actions, what did they merit who by large promiſes had drawn away <hi>Terral,</hi> not onely a Subject, but a Member of his Houſe and family? But theſe were ſmall matters. But if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Embaſſador dived into the ſecrets of State-affairs by politick means, it ought mutually to be diſſembled and pardoned; but counſells of cruelty and ſuch as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the hazard of lives ought by him to be refelled. <hi>Zunica</hi> praiſing the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> that although he differed in Religion, yet he obſerved the Peace with great reverence; the <hi>French</hi> King anſwered, Their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:55798:418"/>
with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was but of a new date, but a ſhort time would make appear what it would come to. But at laſt the Embaſſador was glad to pacify the King's anger, which began to break out into threats, ſaying there ſhould be no need thereof, as well the vertues as the wiſedome of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth being generally known to moſt men. But at laſt <hi>Merarges</hi> being brought to condigne puniſhment, the Secretary was reſtored to the Embaſſador his Maſter; it being proved to the King, that it would be better to repay ſubtlety with policy, then to ſeek to revenge it by War.</p>
               <p>About this time a horrible Conſpiracy was diſcovered in <hi>Britain,</hi> contrived by ſome who valued their own ſafety and fidelity and all Laws both divine and humane leſs then their Zeal to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not by Petition obtain liberty for the exerciſe of their Rites, hiding a great quantity of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder under the Parliament-houſe, they decreed at the firſt aſſembling of the Parliament to blow up the King, the Prince and the Peers of the Kingdome: And the chief Fathers of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> being conſulted with by the authors of the Plot, whether it were lawfull in ſo great a number of guilty perſons to deſtroy ſome innocent ones, they anſwered, that for the great good of the Church ſome wel-deſerving perſons might ſuffer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming their opinion by an argument of beſieged Cities. But one of the more conſciencious of them admoniſhing his friend, that he ſhould not come to the Parliament at the appointed day, the Letter of advice being miſtakenly delivered, firſt gave notice of the deſigne; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place being found out, both the Treaſon and the Traitor himſelf were found out. Upon knowledge whereof, the Conſpirators in the fartheſt parts of <hi>Britain</hi> broke out into open Rebellion, one <hi>Oldcorne</hi> a <hi>Jeſuite</hi>
                  <pb n="820" facs="tcp:55798:419"/>
incouraging thoſe that were afraid, leſt they judged of the goodneſs of the cauſe by one unproſperous event; That God did many times deny ſucceſs to undertakings well approved by himſelf, that he might make trial by adverſity of his ſervants conſtancy and perſeverance. But at the very beginning of the ſame they were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, brought to trial and executed: Father <hi>Garnet</hi> alſo, who had formerly attempted many things againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being wont highly to extoll the <hi>Pope</hi>'s authority over Kings and Kingdomes, that no faith or obedience was due to Princes by him interdicted, aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſubjects, if they were commanded, ought to oppoſe them with Armes even to the hazard of their lives. From whence all in power and authority may learn, who neither ſtand in awe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, nor Fleets nor Armies, that they are by Eccleſiaſtical authority moſt violent inciters of the common people to Rebellion. They added alſo another peſtilent opinion, That one might anſwer to any queſtions propoſed by the Magiſtrate evaſively, ambiguouſly and with mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; to that purpoſe ſetting forth Books in print, which in defence of a lie they inſcribed with lying Titles: And whatſoever was related to them in Confeſſion, ought to be kept ſecret, and to diſcloſe the ſame was a ſin; although it tended either to the deſtruction of Prince or people: and in purſuance hereof they named all manner of conferences among themſelves, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. It was not doubted but theſe hopes of Treaſon were nouriſhed by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wealth, and the rather, becauſe long ſince ſome Societies of <hi>Engliſh Jeſuites</hi> were maintained by them purpoſely to diſturb the Peace of that Kingdome. But ſome that were knowing herein betraied all thoſe forms of private counſells abroad, leſt they ſhould ſtill continue unknown; but they that
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:55798:419"/>
continued faithfull to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> wanted no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſupplies from thence upon all occaſions. And it was told to the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> when he was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in <hi>England,</hi> that if the new King would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or ſuffer the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, he would find ſome ready to exact the ſame by force. And the Archduke fomented jealouſies and ſuſpicions, denying to deliver to King <hi>James</hi> requeſting the ſame ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men living in thoſe parts, with whom the Priſoners confeſſed they had participated counſells; the chief of them being ſent away into <hi>Spain.</hi> Yet did not King <hi>James</hi> take that either as an affront or injury; publiſhing by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, that he was ſatisfied of the innocency of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Princes in that buſineſs. Nor did King <hi>Philip</hi> omit to congratulate his delivery from ſo great a danger by <hi>Don John de Mendoſa,</hi> both in countenance and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious forms of ſpeech to that onely purpoſe made.</p>

Therefore which way ſoever he went among the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> there were great exultations and applauſes attended him; and when he came into <hi>Spain,</hi> as his cuſtome was every year, he was privately envied by the Lords, but publickly and with great honour favoured by the King. But the many actions of the former year had ſo drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Treaſury, that by the emptineſs thereof the preſent Counſels of the Warre were much retarded, and he but ſlowly obtained pay for both his Armies, refuſing to undertake the charge of the Warre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and if he had it, boaſting he had in a manner already obtained the Victory, determining, as before he had paſſed the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſo now he would goe over the <hi>Wael</hi> and the <hi>Yſſell,</hi> and ſo penetrate into the very bowels of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Therefore he conſented to
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:55798:420"/>
help the King's decayed credit with his own and his friends wealth, which with what damage to himſelf it was done, will be commemorated towards the end of the year.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited States,</hi> long fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the approaching evils which Armies are wont to draw along with them, increaſing their Forces that were at diſtance, (and they were infinitely vexed with the vaſt charges of the Garriſons) reſolved the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year to give way to that violence which they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined would not endure long, being content to defend their Borders until the fury thereof began to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged: Beſide, the new Levies intended were hindred in <hi>France</hi> by the Warre of <hi>Sedan,</hi> and in <hi>Germany</hi> by the troubles of <hi>Brunſwick. Sedan</hi> is a City lying hard by the <hi>Maes</hi> in the confines of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Belgick</hi> Dominions, and was a place of great concernment if at any time the Warre came towards thoſe parts: Of old it was poſſeſſed by the Family of <hi>Le Marque;</hi> but <hi>Henry de Turre</hi> Viſcount <hi>Turein</hi> marrying the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Heir of the <hi>Bulionian</hi> Family, gained the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Town, and took the name of <hi>Bulion;</hi> and although his Wife was dead, retained it by virtue of her Teſtament, but often undermined by the <hi>French</hi> greatneſs, while the affairs of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> were yet but private. He was reckoned among the chief Captains during the unſetled eſtate of that Kingdome: But after the King had changed his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and for defence of the Kingdome new Taxes were found our, which gave cauſe of complaint, and the great multitude that profeſſed the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had their eies chiefly upon <hi>Bulion,</hi> he being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in Warre, and the frequent author of reſolute counſels, he was believed to have cauſed ſome commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:55798:421"/>
When he was called to anſwer his offence, at the ſame time as Marſhal <hi>Biron</hi> was put to death, excuſing himſelf againſt the violent animoſities of his Enemies, and challenging many of his ſuſpected Judges, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Germany:</hi> And the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked that he would remember his Affinity, (for both of them had married Prince <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Siſters) ſent ſome Embaſſadours to the King to appeaſe his wrath: but it little prevailed, it being alwaies a thing deteſted by Kings, to have forein Powers interpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the reconciling their differences. Hereupon the matter was undertaken by Prince <hi>William</hi>'s Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; and indeed the Woman's ſollicitation proved moſt effectual: but the King required the cuſtody of <hi>Sedan</hi> as a pledge of his fidelity. <hi>Bulion</hi> offered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver both the Town and Caſtle to the patronage of the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> and for performance of that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſented that as well the Governour as the Souldiers therein ſhould be bound by Oath, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this he offered other things, while yet he was not removed from the poſſeſſion, and in the interim pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all things for enduring a War, if he ſhould be compelled thereto by neceſſity. This boldneſs of his, together with the potent Enemies which he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made himſelf, and beſides being a man greedy of honor and impatient to be excelled, forced the King, that marching out that Spring with a great Army he came with his Camp as far as the <hi>Maes.</hi> Thus did this great King threaten with the fury of a deſtructive War, not the <hi>Spaniard</hi> nor the <hi>Burgundian,</hi> as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, but his old friend, the Lord onely of one poor Town. But a meanes being found to make Peace. <hi>Bulion</hi> was redeemed from that imminent danger, and the King freed from ſuch an inglorious conteſt. The
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:55798:421"/>
King placed a Governor in <hi>Sedan</hi> for four years, and at the end of that time the cuſtody of the ſame was to be redelivered to <hi>Bulion.</hi> By that agreement it was forbidden for any to inquire into his former actions; and if hereafter he ſhould change his allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Townsmen ſwore they would chuſe them another Prince. This Peace being made, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his wonted favor with the King, who as he was eaſily angred, ſo he was ready and free to pardon; all men wondring to ſee him that lately was an Enemy, now be at the King's elbow, and inſeparable from him both in his cares and receſſes. The Caſtle it ſelf within a moneth was reſtored to him. This was the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable iſſue of that buſineſs, which was very pleaſing to both parties at War in the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> For it was a grievous thing to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that one of the ſame Religion and related to the houſe of <hi>Naſſau</hi> ſhould be afflicted; and the Archduke was ſorely afraid, leſt thoſe Armes pretended againſt <hi>Bulion</hi> ſhould fall upon himſelf; and therefore <hi>Lewis de Velaſco,</hi> that was ſent to defend the Borders, offered help to them of <hi>Sedan,</hi> But the <hi>Brunſwick</hi> Commotions began the former year, the Duke having a ſpleen to the City, becauſe having bought their Privileges partly from his anceſtors, and partly extorted them, they defended them with more then ordinary confidence, relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hanſeatick League. He replete with hope that he could by his own power reſtore that Authority which the careleſsneſs of his Anceſtors had loſt, gathering together his Forces, as if he had dreaded <hi>Spinola</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> firſt by ambuſhes planting ſome Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he invaded the more outward of the two Walls that encompaſſed the City: but the aſſailants being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, they fell to open hoſtility and a Siege, which,
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:55798:422"/>
though the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> whoſe Siſter was married to the Duke, came with a notable ſtrength to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, the Winter broke off. The United <hi>States</hi> being requeſted by the Duke to ſend Count <hi>Erneſt</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> as General with ſome Forces to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, were in a great ſuſpenſe, becauſe it appeared to them an unſeemly thing to oppreſs the liberty of another, while they ſo hotly conteſted for their own: and yet rather for the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi>'s ſake then the <hi>Hanſeatick</hi> Cities, who had not aſſiſted the <hi>Hollanders</hi> either by wealth or any other kindneſs whatſoever, it was thus mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; They would not ſend him, but that he might goe with ſome new Forces if he pleaſed: to whom ſome Colonels and Captains joyned and aſſociated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, requeſting that for that time their Oath might be diſpenſed with, being covetous to gain thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which are more readily given at the breaking out of a new War. But this high conteſt was ended in a ſhort time: for at the entrance of the Spring, the Leaguer about the Town being anew begun, and the dam broken, by which the Duke hoped to bring the reſtrained River upon the City, and by that means to ſhorten the Siege; the <hi>Hanſeatick</hi> Forces being col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, prevailed with him to deſiſt from the War. To both parties unable to bear the charge the Emperor's authority was interpoſed, which commanded them, that they ſhould voluntarily and out of reverence to the Laws proceed judicially, ſince they ſeemed in honor thereto to lay down their Armes. Beſides theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs which were common to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and their Enemies, there were certain peculiar cauſes which hindred the Enemies Levies of men both in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> For in <hi>Britain</hi> the King being forewarned
<pb n="827" facs="tcp:55798:422"/>
how dreadful thoſe Subjects were that acknowledged power ſuperiour to the King, conceived a new form of an Oath to oblige all his Subjects, whereby they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> confeſs him the true and lawful King of <hi>Britain,</hi> and that he could not be depoſed by the authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or the Pope: and if that ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, yet that they ſhould bear unto him faith and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>legeance, and diſcover all things that might tend to the King's damage; and that in the taking the ſaid Oath they had no other meaning then the common uſe of the words expreſſed, and that they did not hope to be abſolved from the ſame. From hence aroſe great diſcord even among the Catholicks themſelves; while part of them, by the allowance of <hi>George Blackwel</hi> an Archbiſhop of <hi>England,</hi> (for ſo the Pope had entitled him) took the ſaid Oath without fear, ſuppoſing a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between ſacred and temporal affairs; and as they ought to doe their duty to God in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo in all things elſe by the command of God himſelf they were bound to obey their Princes: On the other hand, ſome believed the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> that humane things ought to be ſubſervient to Divine, and ſo, that he who was the great Arbiter of Religion, if neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

In the interim they that demurred at the taking of the Oath were forbidden to goe out of the Kingdome into any forein ſervice. And the Pope's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>Italy</hi> made the like, if not greater, troubles and delaies: For the <hi>Venetians</hi> fearing the wealth and potency of the Prieſthood, and imitating the Decrees of other Nations, forbad them to build Temples, or to give lands to Abbeys or Monaſteries, unleſs they were licenſed thereto by Decree of the Senate, and
<pb n="828" facs="tcp:55798:423"/>
that the Revenues of Church-lands ſhould at no time return to them: beſides, they commanded ſome Prieſts to be put into Priſon, becauſe they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Sorcery, Parricide, Inceſt, Falſhood and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Force.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, by the inſtigation chiefly of the Cardinals <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> interpreting theſe things to be done in deſpight of him, when they were refuſed to be taken away, interdicted and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the City. Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> in ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by him ſent to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> adviſed them among other things to take heed leſt God, being angry with them as he was once with the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſhould take away their Liberty, and make a Lord over them. Many Books were written, wherein a long time it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted what was the power of the Laws, or of any other Sentences, upon thoſe that were wholly devoted to Religion, or whether the Pope's unjuſt commands obliged their Conſciences. The greateſt part of the Prieſts in the <hi>Venetian</hi> territories did not abſtain from performing all publick ſervices in the Church; and the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> when they refuſed to doe the ſame, were baniſhed. While this matter was hoped to break out into Arms, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who had received it from his Anceſtors to augment the Troubles of <hi>Italy,</hi> raiſed Souldiers there, boaſting himſelf the Defender of the Pope's Majeſty. On the other ſide, the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> partly out of hatred to the Pope, and partly out of love to a free City, promiſed the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance by Sea, if they ſhould be indangered: for which they returned them great thanks by Letters with much candor of language. But that prudent Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as they would ſtoutly defend the rights of their Dominion, ſo they ſtudiouſly avoided all things that
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:55798:423"/>
might hinder Peace or the ceremonies of greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. However this was the beginning of friendſhip between thoſe two moſt potent people, who would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure the Rule or name of a King.</p>
               <p>While theſe things were doing in forein parts, at the beginning of this year the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſend a Fleet into <hi>Spain,</hi> to increaſe the dearth and ſcarcity of all things which was rumored to be there; and alſo for vindicating thoſe loſſes they had received by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aſſault of their Ships by <hi>Lewis Faizard,</hi> the ſaid Ships lying unprovided and unguarded at ſome <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Iſlands ſeeking for Salt, whoſe Mariners and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he either drowned, hanged, or burned. But firſt the <hi>States</hi> ſet out an Edict, that none of their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens nor any foreiner ſhould either carry Corn or other things into <hi>Spain:</hi> And it being found both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly and of late, ſeveral Ships in hope of commerce had been inticed thither, and made uſe of for warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>Van Hauten</hi> had but a very ſlow paſſage, by reaſon of the croſsneſs of the winds, yet got abundance of booty, becauſe he took all Merchants he mer, and waſted the Coaſts. The <hi>Portugal</hi> Ships were ſo long kept in their Harbours, that, deſpairing to get out, they diſcharged their received lading again on ſhore.

This haſte the Beſiegers thought fit to make, becauſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces were drawing together on all hands: But if he had perſiſted, <hi>Terrall</hi> being taken, would have been an acceptable Preſent to the <hi>French</hi> King, and ſhould have been a Pattern, whereby they ſhould have been puniſhed for the Cruelty they uſed in their Victory, the terrour whereof ſhould have been ſuch to all unfortunate attempts of that ſort, as for the future ſhould have rather made them to ſeek their Conqueſts by fair Warr, than Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and Surpriſes.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Terrall</hi> nothing terrified herewith, undertakes grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters, and wanted but little of doing as much in one Night, as deſerved the labour of a whole Year.

Therefore taking through the marſhy Fields of <hi>Cazant</hi> Twelve hundred <hi>Walloons</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> with him, he came unobſerved to a Fort of the Enemies, whither he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
<pb n="833" facs="tcp:55798:425"/>
it lying juſt in his way. It was agreed alſo, That <hi>Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Heremberg</hi> ſhould bring more and greater forces to <hi>Damme,</hi> to aſſault the Caſtle as ſoon as the City ſhould be taken: But as the beginning of their Enterprize ſucceeded beyond hope, ſo the latter end proved quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Two Draw-Bridges and one Gate being forced by the Engines applyed to them, the innermoſt that only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, hitherto made a noyſe, which forced them to apply two Petards, and now nothing withſtood them, but that they might go to the very Rampire, which was not very high, all within the Town remaining ſecure. Colonel <hi>Notte</hi> having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that the Enemy intended ſome Stratagem, adviſed all his Neighbour Covernors, That they ſhould take heed to their Charges: not once ſuſpecting the Deſign to be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt himſelf, that the Enemy would invade the Town ſo difficult to come to by its inward Scituation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed round about with ſo many Guards on every ſide, and therefore he gave himſelf to eaſe; and by his example, ſo did others. At firſt they that entred were afraid, becauſe finding ſo great ſilence, and no ſtirring, they believed they were diſcovered, and that there was ſome Plot laid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap them: It fortuned, that part of the Souldiers, who were commanded to ſet upon another part of the Town at an appointed time, not performing what was commanded, becauſe the Clock of the Town did not ſtrike that Night, whereby the hours were not diſcerned. While theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, to break in, where the way lay open to them: Some few in the Town awaked, partly with the cracking of the Gates, and partly with the noyſe of the Enemies Arms, half naked, and half armed, as they leaped from their beds, ſhut up the inner Gate. And ſurely here the aſſaylants were much too ſhort, that they had placed Pikes in the Front, and not Musketeers, the Pikes not being ſo ready to enter againſt Shot. Hereupon the firſt being beaten off, fear poſſeſſed the reſt, which made them flye, but they were hindred by
<pb n="834" facs="tcp:55798:426"/>
the confuſed Numbers, that ſtood crowded together upon the Bridg: And now Colonel <hi>Notte</hi> the Governour having planted ſome great Guns, made a great ſlaughter among them as they ſtood in heaps in the narrow paſſages. Almoſt Five hundred were killed with ſhot, drowned and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in water and dirt: Nor did they return without the loſſe of blood, for the Enemy now appearing in publick, the Souldiers on all hands from the Forts iſſued out, and fell on in the Rear, making great havock. This terrible danger being eſcaped, care was taken, (which ought to have been done before) that a Redoubt ſhould be made before the Gate; And by the Arch-Duke's Command, ſome of the Officers, whoſe careleſsneſs was principally accuſed, were puniſhed with great ſeverity, being made an example to others, that they ſhould rather chuſe any honourable danger, then by neglect and diſobedience of Commands, to incur a certain and ſordid puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Now the hope of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Warr being deferred, by reaſon of the ſcarcity of proviſions in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments came thence into the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> So alſo did <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola,</hi> though retarded by a Feaver, and the report of his death had much increaſed the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſecurity, with no leſs joy, (though it proved falſe) then if thereby they had hoped to have been delivered from foreign Arms.</p>
               <p>Upon the disbanding of the <hi>French</hi> Army, ſome came to the <hi>States;</hi> but the greateſt part of the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi>'s Forces went to <hi>Spinola, John</hi> Count <hi>Ridberg,</hi> Brother to the <hi>Tranſamaſian</hi> Earl, having ſuffered ſome damage by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Incurſions, conducting to him alſo part of the Horſe, but part of the Money that was intended to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, was intercepted; And the <hi>Hollanders</hi> waſted the Country about <hi>Mechelen,</hi> becauſe they denyed to pay Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution. And <hi>Spinola</hi> having determined at the middle of Summer, and going into places, in his opinion, full of water, divided both his Cares and Forces with Count <hi>Bucquoy.</hi>

To whom he aſſigns Ten thouſand Foot, and Twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, and Twelve pieces of Artillery, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to go into that part of <hi>Holland,</hi> which the <hi>Rhine</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into another channel called the <hi>Waell,</hi> encompaſſeth; Himſelf, with Eleven thouſand Foot, and Two thouſand Horſe, and but Eight Cannons, thinking of many things, yet ſteared his courſe chiefly to <hi>Friezeland</hi> and the <hi>Veluwe,</hi> for ſo is that part of <hi>Gelderland</hi> called, which is compaſſed with the Rivers <hi>Rhene</hi> and <hi>Iſſell,</hi> then he conſidered of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> a great City and ſtrong, but apt to Seditions from the unſtable vulgar. And that he might proceed with the more expedition, he removed from the Camp all Women, and filled the Carriages with Victuals, Boats, Bridges, and Mills: And if what he deſigned had come to paſs, and the Two Armies had met on both ſides, the very heart of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and all the places of leſs ſtrength, lay open to the ſudden violence, and the outer and more fortified places had been torn away from helping them either with Proviſions or otherwiſe: But thick &amp; cloudy weather atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with much Rain, detained <hi>Spinola</hi> as he was entring the Borders of the <hi>Tubantes:</hi> From thence the Souldiers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Sickneſſes, and growing weak, their paſſage lying altogether through mariſhy wayes, that they in the Rear could hardly reach them in the Van in a ſecond days March: Thus had the Mariſhes more than ordinarily wet, and lying ſcattered up and down, ſtopped the paſſage into <hi>Frizeland:</hi> Beſides the <hi>Iſsell,</hi> a River not contemptible at other times, was ſo ſwelled with exceſs of Rain; that it was not fordable in any place. By theſe delays, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> having gained time to get his Souldiers together (in number Ten thouſand Foot, and Two thouſand five hundred Horſe) thoſe be appointed to lye by the River, and to re-enforce with Works and Garriſons, <hi>Deuenter, Zutphen,</hi> and <hi>Doesburg,</hi> being principal Towns, and to leave the reſt to Fortune and the Event. But the Marqueſs revolving in his thoughts

               <p>At the ſame time <hi>Pompey Juſtiniano</hi> by <hi>Bucquoy's</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, leading Four thouſand Foot, Five hundred Horſe, and two Canons, early in a morning came to a Village named <hi>Spardage,</hi> on the left bank of the <hi>Wael,</hi> and put the moſt nimble of the Souldiers into Boats, each of which carried Thirty, and himſelf afterwards carrying over the reſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them at once in an excellent order to looſe from the Shore, and alſo to land at the appointed place; for it was not eaſie to land every where: But <hi>Warner Dubois,</hi> to whom the Prince had given in Charge the defence of that ſide of their Territories, being called from <hi>Nimmeghen</hi> by haſty.

               <p>After the taking other places, <hi>Spinola</hi> conceived a hope to ſhut up <hi>Swoll:</hi> And that he might delude their thoughts, chooſing to go through the parts adjoyning to <hi>Zutphen,</hi> from whence ſending ſome ſmall ſhot, he ſent Count <hi>Solre</hi> to aſſay and found the <hi>Iſsell.</hi> But the wetneſs of the weather hindred the ſudden executing of that Deſign, until the report of their arrivall was brought to <hi>Swoll;</hi> and <hi>Warmelo</hi> being at that time Governour there, aſſiſted by two Ships of Warr, reſiſted the Enemy preparing to paſs the River <hi>Vecht. Solre</hi> had brought with him two great Guns, but by reaſon the Bullets were too big, and the Timber wherewith they ſhould be ſuſtained, not fitted by the error of thoſe that were to make them ready, they were of no uſe. When this did not ſucceed, and all that hope of paſſing the River coming to nothing, they turned thenceforward all their intentions to

Wherefore <hi>Bucquoy</hi> firſt ſending to know the Arch-Duke's Pleaſure, and being reſolved thereof, he agreed in the ſame Judgment, and pretended to ſpend the time in finding out other wayes to get over the <hi>Waell,</hi> and in ſtudying other Policies, fearing leſt he ſhould prejudice his honour by labouring in vain.</p>

And the Iſland that lyes before the Town, was fortified in like manner: From thence a Bridge was made over the <hi>Rhine</hi> to the Bank, on the <hi>German</hi> ſide; and on the Bank it ſelf was a handſom Fort pretty large, and another leſs, and then again Breaſt works. <hi>Bucquoy</hi> leaving <hi>Gelderland,</hi> came firſt to the Town, through the Biſhoprick of <hi>Colen,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, in his March, a <hi>Holland</hi> Ship that lay in the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and

The loſs of this famous Town much troubled the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who hereupon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd what was the Fortune of War, if no Army went againſt it, yet the Fortifications would ſubſiſt but for a ſhort time.

               <p>The day before <hi>Berck</hi> was ſurrendred, Prince <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> taking part of the Forces, by Night attempted to break into <hi>Venſoo,</hi> having forced the Gate with a <hi>Retard,</hi> and ſome of the Souldiers, with great earne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At this time, ſome unfortunate News out of <hi>America,</hi> grievouſly weakned <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Credit, already wavering with the Greatneſs of the Uſury he paid; ſome <hi>Merchants,</hi> whoſe <hi>Accounts</hi> with him were unſetled, being compell'd to break promiſe with him: Whereupon he wanted Money, and being

wonted to give the Souldier part of his Pay, out of his own Revenue, now he was not able to do that. And lately the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Wachtendenck</hi> puniſh'd ſome Seditious Threats, by the death of one Souldier, and the puniſhment of two more: After this continual marching, and labouring in the Camp renewed Diſcipline: But after <hi>Berck</hi> was loſt, and that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had nothing in thoſe parts beſides <hi>Moers,</hi> which it was fear'd <hi>Spinola</hi> would attaque, notwithſtanding the <hi>Autumn</hi> was ſo far ſpent, and it had a conſiderable <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon:</hi> Nor did <hi>Poverty</hi> onely, and the want of Fodder pinch the Horſemen chiefly, but the Infirmities of Diſeaſes affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all the reſt; ſo that many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>While their <hi>Paucity</hi> was contemptible, <hi>Spinola</hi> firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them of their Commands, and proceeded againſt them as Offenders againſt the Law: But when they began to grow more powerful, he was glad to flatter them by <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers:</hi> But as his Threats were without Authority, ſo his Promiſes, with reall Performances, were little eſteemed.

That they did not eſteem it ſo ſlight a matter to fight againſt him, that they would do it without their Reward or Wages.</hi> Theſe Deſires of the Seditious were anſwer'd, by ſending them Proviſion and Arms, together with the hopes of Aſſiſtance, in caſe they ſhould be endanger'd. <hi>Spinola</hi> moved herewith, that this Evil might not ſpread further, he ſends the moſt Active and Cordial of his Men into the Neighbour Towns, and diſperſeth the reſt of the Army over the whole Country of <hi>Colen,</hi> as <hi>Mendoſa</hi> had formerly done; and likewiſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Money from ſome Cities, to keep the Souldiers from coming among them, who (to ſay the truth) were not evilly inclined, as long as they were not neceſſitated.</p>
               <p>From theſe troubled Affairs of the Enemy, the United States conceived hopes of recovering what they had loſt this year beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> having a ſufficient Army by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe that were come out of <hi>Berck,</hi> being near fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Foot, and three thouſand Horſe. No leſs did the Enemy make haſt, in this juncture of time, while neither party much minded the future; that their Forces (whoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience for want of pay, had been exhauſted) might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encouraged and brought again into one Body. Count <hi>Erneſt</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> being ſent to <hi>Lochem</hi> with part of the Souldiers, the fourth day after his Arrival gained it, upon the ſame Terms that <hi>Spinola</hi> had late given it.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time alſo did the Prince attaque <hi>Groll,</hi> Autumn then coming on apace, which place was defended by <hi>Henry</hi> Count <hi>Heremberg,</hi> with ſix hundred Foot, and his own Troop of Horſe, and much Artillery. And by chance, a great quantity of Rain having lately fallen, ſo that the Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers could not with conveniency come to work, not only delayed and protracted the Siege, but brought many diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into the Camp. And the Souldiers were ſpared, in hopes that the Weather would become more ſeaſonable, when at the inſtant arrived News, That <hi>Spinolaes</hi> Forces that had been diſperſed into Garriſons up and down the
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:55798:431"/>
Countrey, were collected together from thence. And then the Princes earneſt deſire to continue the Siege, and Fortify the Camp againſt outward Force, made the Souldiers work and Duty double, though in regard of the Enemies being ſo near, it was too late; for <hi>Spinola</hi> himſelf, and his Officers, thoſe Authority with the Souldiers was of high eſteem, ringling together Prayers and Promiſes, incited them, <hi>That they would not refuſe that ſhort and eaſy undertaking, that would let to them of ſo great advantage, and ſo much to their Honour.</hi> He had gotten together ſeven thouſand Foot, and twelve hundred Horſe, a number much unequal to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> yet he preſſed on to Fight, either confident in his own mens Valor, or knowing that the Enemy by all means endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to avoid a Battel, in which conceit he was not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

<pb n="846" facs="tcp:55798:432"/>
and to have elevated the courage of his own men, and to have impaired the Enemies Glory. Soon after this, both parties went into Winter Quarters. This year, the States diſmiſſed Colonel <hi>Foxes German</hi> Regiment, that had meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted greater Honour and Rewards than the reſt, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was taken in very evil part.

               <p>But in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ocean, after the publick Arms were departed thence, Private Men of War did no ſmall damage, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> great Ships purſued the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and their leſſer were voluntarily ſet aſide. At the end of this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Admiral <hi>Hauteen</hi> was again ſent to intercept the Fleets comming out of <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> he had with him four and twenty Veſſels, but of theſe ſix were beaten back by Tempeſts. And ſoon after <hi>Fiaſciardo,</hi> with eight great Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons, having a proſperous gale, fell upon them unprovided, and ere they were aware: but the Galleyes that were with him, not being driven by the Wind, kept to the Shoar. As the bulk of the Galeons, ſo, the terror thereof, to that time, had been very formidable, and although the <hi>Hollanders</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that ſome ſuch had formerly been ſpoiled by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, or ſplit upon the Rocks, yet they had no preſident of any of them at any time worſted in fight.

But after he ſaw no hopes of relief, and that the Waves poured in upon him, that none of them might come alive into the Enemies hands, at once they unanimouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon a noble, but terrible action, and of much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to their Countrey; for kneeling down upon their knees,

And his death was attended with a great ſlaughter of <hi>Polonians,</hi> while one <hi>Scutskye,</hi> that had raiſed this commotion, ſeized the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, at firſt indeed very unſtable and tottering, while their minds were aſtoniſhed with the cruelty, and being very ſlowly drawn to conſent to a new Prince, but afterwards it was ſoon ſetled by fear add puniſhments, as is uſual among Barbarians.</p>

The chief cauſe of this their ſo great ſecurity was, That the Magiſtrates of the City were ſuch, whoſe fidelity both to them and the publike Religion was well known, and a great Garriſon was kept therein without charge, and without regret. Yet for all this, had the Souldiers no time of leiſure, for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> broke into and burned a ſmall Fort in the Iſle of Bommell, the Sentinell being hired by them to hold his peace. The Captain that Commanded the place was ſlain, who was bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for this, becauſe in not changing his Watches, he had given hopes to that Treacherous Deſign.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Count <hi>Bruyke,</hi> a younger Brother, but in pay under the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as he rid to his Father's houſe with a ſmall retinue, fell into an ambuſh of the Enemies: his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary by chance going before, was ſhot, which was a ſign of what was following to his Maſter; yet he did not offer to fly, but valiantly coped with the Enemy, not out of hope to eſcape, but becauſe he was aſhamed to be taken.

This they claimed, becauſe they were the firſt that had ſearched into the inner part of the Country. Wherefore ſuch aſſembling,
<pb n="870" facs="tcp:55798:444"/>
whoſe Money being not employed at home, yet hoped good advantage from abroad, erected Two Companies, to each of which particular Colonies were deſigned in thoſe parts: And King <hi>James</hi> ſettled Laws and Rewards among them for the augmentation of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> glory: And it was confidently affirmed, That there were Mines of Gold and Silver; which was credulouſly believed, as mens covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wiſhed the ſame. This great buſineſs received its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from one Ship, whoſe Paſſengers having built a ſleight Fort on the Bank of a River which they found, by whoſe Fiſh, and the Fruits of the adjoyning Country, they could well maintain themſelves: They that were loſt there in Garriſon, the <hi>Natives</hi> gathering againſt them, retreated more towards the ſide of the Country: But another <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship falling into their hands, they would not ſpare the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, becauſe leaving at home Peace and Juſtice, they kept the vaſt poſſeſſion of the New World, only by terrour: Moreover, ſome <hi>Britains</hi> lately went to <hi>Guyana,</hi> but a Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſing in the Voyage, and the Ship being loſt, part of the Company remained in the Iſland, where continually vexing the <hi>Barbarians</hi> with injutious uſage, they at laſt were ſet upon by War as Enemies, by force of which, and the want of Victualls, they committed themſelves to the Sea in a Boat made onely of an Hollowed Tree; there for the ſpace of ten dayes together, being toſſed with continual Tempeſts, and thrown upon the rocks, they very hardly got to the Land; where their danger was no whit leſſened, for they were taken by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who for all that pardoned them, in regard they came not to thoſe Parts of their own accord, but by the ſtreſs of weather.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Deſigns ran at a higher pitch, yet went but ſlowly on, according to the cuſtome of great Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings: Heretofore, there was a great number of Merchants, a vaſt multitude of Sea-men, and beſides, then was there ſo much money, as is ſcarcely to be believed, in private mens

hands unimployed, by the Loſs of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade, (the <hi>East-Indies</hi> not being ſufficient) Only <hi>America</hi> ſeemed to be able to give this ſatisfaction, which every where abounds with Mines, beſides Salt and Sugar, pretious Wood, and Phyſical Drugs. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> prepoſſeſſing all the Principal Coaſts, cut off all hope of Commerce by Traffick, wherefore by the Publike, ſtrength and authority being added to the Private wealth: And now the wealthieſt, as well Merchants as others, who out of a zeal to benefit their Country, had inquired into all things in that New World, both from Books, and alſo the relations of Sea-men, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a form of Government and Laws for a new Society, that ſhould continue for the ſpace of Six and Thirty Years: And it ſhould not be lawful for any of their Citizens, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he became a Member of that Company, to go into thoſe Parts, which extend from <hi>Terra-Nova,</hi> well known to the <hi>French</hi> Fiſher-men, by a vaſt Tract of Land all along the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan,</hi> unto the Ocean on both ſides, and whatever lyes oppoſite to the Coaſts of <hi>Africa,</hi> between the Equinoctial and the <hi>Cape of Good Hope.</hi> Five Moneths were limited for the bringing in of Money: And for the firſt Six years, the <hi>

Nor was their Power perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,

but every Sixth year, the Third part of theſe Governors were to give way to Succeſſors: That none ſhould be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to that Office, but ſuch as had been moſt liberal in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Money into the Stock.</p>
               <p>In the judgment of theſe men lay the ordering of all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, both as to Merchandiſe, and War. The hundreth part was deſigned as the reward of the labour of all that either Exported or Imported, and the gain ariſing from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Stock, ſhould be divided when it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the tenth part of the Stock. Whatever ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as Prize, was to be diſpoſed according to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Judges of the Admiralty, but for the firſt ſix years the ſame ſhould remain undivided, that the Charges of the War might be ſuſtained by the Profits gotten by it. And afterwards the tenth part ſhould be brought to the Treaſury of the United States, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> ſhould have a thirtieth part, and the Merchants to enjoy the reſt. That four being ſelected out of the aforeſaid numbers of Governours, ſhould equally with the ſeventeen have the managery of the Chief Affairs of State. The Governors and Commanders ſent by theſe, being ſworn to the States, ſhould do Juſtice, build Forts, and make Leagues, as they ſhould ſee convenient. That at their return home, they ſhould deliver to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, exact relations of all things done by them; That all their Merchandiſes ſhould be free from the Cuſtomes or Tributes which were ſetled of Old, for ever, and from the other lately invented, and ſet up by occaſion of the Wars, during twenty years.</p>
               <p>The Authors and drivers on of this notable Deſign and Policy, flattring themſelves, as every mans humour led him, (and hopes being once let looſe, will quickly ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to an immenſity that will hardly be circumſcribed) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed both in Speeches and Books, that hitherto that moſt potent part of the Enemies Dominion, would, if it were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued by Arms, become the weakeſt.

Now they durſt promiſe themſelves the ſame Greatneſs, which had made the <hi>Spaniard</hi> formidable, and that the glory of that Warfare would certainly be perpetual, becauſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger being removed from them, they would not fear by a rare example to admit any Enemy that durſt hazard the Peace of their Dominion.

               <p>On the other ſide, divers affirmed. That the chance of War was various, That the Sea would admit of all, yet there was no War more uncertain and dangerous then one at Sea. If it liked to remember the <hi>Athenians,</hi> whoſe moſt flouriſhing

Sometimes even the Conquered by frequent ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, have arrived to ſuch proficiency, that at laſt they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to begin to Conquer, And though the people of <hi>Spain</hi> chiefly that live upon the Seacoaſt, are uncapable to manage Ships, yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Brittons</hi> of <hi>Armoric</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Saxons,</hi> are very apt and ready thereat. Nor was the confidence reaſonable which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> put in their mens bodies, which though they could endure the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of cold, yet it is indubitate and experimentally known, that by the perpetual untemperateneſs of the Equinoctial heat, they decay as well as others. Would Fourty Ships do that Work, and beſiege that vaſte and immenſe Ocean, where the Iſlands, Havens, Stations, and all other places are ſhut up againſt them, but open to the Enemy, and when there is no relief or proviſions near at hand: no not ſo much as a ſufficient quantity of freſh water? Tis true, All <hi>America</hi> is not fenced with continual Caſtles: But where any Wealth is contained, where any Riches lye hid, where any certain Income or Commodity attracts men, there are no ſorts of Fortifications omitted. How eaſie will it be to land Men among ſo many difficulties? Where will they find a Foot Army, that ſhould drive away the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiments, which almoſt for a whole Age had been naturalized in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe places? And if they ſhould think it inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to ſend thither ſuch an Army, yet ſurely it would be very neceſſary at the ſame time with another Fleet to ſhut up the Ports of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they might not from thence ſend

Are they ignorant, that among theſe people there were and ſtill are <hi>Men-Eaters,</hi> thinking humane fleſh the greateſt dainty, and therefore every where killing all unknown perſons, for no other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of hatred, but that they are Men? Surely, the <hi>Indians</hi> and people of <hi>Aſia,</hi> have a much more polite underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet even there are the <hi>Hollanders</hi> compelled by many examples of treacherous dealing, to turn their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip into a kind of Domination: Nor could any Peace or Leagues be hoped for in that New World, which is divided from its better part not ſo much by Scituation as Manners,

               <p>Surely it concerned thoſe who were deſirous of finiſhing the Warr, that theſe hopes ſhould not be ſettled too deep in the Opinions of the people: Nor was it a hard matter, to put a ſtop to the begun Project of the New Company, by the emulation of the Cities earneſtly drawing to themſelves the ordering of the Ships, and ſome interceding, that the Liberty of fetching Salt out of <hi>America,</hi> ſhould not be reſtrained by any Law. Therefore this debate being ſet apart, no leſs difficulties were obſerved to hinder thoſe that were deſirous of making peace: for although the Enemies Deſign might chiefly be diſcovered, yet the Governours of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Cities, from a received Opinion in the Prince of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>'s time, abhorred the very name of Peace: And to men of this perſwaſion, much appeared that would be loſt, if the Enemy ſhould openly profeſs himſelf contented with a Peace, whereby he could not regain the dominion he loſt by Warr; for that which of old was accounted a part of Prudence to break off all hope of reconciliation, had no other Baſis than this, That onely ſuch a Peace could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, as would bring along with it an inſulting Lord. On the other ſide, That it pertained both to the Security and Honour of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> if the Enemy could be drawn to a confeſſion of their Liberty: But the War yet growing hot, and new Cauſes of Indignation daily ariſing, either Victory made them fierce, or ſome ſlaughter drew them to the deſire of revenge, ſo that minds prepoſſeſſed, or byaſſed with affection, could not conſiderately ponder the Reaſons that induced to peace: But if any Remiſſion, or Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſhould be granted of Arms, there would not be wanting ſome favourers of peace, which being otherwiſe acceptable in it ſelf, would agree principally with the mind of the <hi>HOLLANDERS</hi> that were

Let us forward the anxious and doubtful cares of the States in this great Affair, for this day will yield a great and happy Omen to us, if forced to return to the War, or elſe will make the</hi> Spaniard <hi>more ſeriouſly to deſire Peace: Then may the Conquering</hi> Hollander <hi>with freedom, deliberate whether it will be more for his advantage, to lay aſide Arms, or ſtill to maintain War: We however in the interim, ſhall begin to be eſteemed happy in the Honour of this Maritime tryumph, or elſe ſhall be looked upon among the chief cauſes that lead to peace; and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Posterity, ſhall ſet a noble end to a War of</hi> 40 <hi>years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> Having ſpoken theſe things, he encouraged the Captains as well by his eyes, and countenance, as his words, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing largely their beſt endeavours, likewiſe ſtirred up both themſelves and others, by old and new examples of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> cruelty: ſo paſſing about an encouraging Cup, and renewing their Oath of fidelity, for that time they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. <hi>Avilas</hi> the Governour, finding Ships ſo much leſs than his, ſteering their courſe directly againſt him, commanded a <hi>Holland</hi> Priſoner that he had with him, to be brought to him; of whom he asked, <hi>What he thought was their Intentions?</hi> Who anſwer'd, <hi>Either I know not my Countrey men, or elſe they are ready to give you Battel.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> laughed, as thinking it a ſcorn, that their whole <hi>Fleet</hi> ſhould be compared with that onely <hi>Galeoon</hi> that was his Admiral: But when the <hi>Holland Fleet</hi> drew nearer, being compell'd to believe, what he ſaw
<pb n="886" facs="tcp:55798:452"/>
was true, he carryed his ſaid Admiral Galeoon, which by chance lay outermoſt, nearer to the City, cutting its Cables, that the Fortune of the <hi>Battel</hi> might firſt be tryed by the other Veſſels: Notwithſtanding which, <hi>Hemskerk</hi> keeping ſtill to his firſt purpoſe, paſſing by the reſt, ſet upon that alone; and at the firſt Onſet, cryed out, <hi>That all ſhould be lawful Frize therein to whoever took it, and appointing a Reward beſides to him that ſhould bring away the Enemies Top-Maſt Banner:</hi> Commanding, <hi>That they ſhould not ſhoot, until they were very wear, whereby the greater Terrour might ſtrike them on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Spaniard</hi> prevented him, in giving the firſt Volley of Shot, but he did no great damage by it. <hi>Hemſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerk,</hi> by this time, but a little way diſtant, began to ſhoot from his Fore-Deck, and preſently ſtriking upon the Enemies Ship he caſt Anchor. He ſtood openly in ſight, in the midſt of the Ship, when the <hi>Spaniard</hi> making thick and frequent ſhots, a Bullet (by chance) killing one, broke and tore off his left Thigh, and threw him groveling, being laden with Arms. He was ſenſible of the approach of Death; and therefore, praying God, mercifully to receive his departing Soul, he exhorted all about him, <hi>That they would not be careleſs in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their buſineſs, but would ſeek to repair the loſs of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with the Enemies Ruine.</hi> The death of the Admiral, being concealed by Captain <hi>Nerhoeven,</hi> did ſpread over the <hi>Fleet</hi> until the <hi>Battel</hi> was ended. The ſame endeavour'd, that the Cannon on the Right-ſide might be diſcharged: The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> now having loſt the uſe of his great Guns, applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to fight with ſmall Shot; but the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Shot did the greateſt damage, in regard the Enemy ſtood thicker, and more crowded together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lambert</hi> following, as he was commanded, at firſt ſhot at <hi>Avila</hi>'s Ship at a diſtance, but afterwards came nearer, and lay ſide by ſide: ſo that now a moſt furious Fight was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and all were involved in Clouds of Smoke; inſomuch, that at Noon-day they had the Reſemblance of a Nocturnal
<pb n="887" facs="tcp:55798:452"/>
Conflict: The reſt of the <hi>Battel</hi> wa ordered by Fortune, not according to Command: For while Captain <hi>Alteraſen</hi> of <hi>Zeland,</hi> delay'd to aſſault the Ship aſſigned to him, 3 others invaded him, to whom a fourth ſoon after joyned themſelves: Which having taken fire, by the perpetual vomiting of the Cannon, and that now danger drew near to the <hi>Aſſailants,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> withdrew themſelves, and quenched their Sails, which had likewiſe caught fire: But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fear, caſting aſide all care of the Ship, after all things in the Ship, and the Ship it ſelf, were ſeized by the Flame, forced alſo by the Enemies Shot, leaped head long into the Sea, and ſo exchanged one kind of death for another: Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Henry Long</hi> a <hi>Hollander,</hi> with more Policy, aſſailing another Galeoon, was kill'd with a Bullet, but that alſo was fir'd, and utterly burned. Again, another of the ſame Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, being ſhot between Wind and Water, by the coming in of the Waves, and its own Burden, ſuddainly ſunk. The reſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, as alſo ſome of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> not during to run the hazard of a cloſe Fight, conteſted at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, almoſt with equal damage to the Enemy and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>There were many ſhot alſo thunder'd upon them from the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Tariff;</hi> but ſuddain violence diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> one of their beſt Ships being blown up and torn in pieces by its own Powder, or elſe ſet on fire by themſelves: After the horrible Crack had thunder'd all over the Bay, the torn Ships Reliques, ſetting fire on thoſe Ships next to him, and they likewiſe drawing others into the like Danger and Ruine: They that remained, before the Miſchief ſhould reach to them, cutting their Cables, made haſt to the Shore; onely the Admiral prolonged the Iſſue of the Fight ſtoutly, making good her part againſt two Ships, until at laſt a Third came: But then the Banner or Enſign being pulled down, together with it they loſt all their Courages; and the Victors wholly entring, it was no longer a Fight, but a meer
<pb n="888" facs="tcp:55798:453"/>
Slaughter. All the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they leaped into the Sea-hoping to eſcape by ſwimming, were kill'd either by Swords, Pikes, or Bullets: Not could one fix his Eye on any part of the Bay, where the ſad Spectacle of dead or dying People was not with Horrour repreſented.</p>

                  <hi>Avilas</hi> not long ſurvive <hi>Hemskerk;</hi> He was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Sea-Commander, for he had accompanied <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> at the <hi>Battel</hi> of <hi>Lepanto:</hi> Among his Papers were found King <hi>Philip</hi>'s ſevere Inſtructions, not againſt the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> onely, but all others, who had in any manner aſſiſted them. The <hi>French,</hi> (whoſe Ships, before ſurprized by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but now deſerted in his flight) afforded a ſafe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to the <hi>Conquerours;</hi> They that were taken Priſoners, and kept alive, after, by a rare chance of good Fortune, the Souldier ſent by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain to kill them, was by a Bullet intercepted; and a ſecond (ſent to put the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in Execution) periſh'd by the like means, at laſt had their Bonds and Chains ſtruck off by an accidental ſhot. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>Battel,</hi> the Night continued quiet; and the next Morning it appear'd, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admiral, (which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had neglected to keep, as ſuppoſing themſelves to have undertaken enough) yet floted intire, with ſome few Men in it; who, while the Victors Fury raged, had hidden themſelves in Holes; from whence creeping our, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the Town, the People voluntarily ſet fire thereon, that it might not become a Prey to the Enemy: Two days the <hi>Holland Fleet</hi> continued in the place of the <hi>Battel,</hi> eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Victory rather honourable, than advantagious or gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>During all the time of their ſtay there, Armed Men ran up and down; and, on the other ſide, the Townſmen gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together all their beſt and moſt precious Things, prepar'd to fly: For all Things were now fill'd with fear, the News of this Action being brought by like <hi>Meſſengers</hi> to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> which would certainly have been a great cauſe of making
<pb n="889" facs="tcp:55798:453"/>
                  <hi>Hamskerk</hi> much more confident, if he had lived; but now all his Counſels fell to the ground with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tittuan,</hi> a City of <hi>Barbary,</hi> not very antient, ſcituate at the Foot of the Mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> near theſe <hi>Streights,</hi> is ſubject to the <hi>Turk:</hi> Hither the <hi>Hollanders</hi> repaired to amend their ſhips, and get help and remedy for their ſick and wounded Men, of whom they had Threeſcore, beſides almoſt one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſlain in the Fight. The <hi>Governour</hi> of the City, both ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and hated of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> received the <hi>Conquerours</hi> with much <hi>Congratulations,</hi> and ſending to them alſo many <hi>Preſents;</hi> And moreover, offer'd them a Supply of Foot Souldiers, if they would pleaſe to aſſault <hi>Septa,</hi> a Town up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Coaſt, but ſcituate a little more inward, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> But they being more deſirous of Booty than War, ſo determined among themſelves, that the greateſt part choſe to Forage the Coaſts of <hi>Portugal:</hi> Others went to the <hi>Azores;</hi> ſome to the <hi>Fortunate Iſlands;</hi> and the reſt coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the <hi>Promontery</hi> of <hi>Antabria:</hi> Two Ships, of thoſe that had brought Proviſions, were ſent into <hi>Holland,</hi> to carry home the wounded Men, and the Body of <hi>Hemskerk,</hi> which Admiral for the better preſerving thereof, was embalmed. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this <hi>Battel</hi> at <hi>Gibralter,</hi> which was fought the 25 day of <hi>April,</hi> was not yet arrived to the knowledge of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> but then ſuppoſed to have been brought by ſpeedy <hi>Meſſengers</hi> out of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Brabant,</hi> when <hi>Naya,</hi> then Reſident at the <hi>Hague,</hi> deſired the Aſſembly of the <hi>States,</hi> the 27 of <hi>April,</hi> ſetting forth to them, <hi>That he lately, at their Requeſt, promiſed the Arch-Dukes ſhould take care, that the King of</hi> Spain <hi>ſhould confirm the Articles, when he had no ſuch thing, either in his Charge or Inſtructions; And that the Arch-Dukes, when they might have refuſed that Authority, yet, out of love to Peace, by promiſing the ſame, had made good his aſſurance to them: Now therefore it was but just, that as thoſe Princes had by an extraordinary belief omitted nothing, that might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to Peace; ſo the States, on the other ſide ſhould remove all
<pb n="890" facs="tcp:55798:454"/>
things that might be Obſtructions to the ſame intent; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhould recall their Fleet out of</hi> Spain, <hi>which had lately been ſent thither, to ſpoil all the Maritime Parts of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> Moreover he deſired, <hi>That thoſe things which had lately been agreed of late, concerning the forbearance of encamping, and invading each others Country, might be declared in more expreſs and plain tearms, for that the words, wherein they were expreſſed, were more ambiguous:</hi> And ſince many Things might happen before the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> which ought to be publiſhed by the <hi>States</hi> in the Arch-Duke's Names, He required Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of publike Credit, and ſafe Conduct; by vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he might (without hazard) go up and down between both Parties.</p>
               <p>And now the greatneſs of the buſineſs in hand had wrought upon all Mens Minds, inſomuch, that ſome of the principal Perſons of each Province, came and were preſent at the daily Debates of the Council: At the firſt, there was much heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning the recalling of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> ſome Rumours of the Victory at <hi>Gibraltar</hi> being ſcatter'd abroad. Whereupon ſome averred, <hi>That it was convenient to proſecute their good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and that Peace ſhould not be diſcourſed of, but in the heat of War.</hi> Others were of Opinion, <hi>That they ought to ſhew as well in words as reality, that their Minds were not averſe from a true Peace; which if it were not at that time brought to paſs, not onely the Sea ſhould be ſecured, but they would all unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their Arms, not ſo much for Revenge of old Injuries, as of their deluſive Peace.</hi> And it had almoſt hapned, that they who deſired <hi>Peace,</hi> by making the <hi>Spaniard</hi> more ſecure; and they that were againſt it, putting the Enemy in fear, and ſeeking after the Cauſes, why <hi>Peace</hi> ſhould be ſought, that they had brought to nothing their own Counſels.</p>
               <p>Among theſe Tranſactions, Embaſſadours came out of <hi>France,</hi> the chief of whom was Mounſieur <hi>Peter Janine,</hi> of old a great Supporter of the <hi>Guiſian</hi> League; but returning to his Obedience towards the King, together with the Duke <hi>de

Mayn;</hi> and from thence forward, was a Miniſter of great Fidelity, and of great Eſtimation and Authority among the chief Counſellors, for his great and eminent Experiments in points of Prudence, having a Wit rarely skilful in handling Affairs of State; and not onely knowing in the Theory and Practice of the Law, but throughly inſtructed in all other good Arts: Beſides, he was ſo prevailing, both in Countenance and Words, that when he endeavour'd moſt to hide himſelf, his Judgment would moſt evidently appear. With him were joyned Mounſieur <hi>Buzenvale,</hi> formerly the King's Agent with the <hi>States,</hi> and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>unſieur <hi>Elias Playce,</hi> who was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſucceed <hi>Buzenvale</hi> in that Dignity: It ſeems the King took it ill, that they had begun to lay the Foundation of ſo great a Matter, onely by the Knowledg and Advice of a few, which he judged they ought not to have begun without his Approbation, as well in regard of his Grandeur, as the Benefits he had often done to the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Therefore the Embaſſadors, according to the Directions given them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing many Things, by which they declared, how highly the King had deſerved of that <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> They preſently fell to Complaints, firſt bitterly inveighing againſt them, who ſeeming to love the Thing, yet ſpoke ſharply of him, as being ambitious to get the Dominion over them. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when they had involved Themſelves in Treaties with the Enemy, they made a Clandeſtine Application to the King, which alſo he could not but take in very evil part: yet nevertheleſs, he would not forbear at this time with Courteſie to ſet forth his Friendſhip, by this his Embaſſie; declaring, <hi>That he would, for the future, aſſiſt them, if they were neceſſitated to make War: Or, if they thought fit to make Peace, He would, by his Authority, make the ſame to them just at the preſent, and permanent for the future; That ſome might be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the Aſſembly of the States, that ſhould before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſsadors, weigh the Ability of the Treaſury, and the ways and means conducing to Peace.</hi>

                  <pb n="892" facs="tcp:55798:455"/>And leſt the <hi>French</hi> Kings Authority might offend other of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Allyes, it was judged neceſſary to requeſt the Kings of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> as alſo the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> and Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> to be aiding and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting by their Counſells in theſe doubtful and ambiguous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Naya</hi>'s demands, after long debate, that part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed who were for Peace; Whereupon it was Decreed, That the Fleet ſhould be recalled from <hi>Spain</hi> aſſoon as king <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould have confirmed the Articles granted by the Archdukes; and that in the interim, neither any new ſhips ſhould be ſent thither, nor any proviſions; That in the Neighbour Sea, which is encloſed within the Streights and narrow paſſage by <hi>Bulloin,</hi> from thence forward ſhould be a ceſſation of arms, but upon this condition, That none but Fiſhermen ſhould be permitted to go out of the Ports of <hi>Flanders.</hi> And as ſoon as <hi>Philips</hi> Inſtruments of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came, the like ceſſation of Arms ſhould be in all that Sea that runs by <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> as far as <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and from thence all over the more inland Sea. They conſulted alſo for the ſame nearer to them by Land. And thus the United States encloſed their juriſdiction and ſecurity, within the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous boundaries of the <hi>Eemes,</hi> the <hi>Vider,</hi> the <hi>Iſſel,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Wael,</hi> and below <hi>Grave,</hi> the <hi>Maes,</hi> all great Rivers of note; but the Archdukes Countreyes were bounded with leſs famous Rivers, ſuch as <hi>Demmer,</hi> and <hi>Gatt,</hi> in <hi>Brabant, Ley,</hi> and <hi>Amand,</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi> All that lay without theſe Borders was ſubject to War, excepting only the Cities, Forts, and Caſtles; yet ſo as no bounds ſhould defend the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themſelves, offering injuries one to the other, either by Sea or Land. Thus before <hi>Naya</hi> departed, it appeared, how little in vain be protracted his time among the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>

               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, it would not be granted that he ſhould ſtay at the <hi>Hague,</hi> for that the minds of the States

                  </gap>ity were offered, to take the ſame, and withal, to detect the Enemies Treachery. When they met, the Monk with great Eloquence gave him thanks, That by his aſſiſtance, ſome glimmerings of Peace had been attained; for it is to be underſtood, that when <hi>Naya</hi> came firſt among the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> by the Mediation of one <hi>Craulen</hi> (who was nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in bloud to <hi>Arſen</hi>) he found the firſt acceſs to him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he added, That he was not ignorant how great danger <hi>Arſenius</hi> had hazarded by this Deed, if the matter had not ſucceeded according to both their wiſhes, a popular or Ariſtocratical Government being alwayes full of envy, emulation, and jealouſy. That the Archdukes did greatly love, and highly eſteem, this his willing inclination to the Peace of the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> and that as they would for the future give greater rewards, ſo they would for the preſent reſtore to him the houſe which he formerly poſſeſſed in <hi>Bruxells,</hi> and that the Marqueſs <hi>Spinola,</hi> who was of the ſame mind and deſire with them, whether a Peace were conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or only a Truce for nine years, would promiſe to give him fifty thouſand Scutes: of which fifteen thouſand, ſhould be forthwith paid to him where he would appoint, and for the ſame produced a writing cautionary under the ſaid <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nlaes</hi> hands. Afterwards <hi>Naya</hi> in hit own name preſented to <hi>Arſens</hi> Wife a Diamond of great value: <hi>Arſen</hi> giving thanks for the houſe, and ſeeming to believe himſelf obliged by the Covenant for the ſame, when it ſhould come to him from the City of <hi>Bruxells,</hi> for a while refuſed the reſt, as too
<pb n="894" facs="tcp:55798:456"/>
hardly preſſing upon his fidelity, yet at length he received both the Jewel, and <hi>Spinola's</hi> writing, and ſo departing, he declared the whole matter to the Prince, and the Prince again related the ſame to ſome few of the States, The Prince ſuppoſing the matter fit to be concealed for a time, refuſed the Cuſtody of the Preſents. But ſoon after <hi>Arſen</hi> being ſollicited by new Letters from <hi>Naya</hi> to come, and receive his fifty thouſand Scutes, and fearing leſt this doubtful and dangerous ſecret might break out to his diſadvantage, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the whole matter in all its circumſtances, to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the States. They appointed <hi>George Debes</hi> a man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary fidelity, and chief overſeer of the common Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, to keep both the Charter and Diamond: yet could not <hi>Arſen</hi> by all this care, eſcape the hatred of the vulgar, who interpreting the common report of the buſineſs to the worſt ſenſe, grew ſo enraged, that he was compelled to ſet forth the truth of the matter in Print to prevent further miſchief that might enſue.</p>
               <p>About this time, Admiral <hi>Hemskerks</hi> body was brought to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> where it was received with high honour and applauſe, and with no leſs grief and ſorrow, becauſe having been the Author of ſo great a Victory, his Countrey was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have received the greater prejudice in his loſs: to him then firſt of all was publickly given a Funeral, and a Monument, with an Inſcription teſtifying, with great honor, and eloquence, the famous Actions by him done. After which they ſent to the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> deſirous to dive more narrowly into the Affairs of <hi>Holland, John Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> an aſſiſtant to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Dort,</hi> and <hi>Jacob Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ree,</hi> a man in principal eſteem in the Senate of <hi>Zeland;</hi> theſe ſet before him the preſent ſtrength and charge of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and how much the Treaſury was judged unable both by the Prince and Senate, to maintain the War in any hopeful condition. Theſe were very gently received, by King <hi>James,</hi> who promiſed to take a ſpecial care of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="895" facs="tcp:55798:456"/>
of his Allyes, for he well underſtood, <hi>That by the</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers <hi>Arms, as well his own, as the Peace of</hi> Ireland <hi>was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. And no leſs did he foreſee, how unfit he was to perſwade to War, who till that time had never given any ſupply of mony to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it,</hi> (which was the greateſt want of that War) <hi>nor had at the preſent any to help them with.</hi> Not long after, there came from him to the <hi>Hague, Richard Spencer,</hi> of an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Family in <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>Ralf Winwood,</hi> then returning out of <hi>Brittain,</hi> but otherwiſe Leiger Ambaſſador for the King with the States.</p>
               <p>In the intetim, <hi>Spinola</hi> by Letters ſent to the States, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the King of <hi>Spains</hi> confirmation of the Archdukes Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and deſires a ſafe conduct for <hi>Don Lewis Verreike, Albertus</hi> his Secretary, who ſhould bring the Inſtrument, and declare other things relating to the matter: which being granted, and He come, immediately the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſubtilties appeared, for the words of the Covenants were not confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Kings Authority according to the Cuſtome of a juſt League, but the Charters were written in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, which is generally ſpoken by the <hi>Duth</hi> Nobility, &amp; bore date the eighth of <hi>May</hi> and brought to them the firſt of <hi>June;</hi> which were ſubſcribed by the King in no other manner, then he uſed to do towards his Subjects, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, That he promiſed the Ceſſation of Arms ſhould be ratified, calling <hi>Albertus</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Princes and Lords of the Netherlands, but in the interim by no word Himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Liberty of the States, according as was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nay more, in the very foremoſt Covenant of <hi>Albertus,</hi> the words that declared their Liberty, were totally left out, which <hi>Verreike</hi> called by a ridiculous pretext, the Writers neglect. When he ſent word to <hi>Bruxells</hi> of that objection, the Archdukes ſaid nothing, only <hi>John Richardot,</hi> the chief of the Cabinet Counſel anſwered, <hi>That the States mistook the words, for ſo long as King</hi> Philip <hi>rejected none of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, they ought to believe that He approved all.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

though the Archdukes might proteſt the performance of all things they had promiſed; yet that their candor and benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity might be the more evident, they ſent back again into <hi>Spain,</hi> for the mending of thoſe things that were found fault with. And the States did not delay to recal their Fleet out of <hi>Spain,</hi> left while they profeſſed to be deſirous of Peace, their Actions ſhould go rancounter to their words.</p>
               <p>But about this time aroſe many hot diſputes among the United Provinces, many furiouſly crying out, <hi>That they were publickly deluded by the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>who for the better concealing their Treacheries, had only made an empty offer of Liberty, but now their deceitful dealing bring manifest, he would only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this one thing, to denude them cunningly of their Arms.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Enemy was ſaid to be preparing a Fleet both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> the danger whereof was the more ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, in regard it was unknown what deſign they intended. To all theſe were added the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, then very averſe to Peace, becauſe they ſaid it was evident to them, That the nature of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was never officious, but when they ſtudied miſchief; but they had ſcarſe reſolved to conſult of that matter, which before they began to agree to, that they would neither ſend proviſions nor ſupplyes to the Fleet, by which means it might be compelled to return by neceſſity, which is ſtronger then any command. Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on matters were brought to that paſs, that <hi>Olden-Barnevelde</hi> ſhould in the name of the States make anſwer, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments brought out of <hi>Spain,</hi> were not congruous to what was promiſed, and therefore the States drew up the ſame is the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Tongue, which were to be in like manner perfected within two Months by the King, if he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped any further to continue the Treaty, which pattern he was to deliver at the ſame time. And becauſe ſome delay happened thereby, the States prorogued the ſpace for delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration after the Inſtruments were anew confirmed, from that preſent time, until the firſt of <hi>September;</hi> yet it was granted
<pb n="897" facs="tcp:55798:457"/>
in honour of the Archdukes (againſt whoſe will theſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects ſeemed to be committed), that the Fleet ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, and that after ſix weeks from that day, all things whatſoever that were taken, ſhould be free, and not taken as Prize. But they would keep the Kings Letters till better were brought, chiefly for this purpoſe, to maintain the ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arms: Nor in the interim (faith he) can we enough wonder, if this Affair be cordially and with uprightneſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, to what purpoſe ſerve theſe great Rewards, <hi>Behold the Diamond! See the Chain! Look upon</hi> Spinola's <hi>hand!</hi> (and here they were all produced) Theſe cannot be ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſpition in the givers, but that they who received them by publick command, cannot yet be free from the undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved envy of the people. Be not deceived, for it is not here as in Kingdomes, where two or three rule all things at their beck, and the reſt of the people are ſlaves, but We Govern, and are Governed by turns; And if this Councel, this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, be not ſufficiently guarded againſt your bribes, We will encreaſe their number: Carry back your gifts to their Owners, which you need not give to obtain Peace, and would be a high wickedneſs in Us to receive in prejudice of our Liberty. <hi>Verreike</hi> being on a ſudden ſurpriſed, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, but that if any ſuch thing were offered, it was without the Archdukes knowledg; nor was it a wonder, if Monks that are a covetous ſort of men, look upon others to be ſuch as themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now was the appointed time of ſix Weeks paſt, when the Fleet was recalled out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and alſo <hi>Naya</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reike</hi> having their deſired ſafe conduct, are come, and bring with them out of <hi>Spain,</hi> another Writing, which contained almoſt the ſame words preſcribed by the States, with this only difference, <hi>That the King profeſſed himſelf ready to Treat with them as a Free People in any place, and that he would chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge nothing againſt them,</hi> adding, <hi>That he aſserted this, as well for maintaining the Credit and Promiſe of the Archdukes, as for
<pb n="898" facs="tcp:55798:458"/>
confirming a Peace or long Truce, which when it was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, He would fully perform all other things that might be deſired for the ſanction thereof; but that it ſhould be Treated of and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that League, as concerning other deſires of Parties, ſo alſo of the buſineſs of Religion Wherein if there were no Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Concluſion; then his Right ſhould not be prejudiced in any thing by this Writing, but all things to remain intire as before to both parties.</hi> They that were more curious, obſerved, That a buſineſs of ſo high concernment, was careleſly written in Paper, and not engroſſed in Parchment for the perpetuating thereof, and that the Name of <hi>Philip</hi> was not ſubſcribed as to Equals, but like a King, according to his Cuſtome in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to His Subjects. The Odium of all theſe things, <hi>Naya</hi> foreſeeing the ſame, attempted to mollify with good words, declaring, That he himſelf, as beſt knowing the deſires of the Archdukes, and the States in relation to Peace, went into <hi>Spain,</hi> and informed the King in what condition the ſtate of Affairs on both ſides was, and how neceſſary Peace was to the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> There the matter was debated in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, That whatever was to be Treated of and concluded, might be more firm and laſting, and that not only the King, who is mortal, but the Kingdome it ſelf, which cannot dye, ſhould be bound by thoſe Agreements. He proteſted alſo with much earneſtneſs and high aſſeverations, That the King was very deſirous of Peace, and that he intended to walk in the right and plain way to attain the ſame, and therefore had ſo clearly declared his mind in writing, which he might have concealed, if he had had any intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
               <p>After him, <hi>Verreike</hi> highly applauding the Archdukes faithful dealing, he made an excuſe, That King <hi>Philips</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions were not Written in <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> but in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue. In this Tongue he converſeth with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, in this he Treats with Free People, nor was it equal for them to take from him this Liberty, who had

               <p>At this time diſſimilitude of thoughts began to diſcover great variety of affections in the United Provinces, the Prince ſuſpecting Treaties, and ſome Cities both in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> hoping a greater advantage from the War, then they could expect from Peace; and therefore he moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and collected minds and thoſe that were unanimous in their deſires, looked upon theſe things with more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſpleaſure, for the acknowledgment of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with the only eſteem whereof being filled, they began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So much confidence had they gotten, by obſerving that a great part of the United Provinces were weary of the War; and knowing it would be much more beneficial to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to make an Agreement with them ſeverally, then all United and conjunct. But the States taking the Prince's Counſel, together with the advice of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ambaſſadors, at length agreed in this Opinion, That they would declare to the Archdukes Ambaſſadors, That the Letters brought out of <hi>Spain,</hi> were not anſwerable to the firſt Promiſes, becauſe the laſt words would ſeem to bear ſuch an Interpretation, that the former Grants might obliquely be avoided thereby; and they being a Free People, and ſuch over whom, neither King <hi>Philip,</hi> nor the Archdukes, had any Authority, would of their own accord conſult of their

Domeſtique Peace, and not ſuffer their Affairs to be ordered at the pleaſure of others. That there was now a fit occaſion given them, not to enter into any further Treaty; yet they would offer ſo much towards the deſired concord, that they would by Letters ſignify the whole matter to the particular Councels of every Province, and deſire their Judgments thereupon, only with this Proteſtation, That they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of nothing that might be prejudicial to their Liberty; And that the Archdukes ſhould within ſix weeks time, know what was their reſult, That if they thought fit to hearken to ſuch Propoſals of Peace as they ſhould offer, then within ten dayes after, ſuch Ambaſſadors as they heretofore promiſed to ſend, ſhould come to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where alſo their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould be preſent, but upon this confidence nevertheleſs, That neither the King, nor the Archdukes, ſhould offer any Propoſition, that might intrench upon the States ordering their own Affairs within themſelves.

               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> and the <hi>Zelanders,</hi> further inſiſted, that the very words for Confirmation of their liberty, ſhould then be contrived, and forthwith ſent to <hi>Albertus,</hi> whereto if he would not conſent, then to let him know, that they would proceed no further in the Treaty: This ſentence ſeemed very hard to ſome, who deſired the Enemy might be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to.</p>
               <p>At this time, a new year approached, at the beginning whereof, the time for the Ceſſation of Arms was to expire, nor did the Arch Dukes deſire its prolongation, expecting
<pb n="902" facs="tcp:55798:460"/>
to have had an Addreſs made to them to that purpoſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the States write that they truſted to the Arch Dukes Promiſes, with the ſame Reſolution they had engaged to <hi>Naya</hi> and <hi>Verreike,</hi> expecting a Treaty. And to that purpoſe they were ready to ſend ſeven or eight from them, if they would pleaſe to ſend the like number, or fewer of theirs, whom they would endeavour equally to fit, as formerly had been diſcovered, with Command and Inſtructions from them, as they hoped the Arch Dukes and King <hi>Philip</hi> would do the like, to wit, that the ſaid Commiſſioner ſhould with all poſſible ſpeed expedite the buſineſs; and that they would conſider, whether it were convenient to the matter in hand, whether they would lengthen the Ceſſation of Arms for a Month, or ſix weeks; That they would be pleaſed, it ſhould be for the longer time, if ſo, the Arch Dukes thought fit to conſent; That the <hi>States</hi> would have the <hi>Legates</hi> to be ſuch as the Arch Dukes were for the future hoped to be. The meaning whereof was, that only <hi>Netherlanders</hi> ſhould be ſent. For the Arch Dukes firſt Letters, whereby the <hi>States</hi> were moved to a Treaty, clearly contained the ſame: Nor was it a matter of ſmall advantage to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that the concluſions of peace ſhould be weighed together by the principal men of their ſo wearily allyed Neighbours, among whom as there was leſs fraud and craft, and one common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of intereſt equal with them, though not for liberty, yet againſt forein oppreſſion and tyranny; which being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen by the Arch Dukes, they on the other hand were as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to the contrary, and from the very beginning, the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlandiſh Nobles</hi> had privily foſtered the ſame deſign, until it ſhould as of neceſſity ſeem to be thrown not only upon them, but the Commons alſo; And lately, <hi>Naya</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reike,</hi> when they were at the <hi>Hague,</hi> were delayed, ſome ſpeeches being caſt abroad, whether the <hi>States</hi> would endure any forein Commiſſioners, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Affairs were no leſs in Agitation, than thoſe of the Arch Duke: But
<pb n="903" facs="tcp:55798:460"/>
then their deſign failed of its effect; yet at this time, the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> who were deſirous of peace, when either by conjecture, or ſome private intimation, that it was likely that <hi>Spinola</hi> himſelf the <hi>General</hi> of the War, together with a <hi>Spaniſh Senator,</hi> ſhould be ſent, of whom <hi>Spinola</hi> was by ſome private means known to be inclinable to peace; and eſteeming it of little advantage, by much diſcourſe to the Counſel to breed further jealouſies in ſuſpicious minds, they earneſtly endeavoured, that the <hi>States Letters</hi> ſhould be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Naya</hi> and <hi>Verreike,</hi> wherein they ſhould be deſired, <hi>That they would certainly inform them of the number and names of the Commiſſioners, that ſo a fitting care might be taken for their Proviſions and Entertainment:</hi> In theſe <hi>Letters</hi> was a <hi>Schedule</hi> incloſed, careleſly, as if is had been a matter of no moment, ſignifying, <hi>That they had deſired one or another might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Legation, beſides Natives: being well pleaſed in that point, to ſubmit to the Arch Dukes, however, the States did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Theſe words were ambiguouſly interpreted, for that as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſeemed only to admit of one ſtranger, ſo the Arch Dukes ſuppoſed and ſo believed, that two were not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and conſequently, that the <hi>General</hi> of the War who was no <hi>Spaniard,</hi> would not be refuſed; The name alſo of Natives, might be extended to the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> who were adjoyning to the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and under the ſame <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> left <hi>Richardotte</hi> ſhould be excluded, who for his many Counſels, and long continuance in the <hi>Court,</hi> was eſteemed a principal Perſon, fit for the managing this ſo great Affair, and therefore thought not to be abſent.</p>

But the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were the Authors of that Opinion, granted both the Dominion, and all Right thereof to <hi>Thierry</hi> as Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, without any mention of a connected Fee; and this only in that part, which formerly belonged to the Church of <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> according to the Evil Cuſtom of that Age, inriching Princes, out of Things conſecrated to Divine Uſes: Not long after, the Empire being divided between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Germanes</hi> prevailed about the <hi>Rhine:</hi> But there is extant a <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Otho</hi> the Third, which grants to the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> to poſſeſs as his own Free-hold, what before he enjoy'd but by a kind of Tenant-Right: But in a ſhort time after, Wars aroſe between the <hi>Emperours,</hi> and <hi>Earls;</hi> the one demanding; the other denying Obedience: Yet there were ſome Princes, who affecting the Favour of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> named themſelves <hi>Vaſſals of the Empire;</hi> yet with ſuch Liberty, as that they were obliged to no other Duty, than that of <hi>Reverence,</hi> among whom <hi>William</hi> became <hi>Emperour:</hi>
                  <pb n="907" facs="tcp:55798:462"/>
Nor did the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> being born under <hi>Emperours,</hi> think of any Change: But the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> and after them the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> refuſed to make any Oath of Allegiance, deriving their Liberty from great Antiquity; as if the Emperor <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> had releaſed to <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> all Right of Empire; <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Son of <hi>Frederick,</hi> being rather the Father, and Tutor of a Prince, than a Prince; and making oppoſition againſt the Cities by Forein Force, reckon'd <hi>Holland,</hi> and other people of the <hi>Burgundian</hi> Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction within the Body of the Empire, but the <hi>States</hi> very eagerly oppoſed the ſame; and this, among all the reſt of the Cauſes, of the begun Commotions, was look'd upon as one. But <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth affecting the Empire, endeavouring to expel the <hi>French</hi> as Foreiners, it was objected by the very <hi>Germans</hi> themſelves, that the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> belonged no more to the <hi>Almain Empire,</hi> than the <hi>French</hi> did, being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged neither to pay Tributes to it, be ſubject to its Laws, not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n its Decrees and Conſtitutions; But He, the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to attain the Honour he ſo earneſtly thirſted after, promiſed that he would bring it to paſſe, that by a firm League, the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> ſhould unite and grow together with the <hi>Germans;</hi> and ſoon after, brought it to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that, what could be offered, either for the priviledge of <hi>Germany,</hi> or the liberty of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> being heard and underſtood, he confeſſed at length, that only <hi>Gelderland</hi> and <hi>Utrecht,</hi> were Feodaries to the <hi>Empire;</hi> yet nevertheleſs, for the future, he required that the reſt of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> ſhould joyntly make one part of the <hi>German</hi> Empire: not that they ſhould receive Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from thence, but that he might confer unto the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick neceſſities, as much as the two <hi>Princes Electors;</hi> and alſo that they ſhould be under the Protection of <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſhould have right of ſuffrage in their <hi>Dyets</hi> and <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> in all things elſe, they ſhould keep their liberty intire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="908" facs="tcp:55798:463"/>Upon the account of this League, it was, that the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> at what time they were ſubject to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the help of <hi>Germany,</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> injuries: And in the Treaty of <hi>Breda,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> ſaying, that <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland</hi> belonged to the <hi>German Empire,</hi> (which he ſpoke meerly to win the favour of that Nation,) King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> Embaſſadors, with much earneſtneſs, denyed the ſame: But being compelled to defend themſelves, and obtaining no help from thence, from that time they withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from bearing any ſhare in thoſe foreign burdens: Nor was it a new thing, that Leagues were in this manner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, ſince almoſt all <hi>Europe,</hi> withdrew it ſelf from the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Emperours,</hi> being by them left undefended againſt the <hi>Barbarians:</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> by the ſame Right, obtained their liberty againſt the <hi>Emperours:</hi> But it is not convenient for us any longer to proſecute theſe things; for the order of our intended Hiſtory, now recalls us to proceed in the ſame, without further digreſſion.</p>
               <p>Therefore, after the violence of Arms was ſomewhat mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated by Covenants, yet the Souldiers did not omit for the whole Year to make Invaſions where it was lawful, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on that laſt opportunity of making War: For <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> had commanded a few Horſemen to go to <hi>Lingen,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Money for Pay. Theſe being by chance met by a ſtronger party of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Bentheym,</hi> were ſurprized and taken: For when they had betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Town of <hi>Steenfort,</hi> ſome of the Purſuers entred pell-mel with them, wile the Townſmen, ſhutting up the Ports, kept others out. Both Parties fought valiantly within the Gates: Thoſe, to keep their Money; Theſe, on the other ſide, greedy to win it. They that were without, threatned to force the Gates, unleſs they were ſet open, as well for them, as the Enemies. Then each of them ſend to their Neighbour Friends in Garriſons, deſiring them to ſend Aſſiſtance: Thus from the ſmall beginning of a Skirmiſh, was likely to

Thus the ſtrength of the <hi>Confederates</hi> being broken, the Arch-Dukes ſpent that time of Reſt which they had from the Enemy, for the encouraging and fortifying Diſcipline by Examples of Severity, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof being <hi>Didaco Ibarra,</hi> one ſent from <hi>Spain,</hi> to overlook the <hi>Treaſury</hi> and <hi>Militia;</hi> Therefore they declare by an Edict, the flagitious wickedneſs of that Sedition at <hi>Dieſt,</hi> and their offences againſt the Publike; who, although they were pardoned their Crimes, yet therefore they were not to be retained in Service as Souldiers, without further Licence: And therefore all that were Aſſociates in that

Sedition, they command, within one Night and Day, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and never to return into, or ſet foot upon any the Lands belonging to the Arch-Dukes, and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> threatning preſent juſtice to all that ſhould remain in, or return to the Country; and propoſing great Rewards to all that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended any of them.</p>
               <p>The wiſer and more moderate ſort of Men eſteem'd it not fit for that time to publiſh their Belief and Opinion to the ſuſpitious <hi>Hollander;</hi> and, by ſo ſubtle an Interpretation, to elude (though never ſo deſervedly) their Promiſes to the Souldiers.</p>
               <p>In this place, it is not fit to defraud Poſterity, of that rare Example of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Wealth and Ingepuity, which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Operations againſt Nature; for ſome private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons undertook, and fortunately brought to paſs, the draining of the Lake <hi>Bameſtren,</hi> adjoyning to <hi>Parmeren,</hi> ſeven hours Journey in compaſs, and ſix Foot deep in Water; This they did with Engines driven by the Wind; and againſt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Force of the Waters, they raiſed Banks: Indeed, the Iſles of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> were for the moſt part of a very low Situation, but were preſerved from being overflowed, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great Labour and Induſtry: Nor did the Ocean ceaſe to vindicate it ſelf, by Breaches upon, and Inundations of the Fields and Towns; ſome whereof were long ſince by the ſame utterly overthrown, and the Currents of Rivers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altered in ſuch manner, that there was hardly any where to be ſeen the like great Exchanges of Land and Water.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> inſiſted on this, that they might try the Enemies minds, at the beginning, by the moſt difficult things whether they only deſited a Treaty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or really intended a Peace: But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were for a more dilatory way, and that they might avoid any conceſſions they ſhould be forced to, as often as they thought fit.</p>

Antiquity averred Arms to be juſtly taken up againſt them who excluded any from their Harbors, how much more then againſt them who would drive them from the Ports belonging to others?

But that they ſhould ſet ſo high an eſteem upon <hi>Philip</hi> for yielding up a part of his Dominion, there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon truly for the ſame, ſince it was not a gift, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the truth, without which there was no hopes of concord. It were more honourable for him to give or take Peace, then while his Affairs ſucceeded ſo well, to ſell it; which if he would not believe, he ſhould eft-ſoons experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it.

But the States, that abhorred thoſe conditions, revived the Counſels of the <hi>American</hi> ſociety lately laid aſide, if perchance they could work upon the Enemy by fear. But they quickly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood theſe were but threats; nor indeed did that matter proceed any further, while they who were deſirous of Peace among the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were afraid to be ſevere towards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters.</p>
               <p>Without doubt this ſtate of Affairs was very prejudicial to
<pb n="924" facs="tcp:55798:471"/>
the people of the United Provinces, Arms being only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, as uncertain whether there ſhould be Peace or War; whereupon many of the common people, who got their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by War, were not apt to apply themſelves to any other buſineſs, and ſo were afflicted with two evils, idleneſs, and penury, and therefore the States eſteemed it more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to haſten the end of the Treaty; to this purpoſe they adviſed the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> That they ſhould on both ſides pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the chief heads of what was to be inſiſted on. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it to be an unuſual thing, to make new Propoſals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the former were concluded; yet at length they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, not that they would diſtinctly and plainly offer the particulars, but only the chief points in general, and that in obſcure tearms; for they ſaid there remained yet to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of concerning their limits, the reſtitution of goods, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign commerce, money, and thoſe immunities which were granted to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or others in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> as alſo of Religion, and Neighbouring Princes.

On the other ſide, the States delivered not a few, and thoſe ambiguouſly contrived, but eight and twenty branches or heads, contained in plain words, ſuch as uſual for the confirmation of Peace, or taking away the injuries of War; nor did they omit private commodity, either of the Houſe of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> or of <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> whoſe Father <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> for a ſhort time poſſeſſed the Kingdome of <hi>Portugal.</hi>

Nor did he obſcurely maintain, that nothing could be determined concerning Trade, unleſs the pleaſure of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> were firſt known therein, and therefore the States ſhould remember to contrive ſuch a manner of Covenant, or Article, as might be approved by a Prince, who is neither Conquered, nor a Captive, but really deſirous of Peace.</p>
               <p>The Moneth of <hi>March</hi> being almoſt ſpent, the time li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited for the Ceſſation of Arms was almoſt expired; it was agreed therefore, That <hi>April,</hi> and <hi>May</hi> ſhould be added. And then the <hi>States</hi> offered this Condition concerning the <hi>Indies,</hi> That it ſhould be free for their Citizens during the ſpace of nine years, from the Concluſion of the Peace, to go to all thoſe places, unleſs where the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had Dominion. And that they ſhould not at any time come thither, unleſs they had permiſſion from the Governors, or were compelled by neceſſity. And during that time, all hoſtility ſhould ceaſe between them and their companions, and if any ſhould do the contrary, it ſhould not be lawful to take vengeance for the ſame in any other place, then where the injury was committed, or the doers of the injuries lived, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the expiration of the ſaid nine years, there ſhould be a more firm and laſting Agreement endeavoured.

But the freedome of home Commerce, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſeemed to ſuſpect, they provided for the ſame
<pb n="926" facs="tcp:55798:472"/>
by theſe Articles: Firſt, That all Taxes invented during the War ſhould be aboliſhed, and only the antient moderate Tributes remain. That the priviledg of drawing Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe to particular Markets, uſurped by divers Cities, as of <hi>German<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> Wines to <hi>Dort, French</hi> Wines to <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> ſhould be prevalent againſt the Citizens of other Nations and Countreyes. On the other ſide, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whither this tended, declared it to pleaſe them, that no greater charges ſhould be laid upon Forreigners Merchandiſing, then upon Natives; but the rights of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to continue in the ſame poſture they were before the <hi>Belgick</hi> troubles. Alſo they eſteemed it juſt, that ſome cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be given to them, that the Ships that went from thence into <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould be free and unmoleſted. Concel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe Controverſies <hi>Naya</hi> was ſent into <hi>Spain</hi> to ſpeak with the King, with promiſe to return within forty dayes; but the event evidenced that promiſe either to be falſe or raſh.</p>
               <p>However the interval of time was not ſpent in vain: for firſt the States took into conſideration the money owing by them to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and ſoon after make a League (likely enough to continue if <hi>Peace</hi> were concluded with <hi>Spain</hi>) almoſt upon the ſame tearms as they had done before with <hi>France,</hi> only but half the number of ſupplyes were promiſed. Then all that were aſſembled above the number of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners returning to their own Provinces, they that were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to preſide this buſineſs of Peace, called to the Enemies Ambaſſadors, That they would expedite their demands upon the reſt of the Heads to be Treated on.</p>
               <p>The debate being entred into concerning Limits, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were not aſhamed to inſiſt, That <hi>Brabant, Flanders,</hi> and all <hi>Gelderland</hi> beyond the <hi>Waell,</hi> ſhould be delivered up by the States, who in ſtead thereof, ſhould receive <hi>Lingen, Oldenzeel,</hi> and <hi>Groll,</hi> (which certainly would have been a very unequal exchange). And when they condeſcended thus
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:55798:472"/>
far, That for a ſhort time the States ſhould have the cuſtody of the Towns, yet ſo as the Soveraign power and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be veſted in the Archdukes; they further ſaid, That they divided the <hi>Netherlands</hi> too liberally, leaving that part to their Neighbours, which the Fortune of War had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be the ſtrongeſt. The rumour of this buſineſs being diſperſed, the <hi>Brabanters</hi> under the States Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not contented to obtain that they ſhould not be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the Enemy, thought they had a fit occaſion given them, whereby to recover their right of having a Vote in the publick Council; for after the principal Cities, and the laſt of them <hi>Antwerp,</hi> had yielded to the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> the reſt being leſs then could govern themſelves, received Laws, Tributes, and Magiſtrates, from the Authority of the ſeven United Provinces, although <hi>Berghen op Zoome</hi> had ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued faithful to the States, yet <hi>Bredah</hi> and other places that were taken and retaken by War, recovered their Liberty by the <hi>Trajectine</hi> League. But thoſe were not times wherein either the labour of Conjunction, or the multitude of Judges ought to be increaſed.</p>
               <p>Little was yet done with the Enemy, when even now the Moneth of <hi>May</hi> was drawing to an end, when they among the <hi>Hollanders</hi> that were deſirous of Peace, faintly deſired of the reſt, That the reſidue of the paſſing year might be added to the Ceſſation of Arms; but upon this Condition, That the Treaty ſhould no longer be continued than the end of <hi>July.</hi> Which being agreed, They fell to diſcuſſing the matter concerning the reſtitution of goods, which gave new matter of diſſention, the former points not being fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; about which <hi>Verreike</hi> going to <hi>Bruxells,</hi> and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with ſpeed, reported what was the intention of the Archdukes, That it was fit the burdens propagated by War, ſhould be thrown aſide and buried by Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for the Towns of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> they would gratify them with the ſame, ſo as they might enjoy the whole Countrey.
<pb n="928" facs="tcp:55798:473"/>
That as all private perſons were to have a reſtitution of their goods, ſo likewiſe were to be reſtored to the Princes the goods their Anceſtors enjoyed, there being ſeveral ſorts of profit of poſſeſſions due to the Majeſty of Dominion; not did it follow, becauſe the Archdukes had denuded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this, that therefore he ſhould be deprived of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The States contradicted, that a Government could not be deprived of its Revenue, nor Cities of the ground belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, without the Ruine and deſtruction both of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Cityes, and therefore unleſs they come to more moderation, they would ſuddenly break off the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The others inſiſted, That although they denyed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, yet certainly there was no reaſon why they ſhould refuſe to reſtore the private Patrimony of the Princes. But this crafty difference and diſtinction was denyed alſo, for that in theſe places, there was no ſeparate account of the Publick Treaſury, and the Princes Patrimony. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they delayed to diſcover, what they would have comprehended under the name of Private Goods; yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, That under that Cloak they would hide as well Towns as whole Countreyes purchaſed by Princes, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gained by any peculiar Title. But when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſaid, That a great part of their future ſecurity conſiſted in this, That the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſons ſhould be drawn from the Borders of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> proteſted, That it was a diſhonourable thing to be required by them, ſince they were able to defend their Territories with <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Souldiers. No more did they hearken to the demand of reſtoring to <hi>Germany,</hi> the places they poſſeſſed belonging to the Juriſdiction of <hi>Almayne;</hi> and therefore <hi>Verreike</hi> was again ſent to <hi>Bruxells,</hi> and after his return, they entred upon the debate concerning the uſe of Priviledges, the acceſs of ſhips of War to the ſhores, the right of Fortification, the chooſing Magiſtrates for thoſe Cities, which by the Peace
<pb n="929" facs="tcp:55798:473"/>
would fall to the ſhare of private perſons or Lords, the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and aſſurances of Peace, and the not reſuming or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling again to War for any injuries, without publick Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Nor did they well agree in theſe things; but the chief thing that offended the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was, That the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> deſired the League might be confirmed, not only by the allowance of the Archdukes, but alſo by the conſent of the Nobles and Cities under their obedience. And when they were again ſpoken to concerning Religion, they ſaid, They muſt of neceſſity wait for <hi>Naya</hi>'s coming out of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom the procraſtinating nature of that dilatory Nation in Affairs of concernment, detained longer then ordinary. Under this pretence, they requeſted, <hi>That the time limited for the Treaty being about the firſt of</hi> Auguſt, <hi>might be lengthened unto the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of</hi> September.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Janinus</hi> went into <hi>France,</hi> that he might inform the King, what was the condition of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in <hi>Holland,</hi> what the inclination of their minds, what their ability for War, and what were their hopes of Peace: He at the ſame time conſulting within himſelf about a Truce, becauſe both by the publick and private col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies of the United States people, he knew many of them werſe to War, and was ſenſible the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would never endure an indifferent Peace.</p>
               <p>It was not a matter of ſmall moment, that the States, if the War continued, had deſired of the Kings their Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, a great ſupply, proteſting, That there remained to them no ſort of Tribute untryed, and yet their Treaſury was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to maintain thoſe Forces, which Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had formerly adjudged neceſſary for the carrying on of the War. Theſe were indeed the deſigns of thoſe that were willing to have Peace, which the Prince too late hoped to avoid by contracting the charge of the War into a narrower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.</p>
               <p>At this time <hi>Don Pedro de Toledo</hi> was Ambaſſador in
<pb n="930" facs="tcp:55798:474"/>
                  <hi>France,</hi> whom King <hi>Philip</hi> had ſent thither to King <hi>Henry,</hi> to intreat him, <hi>That he would ſo moderate the</hi> Hollanders <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, that his Master might loſe as little of his Royal dignity as poſſible.</hi> Then alſo was King <hi>Philips</hi> daughter offered to be given in Marriage to the <hi>French</hi> Kings ſon; but King <hi>Henry</hi> was not deſirous of that affinity, He himſelf formerly having ſought a Marriage with the Family of <hi>Medices,</hi> rather then with the Houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> that abounded in Women, This Embaſſy was ſuſpected by ſome of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> but chiefly by the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> And the Dowry to be given in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, was reported to be a right of Dominion over the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſoon ſatisfied the King of <hi>Britain</hi> with the like honour of an Embaſſy to him directed, and performed by <hi>Don Ferdinando Giron,</hi> a man eminently fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and honourable among the chief, and greateſt <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders. But the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Embaſſadors departed home, wearied out with the tediouſneſs of delayes, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, proteſted, <hi>They would not ſit idle Spectators of that Play, whoſe Scene was wholly laid in</hi> France. And another thing much increaſed the cares of the States, which was, That Meſſengers comming out of <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> all agreed in this point of News, That the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> had declared, <hi>That</hi> Philip <hi>never had any intent to reject or lay aſide his right of Dominion, but only for the obtaining of a Treaty, he had given to the</hi> Hollanders, <hi>the ſhort uſe of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Liberty; But now the very inward parts of thoſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ſo well known to him, that he doubted not a good iſſue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Peace or War: And that of a truth, he would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a Peace, unleſs they abſtained from the</hi> Indies, <hi>and licenſe given to the</hi> Romaniſt <hi>for the exerciſe of their Religion in their own Way.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Janinus</hi> returning to the <hi>Hague,</hi> reported the faithful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the King towards them his Allyes, and how he had refuſed <hi>Toledo</hi>'s troubleſome Requeſts and Offers, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further.

               </p>
               <p>The States looked upon this as an Engine intended to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Foundations of the Commonwealth; the ſame was the Opinion of the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Engliſh. Janinus</hi> did not had fault with the Counſel, but with the Authors thereof, for ſo great an Affair ought not to be made beneficial by the Enemy. At length, the States finding that theſe delayes were dangerous to their Affairs, and not willing any longer to hearken to the Enemies unreaſonable propoſitions, reſolve to ſet an end to the Treaty; and to that end a Decree being drawn up, wherein was ſet forth, by how great and many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments they had been terrified from Treating of a Peace with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> inſomuch that when they were firſt ſent to about it, they immediately declared their minds, on the other ſide, how the Enemy, and with what treachery he brought to effect his deſigns, how every of their demands would deſtroy the right and power of their ſo often granted Liberty; and laſtly, they repeated the whole ſeries of the Affair, as the ſame had been tranſacted. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> this Decree being delivered to them, require a time to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate thereupon.</p>

Their Treacheries and Barbariſmes committed in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands:</hi> A third ſort produced Books that ſhewed all the Articles prejudicial to the <hi>Romane</hi> Religion, or that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it was not neceſſary to obſerve or perform Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants entred into between a Prince and his Subjects: Nor did they omit to find fault, That they were not any Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Cities, nor any of the Native Noblemen that were ſent to Treat, but <hi>Italians, Spaniards,</hi> Monks, the moſt cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and deceitful ſort of men, who if they could find any thing infirm, or hurtful to the State, they would not leave it undone; nay, they would endeavour by gifts to tempt the Ambaſſadors of Kings, but the moſt powerful of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to turn aſide from the right, and walk with them in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and indirect wayes.</p>
               <p>I eſteem this none of the leaſt evils of that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, That ſo great perverſneſs ſhould be ſtirred up in the common people, which had often been forbidden, and then was alſo by a new Edict, yet could not be repreſſed, while a ſharp and diligent ſearch, and other more grievous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not permitted, as being contrary to Liberty. And now an unexpected accident happened to the States, though in their General Aſſembly, and upon the preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and hope of Peace, they ſuffered themſelves with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to be drawn to hearken to a Truce; yet that they might not ſeem to deſpiſe the advice of the Kings, as it was the chief cauſe that induced them thereto; yet there were other, to wit, that the Charge of the War, as it had been of late managed, would every Moneth exceed the money rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Tributes, above three hundred thouſand Florens, and that that ſum would not yet be ſufficient, unleſs for the defence of the Rivers, there were added to the old Forces, ſix thouſand Footmen, whereby the whole Commonwealth of the <hi>

nine thouſand Millions of Flotens, and the ſingle Provinces particularly, twice as much: ſo that without the conſent and help of the Kings their Allyes, the War could not be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with any good hope; for to cut off any parts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and only defend the more inward parts, would be an act of cruelty, although there were ſome that adviſed it, and would be very dangerous if it ſhould be known abroad; and whereas ſome ſaid, <hi>That the Commonwealth was ſo conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, that it could not be at Peace, though Arms were laid aſide,</hi> That was by others accounted an impious and infamous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. It might more juſtly be feared, <hi>Leſt the Common People, underſtanding that juſt and fair Terms were refuſed, growing diſpleaſed with their Governours, ſhould deny to bear the Charge and Burden of the War.</hi> And therefore at laſt they returned anſwer, <hi>That they were ready to hearken to a Truce, ſo as their LIBERTY might be confirmed, not under any Conditions, or for a certain time, but really, and for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when the Ambaſſadors of the ſaid Kings came to them, gave no hopes of any ſuch Agreement, but offered another. Condition, which was, That all Affairs ſhould continue in the ſame poſture they were at preſent, with a Ceſſation of Arms for ſeven years, yet ſo as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> might chooſe within two Moneths, whether he would admit the <hi>Indian</hi> Commerce, or would conteſt the right thereof by Arms. But there was no cauſe why the Grant once already made concerning Liberty, ſhould be again rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, in regard it would be a difficult thing to be obtained, becauſe the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is of a more harſh nature, nor will be drawn to imitate the Archdukes facility: And if the States were not pleaſed with theſe offers, they deſired they might have time given to them till the Calends of <hi>October,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the more pleaſing Orders of King <hi>Philip.</hi>

In the interim, the Deputies had time every one to return to his own Province, to receive new Inſtructions concerning this new Affair. And it was agitated with great contention: Nor did the People that lay more open to the Oppreſſions of the Enemy only diſſent from the <hi>Zelanders,</hi> who were guarded by the Sea, but in <hi>Holland</hi> it ſelf, ſeveral Cities were of ſeveral minds, nor within the Cities were all men of one Opinion, but every one moved as his proper hopes led him, or as they were drawn by more powerful Arguments on either ſide.</p>
               <p>In this wavering of mens minds, counſel was given to Prince <hi>Maurice, That he ſhould openly, and without diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, make Himſelf the Author of the ſtronger Opinion,</hi> which he did, not only with ſharp words, but by Letters ſent to the Cities of <hi>Holland;</hi> At length (ſaith he), The Arts fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by our Anceſtors are burſt out: Thoſe ſpecious words, wherewith they purchaſed a Treaty, were indeed nothing but words, nor was Peace deſired by the Enemy, but that he might make War more at his own, then our conveniency; or that he might trouble the Commonwealth more grievouſly by diſcords and bribes, then he could do by War. In a ſhort time his Wealth will encreaſe anew, which lately was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, ſo that he will make his braſs money of equal value with Gold and Silver. But our burdens ſhall continue, for fear of Treachery. Merchandice and whatever was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by War, will be ſcattered abroad, and the chief flower of our Militia, eſpecially the Horſe, will go to other parts, to ſeek, and gain, both Honour and Booty:</p>

                  <hi>Winwood</hi> alſo thought it a part of his duty, to commend a <hi>Truce</hi> to the <hi>Senate,</hi> whereof he himſelf was a member, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that his Maſter the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> would not perſwade them to any thing, but what he himſelf would give an Example of: Thoſe Arms are juſt, that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and thoſe not onely pious Kings, but God himſelf would favour: but they are not neceſſary, to which there is a way open to an honourable end. If they ſubſiſted by extraordinary ſuccour, yet they ought not to refuſe the making of a League, ſince both their Religion, Liberty and Commerce, might be preſerved. But now it was to far diſtant, to conjecture what would come to paſſe after a <hi>Truce,</hi> by how much they could not diſcern the nearer dangers of War.</p>
               <p>It was a wonder to ſee with what greatneſs of mind, the buſineſs was tranſacted at every Aſſembly, and new Books were daily ſet forth as it were, to ſow and foment diſcords; for now they ſpared neither of the Kings: as if the chief of their hopes had conſiſted in the miſeries of the <hi>Confederate States.</hi> But the chief of their envy was vented againſt <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbarneveldt,</hi> as the Inventor of ſuch things: He being grown odious to men of the greateſt quality, and moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree by his exceſſive Authority, much leſs could his Equalls endure to ſee him ſo far in Honour above them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that there were ſome <hi>Letters</hi> found, wherein he was not obſcurely deſtined to ſlaughter: Whereupon, He in the Aſſembly of the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> proteſting, that he had not feared to draw upon himſelf, the malice of the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men, nor ſhunned any dangers, ſo as He might ſerve his <hi>Country,</hi> being fraught with the Solace of a quiet Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence againſt all ſcandalous Rumours, and unlucky accidents; But when he ſaw a thing in it ſelf diſpleaſing to him, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs be aggravated to make him odious, He beſeeched them, that for expediting thoſe things they ſhould ſee fit in the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> they would appoint others to officiate,

that were leſs hated: which ſaid, immediately he departed from the Aſſembly: Some of the Lords were ſent after him, to deſire him, that he would not in this nice Juncture of time, deſert the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> which he had hitherto aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his faithful Counſels. Hereupon, returning to his accuſtomed charge, ſometimes extolling the benefits and Authority of the Kings, anon explicating, and laying open the charge of the War, he confirmed ſuch as wavered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed them without anger, although they were very ſharply contradicted, and <hi>Amſterdam</hi> it ſelf a long time reſiſted, at length, he brought all <hi>Holland</hi> to one mind; which alſo five other of the Provinces ſoon after embraced. Only <hi>Zeland,</hi> out of ſome peculiar Reaſons of their own, and by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> reſiſted the conſent of all the reſt, denying to agree to a Truce, nor would ſuffer the Decree to be revoked, urging the words of the Trajectine League, that Arms ſhould not be laid down, unleſs by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all, and whatever difference ſhould ariſe among the Provinces, ſhould be left to the deciſion of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
               <p>Others were angry, and ſaid, the Queſtion was not now concerning a Truce, but whether <hi>Zeland</hi> alone, ſhould give the Law to all the reſt; And now the Conteſt among them growing hot, the Embaſſadors of the Kings interpoſed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to drive thoſe by force of Arguments, whom they could not lead by perſwaſion.</p>
               <p>And firſt <hi>Janinus,</hi> producing to the States, King <hi>Henrics</hi> Letters, wherein he ratified whatever they ſhould ſay or do, began to praiſe the good &amp; benefit of Concord; then mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning divers Opinions without frowardneſs, when he came to the Trajectine League, he ſaid, it belongs not to us, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Laws of other People; but yet common Reaſon teacheth, that at this time, the Debate was upon a yielding not an indifferent League; and it any think otherwiſe, the Law is either to be abrogated, or laid aſide, the Publick

               <p>Thus among the <hi>Switzers,</hi> the Decrees of the greater Party are obeyed by thoſe who contradicted the ſame; But the <hi>Acheans</hi> and <hi>Aetolians,</hi> though valiant people, yet were deſtroyed by diſſention, while each of them would not agree to conſult with the other; for too much liberty is the ready way to Servitude: Beſides, that no man may feed himſelf with a vain hope, I now by Command declare, that the King hath no ſuch need of you, as to give aſſiſtance to thoſe that deſpiſe his Counſels.</p>

               <p>In theſe Verbal Contentions, this Tranſient Year was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt expired, and a Rumour was frequently ſpread abroad, <hi>That the Truce endeavour'd by the Embaſſadors, did no whit pleaſe the</hi> Spaniards: And the Truth is, <hi>Richardot</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Janinus, That King</hi> Philip <hi>was grown more averſe than before; but he aſſigned the fault thereof to the King of</hi> Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>as if he had given ſome hope, that nothing more ſhould be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Liberty.</hi>

Neither were thoſe Words much to be fear'd, that were ambiguouſly implyed, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the Kings not only averting, They would take nothing away from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but that many of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> had ſhew'd them to be fruitleſs by ſubtilly cavilling: That theſe Arguments might prevail againſt all contrary Attempts and Endeavours, they were ſtrengthned by the Authority of the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> a Man moſt eminent in the Favour of King <hi>Philip;</hi> and therefore drawing after him, not onely the Reſpect of the Court, but the whole Source of Counſel; he delighted much in the pleaſures of <hi>Peace,</hi> and therefore fear'd, leſt others ſhould over-top him by Honour and Renown gain'd in War.</p>
               <p>This Year came <hi>Philip William</hi> Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> and Elder Brother to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> firſt of all into <hi>Holland,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining other where during the time of War, but now uſing the common freedom taken by all: The cauſes of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither he pretended, That by the Truce, he might take a Care to mind the benefit of his own Affairs; as alſo, that being honour'd with the <hi>French</hi> Affinity, he hoped he might the better bring it about by means of the preſent
<pb n="949" facs="tcp:55798:483"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors, thoſe Things which were in diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his Brothers, concerning his <hi>Paternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> But others interpreted it in another manner, as if he had appear'd there as a Fautor of <hi>Peace,</hi> contrary to the Counſels of his Brother: However it was, this is certain, That by his means, <hi>Emanuel</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> againſt whom we elſewhere mention'd Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> to be highly inraged, for his Marriage with his Siſter, was reconcil'd to the Houſe of <hi>Naſſau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During all this time, nothing was done by the Souldiery, but only near <hi>Ardenburg</hi> ſome were ſlain, that lay in wait to take away the Townſmens Cattel: Likewiſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Horſe, with more than ordinary Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, foraging the Country, were met with and puniſh'd; for ſome being ſent out of the Garriſon at <hi>Berck,</hi> ſlew ſome of them as they were ſcatter'd abroad in the Night, among whom was kill'd <hi>Adolphus</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> a Young-man of great Courage, but too indulgent to the Souldiery: But the <hi>Victors</hi> Joy continued but a while; for the Troops gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all parts, repai'd the ſlaughter of their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with the Death of many more of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>This Year alſo there appear'd the Seeds of a Miſchief that was not contemptible; for Arms were ſcarce laid aſide, before there began a Difference in Religion; the beginnings whereof are not known, nor more of it, but as it broke out by little and little, which hapned thus: At <hi>Leyden,</hi> two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly learned Men; the one, named <hi>Gomarus;</hi> the other, <hi>Arminius,</hi> publikely read <hi>Lectures</hi> upon the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> of whom this maintain'd, <hi>That by God's Eternal Decree, it was appointed, who ſhould be ſaved, and who ſhould be damned; and thereupon, that ſome are drawn to Piety, and being ſo drawn, are preſerved, that they ſhall not fall away, while others are left to perpetrate the common Vices of Mankind, and lie totally involved in their own ſins.</hi> This, on the other ſide, maintain'd, <hi>That God would not be altogether a ſevere Judge, but was alſo a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="950" facs="tcp:55798:484"/>
Father;</hi> and made this difference of Sinners, <hi>That to ſuch as were weary of ſinning, and could put their Confidence in Chriſt, he would give Pardon and Life; but to the Obſtinate Puniſhment; and that it was well-pleaſing to God, that all ſhould repent; and having learned better things, ſhould be held up from falling back; but that no man was to be compelled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Two accuſed each other ſharply; <hi>Arminius</hi> bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Gomarus,</hi> that he aſcribed to God the Cauſes of Sinne, and by a ſtrong perſwaſion made Mens Minds obſtinue: And <hi>Gomarus</hi> finding fault with <hi>Arminius,</hi> that he fill'd men with Arrogance, far more than the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and would not ſuffer a good <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is a Man's greateſt Concern, to be acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>It appears by thoſe, who have with Care peruſed Antient Authors, that the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> granted, That Man had <hi>Free-will,</hi> as well in receiving, as in retaining Diſcipline: from whence proceeds the Equity both of Rewards and Puniſhments: Neither yet did they omit to refer all things to the Divine Goodneſs, by whoſe Gift the wholeſom Seed of Goodneſs came to us, and of whoſe ſingular Aſſiſtance, all our Dangers have need.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> firſt of all (from whence aroſe a ſharp Diſpute between him and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> with thoſe that follow'd him, and he himſelf alſo formerly had thought otherwiſe) ſo Relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed that Name of Liberty, that he preferred before it certain of God's <hi>Decrees,</hi> which ſeemed utterly to overthrow the ſame; But all over <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> the antient and more plain Opinion was, retained.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Western</hi> part of the World, the great and famous Name of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> drew many to conſent to him, though ſome were found in <hi>France,</hi> and elſewhere, that oppoſed the ſame. In after-Ages, when the School hardly made uſe of any other Doctor than <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it was diſputed between the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> what was his ſence, what was the right way of reconciling thoſe Things that ſeem'd ſo
<pb n="951" facs="tcp:55798:484"/>
repugnant; and the moſt Learned of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> labour'd with more curious Subtilty, to unty the Knot; till being accuſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> they hardly eſcaped puniſhment.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Luther,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> going out of a <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> that as well bore the Name of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd his Opinion, taking up the Bucklers in the ſame Cauſe, began to hew down, what remain'd of the Name of <hi>Free-will:</hi> Which ſeem'd ſo abominable to <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that having either approved, or at leaſt paſſed over with ſilence the reſt of his Doctrines, he oppoſed himſelf to this: By whoſe <hi>Arguments Philip Melancthon,</hi> an Aſſiſtant to <hi>Luther,</hi> being mov'd, recanted what he had formerly written; and was the Author, why <hi>Luther</hi> (as many believe, and is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident to the <hi>Lutherans</hi>) deſerted his Rigid <hi>Decrees,</hi> that would admit of no Condition; yet ſo, that they rather abhorred the Name of <hi>Free-will,</hi> than the Thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But in another party of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> their Leader <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> adhering to the firſt Opinions of <hi>Luther</hi> in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, ſtrengthned and upheld the ſame with new <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi> and added to <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> what had never been touched on before, <hi>That a true and ſaving Faith was perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and could not be loſt; whereof, whoever was Conſcious to himſelf, that he poſſeſſed the ſame, he might even then aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of Eternal Felicity;</hi> yet did not deny, <hi>but that in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, they might fall into grievous ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rigor of this Opinion was increaſed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> by <hi>Beza;</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Zanchius, Urſinus, Piſcator;</hi> who often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lanched out ſo far, that ſometime they would publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver, what others had ſo carefully avoided; to wit, <hi>That the Neceſſity of ſinning, did depend from the firſt cauſe: which gave the</hi> Lutherans <hi>an ample occaſion of Quarrel, and eſpecially a new occaſion of Contention ariſing about the</hi> Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</p>
               <p>At the beginning it was to ſome purpoſe, to contend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe <hi>Differences</hi> of diſturbed Religion among the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
                  <pb n="952" facs="tcp:55798:485"/>
although it was eaſie, among ſo many people differing in Opinions, that it might be argued with equal Juſtice: But when many young Folks coming from being taught by <hi>Geneva, Palatine</hi> and <hi>Naſſauian</hi> Doctors, began to collect themſelves together, and get the ordering of ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they ſuppoſed it time, to bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus theſe Matters proceeded, until the two great Champions mention'd before, <hi>Gomarus</hi> on one ſide and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> on the ther, met in the Schools at <hi>Leyden,</hi> each to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his own Opinion, and ſubvert the others.</p>
               <p>The Diſſentions of the Maſters broke out among the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, ſo that now other Miniſters and Divines in <hi>Holland</hi> were call'd to take parties: The <hi>States</hi> thought fit that they ſhould meet, and commanded the Supream Seſſion of the Judges to hear the two <hi>Profeſsors:</hi> After a long Conteſt, it ſeem'd convenient, that all the Acts of the Diſpute ſhould be buried in ſilence: yet both Parties nevertheleſs publiſh'd all, and that pleaſed the Miniſters as the moſt cuſtomary; this, the Magiſtrates, as the moſt popular Opinion: And from hence aroſe a new <hi>Contention,</hi> when theſe averted, <hi>That the Judgment and ſetling of Religion, was a part of Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy or Government:</hi> Thoſe, <hi>That Divine Things ought only to be Debuted in Sacred Aſſemblies.</hi> This brought forth two Books; one, appointing a way for Inſtruction of Youth in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> in Matters of Piety, according to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Palatina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Moreover, about this time a ſmall Book came forth at <hi>Gonde,</hi> containing Matters to be believed by few, yet in the ſame Words which are preſcribed in Holy Writ: Preſently there appear'd ſome from another Company, who publikely deteſted this, ſaying, There was no ſo portentous and horrid Opinion, which might not be hidden under ſuch Words: That the ſimplicity of the Primitive Times was praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, when yet unknown Evils wanted no Remedies; but ſoon after, as every Age was more fertile in Errour, ſo there were found certain manners of ſpeaking, that might drive all that went aſtray from their lurking places: By which means they became ſervile, while theſe enjoy'd Peace and Quiet, which they nick-named Liberty, theſe truly call'd Perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Faction: until on both ſides, by famous Names, the
<pb n="954" facs="tcp:55798:486"/>
differences were encreaſed, which afterwards gave both name and nouriſhment to greater feuds.</p>
               <p>From the Eaſt this year alſo came Capt. <hi>Mateliſeu,</hi> all things there being in a happy condition, which without doubt might be ſome reaſon, why the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would not the deciſion of the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade to War. He went out three years and three Moneths before, when the Spring was too far ſpent, to ſuffer him to eſcape thoſe annual Southerly blaſts under the Equinoctial, driving him to the Coaſts of <hi>Africa.</hi> He had many and great commands for War; But the Seamen reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his Authority, murmuring that they were not to perform the Duties of Souldiers.</p>
               <p>The Captain himſelf being ambitious of honour, allured the moſt potent in the ſociety, with the hope of renown, and the Commons with the hope of prey, now ſpeaking to all in general, anon to particular men, as occaſion offered it ſelf, and giving exhortations to every one according to his diſpoſition. When he came to the <hi>Indies,</hi> they took ſome <hi>Portugall</hi> Ships, and other that aſſiſted them in Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; but the Barbarians in them were all ſet at Liberty, that they might the better acquire their good will. <hi>Malacca</hi> is ſeated upon the right Angle of the gulf of <hi>Bengala,</hi> where <hi>Sumatra</hi> ſhadows the <hi>Indian</hi> Continent, it is a great Iſland divided by a narrow branch of the Sea, which is called there <hi>Cincapura.</hi>

                  <hi>Jora</hi> is not far diſtant, whoſe Kings formerly poſſeſſed <hi>Malacca;</hi> but after the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> came into that World, being invited by the ſcituation of the place, they built there a Caſtle upon a little hill, encompaſſed with a ſquare Wall, and ſome houſes within it, and taking into the ſame a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ground as ſeemed ſufficient. By little and little they began to dwell without the Wall, and eſpecially beyond the River, that lyes to the right hand; thoſe buildings alſo that were near the River ſide, were fenced with a Wall. From hence proceeded a perpetual fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="955" facs="tcp:55798:486"/>
and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and therefore at this time did they firſt make a League with the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> At this time four bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers governed <hi>Jora,</hi> of whom the chief in Authority was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Jandepatuan,</hi> but <hi>Sabran</hi> far excelled him in ingenuity and induſtry, being very intent, both for the defence and increaſe of his Government, the contrary whereof it uſual in moſt of the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings, who rather follow <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> loving all things that bring delight at the preſent, and not minding anything of future advantage. Now <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſen</hi> was more able in mind than power to beſiege <hi>Malacca,</hi> for the Caſtle and Town was kept by <hi>Andrea Fartado,</hi> a man famous in War, and having with him almoſt three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men; but the greater part of them was <hi>Indians,</hi> becauſe ſome <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were ſent out of the Garriſon with certain Ships to <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet, were eleven ſhips, and fourteen hundred men. Wherefore for augmenting his Forces, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired aid of the Kings of <hi>Jora,</hi> making a League, <hi>That they ſhould enjoy the Countrey, and the</hi> Hollanders <hi>the Town, but the Prey to be divided equally between them.</hi> Hereupon they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhoot, firſt from the Ships, then from certain little Iſlands which lay near. Then on the ſhore to the right hand they pitched their Camp, and ſuddenly a ſuburb beyond the River, that might have been defended, was quitted, and a bridg being cut down, the whole defence lay within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and the places near adjoyning to the Caſtle. Thus the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with ſafety made another bridg over the River, and ſo invaded the backſide of the Town, and a Monaſtery defended with a Mount, and in a ſhort time pierced on the other ſide, even to the Sea. Therefore <hi>Mateliſen</hi> appoints Forts in convenient and fit places, and beats down with the ſhot of his Great Guns, a Bulwark that <hi>Fartado</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had added to the Caſtle, and when the ground that was full of Water, would not ſuffer the Pioneers to work, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king little wooden Towers, and filling them with earth and
<pb n="956" facs="tcp:55798:487"/>
ſmall loppings of Trees (and by chance there were many Orchards near there abouts) he removed nearer to the Caſtle carrying into that rude and barbarous World, the Political Stratagems of the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> War. And ſtrange it is to tell, and hard to be believed, that in all that Siege there was no uſe made of any of the <hi>Jorenſians,</hi> or others whom the Neighbour Kings had ſent thither: The firſt number pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſend, they performed not, and then in thoſe that came, obedience and conſtancy was no leſs wanting, than knowledg in the uſe of Arms; for they were not only unfit to ſtand againſt violent eruptions or ſallyes, but at every ſhot of a Gun, were ready to fly from their appointed ſtations; ſo that then it was evident by clear experiments, That the Portugueſes had rather made a prey of theſe Nations, than obtained a Victory.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Hollander</hi> being preſſed with the whole burden of the War, partly by accidental misfortunes, and partly by wearineſs and nocturnal ſhowers, were much diminiſhed and weakened. There was no hope that the beſieged being more in number, could be taken by them who were fewer, it remained therefore only to ſtarve them out; but now the Siege having continued four Moneths was broken up by the comming of a Fleet from <hi>Goa,</hi> which was commanded by <hi>Alphouſe de Caſtro,</hi> the Kings Pretor in the <hi>Indies;</hi> this Fleet conſiſted of fourteen Galeons, four Galleyes, and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſmaller ſhips, which carryed of <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> and other <hi>Europeans,</hi> to the number of three thouſand ſeven hundred men, and well nigh as many <hi>Barbarian</hi> ſervants. Theſe were commanded, as afterwards was known by ſome Priſoners and Letters, to invade all the places where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were wont to come with Merchandiſe, particularly, <hi>Achem, Jora, Faham, Patan, Bantam,</hi> and <hi>Amboyna.</hi> As they came near <hi>Achem,</hi> they commanded the King of the City, to pay the Charges of their Fleet, Deliver up the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and ſuffer a Caſtle to be builded, as if already they had gotten the
<pb n="957" facs="tcp:55798:487"/>
Victory. But he being well furniſhed with Arms and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, wherewith he had ſtrengthened the ſhore, by the directions, of the <hi>Hollander,</hi> contemned all theſe threans and cracks; yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> broke into one of them, but were repulſed with ſo great ſlaughter, that they durſt attempt no further. And now the Seige of <hi>Malacca</hi> coming to their knowledg, they haſten thither, that they might, if poſſible, ſurpriſe the empty Ships, and take the Enemy as he lay ſcattered on the ſhore; but <hi>Mateliſen</hi> being forewarned thereof by his Scouts and Spyes, prevented them; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were but a raw Souldier, yet he performed the duty of an excellent Captain: for firſt, he ſhipped all his Carriages and Guns, then the <hi>Jorenſian</hi> Souldiers, and laſt of all, as any <hi>Hollander</hi> was more diſtant, ſo he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded before the others (that lay nearer) to enter the Fort, that was erected on the ſhore. Now had part of them got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the ſhips, and other part was yet on land, when the Enemy made a ſtrong Sally out of <hi>Malacca,</hi> but they were ſoon beaten back, and ſo afterwards the reſt with more care got on board.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ever the ſhips ſaw each other, they began a Fight with their Great Guns at a diſtance; the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> avoiding the Fight, becauſe the Wind carryed them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sumatra,</hi> which was from the Enemy. As ſoon as day light appeared the next morning, and the Wind began to blow from <hi>Sumatra, Mateliſen</hi> foreſeeing the Enemy would preſs upon him, commanded to weigh Anchor, but one of the ſhips which was named <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> when it could not ſtir the Anchor, and delayed to cut their Cables, was ſet upon by two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Veſſels, and burned; but the danger was like to have reached the Authors thereof, if the Galleys had not come in and aſſiſted them, which kind of help the <hi>Hollanders</hi> wanted, therefore being drawn with ropes faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Galleyes that were rowed, they eſcaped the fire, that was now ready to ſeize them: The <hi>Holland</hi> ſhips alſo
<pb n="958" facs="tcp:55798:488"/>
attempted to ſuccour their fired Veſſels, which were called the <hi>Middleburg</hi> and the <hi>Orange,</hi> but the wind preſently ſlacking, hindred their courſe, and forthwith <hi>Alvares Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vale, Henry Norone,</hi> and <hi>Duertes Guerra, Portugal</hi> Captains with three ſhips ſet upon them; into which being intangled one among another, the <hi>Maurice,</hi> another <hi>Holland</hi> ſhip, caſt fire, which utterly conſumed <hi>Duertes</hi> and <hi>Carvale,</hi> with their ſhips, and together with them periſhed the <hi>Middleburg.</hi> But <hi>Mateliſen</hi> himſelf with the Admiral, aſſailed <hi>Norom,</hi> fighting with the <hi>Orange,</hi> and ſo terrified it with ſhot, that at length the torn Veſſel in ſign of yielding, took down the Banner: yet for all this, he durſt not go among the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes,</hi> preparing to receive him, fearing leſt any Seaman, the Fight being not yet over, ſhould turn both their hands and minds to Booty, and neglect the Battel. Therefore ſuppoſing the ſhip his own, and commanding the ſhot to ceaſe, he drew it after him with a rope, but <hi>Norone,</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breaking of it ſelf, eſcaping to his companions, deceived his too careful and unhappy Prudence. But here the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> being weary, the Fight began to ceaſe, and the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> took great care that they might not by the ſwiftneſs of the Tyde, be ſeparated and driven below the Enemy. The Victory was equal, each ſide having loſt two ſhips, whereof the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> indeed were the bigger, but the <hi>Hollanders</hi> loſs was the greater, their Fleet being the leaſt. But the loſs of men was not equal; for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> wanted only might, whereas many of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> periſhed, both by fire, ſhot, and in the Sea; beſides a great many that were ſlain by the furious Seamen, contrary to their Captains com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as they endeavoured to eſcape from the fire in a ſmall Boat. The next dayes paſſed in quiet, or at leaſt in the exchange of ſome few bullets, when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to want Gunpowder, and which was a greater miſchief than that, the obſtinacy of the Seamen had well nigh burſt put into a ſedition; for becauſe by the Law of the ſociety,

the whole Fleet was not intruſted to all, but every one had his own ſhip delivered to his Truſt, they whoſe ſhips were burned, as if they therewith had loſt their wages, ſad and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, incited others to refuſe fighting, with fear of the like loſs; therefore for appeaſing their minds, as well that their ſick men might be refreſhed, as their torn ſhips repaired, <hi>Mateliſen</hi> withdraws with his Fleet to <hi>Jora,</hi> and there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into Council with the Kings for ſtrengthening of the Town againſt any Aſſaults of the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi> Here while he ſtayed a Moneth, a joyful Meſſenger came to him with news, That the Enemy had divided his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then he commands the ſhip to be immediately entred, and that all they met with ſhould be put to the ſword: Nor were the Seamen backward in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the command, forgetting his Domeſtick quarrel, as he grew hot with fighting, inſomuch that they made a gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And now on the one hand, the Embaſſadors of the Kings, and on the other, they that were ſent from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Albertus,</hi> and were lately returned home, laboured to leſſen the controverted points: but when that way ſeemed too ſlow, and it was found difficult to explicate buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween abſent people, it was concluded there was a neceſſity

               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being ſhewed the ſaid draught, and deſired to Sign it, when they ſaid, that was a little two imperious, becauſe they were not the demands of Enemies, but of Friends, who were admitted Arbitors, and thereupon, at leaſt demanded time of deliberation; they brought to paſſe, that upon the undertaking of the Embaſſadors of the Kings, the Ceſſation of Arms ſhould be continued until the end of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> they promiſing in the mean time to return their Anſwer.</p>
               <p>When they began to read over, and diſcuſs the ſeveral Heads, they found nothing innovated in the words, aſſerting their liberty, only the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not induring that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors ſhould call the <hi>States</hi> by the Title of High and Mighty, conſented at laſt; they ſhould be written Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: The <hi>States</hi> deſired, that thoſe <hi>Tributes,</hi> which the <hi>Country</hi> Scituate in the middle between both Parties, had payd during the War, for redemption of their Lands from the ſpoil of the Souldiers, ſhould be continued by the <hi>Truce;</hi>

That it be lawful for them to paſs backward and forward, and freely to Trade by Land, Sea, and Rivers, which the King thinks fit to limit within <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſuch other places, as have heretofore, by his permiſſion, been open to his Friends, and thoſe at Peace with him; but without thoſe Bounds, it ſhall not be lawful to negotiate and trade, in any the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Towns, and Ports, by him poſſeſſed, without private leave firſt had and obtain'd: But neither King <hi>Philip,</hi> his Miniſters, or Subjects, ſhall hinder them then from Trading there with any other Kings or People willing to deal with them; nor ſhall the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> or any that admit the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> to Commerce, be moleſted in his Name.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> hearkned to this with great Reluctancy, as well becauſe by manifeſt Tokens the <hi>Indies</hi> were expreſſed, no leſs than if they had bin named; as for that they deſired Things taken and ſeized in that part of the World, if they could be found, ſhould be reſtored, but ſlaughters and deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations by fire could not be reſtored: They being more prone to Cruelty, but the <hi>Hollander</hi> eſteeming Booty at a higher value than Bloud: However, at laſt they yielded, but their Countenances and Words manifeſting they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an Injury.</p>
