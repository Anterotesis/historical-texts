            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A WALK TO ISLINGTON, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <l>IN Holiday-Time, when the Ladies of <hi>London</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Walk out with their Spouses, or think themselves Undone;</l>
            <l>When Whores have a more than an ord'nary Itching</l>
            <l>To visit the Fields, and so Ramble a Bitching;</l>
            <l>When Vigorous Youth the young Damsel engages</l>
            <l>In Meadowes, on Haycocks, or under the Hedges;</l>
            <l>When Flesh and the Devil do greatly prevail,</l>
            <l>And the Dame must have Prudence that governs her Tail;</l>
            <l>When Honour in Wedlock by Lust is betray'd,</l>
            <l>And the Maids are a gog to be otherways made:</l>
            <l>Then I, like my Neighbours, to sweeten my Life,</l>
            <l>Took a walk in the Fields; but for want of a Wife,</l>
            <l>Was forc'd to take up with a Lady of Pleasure,</l>
            <l>Who I turn'd off at Will, and enjoy'd at my Leisure:</l>
            <l>We saunter'd about near the <hi>New-River-Head,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Where we pratled and tatled, tho' what 'twas we said,</l>
            <l>If you'd have me Discover, indeed I must fail-you,</l>
            <l>Because 'twas on Business improper to tell-you.</l>
            <l>I found by her Words I her heart could command,</l>
            <l>So quickly we setled the matter in hand.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94933:3"/>We rambled about, till we came to a Gate,</l>
            <l>Where abundance of Rabble peep'd in at a Grate,</l>
            <l>To Gaze at the Ladies amidst of their Revels,</l>
            <l>As fine all as <hi>Angels,</hi> but wicked as <hi>Devils.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>My Mistress, I found, had a huge inclination</l>
            <l>That we should add Two to the Lewd Congregation:</l>
            <l>I willing to yeild (for prevention of Strife)</l>
            <l>To my Mate, as a Married Man would to his Wife,</l>
            <l>She telling me Threepence a piece was the Price,</l>
            <l>I once let her make me a Cull for a Sice.</l>
            <l>Being pleas'd that I seem'd of so good a Condition,</l>
            <l>She call'd me her <hi>Dear,</hi> to reward my submission.</l>
            <l>And when she had righted her Hoods and her Pinners,</l>
            <l>We entred the Walks to the rest of the Sinners:</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Lime-Trees</hi> were plac'd at a Regular distance,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Scrapers</hi> were giving their wofull assistance;</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Bawds</hi> with their <hi>Iilts,</hi> and good <hi>Wives</hi> with their <hi>Daughters,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Were met to <hi>Intreigue</hi> and to Tipple the <hi>Waters</hi>:</l>
            <l>Some Drinking, some P—sing, some sitting, some walking,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Beaus</hi> with their <hi>Belfa's</hi> were Cringing and Talking.</l>
            <l>Some Citizens too, one might easily know</l>
            <l>By his formally handing his <hi>Whither d'ye go</hi>;</l>
            <l>For in the old order you're certain to find 'em,</l>
            <l>Advance with their Tallow fac'd Daughters behind-'em;</l>
            <l>For whether to <hi>Church,</hi> or to <hi>Bawdy-house</hi> bent,</l>
            <l>It's always their Custom to put on the Saint:</l>
            <l>And look so demure, one would think 'twas their Fashion</l>
            <l>To say a long Grace, e'vn before Copulation.</l>
            <l>'Twas pleasant to see how the sly Female Creatures</l>
            <l>In Pomp led their Amorus Slaves in their Fetters:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94933:3"/>With side-looks endeavouring new Hearts to command,</l>
            <l>Regardless of those they had got by the Hand;</l>
            <l>Desirous of Trading with some <hi>Interloper,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Disdaining old <hi>Plugtail,</hi> unfit for a Stopper.</l>
            <l>The Wives of our Traders, those Jems of the City,</l>
            <l>Who thus with their Leers and their Glances invite-ye,</l>
            <l>From Court draw Examples of Leading their Lives,</l>
            <l>And use their Fond Husbands, as Courtiers their Wives,</l>
            <l>But Just for a Show; and with some hidden Treasure</l>
            <l>Keep <hi>Gallanis,</hi> as th'other do <hi>Whores,</hi> for their Pleasure.</l>
            <l>And that you may know such a good Wife as this,</l>
            <l>From the Buxom <hi>Suburbian,</hi> or common <hi>Town-Miss,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>In Colours most proper her Picture I'll Paint,</l>
            <l>And shew you a Devil dress'd up like a Saint.</l>
            <l>She puts on a sanctifi'd Look for Disguise,</l>
            <l>Yet <hi>Sparrows</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> may be seen in her Eyes:</l>
            <l>But Ogle her well, you may read at first Sight,</l>
            <l>How oft she desires to be Lov'd in a Night.</l>
            <l>So formal her Mouth, that her Lips seem to Cry,</l>
            <l>Come Kiss me, my Dear, or I Vow I shall Dye.</l>
            <l>She Minces her Steps but to pleasure her Rider,</l>
            <l>Her Pace she can alter, and lay her Legs wider.</l>
            <l>Her Arms by her sides are so formally Posted,</l>
            <l>She looks like a <hi>Pullet</hi> Truss'd up to be Roasted.</l>
            <l>True Dancing-School-Breeding, in her is Recorded,</l>
            <l>She shows all she Learn'd, when at <hi>Hackney</hi> she Boarded:</l>
            <l>The Swell of her Bubbies, and Jut of her Bum,</l>
            <l>To the next brawny Stallion, crys, <hi>Come, my Dear, Come</hi>:</l>
            <l>The poor Fool, her Husband, she lugs by the Arm,</l>
            <l>Who proud of his Rib, never thinks any harm:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94933:4"/>Whilst her Amorous Squints, full of Lustful Desire,</l>
            <l>Proclaim him a Cuckold, to all that go by her.</l>
            <l>Her Gown is of Sattin, and wants no Expence,</l>
            <l>Such as worn at the Court about sev'n Years since.</l>
            <l>Her Head-dress of Point, a Gold Watch by her Side,</l>
            <l>Was giv'n her the day she was first made a Bride.</l>
            <l>Her Petticoat loaded with Fring to the Top,</l>
            <l>Notwithstanding its weight, will come easily up.</l>
            <l>When ever she Talks, 'tis to rail against Evil;</l>
            <l>And hates a Lewd Woman as bad as the Devil;</l>
            <l>Because the Profession of Whore gives her Title,</l>
            <l>To too much of what she herself has too little:</l>
            <l>So pamper'd with Ease, and Luxurious Diet,</l>
            <l>She never can keep her Concupiscence quiet:</l>
            <l>These Dames were the Top of this Female Convention,</l>
            <l>Who Trade for true Pleasure, and not for a Pension.</l>
            <l>The next I observ'd, were a Number of Creatures</l>
            <l>O'th' Feminine Gender, with very good Features;</l>
            <l>Patch'd up with odd Remnants, from Brokers Collected,</l>
            <l>From whence by us Judges, they might be suspected</l>
            <l>To Labour beneath so unhappy a Fate,</l>
            <l>As to pay by small Sums, what they wore by the Great.</l>
            <l>Their Trains hung of different lengths from the Bum,</l>
            <l>Which shew by their Size, how their Hearts are o'ercome,</l>
            <l>By an answ'rable <hi>Penis,</hi> or suitable Sum.</l>
            <l>As Rattle-Snakes, bred in the <hi>Indies,</hi> ne'er fail</l>
            <l>To tell you their Age, by the Joynts in their Tail;</l>

            <l>From whence City Dames first were taught the ill uses</l>
            <l>Of Riding and Ruling their Horn-Headed Spouses.</l>
            <l>Our Eyes being glutted with this pretty Sight,</l>
            <l>VVe began to look down, and examine the Pit,</l>
            <l>VVhere Butchers and Bayliffs, and such sort of Fellows,</l>
            <l>VVere mix'd with a Vermin train'd up to the Gallows.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94933:8"/>As Buttocks and Files, House-breakers and Padders,</l>
            <l>VVith Prize-Fighters, Sweetners, and such sort of Traders;</l>
            <l>Informers, Theef-Takers, Deer-Stealers, and Bullies,</l>
            <l>Old Straw-hatted Whores with their Twelve-penny Cullies,</l>
            <l>Some Dancing and Skiping, some Ranting and Tearing,</l>
            <l>Some Drinking and Smoaking, some Lying and Swearing;</l>
            <l>And some with the Tapsters, were got in a Fray,</l>
            <l>VVho without paying Reck'ning were stealing away.</l>
            <l>VVhich made Lady Squab, with her Moonifi'd Face,</l>
            <l>By the side of the Organ, resume her old place;</l>
            <l>VVith hands on her Belly, she open'd her Throat,</l>
            <l>And silenc'd the Noise, with her Musical Note:</l>
            <l>The Guests were all Hush, and Attention was given,</l>
            <l>The listening Mob thought themselves in a Heaven;</l>
            <l>If the Ravishing Song which she sung, you wou'd know,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>It was</hi> Rub, rub, rub; rub, rub, rub; in and out ho.</l>
            <l>As soon as her sweet, modest, Ditty was done,</l>
            <l>She withdrew from her VVicker, as Chaste as a Nun.</l>
            <l>The Butchers so pleas'd with her warbling strains,</l>
            <l>Both Knock'd her, and Clap'd her all round for her Pains.</l>
            <l>Then up starts a Fiddler in Scarlet, so fierce,</l>
            <l>So unlike an <hi>Orpheus,</hi> he look'd like a <hi>Mars.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He runs up in Alt, with a Hey-Diddle-diddle,</l>
            <l>To shew what a Fool he could make of a Fiddle;</l>
            <l>And has such an excellent hand at a Pinch,</l>
            <l>He hit's Half a Note, to a Quarter of an Inch.</l>
            <l>Then in comes a Damsel drest up in her Tinsy,</l>
            <l>Too Homely and Sluttish, to Tickle ones Fancy;</l>
            <l>By her Impudence sure, tho' she's Ag'd but Eleven,</l>
            <l>She knew how to Sin by the time she was Seven;</l>
            <l>Arm'd <hi>Amazon</hi> like, with abundance of Rapiers,</l>
            <l>VVhich she puts to her Throat, as she Dances and Capers.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94933:9"/>And further, the Mob's Admiration to kindle,</l>
            <l>She turns on her Heel, like a VVheel on a Spindle;</l>
            <l>And under her Petty-coats gathers such VVind,</l>
            <l>That Fans her, and cools her, before and behind.</l>
            <l>The next that appear'd, was a Young Babe of Grace,</l>
            <l>VVith <hi>Merc'ry</hi> in's Heels, and a Gallows in's Face;</l>
            <l>VVhose Sawcy Behaviour, and Impudent Air,</l>
            <l>Denotes he was born for a <hi>Barthol'mew-Fair</hi>:</l>
            <l>Begot in a Cellar, at Head of a But,</l>
            <l>His Father a Tapster, his Mother a Slut;</l>
            <l>And that the Good Liquor might o'er-him prevail,</l>
            <l>No Pap did they give him, but Nurs'd him with Ale:</l>
            <l>Thus wrap'd in Blew-Apron, instead of a Clout,</l>
            <l>VVas Rock'd in a Tap-Tub, and Christ'ned in Stout;</l>
            <l>VVhich makes the Child's Impudence greatly surmount</l>
            <l>A Hundred bold Bastards, Baptis'd at the Font.</l>
            <l>In Dancing a Jig, lies the chief of his Graces,</l>
            <l>And making strange Musick-house Monkey-like Faces.</l>
            <l>Then in a Clown's Dress comes my honest Friend <hi>Thomas,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>VVho looks by his Bulk to be Lord of the <hi>Domus</hi>;</l>
            <l>He cocks up his Hat, draws his Heels to his Arse,</l>
            <l>And makes his own Person as good as a Farce:</l>
            <l>But since thou art Honest, and fills me good <hi>Nants,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I'll let thee alone, and not spoil a good Dance.</l>
