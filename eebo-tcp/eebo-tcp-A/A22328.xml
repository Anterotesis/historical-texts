         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ By the King.</head>
            <head>¶ A Proclamation concerning Tobacco.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Our Commons, assembled in Our last Sessions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> became humble Petitioners vnto Us, That, for many waightie reasons, much concerning the welfare of Our Kingdome, and the Trade thereof, We would by Our Royall power, vtterly prohibite the vse of all forreigne Tobacco, which is not of the growth of Our owne Dominions; And whereas We haue vpon all occasions made knowen Our dislike, We haue euer had of the vse of Tobacco in generall, as tending to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of the health and manners of Our people, and to that purpose haue at seuerall times heretofore prohibited the planting of Tobacco, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> as vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnfit, in respect of the Climate, to cherish the same for any medicinall vse, (which is the onely good to bee approoued in it;) And at other times haue also prohibited the disorderly Trading for To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, into the parts beyond the Seas, as by Our seuerall Proclamations, published to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it may appeare. Neuerthelesse, because Wee haue beene earnestly and often importuned by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Our louing Subiects, Planters and Aduenturers in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>Sommer Islands,</hi> and lately by Our Commissioners for <hi>Virginia,</hi> that We would be pleased to take into Our Royall care that part of Our Dominions, by Our Royall authoritie, and by the industrie of Our loyall Subiects, added to the rest of Our Empire, for the propagation of Christian Religion, and the ease and benefite of this populous Realme, and to consider, that those Colonies and Plantations, are yet but in their infancie, and cannot be brought to maturitie and perfection, vnlesse We will bee pleased for a time to tolerate vnto them the planting and venting of the Tobacco, which is, and shall be of the growth of those Colonies and Plantations; We, taking into Our Princely consideration these, and many other important reasons of State, haue beene graciously pleased to condescend to the desires and humble petitions of Our louing Subiects in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>And therefore We doe by these presents straitly charge and command, That no person whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, of what degree or qualitie soeuer, doe at any time hereafter, import, or cause to be imported from any part beyond the Seas, or out of Our Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> into this Our Realme of <hi>England,</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> or into Our Realme of <hi>Ireland,</hi> any Tobacco, which is not of the proper growth of the Plantations of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>Sommer Islands,</hi> or one of them, vpon paine of forfeiture vnto Us of all such Tobacco so to be imported, contrary to the true meaning of these presents, in whose hands soeuer the same shall be found, and vpon such further paines and penalties, as by the Lawes and Statutes of these Our Realmes, or by the seuerity or censure of Our Court of Starre-chamber, in either of those Kingdomes respectiuely, may be inflicted vpon the Offendors, for contempt of this Our Royall command, and to be reputed and taken as enemies to Our proceedings, and to those Plantations which so much concerne Our Honour, and the honour and profit of these Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
<pb facs="tcp:28553:2"/>
And We further will and command, vpon the penalties aforesaid, that from hencefoorth, no person or persons whatsoeuer, presume to sow, set, or plant, or cause, or permit, or suffer to be sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, set, or planted, in any of his or their grounds, any Tobacco whatsoeuer, within these Our Realmes of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> or any Isles or places belonging thereto, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or suffer any old stocke, plant, or root of Tobacco formerly set, sowed, or planted there to continue, not plucked vp and vtterly destroyed, contrary to the tenour and true meaning of a former Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, made and published by Us to that purpose, bearing date the thirtieth day of <hi>December,</hi> in the seuenteenth yeere of Our Reigne of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Wee further straitly charge and command, vpon the paines and penalties aforesaid, That no person whatsoeuer, presume to buy, or sell any Tobacco, which from hencefoorth shall be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or brought from any the parts beyond the Seas, or from Our Realme of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is not, or shall not be of the proper growth of the Colonies aforesaid, of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>Sommer Islands,</hi> or one of them. And because Wee vnderstand, that some, who intend their owne priuate, more then the publique, conceiuing it to be probable, that We would grant the petition of Our Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to preuent the effect thereof, haue lately imported secretly, and by stealth, great quantities of forreigne Tobacco, for which they haue payd no Subsidie or other duety vnto Us; We further will and command, vnder the paines and penalties aforesaid, that no person whatsouer, from, and after the fiue and twentieth day of <hi>March,</hi> now next ensuing, presume to sell, or offer, or put to sale within these Our Realmes or Dominion, any Tobacco, which hath beene formerly imported into this Realme, which is not of the proper growth of the Colonies, or Plantations aforesaid, or one of them, nor that any person whatsouer, willingly and knowingly, take, or vse any Tobacco, from, and after the first day of <hi>May,</hi> now next ensuing, which is not, or shall not be of the proper growth of the sayd Colonies, or Plantations, or one of them. Yet, because the said forreigne Tobacco may not lie on the hands of the owners thereof, Wee are graciously pleased, that at any time, within fortie dayes after the sayd fiue and twentieth day of <hi>March,</hi> such forreigne Tobacco may be freely exported by any person whatsoeuer, without paying any Subsidie or other duetie for the same. And because no man shall pretend ignorance, and thereby endeuour to excuse his offence in any of the premisses; Wee doe further charge and command, and doe hereby signifie and declare Our will and pleasure to be, that all, and euery person and persons, Merchant or other, who vseth to sell, or hath any purpose to sell Tobacco, who haue in his, or their hands, custodie or possession, or in the hands, custodie or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesson of any other by their deliuery, or to their vse, any Tobacco heretofore imported into this Our Realme, or planted, set, or sowen within this Realme, shall before the twentieth day of <hi>October,</hi> now next comming, bring the same into Our Custome-house, within Our Citie of <hi>London,</hi> if such Tobacco be within fiue miles of Our said Citie, or if such Tobacco be in any other Citie, Towne, or place, within this Our Realme of <hi>England,</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> or Realme of <hi>Ireland,</hi> shall bring the same to the Towne-house, or other fit place, which shall be to that purpose appointed by Us, in that City or Corporate Towne, neerest vnto which the said Tobacco shall be, and shall before the first day of <hi>December,</hi> now next comming, there require and cause the same to be Marked and Sealed by such person or persons, and with such Seale and Marke, as We shall thereunto assigne or appoint for that purpose, without giuing any fee or allowance for the said Seale or Marke, and whatsoeuer Tobacco shall not be Sealed or marked, as aforesaid, within the seuerall times aforesaid, shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate &amp; forfeited vnto Us for such their default and contempt. And for the auoyding of all deceit and abuse in disguising of forraigne Tobacco, or mingling the same with the Tobacco of <hi>Virginia,</hi> or the <hi>Sommer Islands,</hi> thereby to defraud the true intent of these presents, We further straitly charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, vnder the paines and penalties aforesaid, That no person, who is, or shall be a seller of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, shall haue, or keepe ready cut, aboue the quantitie of one pound of Tobacco at once, nor shall min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<pb facs="tcp:28553:3"/>
any forraigne Tobacco, with any Tobacco of the growth of the <hi>Sommer Islands</hi> or <hi>Virginia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Wee straitly charge and command, that all the planters of Tobacco in the Colonies afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, or any part thereof, shall make the same good, and merchantable, and shall not presume to send ouer into this our Realme of <hi>England,</hi> any Tobacco, which shall not be good and merchantable, and well made vp in rolle without stalkes, or other bad or corrupt stuffe, vpon paine of confiscation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or so much thereof, as vpon due triall made, shall be found to be otherwise, to the intent that such of Our Subiectes, as shall desire to vse the same, may not be abused, or deceiued therewith, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of their health. And to the intent that the Tobacco of the Colonies, and Plantations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, thus tolerated by Us, may be knowen and distinguished, from such as shall bee secretly, and without warrant brought in by stealth; Wee doe likewise straitly charge and command, vpon the paines and penalties aforesaid, That all such Tobacco, as shall bee brought from the Colonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, shall be all brought, and landed at the Key of Our Custome house, in Our citie of <hi>London,</hi> and not elsewhere, in any of Our Realmes or Dominions, and shalbe there registred, &amp; shall not be remooued from Our said Custome house, vntill it shall bee there first tryed, sealed, and marked, by such person, or persons, &amp; with such seale or marke, as We shall thereunto assigne and appoint; such seale or marke to bee set thereto, without Fee, or other reward whatsoeuer. And Wee doe further straitly charge and command, vpon the paines and penalties aforesaid, That all owners of ships, bee carefull to imploy such masters in their ships, or other vessels, from whom they will take good caution, not to offend in the importation of any Tobacco, contrary to this Our Royall pleasure. And We do further signifie and declare by these presents, that We will require an exact accompt of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of euery ship, or other vessell, that he shall make such diligent, and carefull search, ouer the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners and passengers in his ship, or other vessell, that none of them shall conueigh ouer into these Our Realmes of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or dominion of <hi>Walles,</hi> or into any Port, Hauen, Creeke, or other parts thereof, any Tobacco, to be imported, contrary to the true intent and meaning of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents: And that Our Customers, or their deputies, in euery Port of these Our Realmes of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> shall, vpon oath, examine euery Master of a ship, or other vessell, or other Officers and Mariners in the said ship, or vessell, whether they haue made search in the said ship or vessell, for To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, and whether any Tobacco bee in the said ship, or vessell, to their knowledge, and whether any Tobacco were laden in the said ship or vessell, and bee taken out thereof, and what is become of the same: And if any Master of a ship, or other vessell, shall wilfully, or negligently permit, or suffer any Tobacco to be imported, or shall otherwise offend, contrary to these presents, euery such Master (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is in his power to preuent the same) shall also be answerable vnto Us for his contempt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and shall be subiect, &amp; lyable to all the paines and penalties aforesaid, aswell as if he himselfe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and purposely committed the said offence. And whereas We are informed, that some traders in Tobacco, doe vse to import Tobacco in forreigne Bottomes; Wee strictly charge and command, that no person whatsoeuer, either Stranger, Denizen, or naturall borne Subiect, presume to import any Tobacco whatsoeuer, in any forreigne bottome, at any time hereafter, vpon paine of confiscation, not onely of the said Tobacco, but also of the ship, or vessell, wherein the same is so imported, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other paines and penalties aforesaid.</p>
            <p>And for the better execution of Our pleasure herein, We doe hereby command all and singuler Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Wayters, and other Officers, attending in all, and euery the Ports, Creekes, or places of lading or vnlading, for the taking, collecting, or receiuing of any of our Customes, Subsidies, or Duties, to take notice of this Our pleasure: And We do hereby command, and giue power and authoritie vnto them, and euery of them, from time to time, aswell to search any shippe, or other vessell, or bottome, ryding, or lying within any Port, Hauen, or Creeke, within their seuerall charge of attendance, for all Tobacco imported, contrary to the intent of this Our Royall

Proclamation; and the same being found, to seize and take to Our vse, and also to take notice of the names, and apprehend the bringers in and buyers of the same, to the end they may receiue condigne punishment for their offences, vpon payne, that euery of the said Officers, which shall bee found negligent, remisse or corrupt therein, shall lose his place and entertainement, and vndergoe such paines and penalties, as by Our Lawes, or by the censure of Our said Court of Starre-chamber, may be inflicted vpon them for the same.</p>
            <p>And We doe likewise, will, ordaine, and appoint, that it shall and may bee lawfull, for such person or persons, as shall be thereunto authorized and appointed, by him, or themselues, or his, or their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty or Deputies, with a lawfull Officer to search any shippe, or other vessell, and to enter into any shoppe, house, seller, warehouse, or other suspected places, at lawfull and conuenient times, and there to search, discouer, and find out any Tobacco, imported, vttered, sold, or vented, or to be vttered, sold, or vented, not marked or sealed, as aforesaid, contrary to the true meaning hereof, and all such Tobacco so found, to seize, take away, and dispose of, and the owners thereof, or in whose cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie the same shall be found, to informe and complaine of, to the end they may receiue punishment, according to Our pleasure before herein declared.</p>
