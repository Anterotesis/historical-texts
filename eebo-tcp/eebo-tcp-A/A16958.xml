         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere came lately to my hands divers writings, controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſundry poynts of religion.

By reaſon wherof, as alſo conſidering that this controverſie concerneth divers points of Religion profitable to be obſerved; and both parties (I take it) being willing to have them ſeen and dulie weyghed of any: I have thought it good to publiſh in print al the writings that hetherto have paſſed from one to another, not doubting but it may much further the truth And bring glorie vnto God. And now I deſire both the Authors to take this my doing in good part, and thee (good Reader) indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to read &amp; equally to iudge of the matters here contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as thou ſhalt ſee the truth by eyther of them to be proved vnto thee.

               <head>Mr HENRY AINSVVORTH HIS vvriting concerning this queſtion: VVHither the High ſacrificers attire were made of ſilk or of wooll.</head>
               <p>THat they were not made of <hi>ſilk,</hi> this reaſon is alleged:
<q>Becauſe the worm <hi>(wherof ſilk cometh)</hi> was vnclean by ceremonie, &amp; therfore might not be in cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie figuring holines.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And to prove they vver of <hi>wool,</hi> it is ſayd;
<q>That the Iewes vniverſally hold, that wool threed blew &amp; purple &amp; ſcarlet, &amp; white linen, &amp; golden plates cut as threed, was the matter wherof thoſe garments wer made.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BVt vnto the former it may be anſvvered;</p>
               <p>That though it wer granted to be worm-wrought <hi>ſilk,</hi> yet it need not be counted vnclean becauſe the worm was vnclea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for vnclean creatures whiles they wer aliue defiled not a man; but the eating of their fleſh, or touching of their carkeſſes being dead. <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.8.11.24, 31.41. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.8. And the Iewes vſed the ſervice of vnclean beaſts continually, as of horſes, aſſes, camels &amp;c, without pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now ſeing Gods law limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth their vnclea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes in theſe two points; how may we extend it further?</p>
               <p>Againe, the Bee was by ceremonie vnclean, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.19. yet the honie which ſhe gathered &amp; wrought was not vnclean, eyther to touch or to eat.</p>
               <p>But if it be granted, that the ſilk as it is firſt taken from the worm, is vnclea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; yet it foloweth nor, that after it is waſhed wound &amp; woven by art of man, that it ſhould continew vnclean ſtil: ſeing that the hayr of vnclean beaſts when it was wrought into cloth had no vncleannes. The camel was vnclean, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.7. yet Ioh. Baptiſt wore a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the hayr.

Herevpon I thought it needful (for ſtaying of falſe tumors) to giv out that writing. In it, I onely ſought after the truth, minding what might be both objected &amp; anſwered. I found the ſtate of the queſtion to conſiſt of two branches, 1. That it might not be <hi>ſilk,</hi> becauſe that was <hi>vnclean by ceremonie.</hi> 2.

Betwixt himſelf &amp; his moſt reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the curſe then doth lie; &amp; between them let it reſt.</p>
               <p>The effects folowing his excommunication ar next to be minded. He <hi>aſſured the readers, that they ſhould ſee the Archb. or himſelf pay the price.</hi> Would he hav men expect miracles by his hands, as if ſome great plague ſhould folow the man tht he curſeth, or els himſelf? The word of God teacheth vs to look for no ſuch thing by the excommunication of a whole church, much leſſe of one man; but rather to hope for the ſinners converſion &amp; ſalvation by means of this cenſure; or otherwiſe to leav him to Gods judgement, without looking for corporal puniſhment vpon him in this life. For God often ſuffreth wicked here to flouriſh long, &amp; go down in peace to the grave, when he layeth his rod &amp; ſtrokes vpon his own beloved children. And if he pleaſe to lay any judgement vpon the wicked here on earth, yet he reſerveth ſuch things to his own ſecret counſel, &amp; wil not hav them expected from the mouth of man. Let <hi>Mr Br.</hi> then look how he preſumeth thus to limit the Lords judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments betwixt his neighbour &amp; himſelf, leaſt the evil light on his own head. It ſeemeth becauſe the <hi>Archb.</hi> is dead, this man thincketh he payed the price of his curſe; &amp; if himſelf had firſt died, the reader muſt hav judged his curſe killed him ſelf. Wel let him beware he curſe not many, leaſt ſome of them do out live him, &amp; he dynig without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance giv the world occaſion to thinck he died <hi>accurſed, &amp; ſurely miſerable</hi>

               <p>Firſt he ſayth <hi>no ſubject wil diſpute, one for al Chriſtians againſt me</hi>: yet he being but one, wil excommunicate me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If I were to be excommunicat, it muſt be for ſin wilfully perſiſted in; ſuch he hath not proved to be in me; neyther wilbe brought to prove by Gods word any thing he ſayth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Mr Br.</hi> being a member &amp; miniſter of the church of England, I am none of his brethren, nor any fellow member with him of that bodie, which we witneſſe againſt not to be a true gathered &amp; conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted church of Chriſt. What authoritie then hath he over me, except he be a Pope &amp; claymeth power over all churches?</p>
               <p n="4">4. No falſe Prophet or antichriſtian miniſter, hath the power of the keyes, or right to adminiſter the word or cenſures of Chriſt. Such is <hi>Mr Br.</hi> having received a falſe miniſterie or preiſthood at the hands of his right reverend Fathers the Prelates: which miniſterie we hav diſproved in many writings publiſhed; &amp; <hi>Mr Broughton</hi> himſelf wil not &amp; cannot approve his own function.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We ar counted ſchiſmaticks &amp; out of the church: &amp; of me, he ſayth I <hi>have given my ſelf to Satan by wicked excommunication.</hi> If it be ſo, I am not within, but without the church already, &amp; therfore cannot be caſt out of that communion in which I am not. Now the Apoſtle Paul &amp; the whol church of Corinth had no authoritie to judge them that wer <hi>without,</hi> but onely them that wer <hi>within</hi>; &amp; God judgeth thoſe without, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12.13. But <hi>Mr Br.</hi> in judging &amp; excommunicating me, (if I be ſuch as he eſteemeth me,) hath taken vpon him more power then the Apoſtle had, &amp; preſumeth to do that vvhich perteyneth to God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That which he ſayth to the ArchB. <hi>if you deſerved it not, it returneth to the giver</hi>; let him apply to himſelf in this caſe. If I hav deſerved it, it is for ſin: al ſin muſt be diſcouered &amp; judged by Gods law; &amp; the ſinner wilfull. With me he refuſeth to debate the matter; how am I then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of ſin, or deſerv I this cenſure? What then ſhal I ſay; ſhal I wiſh it may turn <hi>to the giver</hi>?

                  <p>Theſe charges I found in his papers, and do now openly deny them; let him prove the contrarie againſt me if he can; or els be aſhamed ſo to traduce me without cauſe. His other things about the <hi>ſtones names &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> are but preſumptions &amp; ſurmiſes of his own head, thinking that I did not or could not open them aright.

When he hath quitted himſelf of theſe vntruthes, or repented them; let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to other matters, ſo as he will directly affirme &amp; bring due proof of his words.
