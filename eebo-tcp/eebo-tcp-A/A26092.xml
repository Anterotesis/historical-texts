            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce the Profitable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures that have gone abroad in the World,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48021:3"/>
have met with ſo great Encouragement, tho' the higheſt advantage they can propoſe, is an uncertain Lot for ſuch matters as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion (not real worth) gives a value to; things which if obtain'd, are as flitting and fickle, as that Chance which is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſuade my ſelf, you will not be leſs kind to a Propoſition that comes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with more certain and ſubſtantial Gain; whoſe only deſign is to improve your Charms and heighten your Value, by ſuffering you no longer to be cheap and contemptible. It's aim
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48021:3"/>
is to fix that Beauty, to make it laſting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, which Nature with all the helps of Art, cannot ſecure: And to place it out of the reach of Sickneſs and Old Age, by transferring it from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Body to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Mind. An oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deſign, which wou'd procure them <hi>inward</hi> Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to whom Nature has unkindly denied the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> and not permit thoſe Ladies who have comely Bodies, to tarniſh their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with deformed Souls. Wou'd have you all be wits, or what is better Wiſe. Raiſe you above the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48021:4"/>
by ſomething more truely illuſtrious, than a founding Title, or a great Eſtate. Wou'd excite in you a generous Emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to excel in the beſt things, and not in ſuch Trifles as every mean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who has but Mony e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, may purchaſe as well as you. Not ſuffer you to take up with the low thought of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves by any thing that is not truly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable; and procure you ſuch Ornaments as all the Treaſures of the <hi>Indies</hi> are not able to purchaſe. Wou'd help you to ſurpaſs the Men as much in Vertue and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48021:4"/>
as you do in Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that you may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be as lovely, but as wiſe as Angels. Exalt and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh your Fame, more than the b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt wrought <hi>Poems,</hi> and loudeſt <hi>Panegyricks,</hi> by ennobling your Minds with ſuch Graces as really deſerve it. And inſtead of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Complements and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Flatteries of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, obtain for you the Plaudit of Good Men and Angels, and the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him who cannot err. In a word, render you the Glory and Bleſſing of the preſent Age, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and Pattern of the next.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48021:5"/>
And ſure, I ſhall not need many words to perſuade you to cloſe with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. The very offer is a ſufficient inducement; nor does it need the ſet-off's of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to recommend it, were I capable, which yet I am not, of applying them with the greateſt force. Since you cannot be ſo unkind to your ſelves, as to refuſe your <hi>real</hi> Intereſt; I only entreat you to be ſo wiſe as to examine wherein it conſiſts; for nothing is of worſer conſequence than to be deceiv'd in a matter of ſo great concern. 'Tis as little beneath your Grandeur as your Prudence, to examine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48021:5"/>
curiouſly what is in this caſe offer'd you; and to take care that cheating Huckſters don't impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you with deceitful Ware. This is a matter infinitely more worthy your Debates, than what Colours are moſt agreeable, or whats the Dreſs becomes you beſt? Your <hi>Glaſs</hi> will not do you half ſo much ſervice as a ſerious reflection on your own Minds; which will diſcover Irregularities more worthy your Correction, and keep you from being either too much elated or depreſs'd by the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the other. 'Twill not be near ſo advantagious
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48021:6"/>
to conſult with your Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-maſter as with your own Thoughts, how you may with greateſt exactneſs tread in the Paths of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which has certainly the moſt attractive <hi>Air,</hi> and Wiſdom the moſt grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and becoming <hi>Meen:</hi> Let theſe attend you, and your Carriage will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways well compos'd, and ev'ry thing you do will carry its Charm with it. No ſolicitude in the adorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your ſelves is diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, provided you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your care about that which is really your <hi>ſelf;</hi> and do not neglect that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Divinity within
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48021:6"/>
you, which muſt ſurvive, and may (if you pleaſe) be happy and perfect when it's unſuitable and much inferiour Companion is mouldring into Duſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will any pleaſure be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied you, who are only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd not to catch at the Shadow and let the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance go. You may be as ambitious as you pleaſe, ſo you aſpire to the beſt <hi>things;</hi> and contend with your Neighbours as much as you can, that they may not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do you in any commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Quality. Let it never be ſaid, that they to whom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence is ſo very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, can be tamely content
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48021:7"/>
that others ſhou'd ſurpaſs them in <hi>this,</hi> and precede them in a <hi>better</hi> World! Remember, I pray you, the famous Women of former Ages, the <hi>Orinda</hi>'s of late, and the more Modern <hi>D'a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier</hi> and others, and bluſh to think how much is now, and will hereafter be ſaid of them, when you your ſelves (as great a Figure as you make) muſt be buried in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and forgetfulneſs! Shall your Emulation fail <hi>there only,</hi> where it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable? Why are you ſo prepoſterouſly humble, as not to contend for one of the higheſt Manſions in the Court of Heav'n? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48021:7"/>
me Ladies, this is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Place</hi> worth contending for; you are neither better nor worſe in your ſelves for going before, or coming after <hi>now;</hi> but you are really ſo much the better, by how much the higher your ſtation is in an Orb of Glory. How can you be content to be in the world like Tulips in a Garden, to make a fine <hi>ſhew</hi> and be good for nothing; have all your Glories ſet in the grave, or perhaps much ſooner? What your own ſentiments are, I know not, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without pity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment reflect, that thoſe Glorious Temples on which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48021:8"/>
your kind Creator has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd ſuch exquiſite work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, ſhou'd enſhrine no better than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Deities; be like a garniſh'd Sepulchre, which for all it's glittering, has nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but Emptineſs or Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction! What a pity it is, that whilſt your Beauty caſts a luſtre round about, your Souls which are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more bright and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant (of which if you had but a clear Idea, as lovely as it is, and as much as you now value it, you wou'd then deſpiſe and neglect the mean <hi>Caſe</hi> that encloſes it) ſhou'd be ſuffer'd to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with Weeds, lye fallow
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48021:8"/>
and neglected, unadorn'd with any Grace! Altho the Beauty of the Mind is neceſſary to ſecure thoſe Conqueſts which your Eyes have gain'd; and Time that mortal Enemy to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Faces, has no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on a lovely Soul, but to better and improve it. For ſhame, let us abandon that <hi>Old,</hi> and therefore one wou'd think, unfaſhionable employment of purſuing Butterflies and Trifles! No longer drudge on in the dull beaten road of Vanity and Folly, which ſo many have gone, before us; but dare to break the enchanted Circle that cuſtom has
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48021:9"/>
plac'd us in, and ſcorn the vulgar way of imitating all the Impertinencies of our Neighbours. Let us learn to pride our ſelves in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more excellent than the invention of a Faſhion: And not entertain ſuch a degrading thought of our own <hi>worth,</hi> as to imagin that our Souls were given us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſervice of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and that the beſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement we can make of theſe, is to attract the eyes of men. We value <hi>them</hi> too much, and our <hi>ſelves</hi> too little, if we place any part of our worth in their Opinion; and do not think our ſelves capable of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48021:9"/>
Nobler Things than the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Conqueſt of ſome worthleſs heart. She who has opportunities of making an intereſt in Heav'n, of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the love and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of GOD and Angels, is too prodigal of her Time, and injurious to her Charms, to throw them away on vain inſignificant men. She need not make her ſelf ſo cheap, as to deſcend to Court their Applauſes; for at the greater diſtance ſhe keeps, and the more ſhe is above them, the more effectually ſhe ſecures their eſteem and wonder. Be ſo generous then Ladies, as to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unworthy of you; ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48021:10"/>
true to your Intereſt as not to leſſen your Empire, and depreciate your Charms. Let not your Thoughts be wholly buſied in obſerving what reſpect is paid you, but a part of them at leaſt, in ſtudying to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. And after all, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that Goodneſs is the trueſt Greatneſs, to be wiſe for your ſelves, the greateſt Wit, and <hi>that</hi> Beauty the moſt deſirable, which will endure to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>Pardon me the ſeeming rudeneſs of this Propoſal, which goes upon a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that there is ſomething amiſs in you, which it is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48021:10"/>
intended to amend. My deſign is not to expoſe, but to rectify your Failures. To be exempt from miſtake, is a priviledge few can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, the greateſt is to be paſt Conviction, and too obſtinate to reform. Even the <hi>Men,</hi> as exact as they wou'd ſeem, and as much as they divert themſelves with our Miſcarriages, are very often guilty of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er faults; and ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the advantages they enjoy, are much more inexcuſable. But I will not pretend to correct their Errors, who either are or at leaſt <hi>think</hi> themſelves too wiſe to receive Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48021:11"/>
from a Womans Pen. My earneſt deſire is, that you Ladies, would be as perfect and happy as 'tis poſſible to be in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate; for I love you too well to endure a ſpot upon your Beauties, if I can by any means remove and wipe it off. I would have you live up to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of your Nature, and expreſs your thankfulneſs to GOD for the benefits you enjoy by a due improvement of them: As I know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many of you do, who countenance that Piety which the men decry, and are the brighteſt Patterns of Religion that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48021:11"/>
the Age affords; 'tis my grief that all the reſt of our Sex do not imitate ſuch il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Patterns, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would have them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd and render'd more conſpicuous, that Vice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put out of countenance, (becauſe Vertue is the only thing in faſhion) may ſneak out of the world, and it's darkneſs be diſpell'd by the confluence of ſo many ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Graces. Some perhaps will cry out that I teach you falſe Doctrine; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by their ſeductions, ſome amongſt us are become very mean and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they would fain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the reſt to be as deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48021:12"/>
and forlorn as they. We are indeed oblig'd to them for their management, in endeavouring <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd deny us the means of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that inſtead of inquiring why all Women are not wiſe and good, we have reaſon to wonder that there are any ſo. Were the men as much neglected, and as little care taken to cultivate and improve them, perhaps they wou'd be ſo far from ſurpaſſing thoſe whom they now deſpiſe, that they themſelves wou'd ſink into the greateſt ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and brutality. The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48021:12"/>
prepoſterous returns that the moſt of them make, to all the care and pains that is beſtow'd on them, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this no uncharitable, nor improbable Conjecture. One wou'd therefore almoſt think, that the wiſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of all things, foreſeeing how unjuſtly Women are denied opportunities of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement from <hi>without,</hi> has therefore by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation endow'd them with greater propenſions to Vertue, and a natural good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper <hi>within,</hi> which if duly manag'd, would raiſe them to the moſt eminent pitch of Heroick Vertue. Hither Ladies, I deſire you
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48021:13"/>
wou'd aſpire, 'tis a noble and becoming Ambition; and to remove ſuch Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as lye in your way, is the deſign of this Paper. We will therefore enquire what it is that ſtops your flight, that keeps you gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling here below, like <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> catching Flies, when you ſhould be buſied in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Empires?</p>
            <p>Whatever has been ſaid by Men of more Wit than Wiſdom, and perhaps of more malice than either, that Women are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Incapable of acting Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, or that they are neceſſarily determined to folly, I muſt by no means
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48021:13"/>
grant it; that Hypotheſis would render my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours impertinent, for then it would be in vain to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the one, or endeavour the Reformation of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Beſides, there are Examples in all Ages, which ſufficiently confute the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Malice of this Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>The Incapacity, if there be any, is acquired not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; and none of their Follies are ſo neceſſary, but that they might avoid them if they pleaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Some diſadvantages indeed they labour under, &amp; what theſe are we ſhall ſee by and by, and endeavour
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48021:14"/>
to ſurmount; but Women need not take up with mean things, ſince (if they are not wanting to themſelves) they are capable of the beſt. Neither God nor Nature have excluded them from being Ornaments to their Families, and uſeful in their Generation; there is therefore no reaſon they ſhould be content to be Cyphers in the World, uſeleſs at the beſt, and in a little time a burden and nuiſance to all about them. And 'tis very great pity that they who are ſo apt to over-rate themſelves in ſmaller matters, ſhou'd, where it moſt concerns
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48021:14"/>
them to know, and ſtand upon their Value, be ſo inſenſible of their own worth.</p>
            <p>The cauſe therefore of the defects we labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is, if not wholly, yet at leaſt in the firſt place, to be aſcribed to the miſtakes of our Education; which like an Error in the firſt Concoction, ſpreads its ill Influence thro' all our Lives.</p>
            <p>The Soil is rich and would, if well cultivated, produce a noble Harveſt, if then the Unskilful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers not only permit, but incourage noxious Weeds, tho' we ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by their Neglect, yet
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48021:15"/>
they ought not in juſtice to blame any but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they reap the Fruit of their own Folly. Women are from their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Infancy debar'd thoſe Advantages, with the want of which, they are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reproached, and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up in thoſe Vices which will hereafter be upbraided to them. So partial are Men as to expect Brick where they afford no ſtraw; and ſo abundantly civil as to take care we ſhou'd make good that obliging Epithet of <hi>Ignorant,</hi> which out of an exceſs of good Manners, they are pleas'd to beſtow on us!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48021:15"/>
One wou'd be apt to think indeed, that Parents ſhou'd take all poſſible care of their Childrens Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only for <hi>their</hi> ſakes, but even for their <hi>own.</hi> And tho the Son convey the Name to Poſterity, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a great Part of the Honour of their Families de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on their Daughters. 'Tis the kindneſs of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that binds our duty faſteſt on us: For the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtrumental to the bringing us into the world, is no matter of choice, and therefore the leſs obliging: But to procure that we may live wiſely and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it, and be capable of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48021:16"/>
endleſs Joys hereafter, is a benefit we can never ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently acknowledge. To introduce poor Children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and neglect to fence them againſt the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of it, and ſo leave them expos'd to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal Miſeries, is a wickedneſs, for which I want a Name; 'tis beneath Bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Beaſts are better natur'd, for they take care of their off-ſpring, till they are capable of caring for themſelves. And, if Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had a due regard to their Poſterity, how <hi>Great</hi> ſoever they are, they wou'd not think themſelves too <hi>Good</hi> to perform what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48021:16"/>
requires, nor thro' Pride and Delicacy remit the poor little one to the care of a Foſter Parent. Or, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity inforce them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute another to perform their Duty, they wou'd be as choice at leaſt in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Inclinations, as they are in the complections of their Nurſes, leaſt with their Milk they transfuſe their Vices, and form in the Child ſuch evil habits as will not eaſily be eradicated.</p>
            <p>Nature as bad as it is, and as much as it is complain'd of, is ſo far improveable by the grace of GOD, upon our honeſt and hearty endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that if we are not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48021:17"/>
wanting to our ſelves, we may all in <hi>ſome,</hi> tho not in an <hi>equal</hi> meaſure, be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Glory, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to this world, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of eternal Bleſſedneſs in that to come. But if our Nature is ſpoil'd, inſtead of being improv'd at firſt; if from our Infancy, we are nurs'd up in Ignorance and Vanity; are taught to be Proud and Petulent, Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and Fantaſtick, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and Inconſtant, 'tis not ſtrange that the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this Conduct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in all the future Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Lives. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is Ignorance, either ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual or actual, which is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48021:17"/>
the cauſe of all ſin, how are they like to eſcape <hi>this,</hi> who are bred up in <hi>that?</hi> That therefore women are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to moſt, and a plague and diſhonour to ſome men is not much to be regretted on account of the <hi>Men,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis the product of their own folly, in denying them the benefits of an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, the moſt effectual means to direct them into, and to ſecure their progreſs in the ways of Vertue.</p>
            <p>For that Ignorance is the cauſe of moſt Feminine Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be inſtanc'd in that Pride and Vanity which is uſually imputed to us, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48021:18"/>
which, I ſuppoſe, if through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſifted, will appear to be ſome way or other, the riſe and Original of all the reſt. Theſe, tho very bad Weeds, are the product of a good Soil; they are nothing elſe but Generoſity degenerated and corrupted. A deſire to advance and perfect its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is planted by GOD in all Rational Natures, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them hereby to every worthy and becoming Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for certainly, next to the Grace of GOD, nothing does ſo powerfully reſtrain people from Evil, and ſtir them up to Good, as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Temper. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ambitious of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48021:18"/>
is no fault; tho to aſſume the Glory of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies to our ſelves, or to Glory in ſuch as we really have not, are. And were Womens haughtineſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in diſdaining to do a mean and evil thing; wou'd they pride themſelves in ſomewhat truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective of a Rational Nature, there were no hurt in it. But then they ought not to be denied the means of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining and judging what is ſo; they ſhould not be impos'd on with tinſel ware. If by reaſon of a falſe Light, or undue Medium, they chuſe amiſs; theirs is the loſs, but the Crime is the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48021:19"/>
Deceivers. She who right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly underſtands wherein the perfection of her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſiſts, will lay out her Thoughts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in the acquiſition of ſuch Perfections. But ſhe who is kept ignorant of the matter, will take up with ſuch Objects as firſt offer themſelves, and bear any plauſible reſemblance to what ſhe deſires; a ſhew of advantage is ſufficient to render them agreeable baits to her, who wants Judgment and skill to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between reality and pretence. From whence it eaſily follows, that ſhe who has nothing elſe to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48021:19"/>
value her ſelf upon, will be proud of her Beauty, or Money, and what that can purchaſe; and think her ſelf mightily oblig'd to him, who tells her ſhe has thoſe Perfections which ſhe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally longs for. Her imbred ſelf-eſteem, and deſire of good, which are degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Pride, and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſelf-love, will eaſily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen her Ears to whatever goes about to nouriſh and delight them; and when a cunning deſigning Enemy from without, has drawn over to his Party theſe Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors within, he has the Poor unhappy Perſon at his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, who now very glibly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48021:20"/>
ſwallows down his Poyſon, becauſe 'tis preſented in a Golden Cup; and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly hearkens to the moſt diſadvantagious Propoſals, becauſe they come attended with a ſeeming eſteem. She whoſe Vanity makes her ſwallow praiſes by the whole ſale, without examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether ſhe deſerves them, or from what hand they come, will reckon it but gratitude to think well of him who values her ſo much; and think ſhe muſt needs be merciful to the poor diſpairing Lover whom her Charms have reduc'd to die at her feet. Love and Honour are what every
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48021:20"/>
one of us naturally eſteem; they are excellent things in themſelves, and very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our regard; and by how much the readier we are to embrace what ever reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them, by ſo much the more dangerous, it is that theſe venerable Names ſhould be wretchedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd, and affixt to their direct contraries, yet this is the Cuſtom of the World: And how can ſhe poſſibly detect the fallacy, who has no better Notion of either, but what ſhe derives from Plays and Romances? How can ſhe be furniſhed with any ſolid Principles whoſe very Inſtructors are Froth
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48021:21"/>
and emptineſs? Whereas Women were they rightly Educated, had they obtain'd a well inform'd and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mind, they would be proof againſt all theſe Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, ſee through and ſcorn thoſe little ſilly Artifices which are us'd to enſnare and deceive them. Such an one would value her ſelf only on her Vertue, and conſequently be moſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of what ſhe eſteems ſo much. She would know, that not what others ſay, but what ſhe her ſelf does, is the true Commendation, and the only thing that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts her; the loudeſt Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums being not half ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48021:21"/>
as the calm and ſecret Plaudit of her own Mind; which moving on true Principles of Honour and Vertue, wou'd not fail on a review of it ſelf to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate that delightful Eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſhe ſhall one day hear.</p>
            <p>Whence is it but from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, from a want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to compare and judge of things, to chuſe a right end, to proportion the means to the end, and to rate ev'ry thing according to its proper value; that we quit the Subſtance for the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, Reality for Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and embrace thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things, which if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, we ſhou'd hate and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48021:22"/>
fly, but now are reconcil'd to, merely becauſe they uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urp the Name, tho they have nothing of the Nature of thoſe venerable Objects we deſire and ſeek? Were it not for this deluſion, is it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Lady who paſſionately deſires to be admir'd, ſhou'd ever conſent to ſuch Actions as render her baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible? Wou'd ſhe be ſo abſurd as to think either to get love, or to keep it, by thoſe methods which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on loathing, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end in hatred? Wou'd ſhe reckon it a piece of her Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, or hope to gain eſteem by ſuch exceſſes as really leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen her in the eyes of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48021:22"/>
and judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? Wou'd ſhe be ſo ſilly as to look big, and think her ſelf the better perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe has more Mony to beſtow profuſely, or the good luck to have a more ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Taylor or Milliner than her Neighbour? Wou'd ſhe who by the regard ſhe pays to Wit, ſeems to make ſome pretences to it, undervalue her Judgment ſo much as to admit the Scurrility and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane noiſy Nonſenſe of men, whoſe Fore-heads are better than their Brains to paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Character? Wou'd ſhe be ſo weak as to imagine that a few airy Fancies, joyn'd with a great deal of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48021:23"/>
Impudence (the right defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of modern Wit) can be ſpeak him a Man of ſenſe, who runs counter to all the ſenſe and reaſon that ever appear'd in the world? than which nothing can be an Argument of greater ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs, unleſs it be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and eſteem him for it. Wou'd a woman, if ſhe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood her ſelf, be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected either with the praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or calumnies of thoſe worthleſs perſons, whoſe Lives are a direct contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Reaſon, a very ſink of corruption; by whom one wou'd bluſh to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, leſt they ſhou'd be miſtaken for Partners or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48021:23"/>
Connivers at their Crimes? Will ſhe who has a jot of diſcernment think to ſatisfy her greedy deſire of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with thoſe promiſing nothings that have again &amp; again deluded her? Or, will ſhe to obtain ſuch Bubbles, run the riſque of forfeiting Joys, infinitely ſatisfying and eternal? In ſum, did not ignorance impoſe on us, we would never laviſh out the greateſt part of our Time and Care, on the decoration of a Tenement, in which our Leaſe is ſo very ſhort, and which for all our induſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may loſe it's Beauty e're that Leaſe be out, and in the mean while neglect a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48021:24"/>
more glorious and durable Manſion! We wou'd never be ſo curious of the Houſe, and ſo careleſs of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, whoſe beauty is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of great improvement, and will endure for ever without diminution or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay!</p>
            <p>Thus Ignorance and a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Education, lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Vice, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cuſtom rear it up. Cuſtom, that mercileſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that carries all before. And which indeed can be ſtem'd by none but ſuch as have a great deal of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and a rooted Vertue. For 'tis but Decorous that ſhe who is not capable of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48021:24"/>
giving better Rules, ſhou'd follow thoſe ſhe ſees before her, leſt ſhe only change the inſtance, and retain the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity. 'T wou'd puzzle a conſiderate Perſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for all that Sin and Folly that is in the World, (whcih certainly has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it ſelf to recommend it,) did not cuſtom help to ſolve the difficulty. For Vertue without queſtion has on all accounts the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of Vice 'tis abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more pleaſant in the <hi>Act,</hi> as well as more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious in the <hi>conſequences,</hi> as any one who will but right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe her reaſon, in a ſerious reflection on her ſelf, and the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48021:25"/>
nature of things, may eaſily perceive. 'Tis cuſtom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Tyrant Cuſtom, which is the grand motive to all thoſe irrational choices which we daily ſee made in the World, ſo very contrary to our <hi>preſent</hi> intereſt and pleaſure, as well as to our Future. We think it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable miſtake, not to do what others do round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, and part with our Peace and Pleaſure as well as our Innocence &amp; Vertue, meerly in complyance with an unreaſonable Faſhion. And having inur'd our ſelves to Folly, we know not how to quit it; we go on in Vice, not becauſe we find ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48021:25"/>
in it, but becauſe we are unacquainted with the Joys of Vertue.</p>
            <p>Add to this the hurry and noiſe of the world, which does generally ſo buſy and pre-ingage us, that we have little time, and leſs inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtand ſtill and reflect on our own Minds. Thoſe impertinent Amuſements which have ſeiz'd us, keep their hold ſo well, and ſo conſtantly buz about our Ears, that we cannot attend to the Dictates of our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor to the ſoft whiſpers and winning perſuaſives of the divine Spirit, by whoſe aſſiſtance were we diſpos'd to make uſe of it, we might
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48021:26"/>
ſhake off theſe Follies, and regain our Freedom. But alas! to complete our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, by a continual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to Vanity and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we quite ſpoil the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture and frame of our Minds; ſo looſen and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, that nothing ſolid and ſubſtantial will ſtay in it. By an habitual inadvertency we render our ſelves incapable of any ſerious &amp; improving thought, till our minds themſelves become as light and frothy as thoſe things they are converſant about. To all which, if we further add the great induſtry that bad people uſe to corrupt the good, and that unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48021:26"/>
backwardneſs that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in too many good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to ſtand up for, and propagate the Piety they profeſs; (ſo ſtrangely are things tranſpoſed, that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue puts on the bluſhes, which belong to Vice, and Vice inſults with the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Vertue!) and we have a pretty fair account of the Cauſes of our non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
            <p>When a poor Young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is taught to value her ſelf on nothing but her Cloaths, and to think ſhe's very fine when well accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. When ſhe hears ſay, that 'tis Wiſdom enough for her to know how to dreſs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48021:27"/>
her ſelf, that ſhe may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come amiable in his eyes, to whom it appertains to be knowing and learned; who can blame her if ſhe lay out her Induſtry and Money on ſuch Accompliſhments, and ſometimes extends it farther than her miſinformer deſires ſhe ſhould? When ſhe ſees the vain and the gay, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Parade in the World, and attended with the Courtſhip and admiration of all about them, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that her tender Eyes are dazled with the Pageantry; and wanting Judgment to paſs a due Eſtimate on them and their Admirers, longs to be ſuch a fine and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48021:27"/>
thing as they! What tho' ſhe be ſometimes told of another World, ſhe has however a more lively per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this, and may well think, that if her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors were in earneſt, when they tell her of <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,</hi> they would not be ſo buſied and concerned about what happens <hi>here.</hi> She is, it may be, taught the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Duties of Religion, but not acquainted with the Reaſons and Grounds of them; being told, 'tis enough for her to believe, to examin why, and wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to her. And therefore, though her Piety may be tall and ſpreading,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48021:28"/>
yet becauſe it wants founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Root, the firſt rude Temptation overthrows and blaſts it; or perhaps the ſhort liv'd Gourd decays and withers of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. But why ſhould ſhe be blamed for ſetting no great value on her Soul, whoſe nobleſt Faculty, her Underſtanding is render'd uſeleſs to her? Or cenſur'd for relinquiſhing a courſe of Life, whoſe Prerogatives ſhe was never acquainted with, and tho highly reaſonable in it ſelf, was put upon the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing it, with as little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as ſhe now forſakes it? For if her Religion it ſelf, be taken up as the Mode of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48021:28"/>
Country, 'tis no ſtrange thing that ſhe lays it down again, in conformity to the Faſhion. Whereas ſhe whoſe Reaſon is ſuffer'd to diſplay it ſelf, to inquire into the grounds and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Religion, to make a diſquiſition of its Graces, and ſearch out its hidden Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; who is a Chriſtian out of Choice, not in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to thoſe about her; and cleaves to Piety, becauſe 'tis her Wiſdom, her Intereſt, her Joy, not becauſe ſhe has been accuſtom'd to it; ſhe who is not only eminently and unmoveably good, but able to give a Reaſon <hi>why</hi> ſhe is ſo; is too firm and ſtable
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48021:29"/>
to be mov'd by the pitiful Allurements of ſin, too wiſe and too well bottom'd to be undermin'd and ſupplanted by the ſtrongeſt Efforts of Temptation. Doubtleſs a truly Chriſtian Life requires a clear Underſtanding, as well as regular Affections, that both together may move the Will to a direct choice of Good, and a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt adherence to it. For tho the heart may be honeſt, it is but by chance that the Will is right, if the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be ignorant and Cloudy. And whats the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily ſee perſons falling off from their Piety, but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48021:29"/>
becauſe 'twas their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not their Judgment, that inclin'd them to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious? Reaſon and Truth are firm and immutable, ſhe who bottoms on them is on ſure ground: Humour and Inclination are ſandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; and ſhe who is ſway'd by her Affections more than by her Judgment, owes the happineſs of her Soul in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the temper of her Body; her Piety may perhaps blaze higher, but will not laſt ſo long. For the Affections are various and changeable, mov'd by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Object, and the laſt comer eaſily undoes whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48021:30"/>
its Predeceſſor had done before it. Such Perſons are always in extreams; they are either violently good, or quite cold and indifferent, a perpetual trouble to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves &amp; others, by indecent Raptures, or unneceſſary Scruples; there is no Beauty and order in their lives, all is rapid and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; they are now very furious in ſuch a courſe, but they cannot well tell why, &amp; anon as violent in the other extream. Having more <hi>Heat</hi> than <hi>Light,</hi> their Zeal out runs their knowledge and inſtead of repreſenting Piety as it is in it ſelf, the moſt lovely and inviting
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48021:30"/>
thing imaginable, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to the contempt and ridicule of the cenſorious World. Their Devotion being ricketed, ſtarv'd and contracted in ſome of it's vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal parts, and diſproportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and over grown in leſs material inſtances; whilſt one Duty is <hi>over done,</hi> to commute for the neglect of another, and the miſtaken Perſon thinks the being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on her knees, attones for all the miſcarriages of her Converſation: Not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that 'tis in vain to Petition for thoſe Graces which we take no care to Practice, and a mockery to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore thoſe Perfections we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48021:31"/>
run counter to: and that the true end of all our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and external Obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is to work our minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a truly Chriſtian temper, to obtain for us the Empire of our Paſſions, and to reduce all irregular Inclinations, that ſo we may be as like GOD in Purity, Charity, and all his imitable excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as is conſiſtent with the imperfection of a Creature.</p>
            <p>And now having diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Diſeaſe and its cauſe, 'tis proper to apply a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſingle Medicines are too weak to cure ſuch compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Diſtempers, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a full Diſpenſatory; and what wou'd a good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48021:31"/>
refuſe to do, could ſhe hope by that to advantage the greateſt part of the world, and improve her Sex in Knowledge and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? I doubt not Ladies, but that the Age, as bad as it is, affords very many of you who will readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace whatever has a true tendency to the Glory of GOD, and your mutual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, to revive the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Spirit of Piety in the World, and to tranſmit it to ſucceeding Generations. I know there are many of you who ſo ardently love GOD, as to think no time too much to ſpend in his ſervice, nor any thing too difficult to do
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48021:32"/>
for his ſake; and bear ſuch a hearty good-will to your Neighbours, as to grudge no Prayers or Pains to reclaim and improve them. I have therefore no more to do, but to make the Propoſal, to prove that it will anſwer theſe great and good Ends, and then 'twill be eaſy to obviate the Objections that Perſons of more Wit than Vertue may happen to raiſe againſt it.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Propoſal, it is to erect a <hi>Monaſtry,</hi> or if you will (to avoid giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the ſcrupulous and injudicious, by names which tho innocent in themſelves, have been abus'd by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious

For here, thoſe who are convinc'd of the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of earthly Enjoyments, who are ſick of the vanity of the world, and its imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies, may find more
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48021:33"/>
ſubſtantial and ſatisfyingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, and need not be confin'd to what they juſtly loath. Thoſe who are deſirous to know and fortify their weak ſide, firſt do good to themſelves, that hereafter they may be capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more good to others; or for their greater ſecurity are willing to avoid <hi>temptation,</hi> may get out of that danger which a continual ſtay in view of the Enemy, and the familiarity and unwearied application of the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may expoſe them to; and gain an opportunity to look into themſelves, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted at home, and no longer the greateſt ſtrangers
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48021:33"/>
to their own hearts. Such as are willing in a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and undiſturb'd man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to attend the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs they came into the world about, the ſervice of GOD, and improvement of their own Minds, may find a convenient and bliſsful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs from the noiſe and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the world. A world ſo cumberſom, ſo infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that altho' thro' the grace of GOD, and their own ſtrict watchfulneſs, they are kept from ſinking down into its corruptions, 'twill however damp their flight to heav'n, hinder them from attaining any eminent pitch of Vertue.</p>
            <p>

You are therefore Ladies, invited into a place, where you ſhall ſuffer no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, but to be kept out of the road of ſin: You ſhall not be depriv'd of your grandeur, but only exchange the vain Pomps and Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the world, empty Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Forms of State, for the true and ſolid Greatneſs of being able to diſpiſe <hi>them.</hi> You will only quit the Chat of inſignificant people, for an ingenious Converſation; the froth of flaſhy wit for real wiſdom; idle tales for inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tive diſcourſes. The deceitful Flatteries of thoſe who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of loving and admiring you, really ſerved

their <hi>own</hi> baſe ends, for the ſeaſonable Reproofs and wholſom Counſels of your hearty well-wiſhers and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Friends; which will procure you thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections your feigned lovers pretended you had, and kept you from obtaining. No uneaſy task will be enjoyn'd you, all your labour being only to prepare for the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degrees of that Glory, the very loweſt of which, is more than at preſent you are able to conceive, and the proſpect of it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to out-weigh all the Pains of Religion, were there any in it, as really there is none. All that is requir'd of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48021:35"/>
you, is only to be as happy as poſſibly you can, and to make ſure of a Felicity that will fill all the capacities of your Souls! A happineſs, which when once you have taſted, you'l be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, you cou'd never do too much to obtain it; nor be too ſolicitous to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn your Souls, with ſuch tempers and diſpoſitions, as will at preſent make you in ſome meaſure ſuch holy and Heavenly Creatures, as you one day hope to be in a more perfect manner; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Qualifications you can neither reaſonably <hi>expect,</hi> nor are <hi>capable</hi> of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the Happineſs of the

Life to come. Happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat! which will be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing you into ſuch a <hi>Paradiſe</hi> as your Mother <hi>Eve</hi> forfeited, where you ſhall feaſt on Pleaſures, that do not, like thoſe of the World, diſappoint your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, pall your Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and by the diſguſt they give you, put you on the fruitleſs ſearch after new Delights, which when obtain'd are as empty as the former; but ſuch as will make you truly happy <hi>now,</hi> and prepare you to be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> ſo hereafter. Here are no Serpents to deceive you, whilſt you entertain your ſelves in theſe delicious Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48021:36"/>
No Provocations are given in this Amicable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, but to Love and to good Works, which will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſuch an entertaining employment, that you'l have as little inclination as lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to purſue thoſe Follies which in the time of your ignorance paſs'd with you under the name of love; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' there is not in nature two more different things, than <hi>true Love,</hi> and that <hi>bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Paſſion</hi> which pretends to ape it. Here will be no Rivalling but for the love of GOD, no ambition but to procure his Favour, to which nothing will more effectually recommend you,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48021:36"/>
than a great and dear affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to each other. Envy, that Canker, will not here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb your Breaſts; for how can ſhe repine at anothers wel-fare, who reckons it the greateſt part of her own? No Covetouſneſs will gain admittance in this bleſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, but to amaſs huge Treaſures of good Works, and to procure one of the brighteſt Crowns of Glory. You will not be ſolicitous to encreaſe your Fortunes, but enlarge your Minds; eſteeming no Grandeur like being conformable to the meek and humble JESUS. So that you only withdraw from the noiſe and trouble,

the folly and temptation of the world, that you may more peaceably enjoy your ſelves, and all the innocent Pleaſures it is able to afford you, and particularly that which is worth all the reſt, a noble, Vertuous and Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs'd Friendſhip. And to compleat all that <hi>acme</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which the devout Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphic Soul enjoys, when dead to the World, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes her ſelf entirely to the contemplation and fruition of her Beloved; when hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſengag'd her felf from all thoſe Lets which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her from without, ſhe moves in a direct and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous motion towards her

true and only Good, whom now ſhe embraces and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſces in, with ſuch an unſpeakable pleaſure, as is only intelligible to them who have tried and felt it, which we can no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the dark and ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part of Mankind, than we can the beauty of Colours, and harmony of Sounds, to the Blind and Deaf. In fine, the place to which you are invited will be a Type and Antipaſt of Heav'n, where your Employment will be as there, to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy GOD, and to love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and to communicate that uſeful <hi>knowledge,</hi> which by the due improvement of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48021:38"/>
your time in Study and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation you will obtain; and which when obtain'd, will afford you a much ſweeter and durable delight, than all thoſe pitiful diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thoſe revellings and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements, which now thro your ignorance of better, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the only grateful and reliſhing Entertainments.</p>
            <p>But becauſe we were not made for our ſelves, nor can by any means ſo effectually glorify GOD, and do good to our own Souls, as by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Offices of Charity and Beneficence to others; and to the intent, that every Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the higheſt degrees of every Vertue, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd

&amp; promoted the moſt that may be; your Retreat ſhall be ſo manag'd as not to exclude the good Works of an <hi>Active,</hi> from the pleaſure and ſerenity of a <hi>contemplative</hi> Life, but by a due mixture of both, retain all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and avoid the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies that attend either. It ſhall not ſo cut you off from the world, as to hinder you from bettering and improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; but rather qualify you to do it the greateſt Good, and be a Seminary to ſtock the Kingdom with pious and prudent Ladies; whoſe good Example it is to be hop'd, will ſo influence the reſt of their Sex, that Women may no longer paſs for thoſe little
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48021:39"/>
uſeleſs and impertinent Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which the ill conduct of too many, has caus'd them to be miſtaken for.</p>
            <p>We have hitherto conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd our Retirement only in relation to Religion, which is indeed its <hi>main,</hi> I may ſay, its <hi>only</hi> deſign; nor can this be thought too contracting a word, ſince Religion is the adequate buſineſs of our lives; and largely conſider'd, takes in all we have to do; nothing being a fit employment for a rational Creature, which has not either a <hi>direct</hi> or <hi>remote</hi> tendency to this great and <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> end. But becauſe, as we have all along obſerv'd, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion never appears in it's true Beauty, but when it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48021:39"/>
with Wiſdom and Diſcretion; and that without a good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we can ſcarce be <hi>truly,</hi> but never <hi>eminently</hi> Good; being liable to a thouſand ſeductions and miſtakes; for even the men themſelves, if they have not a competent degree of Knowledge, they are carried about with every wind of Doctrine. Therefore, one great end of this inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall be to expel that cloud of Ignorance, which cuſtom has involv'd us in, to furniſh our minds with a ſtock of ſolid and uſeful Knowledge, that the Souls of women may no longer be the only unadorn'd and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected things. It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48021:40"/>
that our Religious ſhou'd waſte their time, and trouble their heads about ſuch unconcerning matters, as the vogue of the world has turn'd up for Learning; the impertinency of which has been excellently expos'd by an ingenious Pen, but buſy themſelves in a <note place="margin">Mr Nor.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48021:40"/>
for it is not intended ſhe ſhou'd ſpend her hours in learning <hi>words</hi> but <hi>things,</hi> and therefore no more Languag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es than are neceſſary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her with uſeful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Nor need ſhe trouble her ſelf in turning over a huge number of Books, but take care to underſtand and digeſt a few well-choſen and good ones.

Indeed a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Education of the Women will appear ſo unfaſhionable, that I began to ſtartle at the ſingularity of the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but was extreamly pleas'd when I found a late ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Author (whoſe Book I met with ſince the writing of this) agree with me in my Opinion. For ſpeaking of the Repute that Learning was in about 150 years ago: <hi>It</hi>

One wou'd think by the effects, that it was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per way of Educating them, ſince there are no accounts in Hiſtory of ſo many great Women in any one Age, as are to be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the years</hi> 15 <hi>and</hi> 1600.</p>
            <p>For, ſince GOD has given Women as well as Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Souls, why ſhould they be forbidden to improve them?

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48021:42"/>
and ſecular Affairs? Being the Soul was created for the contemplation of Truth, as well as for the fruition of Good, is it not as cruel and unjuſt to preclude Women from the knowledge of the one, as well as from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the other? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the Will is blind, and cannot chuſe but by the direction of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or to ſpeak more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, ſince the Soul always <hi>Wills</hi> according as ſhe <hi>

Underſtandings we ſhall ſhortly have none to uſe; and the more contracted, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employ'd the deliberating and directive Power is, the more liable is the elective to unworthy and miſchievous options. What is it but the want of an ingenious Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that renders the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Feminine Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo inſipid and fooliſh, and their ſolitude ſo <hi>inſupportable?</hi> Learning is therefore neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to render them more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and uſeful in company, and to furniſh them with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming entertainments when alone, that ſo they may not be driven to thoſe miſerable ſhifts, which too many make uſe of to put off their time,

that precious Talent that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lies on the hands of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Perſon.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48021:43"/>
Truths? Let ſuch therefore as deny us the improvement of our Intellectuals, either take up <hi>his</hi> Paradox, who ſaid, <hi>That Women have no Souls;</hi> which at this time a day, when they are allow'd to Brutes, wou'd be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philoſophical as it is unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly; or elſe let them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to cultivate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them.

yet how can they juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blame her, who forbid, or at leaſt, won't afford oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of better?

It will therefore

be very proper for our Ladies to ſpend part of their time in this Retirement, in adorning their minds with uſeful Knowledge.</p>
            <p>To enter into the detail of the particulars concerning the Government of the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> their Offices of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Employments, Work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not now neceſſary.

And as it will be the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their lives, their meat and drink to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>do</hi> the Will of their heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo will they pay a ſtrict conformity to all the Precepts of their holy Mother the <hi>Church,</hi> whoſe ſacred Injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are too much neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even by thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the greateſt zeal for her. For, beſides the daily perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Publick Offices after the Cathedral manner, in the moſt affecting and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating way, the celebration of the Holy Euchariſt every Lords Day and Holyday, and a courſe of ſolid inſtructive Preaching and Catechizing; our Religious, conſidering that the holy JESUS punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

obſerv'd the innocent uſages of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; and tho in many inſtances the <hi>reaſon</hi> of the Command ceas'd as to him, yet he wou'd obey the <hi>letter</hi> to avoid giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offence, and to ſet us an admirable pattern of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; therefore, tho' it may be thought ſuch pious Souls have little occaſion for the ſeverities of faſting and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; yet, they will conſider it as a ſpecial part of their Duty, carefully to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the Faſts of the Church, <hi>viz.

But having long ſince laid the Ax to the root of ſin, and deſtroy'd the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of it, they will look upon theſe holy times of recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and extraordinary Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (without which Faſting ſignifies little) as excellent means to keep it down, and to pluck up every the leaſt Fibre that may happen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in them. But we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48021:48"/>
not by this to impoſe any intolerable burden on tender Conſtitutions, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that our Lord has taught us, that Mercy is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before Sacrifice; and that Bodily Exerciſe profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but a little, the chief bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs being to obtain a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and God-like temper of Mind.</p>
            <p>And as this inſtitution will ſtrictly enjoyn all pious and profitable Employments, ſo does it not only permit but recommend harmleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Diverſions, Muſick particularly, and ſuch as may refreſh the Body, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervating the mind.

Nature, and injure the Almighty when they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him as impoſing burdens that are not to be born. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther GOD nor Wiſe men will like us the better, for an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſeverity and waſpiſh ſourneſs. Nature and Grace will never diſagree, provided we miſtake not the one, nor indulge the petulency of the other; there being no Diſplacencies in Religon, but what we our ſelves have unhappily made. For true Piety is the moſt ſweet and engaging thing imaginable, as it is moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging to others, ſo moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to our ſelves. 'Tis in truth the higheſt <hi>Epicuriſm,</hi> exalting our Pleaſures by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſining

And ſince neither Meat nor Cloaths commend us unto GOD, they'l content themſelves with ſuch things as are fit and convenient, without occaſioning ſcruple to themſelves, or giving any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48021:50"/>
trouble or offence to others. She who conſiders to how much better account that Money will turn, which is beſtow'd on the Poor, then that which is laid out in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Expences on her ſelf, needs no Admonitions againſt ſuperfluities: She who truly loves her ſelf, will never waſte that Money on a decaying Carkaſs, which if prudently disburs'd, wou'd procure her an eternal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. She will never think her ſelf ſo fine, as when the backs of the Poor do bleſs her; and never feaſt ſo luxuriouſly as when ſhe treats an hungry perſon. No perfume will be thought ſo grateful as the Odour of Good
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48021:50"/>
Works; nor any Waſh ſo beautifying as her own tears. For her Heroic Soul is too great to ambition any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire but that of her own Breaſt; or to regard any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conqueſt than the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing poor unhappy-Souls from the ſlavery of Sin and Satan, thoſe only unſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Tyrants; and therefore what Decays ſhe obſerves in her Face will be very uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, but ſhe will with greateſt ſpeed and accuracy rectify the leaſt Spot that may prejudice the beauty of her lovely Soul.</p>
            <p>In a word, this happy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety will be but one Body, whoſe Soul is love, animating and informing it, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48021:51"/>
breathing forth it ſelf in flames of holy deſires after GOD, and acts of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to each other. Envy and Uncharitableneſs are the Vices only of little and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hearts, and therefore 'tis ſuppos'd, they will not enter here amongſt perſons whoſe Diſpoſitions as well as their Births are to be Generous. Cenſure will refine into Friendly Admonition, all Scoffing and offenſive Railleries will be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and baniſh'd hence; where not only the Words and Actions, but even the very Thoughts and Deſires of the Religious, tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the moſt endearing Love, and univerſal Good-
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48021:51"/>
will; for tho' there may be particular Friendſhips, they muſt by no means prejudice the general Amity. Thus theſe innocent and holy Souls ſhou'd run their Race, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring their hours by their Devotions, and their days by the charitable Works they do. Thus wou'd they live the life of Heaven whilſt on Earth, and receive an Earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of its Joys in their hearts. And now, what remains for them to do at Night, but to review the Actions of the Day? to examine what Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have been ſtirring? How their Devotions were perform'd? in what temper their Hearts are? what good they have done? and what
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48021:52"/>
progreſs made towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? and with the plaudit of a ſatisfied Conſcience ſweetly to ſleep in peace and ſafety, Angels pitching their Tents round about them, and he that neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps, rejoycing over them to do them good!</p>
            <p>And to the end, that theſe great deſigns may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purſu'd, and effectually obtain'd, care ſhall be taken that our Religious be under the tuition of perſons of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable Lives, of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Prudence, ſincere Piety, and unaffected Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. No Novices in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſuch as have ſpent the greateſt part of their lives in the ſtudy and practice of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48021:52"/>
Chriſtianity; who have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>much,</hi> whatever the time of their abode in the world has been. Whoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are clear and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, as well as their Paſſions at command, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections regular; and their knowledge able to govern their Zeal.

Plentifully furniſh'd with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for the ignorant, and comfort for the diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Who know how to quicken the ſlothful, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48021:53"/>
the ſecure, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the doubts of the Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Who are not ignorant when to uſe the Spur, and when the Rein, but duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to miniſter to all the ſpiritual wants of their Charge. Watching over their Souls with tenderneſs and prudence; applying fitting Medicines with ſweetneſs &amp; affability. Sagacious in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the very approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of a fault, wiſe in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and charitable in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all pityable Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The ſweetneſs of whoſe Nature is commenſurate to all the reſt of their good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and all conſpire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make them lov'd and reverenc'd. Who have the

perfect government of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and therefore rule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Reaſon, not Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, conſulting the good of the Society, not their own ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary ſway. Yet know how to aſſert their Authority when there is juſt occaſion for it, and will not prejudice their Charge, by an indiſcreet remiſsneſs and looſning the Reins of diſcipline. Yet what occaſion will there be for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, when the deſign is to repreſent Vertue in all her Charms and native Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which muſt needs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the eyes, and enamour the hearts of all who behold her? To joyn the ſweetneſs of Humanity to the ſtrictneſs of Philoſophy, that both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48021:54"/>
being improv'd and heighten'd by grace, may make up an accompliſh'd <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> who (if truly ſo) is certainly the beſt-bred and beſt-natur'd perſon in the world, adorn'd with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Charms, moſt happy in her ſelf, and moſt agreeable and beneficial to all about her. And that every one who comes under this holy Roof, may be ſuch an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſuch a charming Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what faults they bring with them ſhall be corrected by ſweetneſs, not ſeverity; by friendly Admonitions, not magiſterial Reproofs; Piety ſhall not be roughly impos'd, but wiſely inſinuated by a perpetual Diſplay of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48021:54"/>
Beauties of Religion in an exemplary Converſation, the continual and moſt powerful Sermon of an holy Life. And ſince Inclination can't be forc'd, (and nothing makes people more uneaſy than the fettering themſelves with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Bonds) there ſhall be no Vows or irrevocable Obligations, not ſo much as the fear of Reproach to keep our Ladies here any longer than they deſire. No: Ev'ry act of our Religious Votary ſhall be voluntary and free, and no other tye but the Pleaſure, the Glory and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, to confine her to it.</p>
            <p>And now, I ſuppoſe, you will ſave me the labour of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48021:55"/>
proving, that this inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will very much ſerve the ends of Piety and Charity; it is methinks ſelf-evident, and the very Propoſal ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof. But if it will not promote theſe great ends, I ſhall think my ſelf mightily oblig'd to him that will ſhew me what will; for provided the good of my Neighbour be advanc'd, 'tis very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to me, whether it be by my method or by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Here will be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Viſits, no fooliſh Amours, no idle Amuſements to diſtract our Thoughts, and waſte our precious time; a very little of which is ſpent in Dreſſing, that grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer, and its concomitants;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48021:55"/>
and no more than neceſſity requires in ſleep and eating; ſo that here's an huge Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure gain'd, which for ought I know, may purchaſe an happy Eternity. But we need not reſt in generals, a curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry view of ſome particulars will ſufficiently demonſtrate the great uſefulneſs of ſuch a Retirement; which will appear by obſerving firſt, a few of thoſe inconveniences to which Ladies are expos'd, by living in the world, and in the next place the poſitive advantages of a Retreat.</p>
            <p>And firſt, as to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of living in the World; no very ſmall one is that ſtrong <hi>Idea</hi> and warm perception it gives us of its
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48021:56"/>
Vanities; ſince theſe are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at hand, conſtantly thronging about us, they muſt neceſſarily puſh aſide all other Objects, and the Mind being prepoſſeſs'd and gratefully entertain'd with thoſe pleaſing Perceptions which external Objects occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, takes up with them as its only Good, is not at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to taſte thoſe delights which ariſe from a Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on it ſelf, nor to receive the <hi>Ideas</hi> which ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection conveys, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently forms all its Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by ſuch <hi>Ideas</hi> only as ſenſation has furniſh'd it with, being unacquainted with thoſe more excellent ones which ariſefrom its own
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48021:56"/>
operations and a ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on them, and which are neceſſary to correct the miſtakes, and ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the other. From whence ariſes a very partial knowledge of things, nay, almoſt a perfect ignorance in things of the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For tho we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Sound of ſome certain words, <hi>v. g. God, Religion, Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Pain, Honour</hi> and <hi>Diſhonour,</hi> and the like; yet having no other <hi>Ideas</hi> but what are convey'd to us by thoſe Trifles we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with, we frame to our ſelves ſtrange &amp; awkard noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, conformable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> ſenſation has furniſh'd us with, which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48021:57"/>
ſometimes grow ſo ſtrong and fixt, that 'tis ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to introduce a new Scheme of Thoughts, and ſo to diſabuſe us, eſpecially whilſt theſe Objects are thick about us.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhe who ſees her ſelf and others reſpected in proportion to that Pomp and Buſtle they make in the world, will form her Idea of Honour accordingly. She who has reliſh'd no Pleaſures but ſuch as ariſe at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of outward Objects, will ſeek no higher than her Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for her Gratification. And thus we may account for that ſtrange inſenſibility that appears in ſome people when you ſpeak to them of any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48021:57"/>
religious matter. They are then ſo dull you'l have much ado to make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the cleareſt Truth: Wheras if you rally the ſame perſons, or chat with them of ſome Mode or Foppery, they'll appear very quick, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, and ingenious. I have ſometimes ſmil'd to hear Women talk as grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and concernedly about ſome trifling diſappointment from their Milliner or Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, as if it had related to the weightieſt concerns of their Soul, nay, perhaps more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly than others who wou'd paſs for Good, do about their eternal Intereſt; but turn the talk that way, and they grow as heavy and cold as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48021:58"/>
they were warm and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before. And whence is this, but becauſe their heads are full of the one, and quite deſtitute of ſuch Ideas as might give them a competent notion of the other; and therefore to diſcourſe of ſuch matters, is as little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as to make Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Demonſtrations to one who knows not what an Angle or Triangle means. (Hence by the way, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the great uſefulneſs of judicious Catechizing, which is neceſſary to ſtir up clear Idea's in the mind, without which it can receive but little benefit from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the Pulpit, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the neglect of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48021:58"/>
is the reaſon that the great plenty of the latter has no better effect.) By all which it appears, that if we wou'd not be impos'd on by falſe Reprefentations and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, if we wou'd obtain a due knowledge of the moſt important things, we muſt remove the little Toys and Vanities of the world from us, or our ſelves from them; enlarge our Ideas, ſeek out new Fields of Knowledge, whereby to rectify our firſt miſtakes.</p>
            <p>From the ſame Original, <hi>viz.</hi> the conſtant flattery of external Objects, ariſes that querulouſneſs and delicacy obſervable in moſt Perſons of Fortune, and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48021:59"/>
them to many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies. For beſides that, it renders them altogether unfit to bear a change, which conſidering the great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, the ſwift viciſſitudes of worldly things, the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt eſtabliſhed, ought not to be unprepar'd for; beſides this, it makes them perpetually uneaſy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates the delight of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, for ſuch perſons will very rarely find all things to their mind, and then ſome little diſorder which others wou'd take no notice of, like an aching Tooth or Toe, ſpoils the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of their Joys. And tho many great Ladies affect this temper, miſtaking it for a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48021:59"/>
piece of Grandeur, 'tis ſo far from that, that it gives evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a poor weak Mind; a very childiſh Humour, that muſt be cocker'd and fed with Toys and Baubles to ſtill its frowardneſs; &amp; is like the crazy ſtomach of a ſick Perſon, which no body has reaſon to be fond of or deſire.</p>
            <p>This alſo diſpoſes them to Inconſtancy, (for ſhe who is continually ſupply'd with variety, knows not where to fix,) a Vice which ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſeem to be proud of, and yet nothing in the world ſo reproachſul and degrading, becauſe nothing is a ſtronger evidence of a weak and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious mind. For it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us either ſo ignorant as
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48021:60"/>
to make a wrong Choice at firſt, or elſe ſo ſilly as not to know and ſtick to it, when we have made a right one. It beſpeaks an unthinking inconſiderate Mind, one that lives at Random, without any deſign or end; who wanting judgment to diſcern where to fix, or to know when ſhe's well, is ever fluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating and uncertain, undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to day what ſhe had done yeſterday, which is the worſt Character that can be given of ones Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>A conſtant Scene of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and the infection of ill company, is another great danger, which converſing in the world expoſes to. 'Tis a dangerous thing to have all
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48021:60"/>
the opportunities of ſinning in our power, and the danger is increas'd by the ill Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents we daily ſee of thoſe who take them. <hi>Liberty</hi> (as ſome body ſays) <hi>will corrupt an Angel.</hi> And tho it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more glorious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer than to fly, yet ſince our Vertue is ſo viſibly weakned in other inſtances, we have no reaſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume on't in this. 'Tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no eaſy matter to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Innocence in our neceſſary Civilities and daily Converſations; in which, if we have the good luck to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſuch as bring a neceſſity on us, either of ſeeming rude to them, or of being really ſo to GOD Almighty, whilſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48021:61"/>
we tamely hear him, our beſt Friend and Benefactor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted, and ſwallow'd it, at the ſame time, that we wou'd reckon't a very piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spirit to hear an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance traduc'd and hold our Tongue; yet, if we avoid this Trial, our Charity is however in continual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Cenſoriouſneſs being grown ſo modiſh, that we can ſcarce avoid being active or paſſive in it; ſo that ſhe who has not her pert jeſt ready to paſs upon others, ſhall as ſoon as her back is turn'd, become a Jeſt her ſelf for want of Wit.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of all this, we are inſenſibly betray'd to a great loſs of time, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48021:61"/>
whoſe value we are too often quite ignorant of, till it be loſt paſt redemption. And yet, conſidering the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of Life, the great work we have to do, and what advantages accrew to us by a due ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of our time, we cannot reconcile it with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſuffer the leaſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute to eſcape us. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our own laviſh Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (concerning which one may ask as <hi>Solomon</hi> does of Labour, <hi>What Fruit have we of all that Sport and Paſtime we have taken under the Sun?)</hi> So unreaſonable is the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World, that thoſe who wou'd reckon it a rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make ſo bold with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48021:62"/>
our Mony, never ſcruple to waſte, and rob us of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more precious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, by reaſon of this loſs of time and the continual hurry we are in, we can find no opportunities for thoughtfulneſs and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; we are ſo buſied with what paſſes abroad, that we have no leiſure to look at home, nor to rectify the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders there. And ſuch an unthinking mechanical way of living, when like Machins we are condemn'd every day to repent the impertinencies of the day before; ſhortens our Views, contracts our Minds, expoſes to a thouſand practical Errors, and renders
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48021:62"/>
Improvement impoſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will not permit us to conſider and recollect, which is the only means to attain it. So much for the inconveniences of living in the World; if we enquire about Retirement, we ſhall find it does not only remove all theſe, but brings conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable advantages of its own.</p>
            <p>For firſt, it helps us to mate cuſtom, and delivers us from its Tyranny, which is the moſt conſiderable thing we have to do, it being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the habituating our ſelves to Folly that can reconcile us to it. But how hard is it to quit an old road? What courage as well as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48021:63"/>
does it require? How clear a Judgment to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the Prejudices of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Example, and to diſcern what is beſt, and how ſtrong a reſolution, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Scoffs and Noiſes of the world to adhere to it! For Cuſtom has u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpt ſuch an unaccountable Authority, that ſhe who wou'd endeavour to put a ſtop to its Arbitrary Sway, and reduce it to Reaſon, is in a fair way to render her ſelf the <hi>Butt</hi> for all the Fops in Town to ſhoot their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Cenſures at. And tho a wiſe Woman will not value their Cenſure, yet ſhe cares not to be the ſubject of their Diſcourſe. The only
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48021:63"/>
way then is to retire from the world, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> leſt the Sacrifice we muſt make of its Follies, ſhou'd provoke its Spleen.</p>
            <p>This alſo puts us out of the road of temptation, and very much redeems our Time, cutting off thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies on which ſo much of it was ſquandred away before. And furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us conſtantly with good employment, ſecures us from being ſeduc'd into bad. Great are the Benefits of holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation which will be here enjoy'd: As Vice is, ſo Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue may be catching; and to what heights of Piety will not ſhe advance, who is plac'd where the ſole Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48021:64"/>
is to be Good, where there is no pleaſure but in Religion, no contention but to excel in what is truly commendable; where her Soul is not defil'd nor her Zeal provok'd, by the ſight or relation of thoſe Villanies the World abounds with?</p>
            <p>And by that Learning which will be here afforded, and that leiſure we have, to enquire after it, and to know and reflect on our own minds, we ſhall reſcue our ſelves out of that woful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy we have ſlipt into, awaken our ſleeping Powers, and make uſe of that reaſon which GOD has given us. We ſhall then begin to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at our Folly, that amongſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48021:64"/>
all the pleaſures we former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued, we never attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that moſt noble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious one which the chaſe of truth affords us; and bleſs our ſelves at laſt, that our eyes are open'd to diſcern how much more pleaſantly we may be entertain'd by our own Thoughts, than by all the Diverſions which the world affords us. By this means we are fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the influences of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and are put in a due frame of Devotion. No doubt but he has often knock'd at the door of our hearts, when the croud and noiſe of our Vanities would not ſuffer us to regard or hear him; and could find no admittance
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48021:65"/>
when our houſe was ſo fill'd with other company. Here therefore is the fitteſt place for his Entertainment, when we are freed from outward diſturbances, and entirely at leiſure to attend ſo divine a Gueſt. Our Devotions will be perform'd with due attention, thoſe Objects that uſed to diſtract being now remov'd from us; ſimplicity of deſire will beget ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thought, and that will make our minds moſt intenſe and elevated, when we come to addreſs our ſelves to the Throne of Grace. Being dead to the things of this world, we ſhall with greater fervour petition for thoſe of another; and living always in a lively
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48021:65"/>
and awful ſenſe of the divine Majeſty, our hearts will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be diſpos'd to approach him in the moſt ſolemn, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and reverent manner. 'Tis a very unſeemly thing to jump from our Diverſions to our Prayers; as if when we have been entertaining our ſelves and others with Vanity, we were inſtantly prepar'd to appear in the ſacred preſence of GOD. But a Religious Retirement and holy Converſation, will procure us a more ſerious Temper, a graver Spirit, and ſo both make us conſtantly ſit to approach, and likewiſe ſtir us up to be more careful in our preparations when we do. For beſides all other
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48021:66"/>
improvements of knowledge, we ſhall hereby obtain tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Notions of GOD than we were capable of before, which is of very great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſince the want of right apprehenſions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, is the general cauſe of miſtakes in Religion, and Errors in Practice; for as he is the nobleſt Object of our Underſtanding, ſo nothing is more neceſſary or of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to us as to buſy our thoughts about him. And did we rightly conſider his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we ſhou'd neither dare to forget him, nor draw near to him with unclean hands, and unholy hearts.</p>
            <p>From this ſacred Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain where the world will
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48021:66"/>
be plac'd at our feet, at ſuch a diſtance from us, that the ſteams of its corruptions ſhall not obſcure our eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight; we ſhall have a right proſpect of it, and clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that all its Allurements, all thoſe Gaities and Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which at preſent we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire ſo much, are no better than inſignificant Toys, which have no value but what our perverſe Opinion impoſes on them. Things which contribute ſo very little to our real Good, that even at <hi>preſent,</hi> which is their only ſeaſon, we may live much happier without than with them; and which are ſo far from being neceſſary to true Felicity, that they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48021:67"/>
ſhall vaniſh and be no more when that is conſummate and perfect. Many are the Topic's from whence we might declaim againſt the vanity of the world, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks Experience is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, that it ſuperſedes all the reſt, and wou'd certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reclaim us from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate love of earthly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, did we but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly hearken to it. For tell me Ladies, if your greateſt Pleaſures are not attended with a greater ſting; when you think to graſp them, do they not either vaniſh into froth, or gall your fingers? To want, or to enjoy them, is equally tormenting; the one produces in you the Pain
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48021:67"/>
of Hunger, the other of Loathing. For in reality, there is no good in them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Shadow and Appearance; if there were, you cou'd not ſo eaſily loath your old Delights, and be ſo fond of variety, what is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirable never ending in diſguſt. They are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Pleaſures but Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which you now pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, and which, through your ignorance of better Joys, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to fill their place; toll you on with fair pretences, and repay your Labour with defeated Hopes. Joys, not near ſo laſting as the ſlighteſt toy you wear; the moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious Humoriſt among you is more conſtant far than
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48021:68"/>
they. Come hither there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and take a true view of 'em, that you may no longer deceive your ſelves with that which profits not; but ſpurning away theſe empty nothings, ſecure a portion in ſuch a Bliſs as will not fail, as cannot diſappoint you! A Felicity which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on GOD only and your own Minds, is out of Fortunes reach, will place you above the Batteries of the world, above its Terrors and Allurements, and enable you at once to triumph over, and deſpiſe it. And what can be more glorious, than to have a mind unſhaken by the blandiſhments of Proſperity, or the rough ſhocks of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48021:68"/>
that paſſes thro both with the ſame indifferency and integrity, is not to be tempted by either to a mean unworthy and indecent Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
            <p>Farther yet, beſides that holy emulation which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual view of the brighteſt and moſt exemplary Lives will excite in us; we ſhall have opportunity of contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the pureſt and nobleſt Friendſhip; a Bleſſing, the purchaſe of which were rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides! For ſhe who poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a worthy Perſon, has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly obtain'd the richeſt Treaſure! a Bleſſing that Monarchs may envy, and ſhe who enjoys is happier than
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48021:69"/>
ſhe who fills a Throne! a Bleſſing, which next to the love of GOD, is the choiceſt Jewel in our Caeleſtial Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, which, were it duly practic'd, wou'd both fit us for heav'n, and bring it down into our hearts whilſt we tarry here. For Friendſhip is a Vertue which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all the reſt; none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit for this, who is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with every other Vertue. Probably one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable cauſe of the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the preſent Age, is the little true Friendſhip that is to be found in it; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will rather ſay, that this is the effect of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The cauſe and the effect are indeed reciprocal;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48021:69"/>
for were the world better, there wou'd be more Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and were there more Friendſhip we ſhou'd have a better world. But becauſe <hi>Iniquity abounds,</hi> therefore the <hi>love of many</hi> is not only <hi>wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en cold,</hi> but quite benum'd and periſh'd. But if we have ſuch narrow hearts, be ſo full of miſtaken Self-love, ſo unreaſonably fond of our ſelves, that we cannot ſpare a hearty Good-will to one or two choice Perſons, how can it ever be thought, that we ſhou'd well acquit our ſelves of that Charity which is due to all mankind? For Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is nothing elſe but Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity contracted; it is (in the words of an admired Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48021:70"/>
a kind of revenging our ſelves on the narrowneſs of our Faculties, by exemply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that extraordinary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity on one or two, which we are willing, but not able to exerciſe towards all. And therefore 'tis without doubt, the beſt Inſtructor to teach us our duty to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and a moſt excellent Monitor to excite us to make payment as far as our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will reach. It has a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial force to dilate our hearts, to deliver them from that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſelfiſhneſs and the reſt of thoſe <hi>ſordid paſſions,</hi> which expreſs a narrow illiberal temper, and are of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious conſequence to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. That inſtitution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48021:70"/>
muſt needs be highly beneficial, which both diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us to be friends our ſelves, and helps to find them. But by Friendſhip I do not mean any thing like thoſe intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that are about in the world, which are often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations in evil, and at beſt but inſignificant dearneſſes; as little reſembling true Friendſhip, as Modern Practice does Primitive Chriſtianity. But I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by it the greateſt uſefulneſs, the moſt refin'd and diſintereſs'd Benevolence, a love that thinks nothing within the bounds of Power and Duty, too much to do or ſuffer for its Beloved: And makes no diſtinction
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48021:71"/>
betwixt its Friend and its ſelf, except that in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals it prefers her intereſt. But tho it be very deſirable to obtain ſuch a Treaſure, ſuch a Medicine of Life, (as the wiſe man ſpeaks) yet the danger is great, leaſt being deceiv'd in our choice, we ſuck in Poyſon where we expected Health. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how apt we are to diſguiſe our ſelves, how hard it is to know our own hearts, much leſs anothers, it is not adviſable to be too haſty in contracting ſo important a Relation; before that be done, it were well if we could look into the very Soul of the beloved Perſon, to diſcover what reſemblance
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48021:71"/>
it bears to our own, and in this Society we ſhall have the beſt opportunities of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. There are no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts here to ſerve, no contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances for another to be a ſtale to; the Souls of all the Religious will be open and free, and thoſe particular Friendſhips muſt be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the general Amity. But yet, as in Heav'n, that region of perfect Love, the happy Souls (as ſome are of opinion) now and then ſtep aſide from more general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, to entertain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a peculiar friend; ſo, in this little emblem of this bleſſed place, what ſhoud hinder, but that two Perſons of a ſympathizing diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48021:72"/>
the <hi>make</hi> and <hi>frame</hi> of whoſe Souls bears an exact conformity to each other, and therefore one wou'd think, were purpoſely deſign'd by Heaven to unite and mix; what ſhou'd hinder them from entring into an holy combination to watch over each other for Good, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, encourage and direct, and to obſerve the minuteſt fault in order to its amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The trueſt effect of love being to endeavour the bettering the beloved Perſon. And therefore nothing is more likely to improve us in Vertue, and advance us to the very higheſt pitch of Goodneſs, than unfeigned Friendſhip, which is the moſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48021:72"/>
beneficial, as well as the moſt pleaſant thing in the world.</p>
            <p>But to haſten; ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution will much confirm us in Vertue, and help us to perſevere to the end, and by that ſubſtantial Piety and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Knowledge, we ſhall here acquire, fit us to propagate it when we return into the World. An habitual Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Piety for ſome years will ſo root and eſtabliſh us in it, that Religion will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſecond Nature, and we muſt do ſtrange violences to our ſelves, if after that we dare venture to oppoſe it. For beſides all the other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that Vertue has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Vice, this will diſarm it of <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> the only thing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48021:73"/>
that recommends it, bravely win its ſtrongeſt Fort, and turn its own Cannon againſt it ſelf. How almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wou'd it be for her to ſin, whoſe Underſtanding being clearly illuminated with the knowledge of the Truth, is too wiſe to be impos'd on by thoſe falſe <hi>repreſentations</hi> that ſin wou'd deceive it with; whoſe will has found out and united it ſelf to its true <hi>Centie;</hi> and having been long habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to move in a <hi>right</hi> line, has no temptation to decline to an <hi>Oblique.</hi> Whoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have daily regaled on thoſe delicious Fruits of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, which Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them with, and are therefore too ſublime and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48021:73"/>
to reliſh the muddy Pleaſures of ſenſual Delights. It muſt certainly be a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle if ſuch an one relinquiſh her Glory and Joy; ſhe muſt be as bad as <hi>Lucifer</hi> himſelf who after ſuch Enjoyments can forſake her Heaven. 'Tis too unreaſonable to imagine ſuch an Apoſtacy, the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is monſtrous, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may conclude will never, or very rarely happen. And then what a bleſſed world ſhou'd we have, ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſo many ſtars of Vertue! Who, not content to be happy themſelves, for that's a narrowneſs of mind too much beneath their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like temper, would like the glorious Lights of Heav'n, or
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48021:74"/>
rather like him who made them, diffuſe their benign Influences round about. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gain'd an entrance into Paradiſe themſelves, they wou'd both ſhew the way and invite all others to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their felicity. Inſtead of that froth and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that Cenſure and Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticalneſs, with which Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine Converſations ſo much abound, we ſhould hear their tongues employ'd in making Proſelytes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in running down Vice, in eſtabliſhing Vertue, and proclaiming their Makers Glory. 'Twou'd be more genteel to give and take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions about the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Mind, than to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48021:74"/>
enquire after the Mode; and a Lecture on the Faſhions wou'd become as diſagreeable as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any ſerious diſcourſe is. Not the Follies of the Town, but the Beauties and the Love of JESUS wou'd be the moſt polite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Entertainment. 'Twould be thought as rude and barbarous to ſend our Viſitors away unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, as our fooliſhneſs at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reckons it to introduce a pertinent and uſeful Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Ladies of Quality wou'd be able to diſtinguiſh themſelves from their Inferiors by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings they communicated, and the good they did. For this is their grand Prerogative, their <hi>diſtinguiſhing Character,</hi> that they are plac'd in a condition which makes that which is every ones chief buſineſs, to be their only employ. They have nothing to do but to glorify GOD, and to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48021:75"/>
benefit their Neighbours, and ſhe who does not thus improve her Talent, is more vile and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable than the meaneſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture about her.</p>
            <p>And if after ſo many ſpiritual Advantages, it be convenient to mention Temporals, here Heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes and Perſons of Fortune may be kept ſecure, from the rude at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of deſigning Men; And ſhe who has more Mony than Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, need not curſe her Stars, for being expos'd a prey to bold importunate and rapacious Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. She will not here be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled and impos'd on, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be bought nor ſold, nor be forc'd to marry for her own quiet, when ſhe has no inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, but what the being tir'd out with a reſtleſs importunity occaſions. Or if ſhe be diſpos'd to marry, here ſhe may remain in ſafety till a convenient Match
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48021:75"/>
be offer'd by her Friends, and be freed from the danger of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable one. Modeſty requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that a Woman ſhould not love before Marriage, but only make choice of one whom ſhe can love hereafter: She who has none but innocent affections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily able to fix them where Duty requires.</p>
            <p>And tho at firſt I propos'd to my ſelf to ſpeak nothing in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of the employment of the Religious, yet to give a Specimen how uſeful they will be to the World, I am now inclin'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that it is deſign'd a part of their buſineſs ſhall be to give the beſt Education to the Children of Perſons of Quality, who ſhall be attended and inſtructed in leſſer matters by meaner perſons deputed to that Office, but the forming of their minds ſhall be the particular care of thoſe of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48021:76"/>
their own Rank; who cannot have a more pleaſant and uſeful employment than to exerciſe and encreaſe their own knowledge, by inſtilling it into theſe young ones, who are moſt like to profit under ſuch Tutors. For how can their little Pupils forbear to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit them, ſince they do not decry the World (as others may be thought to do) becauſe they cou'd not enjoy it; but when they had it in their power, were courted and careſs'd by it, for very good Reaſons, and on mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, thought fit to relinquiſh and deſpiſe its offers for a better choice? Nor are mercenary peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on other accounts capable of doing ſo much good to young Perſons, becauſe, having often but ſhort views of things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſordid and low Spirits, they are not like to form a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temper in the minds of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48021:76"/>
Educated. Doubtleſs 'twas well conſider'd of him, who wou'd not truſt the breeding of his Son to a Slave, becauſe nothing great or excellent could be expected from a perſon of that condition.</p>
            <p>And when by the increaſe of their Revenue, the Religious are enabled to do ſuch a work of Charity, the Education they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to beſtow on the Daughters of Gentlemen who are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to decay, will be no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage to the Nation. For hereby many Souls will be preſerv'd from great Diſhonours, and put in a comfortable way of ſubſiſting, being either receiv'd into the Houſe, if they incline to it, or otherwiſe diſpos'd of. It being ſuppos'd that prudent men will reckon the endowments they here acquire a ſufficient <hi>Dowry;</hi> and that a diſereet and vertuous Gentlewoman will make a better
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48021:77"/>
Wife than ſhe whoſe mind is empty, tho her Purſe be full.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, May not peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be good without this confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? may they not live at large in the world, and yet ſerve GOD as acceptably as here? 'tis allow'd they may; truly wiſe and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls will do it by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of GODS Grace, in deſpite of all temptations; and I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh, that all Women were of this temper. But it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, that there are <hi>tender</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, who need to be ſcreened from the ill Airs of the world: Many perſons who had <hi>begun</hi> well might have gone to the Grave in peace and innocence, had it not been their misfortune to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently tempted. For thoſe who have honeſt Hearts have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſtrongeſt Heads; and ſometimes the enticements of the world, and the ſubtil inſinuations
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48021:77"/>
of ſuch as lye in wait to deceive, may make their Heads giddy, ſtagger their Reſolutions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow all the fine hopes of a promiſing beginning. 'Tis fit therefore, ſuch tender <hi>Cyons</hi> ſhou'd be tranſplanted, that they may be ſupported by the prop of Vertuous Friendſhip, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in Goodneſs by holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which alas! they will not often meet with in the world. And, ſuch is the weakneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, that bad people are not ſo apt to be better'd by the Society of the Good, as the Good are to be corrupted by theirs. Since therefore we daily pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt temptation, it cannot be amiſs if we take all prudent care to avoid it, and not out of a vain preſumption face the danger, which GOD may juſtly permit to overcome us for a due correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Pride. It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible

for a man to live in an infected Houſe or Town, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape with Life and Health; yet if he have a place in the Country to retire to, he will not make ſlight of that advantage; and ſurely the Health of our Souls is of greater conſideration than the health of our Bodies. Beſides, ſhe has need of an eſtabliſh'd Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and conſummated Prudence, who ſo well underſtands the great end ſhe was ſent into the world about, and ſo faithfully purſues it, that not content to be wiſe and good her ſelf alone, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to propagate Wiſdom and Piety to all about her. But neither this Prudence nor heroic Goodneſs are eaſily attainable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the noiſe and hurry of the world, we muſt therefore retire a while from its clamour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, if we generouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to do it good; and having
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48021:78"/>
calmly and ſedately obſerv'd and rectify'd what is amiſs in our ſelves, we ſhall be fitter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a Reformation in others. A devout Retirement will not only ſtrengthen and confirm our Souls, that they be not inſected by the worlds Corruptions, but likewiſe ſo purity and reſite them, that they will become An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes to expel the Poyſon in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſpread a ſalutary Air round about them.</p>
            <p>If any object againſt a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Education, that it will make Women vain and aſſuming, and inſtead of correcting, encreaſe their Pride: I grant, that a ſmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in Learning may; for it has this effect on the Men, none ſo Dogmatical, and ſo forward to ſhew their Parts as your little <hi>Pretenders</hi> to Science. But I wou'd not have the Ladies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with the <hi>ſhew,</hi> my
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48021:79"/>
deſire is, that they ſhou'd not reſt till they obtain the <hi>Subſtance.</hi> And then ſhe who is moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will be forward to own with the wiſe <hi>Socrates,</hi> that ſhe knows nothing: nothing that is matter of Pride and Oſtentation; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is attended with ſo much ignorance and imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it cannot reaſonably elate and puff her up. The more ſhe knows, ſhe will be the leſs ſubject to talkativeneſs and its ſiſter Vices, becauſe ſhe diſcerns, that the moſt difficult piece of Learning is, to know when to uſe and when to hold ones Tongue, and never to ſpeak but to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But the men if they rightly underſtand their own intereſt, have no reaſon to oppoſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Education of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſince 'twou'd go a great way towards reclaming the men; great
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48021:79"/>
is the influence we have over them in their Childhood, in which time, if a Mother be diſcreet and knowing as well as devout, ſhe has many opportunities of giving ſuch a <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Seaſon</hi> to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mind of the Child, as will ſhew its good effects thro' all the ſtages of his Life. But tho' you ſhould not allow her capable of doing <hi>good,</hi> 'tis certain, ſhe may do <hi>hurt:</hi> If ſhe do not <hi>make</hi> the Child, ſhe has power to <hi>marr</hi> him, by ſuffering her fondneſs to get the better of diſcreet affection. But beſides this, a good and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Wife, wou'd wonderfully work on an ill man; he muſt be a Brute indeed, who cou'd hold out againſt all thoſe innocent Arts, thoſe gentle perſuaſives, and obliging methods ſhe wou'd uſe to reclaim him. Piety is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten offenſive, when it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with indiſcretion: but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48021:80"/>
ſhe who is as Wiſe as Good, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſles ſuch Charms as can hardly fail of prevailing. Doubtleſs, her Husband is a much happier Man, and more likely to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all his ill Courſes, than he who has none to come home to, but an ignorant, froward and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick Creature. An ingenious Converſation will make his life comfortable, and he who can be ſo well entertain'd at home, needs not run into Temptations in ſearch of Diverſions abroad. The only danger is, that the Wife be more knowing than the Husband; but if ſhe be, 'tis his own fault, ſince he wants no opportunities of improvement; unleſs he be a natural <hi>Blockhead,</hi> and then ſuch an one will need a wiſe Woman to govern him, whoſe prudence will conceal it from publick Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and at once both co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ſupply his defects. Give
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48021:80"/>
me leave therefore to hope, that no Gentleman who has honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſigns, will henceforward decry Knowledge and Ingenuity in her he wou'd pretend to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Or if he does, it may ſerve for a Teſt to diſtinguiſh the feigned and unworthy from the real Lover.</p>
            <p>Now, who that has a Spark of of Piety, will go about to oppoſe ſo Religious a deſign? What ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Spirit that has a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the good of Mankind, will not be forward to advance and perfect it? Who will think 500 pounds too much to lay out for the purchaſe of ſo much Wiſdom and Happineſs? Certainly, we ſhou'd not think them too dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid for by a much greater Sum, did not our pitiful and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Spirits ſet a much higher va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue on Money than it deſerves. But granting ſo much of that dear
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48021:81"/>
Idol is given away, a perſon thus bred, will eaſily make it up by her Frugality and other Vertues: if ſhe bring leſs, ſhe will not waſte ſo much, as others do in ſuperfluous and vain Expences. Nor can I think of any expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſo uſeful as this to Perſons of Quality, who are over-ſtock'd with Children; for thus they may honourably diſpoſe of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impairing their Eſtates. Five or ſix hundred pounds may be eaſily ſpar'd with a Daughter, when ſo many thouſand would go deep; and yet as the world goes be a very inconſiderable Fortune for Ladies of their Birth; neither maintain them in that <hi>Port</hi> which Cuſtom makes almoſt neceſſary, nor procure them an equal Match; thoſe of their own Rank (contrary to the generous cuſtom of the <hi>Germans)</hi> chuſing rather to fill their Coffers than
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48021:81"/>
to preſerve the purity of their Blood, and therefore think a weighty Bag the beſt Gentility, preferring a wealthy Upſtart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt Deſcended and beſt Qualifyed Lady: Their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies perhaps having made it neceſſary, that they may keep up an empty ſhadow of Greatneſs, which is all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to ſhew what their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors have been.</p>
            <p>Does any think their money loſt to their Families, when 'tis put in here? I will only ask what courſe they can take to ſave it, and at once to preſerve their Money, their Honour and their Daughters too? Were they ſure the Ladies wou'd die unmarried, I ſhou'd commend their Thrift; but Experience has too often ſhewn us the vanity of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. For the poor Lady having paſt the prime of her
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48021:82"/>
years in Gaity and Company, in running the Circle of all the Vanities of the Town, having ſpread all her Nets and us'd all her Arts for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and finding that the Bait fails where ſhe wou'd have it take, and having all this while been ſo over-careful of her Body, that ſhe had no time to improve her mind, which therefore affords her no ſafe retreat now ſhe meets with Diſappointments abroad, and growing every day more and more ſenſible that the reſpect which us'd to be paid her, decays as faſt as her Beauty; quite ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the dreadful name of <hi>Old Maid,</hi> which yet none but Fools will reproach her with, nor any wiſe Woman be afraid of; to avoid this terrible <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> and the ſcoffs that are thrown on ſuperannuated Virgins, ſhe f<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48021:82"/>
as her laſt, tho much miſtaken Refuge, to the diſgrace of her Family, and her own irreparable Ruin. And now let any perſon of Honour tell me, if it were not richly worth ſome thouſand Pounds, to prevent all this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſchief, and the having an idle Fellow, and perhaps a race of beggarly Children to hang on him, and to provide for?</p>
            <p>Cou'd I think of any other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I wou'd conſider it; theres nothing indeed which witty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may not argue <hi>for</hi> &amp; <hi>againſt,</hi> but they who duly weigh the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on both ſides, unleſs they be extreamly prejudiced, will caſily diſcern the great uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this Inſtitution. The <hi>Beaux</hi> perhaps, and topping Sparks of the Town, will ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule and laugh at it. For Vertue her ſelf as bright as ſhe is, can't eſcape the laſh of ſcurrilous
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48021:83"/>
Tongues; the comfort is, whilſt they impotently endeavour to throw dirt on her, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſoil her Beauty, and only render themſelves the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. They may therefore if they pleaſe, hug themſelves in their own dear folly, and enjoy the diverſion of their own inſipid Jeſts. She has but little Wiſdom and leſs Vertue, who is to be frighted from what ſhe judges reaſonable by the ſcoffs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant noiſes of ludicrous Wits, and pert Buffoons. And no <hi>wonder</hi> that ſuch as they, (who have nothing to ſhew for their pretences to Wit, but ſome ſcraps of Plays, and bluſtring Non-ſence; who fancy a well adjuſted Peruke is able to ſupply their want of Brains, and that to talk <hi>much</hi> is a ſign of Ingenuity, tho't be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little to the purpoſe,) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt our Propoſal; 'twou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

indeed ſpoil the Trade of the gay fluttering Fops, who wou'd be at a loſs, had they no body as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent as themſelves to talk with. The Criticiſm of their Dreſs wou'd be uſeleſs, and the labour of their <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> loſt, unleſs they cou'd peaceably lay aſide their Rivalling, and one Aſs be content to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and admire another. For the Ladies wou'd have more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment than to eſteem a Man for ſuch Follies as ſhou'd rather incline them to ſcorn and deſpiſe him. They wou'd never be ſo ſottiſh as to imagine, that he who regards nothing but his own bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Appetite, ſhou'd have any real affection for them, nor ever expect Fidelity from one who is unfaithful to GOD and his own Soul. They wou'd not be ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as to ſuppoſe, that man can eſteem them who neglects his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48021:84"/>
Maker; for what are all thoſe fine Idolatries, by which he wou'd recommend himſelf to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Goddeſs; but mockery and deluſion from him who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets and affronts the true Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? They wou'd not value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on account of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſuch incompetent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, nor conſequently make uſe of thoſe little trifling Arts that are neceſſary to recommend them to ſuch Admirers: Neither wou'd they give opportunity to profeſs themſelves their Slaves ſo long, till at laſt they become their Maſters.</p>
            <p>What now remains, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to Practice that which tends ſo very much to our advantage. Is Charity ſo dead in the world that none will contribute to the ſaving their own and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Souls? Shall we freely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our Money to purchaſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48021:84"/>
and often times both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future Ruin, and find none for ſuch an eminent good Work, which will make the Ages to come ariſe and call us Bleſſed? I wou'd fain perſuade my ſelf better things, and that I ſhall one day ſee this <hi>Religious Retirement</hi> happily ſetled, and its great deſigns wiſely and vigorouſly purſu'd; and methinks I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a Viſion of that luſtre and glory our Ladies caſt round about them! Let me therefore intreat the reſt of our Sex, who tho at liberty in the world, are the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Slaves of their own vile affections; let me entreat them to lay aſide their Prejudices, and whatever borders on Envy and Malice, and with impartial eyes to behold the Beauties of our <hi>Religious.</hi> The native innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and unaffectedneſs of whoſe Charms, and the unblameable
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48021:85"/>
Integrity of their Lives, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly more taking than all the curious Artifices and ſtudied Arts the other can invent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them, even bad men themſelves being Judges, who often betray a ſecret Veneration for that vertue they wou'd ſeem to deſpiſe and endeavour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. As there is not any thing, no not the leaſt ſhadow of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to recommend vice, but its faſhionableneſs, and the being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to it; ſo there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all forbidding in vertue but her uncouthneſs. Acquaint your ſelves with her a little, and you'l wonder how you cou'd be ſo fooliſh as to delight in any thing beſides! For you'l find her Converſation moſt ſweet and obliging; her Precepts moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and beneficial; her very tasks Joys, and her Injunctions the higheſt Pleaſures. She will not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48021:85"/>
rob you of any innocent delight, not engage you to any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath your Birth and Breeding: But will put a new and more grateful reliſh into all your Enjoyments, and make them more delicious with her Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs She'll preſerve and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your Honour, by allying you to the King of Heaven; ſecure your Grandeur by fixing it on a firm bottom, ſuch as the caprice of Fortune cannot ſhake or overthrow; ſhe'll enlarge your ſouls, raiſe them above the common level, and encourage that allowable Pride of Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do a baſe unworthy action. Make you truly amiable in the eyes of GOD and Man, preſerve even the Beauty of your Bodies as long as 'tis poſſible for ſuch a brittle thing to laſt; and when it muſt of neceſſity decay, impreſs ſuch a lovelineſs on your Minds,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48021:86"/>
as will ſhine thro' and brighten your very Countenances; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching you with ſuch a ſtock of Charms, that Time which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours every other thing, ſhall never be able to decay. In a word, 'tis Vertue only which can make you truly happy in this world as well as in the next.</p>
            <p>There is a ſort of Bravery and Greatneſs of Soul, which does more truly ennoble us than the higheſt Title, and it conſiſts in the living up to the dignity of our Natures, ſcorning to do a mean unbecoming thing; in paſſing differently thro' Good and Evil Fortune, without being corrupted by the one or depreſt by the other. For ſhe that can do ſo, gives evidence that her Happineſs depends not on ſo mutable a thing as this world; but, in a due ſubſerviency to the Almighty, is bottom'd only on
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48021:86"/>
her own great Mind. This is the richeſt Ornament, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a Woman glorious in the loweſt Fortune: So ſhining is real worth, that like a Diamond it loſes not its luſtre, tho caſt on a Dunghill. Whereas, ſhe who is advanc'd to ſome eminent Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wants this natural and ſolid Greatneſs, is no better than Fortunes <hi>May-game,</hi> rendered more conſpicuous, that ſhe may appear the more contemptible. Let thoſe therefore who value themſelves only on external Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, conſider how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they are to decay, and how ſoon they may be depriv'd of them, and that ſuppoſing they ſhou'd continue, they are but ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Foundations to build Eſteem upon. What a diſappointment will it be to a Ladies Admirer as well as to her ſelf, that her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſhou'd loſe and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48021:87"/>
the Victory her eyes had gain'd! For when the Paſſion of a Lover is evaporated into the cool temper of a Husband, and a frequent review has leſſen'd the wonder which her Charms at firſt had rais'd, ſhe'll retain no more than ſuch a formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as decency and good breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will require, and perhaps hardly that; but unleſs he be a very good Man (and indeed the world is not over full of 'em) her worthleſneſs has made a forfeit of his Affections, which are ſeldom fixt by any other thing than Veneration and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem. Whereas, a wiſe and good Woman is uſeful and valuable in all Ages and Conditions; ſhe who chiefly attends the <hi>one thing needful,</hi> the <hi>good part which ſhall not be taken from her,</hi> lives a cheerful and pleaſant Life, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ſedate, calm and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quile,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48021:87"/>
and makes a glorious Exit; being tranſlated from the moſt happy life on Earth, to unſpeakable happineſs in heaven; a freſh and fragrant Name, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming her Duſt, and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Perfume to ſucceeding Ages. Whilſt the Fools, and the worſt ſort of them the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>live</hi> as well as <hi>die</hi> in Miſery, go out in a ſnuff, leaving nothing but ſtench and putrefaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them.</p>
            <p>To cloſe all, if this <hi>Propoſal</hi> which is but a rough draught and rude Eſſay, and which might be made much more beautiful by a better Pen, give occaſion to wiſer heads to improve and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, I have my end. For im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect as it is, it ſeems ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that ſhe who drew the Scheme is full of hopes, it will not want kind hands to perform and compleat it. But if it miſs
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48021:88"/>
of that, it is but a few hours thrown away, and a little la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain, which yet will not be loſt, if what is here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd may ſerve to expreſs her hearty Good-will, and how much ſhe deſires your Improvement, who is</p>
