            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>GALAT. VI. 7.</bibl>
               <q>Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>EN that have lived a great while under the Power of their Paſſions, find nothing harder than to ſubdue them, and bring them under the command of their Reaſon; and they who have given themſelves up to obey the Luſts of the Fleſh, meet with nothing more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, than to reſtore the Spirit to its juſt Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to govern their Actions by a Principle of Divine Life.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that we may obſerve men in all times to make objections againſt the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Godlineſs and Virtue, and to invent other ways than thoſe preſcribed in the Goſpel, of going to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100077:4"/>
Some impoſe a perſuaſion on themſelves, That they ſhall find God merciful when they come to die, tho now they neither do what he commands, nor forbear what he forbids, nor uſe any means to pleaſe him; ſo that if any Conſideration about their Behaviour be needful, or any pains are to be taken, to ſpeed well in another world, they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will be loſt.</p>
            <p>Some hope to have God's Pardon of their great and many Sins, by an outward ſhew only of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; they at fixt times appear in his Houſe, they hear Sermons, now and then receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, exactly obſerve the Rites and Ceremonies ordered in the Publick Worſhip, and repeat the Prayers with the reſt of the Congregation; but with theſe things their hearts are not at all affected, as they certainly would be, if it was their chief deſign in performing their Devotions, to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>Others preſume God may be reconciled by a Scheme of ſound Principles which they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd in matters of Chriſtianity, and by their Orthodox Faith, notwithſtanding their Lives are as bad as any of thoſe whoſe Principles are falſe and dangerous, and who hold many Errors touching the Faith. Again; Others expect to come off well in the next Life, not from any Contemplation either of the Soundneſs of their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100077:4"/>
Faith, or the Holineſs of their Lives; but from their being Members of ſuch a Church, or from their being incorporated into ſuch a Sect, or join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a Party.</p>
            <p>But if we look into the Scriptures, it will there be evident, that men have not the leaſt Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to hope for Mercy from God, upon any of theſe Pretences; and that it is the main Scope of thoſe Holy Writings, to oblige them to lead a Godly Life, and not ſo much as to think of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs upon other terms: <hi>Be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, God is not mocked,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Every obſtinate Sinner then, who preſumes upon the Mercy of God for a Pardon, does but delude himſelf with a groundleſs Perſuaſion, and mocks his Maker, who will judge and condemn him; <hi>For he that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then it is manifeſt, That mens Rewards and Puniſhments hereafter, ſhall be exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature and kind of their works in this life, let us enquire by what deceitful methods and arts they impoſe upon themſelves, and in a ſort, quiet their minds, about the ſafety of their future condition, notwithſtanding they abide in their Iniquities, and are lovers of Pleaſure, more than lovers of God. It will not be difficult to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100077:5"/>
diſcover that they wrong their poor Souls with ſuch Devices and Arrifices as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If men by the diſpoſition of their Nature, or the way of their Education, or the Poſt they hold in the World, do happen to have an averſeneſs to ſome crying ſins, which may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the Places where they live, they take this averſion of theirs to be a ſign of their being good; and it makes them overlook their heinous Crimes of another kind; or to be but ſlightly concern'd for them.</p>
            <p>The Prodigal Perſon believes all will go well with him, ſo long as he is free from the great ſin of Covetouſneſs, which is the root of all evil: and he that greedily thirſts after, and hunts for Riches, hath as favourable an opinion of the condition of his own Soul; ſince he can never be charged with the ſcandalous faults of Riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Luxury, whereby men ſo cripple them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as not to be able to provide for their own Families, and ſo become worſe than Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels: And after this faſhion, men, by thinking only of the Crimes they do not commit, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reflect upon thoſe of which they are deeply guilty.</p>
            <p>Thus alſo when men have done ſome few good actions, ſuch as their Religion requires, and God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100077:5"/>
will approve; they are always taken up with meditations upon them, and do pore on them ſo continually, as hardly to think or ſpeak of any thing elſe. Whereby a number of great ſins lye cover'd in their hearts; wherefrom they receive no diſturbance, as not having the leaſt remorſe or ſorrow for them, or taking the leaſt care to forſake them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When men obſerve there are naughtier peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than themſelves in the World, they are apt from thence to draw a kind concluſion in behalf of their own caſe, and that all will be right with them; and that God in the other World will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to his Mercies; inſomuch as all the proof they have for their own virtue and God's favour is, that they have ſome neighbours worſe than themſelves.</p>
            <p>They are no drunkards, they are no extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they are no whoremongers, they do not blaſpheme God and ridicule Religion, as many do, and therefore it is concluded clearly, That they are truly righteous and honeſt men, and by this means they ſpend ſo much time in expoſing other mens vices, as quite to forget their own.</p>
            <p>As if it was an infallible mark of ſincere Piety, not to be altogether ſo bad as the moſt infamous are: And yet theſe unhapyy men, who by uſing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100077:6"/>
a fallacious rule, judge of themſelves with ſo much advantage, may live in the guilt of ſeveral great ſins, which are not, perhaps, ſo notorious and apparent to the eyes of men; and may to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally omit prayers to God in ſecret; may ſeldom come to his Houſe, and rarely receive the Holy Sacrament; may improve none of their Maſter's Talents; neither feed the hungry; nor clothe the naked; nor Comfort the Sick; nor ſupport the feeble; nor laſtly, have any due regard to preſerve humility, meekneſs, charity, patience, purity, in their own hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Men are accuſtom'd to ſilence their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences, by giving wrong names to their Vices, and by repreſenting only the light and beſt ſide of their ſins to the mind; whereby that which being conſidered in all its ugly circumſtances, and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful retinue of Conſequences, would look vile and odious, doth appear comely and deſirable.</p>
            <p>So a gratification of the moſt beaſtly Luſts, is accounted rational and manly Pleaſure; Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs goes for a free uſe of God's Creatures; Whoredom is but a juſt ſatisfaction of the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of Nature; the ſqueezing a poor man, when got within our clutches, till we break him and his Fortunes to pieces, is but to maintain our own rights, and to preſerve our Children and Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from beggary; for the ſlighteſt Provocation,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100077:6"/>
coolly to ſpill the Blood of our Brother, is to behave our ſelves like Men of Honour, and to keep our Perſons from falling into Contempt, and being trampled upon.</p>
            <p>Thus thoſe things, which are in themſelves moſt loathſome and deteſtable, neither conſiſtent with true Peace of Conſcience, nor the Favour of God, paſs for Inſtances of the higheſt wiſdom and honour, and are reputed actions moſt worthy of men. And a little preſent gain, empty ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or ſenſual pleaſure, which dies as ſoon as it is taſted, muſt be preferr'd before everlaſting happineſs, and the fruition of the Almighty and Infinitely Glorious God, to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>O that thoſe ſordid and mean ſenſualities, which ſink us into a level with the brutes, ſhould be the things upon which we have ſet our hearts, and unto which we make all our Courtſhip and Addreſs! O that we ſhould be in love with thoſe fetters, with which we are drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto the gates of death, and be ſo ſottiſh as to admire the chains, that confine us to the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of darkneſs, and will hold us faſt till the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble day of Judgment, as the marks of our honour, and as the true accompliſhments of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Men make themſelves a little eaſie in an ill courſe of life, by hearing endleſs Rewards and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100077:7"/>
Puniſhments often ſpoke of, without applying them to their own condition: They can hear Heaven diſcourſed of, as a State of infinite Peace and Delight, without being much moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and they can hear Hell repreſented as a diſmal place, void of all eaſe and comfort, and be but little troubled at it; and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe things paſs thorough their ears like Romances, in which they do not imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be concern'd.</p>
            <p>For when a man ſhall hear a lively deſcription of the Joys of Heaven, will not his heart be tranſported, and even lifted up within him, if he have ſo loved and obeyed God, in the ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his life, as to hope he has ſure ground to claim a right in them? And when likewiſe the Terrors of the Lord are Preached unto the wicked, and diſplayed in their true colours, and they are plainly inform'd how inſupportable and dreadful the condition of all thoſe will be, who ſhall be baniſhed from the Preſence of God, the Fountain of Light and Good, unto everlaſting darkneſs, certainly they muſt be filled with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and horror, if they do but reflect, that it is moſt likely that they ſhall be condemned for ever to dwell in that dark and doleful ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100077:7"/>
Therefore when ever the conſideration of our own title to that Glorious place doth enter into the meditations we have of Heaven, it will warm the heart, and enliven all our affections: And as often as the poor Sinner does entertain thoughts of Hell with reſpect of the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his going thither, it will confound him, and take down all his confidence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p>For when a man once comes to reflect that the dreadful things he hears of Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do cloſely and nearly concern his moſt precious Soul, he will be ready to ſay with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</p>
            <p>O my Soul! Thou art in the Company of them that do fooliſhly, and who forget God; thy Happineſs in another World, does whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon thy behaviour in this Life; this Life is very ſhort, the buſineſs thou haſt to do therein is great; and when a period ſhall be put to thy days, is moſt uncertain; wherefore if thou ſhouldeſt be ſurpriſed by a ſudden Death, before thy Sins are broken off by ſincere Repentance, thou wouldeſt be the moſt miſerable of all creatures, and muſt as unavoidably go down into the bottomleſs Pit, there to dwell with enraged and mercileſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100077:8"/>
devils, as ever any unrelenting Sinner has done before thee.</p>
            <p>Such conſiderations as theſe, will make bad men apprehenſive of the vaſt hazard unto which they expoſe their immortal Souls, and timely to remember their Creator, leſt he tear them in pieces, and there be none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver.</p>
            <p>Thus I have diſcovered by what arts men ſpeak falſe peace unto their Souls, and ſo far delude themſelves, as to fancy they ſhall find God Merciful at the laſt, though they do not put away their Sins; and notwithſtanding they ſow to the Fleſh, to preſume they ſhall of the Spirit reap everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>But being now to take my Leave of you, and to return my Thanks for the Favours I have received from you, which as they are ſo many and ſo great, that I cannot duly here acknowledge them, without making you uneaſie, by treſpaſſing upon your Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; ſo during my whole Life, I ſhall never forget them: But by my conſtant and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prayers for your Preſent and Future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and by embracing all opportunities of doing you Real Service, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, That your Kindneſſes were not miſplaced: This being, I ſay, the laſt time I am to appear

among you in the capacity of your Miniſter, I ſhall take the liberty now with more arguments to urge the neceſſity of holy living, and more particularly to lay down ſuch directions and advice as may be of moſt general and laſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
            <p>It is a noble argument we have before us, to ſhew that the crop a man ſhall reap, will anſwer the nature and qualities of the ſeed, which he now doth ſow. Wherefore it will not be in my power to do you a greater good, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to increaſe and ſtrengthen your belief of this important truth, That they who live Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall reap corruption, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhall have all their labour periſh and come to nothing; and that they who give up themſelves to the conduct of the Holy Spirit, ſhall, through its Aſſiſtance and Interceſſion, attain Everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>That therefore you may not be ſeduced by any of the deceitful artifices and Frauds now mentioned, nor by any other wiles of Satan, to depend upon the Favour of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have parted with every known Sin, let me adviſe you to conſider:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is inconſiſtent both with God's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and your own, for you to partake of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100077:9"/>
happineſs of Heaven, before you are cleanſed from the filth of your Iniquities. Goodneſs, and Wiſdom, and Juſtice, and Truth, and Purity, are the inſeperable Attributes of the Divine Nature, which ſtand in ſuch a direct oppoſition to all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that God cannot but abhor it: Nothing being evil in its own nature, but from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeableneſs it hath to the Eſſence of God: And for this reaſon he is ſaid to be of purer eyes than to behold iniquity; <hi>i. e.</hi> with the leaſt allowance and approbation; it having ſuch a contrary ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to his Infinite Goodneſs, and Purity, and Truth, that it muſt ever be an abomination un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: And for the ſame reaſon it is affirmed, <hi>That without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> For his Juſtice, like fire, would ſwiftly iſſue forth, and devour the impure Sinner.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs then of Religion, is to reſtore the Image of God in our ſouls, which was ſullied and defaced by our ſins; for by a thorough confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Divine Precepts, we ſhall arrive at ſo happy a temper of mind, as only to deſire what is ſuitable to the will of our Father which is in Heaven, and to hate only thoſe things which he has forbidden; and when theſe holy diſpoſitions are well ſettled in our ſouls, then the Glorious Image of God will ſhine brightly upon them, and they will be as ſo many Lights, to guide
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100077:9"/>
others, who in a lower ſtation are ſtriving to come up to our example.</p>
            <p>But were we admitted into the Preſence of God, before an entire change was wrought in our minds, and all our luſts were mortified, as we ſhould be odious in the eyes of God, ſo his Holineſs and Purity would fright and amaze us, and our polluted ſouls would ſink and dye away at the appearance of ſo much Goodneſs, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Truth, and not find within themſelves the leaſt capacity to be delighted with thoſe things that are the true cauſes of all the Glory and Joy that is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The mighty deſign, I ſay, of all Religion, is, to make our Nature conformable to the Divine Nature; that is, To make us become like unto God, in all thoſe Perfections of his Nature, which can be imitated by Rational Creatures.</p>
            <p>And in nothing can we approach nearer to the Likeneſs of God, than in ſtriving to do the greateſt good we can, in every capacity, to all our Fellow-Creatures; this is a God like Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whereby we ſhall extremely reſemble our Great Maker, and become his Deputies upon Earth, and perform that very work, which otherwiſe God would have done him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100077:10"/>
When we ſhall have baniſht out of our Souls all Rancour and Malice, and Pride and Envy; when we ſhall have ſubdued all Covetous and Greedy deſires; all fleſhly and filthy appetites; all peeviſhneſs and uneaſineſs of humour; then will our Soul become a moſt fit and ſuitable place for the holy Spirit to reſide in; and our God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to dwell in us; and we ſhall have foretaſts of the Joys of Heaven, even while we remain here upon Earth.</p>
            <p>If we relieve the needy, and refreſh the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed; if we ſatisfie the doubting, confirm the wavering; conduct into the right paths thoſe that are gone aſtray; if we do no hurt to the innocent; do not cruſh the weak, nor over-reach the ignorant, but are helpful to all, as far as our power will extend: What a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deal of good ſhall we do to the World, in the place and ſtead of God? And how evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhall we make it to men, that the Divine Providence doth carefully watch over the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and hath a tender regard to all thoſe that love the Lord, by our executing and fulfilling ſo many of his Gracious and Merciful deſigns?</p>
            <p>And what unconceivable rewards ſhall they receive in the other World, who are the glorious inſtruments of God's Providence in this; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100077:10"/>
who, by their Piety, and Goodneſs, and Chariry, do help to bring about ſo many of the wiſe and kind contrivances of their Maſter, to render his poor creatures Happy!</p>
            <p>Hence it appears, that the Religion which pleaſes God, has in all times been the ſame; and the chief end of it is, to Glorify God by an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him in the whole courſe of our lives. This was the great Doctrine taught by the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs before the Law, and by the Prophets under the Law, and by our Bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles ſince. Herein the Laws of Nature, and <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and the Goſpel of Chriſt, all agree.</p>
            <p>And as they taught, ſo they lived; for the Preachers of Righteouſneſs under theſe ſeveral diſpenſations, did with the moſt unfeigned love and deepeſt reverence conſtantly Worſhip God; they carried themſelves with punctual Juſtice, and great Compaſſion towards their brethren; they were peaceable and meek, and pure, and full of Pity in their converſation: The ſum of all their Doctrines, and the deſign of all their lives, being to do juſtice and love meroy, and walk humbly with their God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Nature of God and our ſelves, ſo likewiſe all the Declarations, Precepts, Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100077:11"/>
and Threatnings, publiſh'd in the Scripture, do make it moſt manifeſt, that we muſt ſow to the Spirit, if we hope of the Spirit to Reap Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. If we read thoſe Holy Records from one end to the other, we ſhall not meet with ſo much as one declaration of God made in favour of obdurate Sinners, who are resolv'd not to turn from the wickedneſs they have committed, and to do that which is lawful and right: But every where we may obſerve his Averſion to the ungodly, and that their works are loathſome in his ſight.</p>
            <p>God has prononnced that theſe men ſhall have no lot or ſhare in his Kingdom; <hi>Know ye not, that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God? be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. Although the Supreme Powers ſhould allow the commiſſion of any of theſe vile ſins in their own Countrey, and enact no Laws for the Puniſhment of the perſons who were guilty of them; and though falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would undertake to perſwade you, that you might do ſuch things without losing the Love of God; yet your poor ſouls would be wretchedly deceiv'd, if you did practice theſe great Sins upon the Authority of your
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100077:11"/>
Teachers; or becauſe they were not puniſht by the Laws of the Place where you liv'd: For how favourably ſoever ſome may think and ſpeak of them; and how ſlightly ſoever others may correct Fornicators, Idolaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet God the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judg of the whole World, does hate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt theſe Crimes, which will extinguiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the right they had to inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Glory: <hi>For becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> Eph. 5. 6. And certainly words can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be found, which more clearly and diſtinctly expreſs God's abhorrence of Men, while they abide in an impenitent State, than theſe.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if you take a ſurvey of the Divine Precepts, you may perceive that they all have a tendency to eſtabliſh an univerſal Holineſs in our Minds and Practice: nothing leſs than a total change in our Souls will prepare us for Heaven: <hi>We muſt put on the new man, which after God is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 24.</note> 
               <hi>in righteouſneſs and true holineſs; We muſt deny</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and live ſoberly and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly and godly in this preſent world.</hi> For without theſe Heavenly and Divine Qualifications of Mind, we ſhall never be permitted to behold the pure and glorious Face of God; and if we were, it would confound us, and make us miſerable. Let then Evil Rulers connive at thoſe Vices which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100077:12"/>
do not ſeem ſo directly to hazard and undermine their Government; Let the prophane cry up their brutiſh Senſualities, as the moſt exalted Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Human Nature; let the frequency of ſome Sins leſſen their uglineſs, and the ſenſe of their danger, with unthinking Men, yet the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Effects of their Wickedneſs ſhall overtake them at the laſt, and they ſhall find every wilful Sin to have Malignity enough in its Nature to ruin them; for the great God does behold all their Lewdneſſes and Villanies; he cauſes them all to be recorded againſt the day of Accounts, and they will ſink away with extremiry of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, when oppreſſed with ſuch a vaſt burden of abominable Iniquities they ſhall be hailed to the Bar of Judgment. <hi>For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings; his own Iniquities ſhall take the wicked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he ſhall be holden with the Cords of his Sins; he ſhall die without inſtruction, and in the greatneſs of his folly ſhall he go aſtray,</hi> Prov. 5. 21.—3.</p>
            <p>Moreover if you conſider the Precepts of our Bleſſed Saviour, you will be fully ſatisfi'd, that they were all levell'd at this ſingle Mark, to make Men Holy; that is, to confer the greateſt Benefit upon them they were capable to receive: For this was to render them acceptable to God; to make them agreeable Company for Angels;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100077:12"/>
and compleatly to qualifie them to be Citizens of the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this one Point did all the Promiſes of the Goſpel, and the whole deſign of the Life of Chriſt center and ſettle; there is not a Promiſe made to the Malicious or the Unclean, or the Revengeful, or the Perjur'd, or the Lovers of fleſhly Pleaſure; nor the leaſt anger of God manifeſted any where againſt the Humble and the Chaſt, and the Merciful and the Righteous Perſons; but all the Beatitudes and Bleſſings of Heaven are beſtowed upon the Godly, and all the Curſes and Puniſhments do light upon the Head of the Sinner.</p>
            <p>And ſo it is plain, that our Religion was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted and publiſhed not to repleniſh our Heads with fine Notions, nor to furniſh our Tongues with Eloquent Diſcourſe; but to fill our Hearts with Humility, Love, and Purity, and to govern our Lives and Actions by moſt Holy Rules. And therefore under the Chriſtian Diſpenſation no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will avail us, or ſtand our Immortal Souls in the leaſt ſtead, but the keeping of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God.</p>
            <p>It now only remaineth, that I preſent you with ſome Directions, that, I hope, will make a juſt Impreſſion upon your Minds, and be of durable advantage to you.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100077:13"/>
1. The firſt is, to keep conſtant and firm to the Communion of the Church in which you were Baptized and brought up; a Church whoſe Faith is founded upon the Scriptures; and whoſe Worſhip, of all others, cometh neareſt to the Pattern left us by the Primitive Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>A Church the freeſt from Error in what it Teaches; and from Superſtition in what it Practices, of any, perhaps, in the World; which as it hath reformed it ſelf from the Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that were ſo deſtructive of a good Life, ſo it hath only reteined a very few Rites and Ceremonies, for the preſervation of Order and Decency, and Reverence in the Service of God: and upon which it doth not lay ſo great weight and ſtreſs, as to hold them unalterable; but hath publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <q>That upon weighty and important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, according to the various exigency of Times and Occaſions, ſuch Changes and Alterations may be made therein, as to thoſe in Place of Authority ſhall ſeem either neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or expedient.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now to them that duly weigh things, it muſt appear very dangerous to leave the Communion of a Church ſo excellently conſtituted, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect either upon the grievous miſchiefs of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, or upon the great obligations
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100077:13"/>
Chriſt has laid upon us to preſerve the unity of the Church.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable that hardly any thing does oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion more bitterneſs and heat, than an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable departure from a Church which impoſes nothing ſinful as a term of Communion. For Separatiſts to juſtifie their departure, will be apt to charge great faults, how little ſoever deſerved, upon the Society they have left, and ſo of courſe grow more ſowr and cenſorious; whereby ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities will encreaſe, and the breach will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually widen'd by freſh provocations.</p>
            <p>Thus by theſe needleſs diviſions the charity and good will, which our bleſſed Maſter ſo ſtrictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and of which he was ſo glorious an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, does waſt and conſume away; and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians thus unjuſtifiably ſplit into Parties inſtead of mutually ſupporting one another againſt the Common Enemy, which doth thirſt after their deſtruction, do bite, tear, and devour each other; and hereby the Band of Love which ſhould hold us together, is broken, and the ſeveral Members of that Body, whereof Jeſus Chriſt is the Head, are disjoynted, and become uſeleſs to the holy and merciful purpoſes for which he did unite them.</p>
            <p>It is much to be lamented, that divers of thoſe who have forſaken our Church, and which they have not yet proved to have enjoyned any thing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100077:14"/>
unlawful, under pretence of greater edification, and of joyning in a purer Communion, have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ground had others ſeparate from them, and theſe again have left others, till at length they have been of no Communion at all; and ſo with their Church have at laſt alſo loſt their Religion.</p>
            <p>And yet nothing is of more neceſſity, than that the Unity of this Body of Chriſt, the Church, ſhould be preſerved entire. This the Chriſtians are frequently exhorted and ſtrictly commanded to keep whole with the greateſt care; and upon this union of Members mighty bleſſings are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, there being ſcarce any promiſe of our Lord made to particular Chriſtians, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their being parts of his Church.</p>
            <p>We are earneſtly required to endeavour to <hi>keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long ſuffering, forbearing one another.</hi> And the reaſon of all this is, becauſe <hi>there is one body and one ſpirit, one hope of our calling,</hi>

               <hi>name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that they all ſpeak the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100077:14"/>
ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among them; but that they be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment.</hi> He alſo preſſeth the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians to ſtand faſt in one ſpirit, with one mind, ſtriving together for the faith of the Goſpel.</hi> Nay, with the moſt powerful and melting expreſsions that can come from the mouth of a man deeply concerned for their ſalvation, he entreats them to do nothing through ſtrife, whereby the Unity of the Church may be rent. <hi>If there be therefore any</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the ſpirit, if any bowels of mercy, fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one mind.</hi> By that ſolid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort they had in being redeemed by Chriſt, by that ineffable joy which did ſpring up in their ſouls from their fellowſhip with the Holy Ghoſt; by that ſatisfaction and pleaſure which did proceed from their ſincere charity one towards another, he in the moſt importunate and affectionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth requeſt, that Peace, Unity, and Love may be upheld among them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be very careful to do all thoſe things, in which holding Communion with the Church doth conſiſt, and which will be true Teſtimonies of your adherence to it. Preſent your ſelves conſtantly to God in his own Houſe, and ſuffer nothing to divert you from the diſcharge of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100077:15"/>
thoſe Duties which you are bound to render unto the Lord upon his own day.</p>
            <p>Bear your part in the Publick Worſhip, join your Prayers with thoſe of the great Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that by their their united force, they may more powerfully prevail for the Bleſſings you moſt need; frequently receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, that Inſtitution of our Dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, contrived both to preſerve the Memory of his unſpeakable Mercies, and to confirm and encreaſe our Spiritual Strength. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confeſt and bewailed your Sins, and taken up ſtrong Reſolutions to forſake them, do not fail humbly to approch the Table of the Lord, and with the deepeſt Reverence and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to eat the Bread of Life, and drink the Cup of Salvation.</p>
            <p>And here it may be no improper Place for me earneſtly to beſeech you, never to omit ſending up your Prayers to God in ſecret, at leaſt the Morning and Evening of every day, and that not formally and coldly, but ſincerely and heartily, as Perſons thoroughly concerned to be infinitely happy in another World.</p>
            <p>For this Courſe will wonderfully keep up a vigorous ſenſe of God in your Souls; it will admirably fit you for the Publick Worſhip, and make you benefit exceedingly by all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100077:15"/>
of Divine Appointment; it will make you perform ſeveral the Inſtances of Chriſtian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with much chearfulneſs, and enable you to bear the ſharpeſt Afflictions with great Patience.</p>
            <p>And it is very obſervable that it is a great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe people, when they come to die, who, notwithſtanding their conſciences did not allow them to live in any notorious ſin, have often, upon ſlight occaſions, neglected their private prayers.</p>
            <p>How little regard ſoever they had to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Prayer in their healthful and youthful days, yet in their laſt hours they are very ſenſible of their baſe ingratitude to their kindeſt Friend and great Maſter. And the Conſideration of theſe omiſſions of Duty cauſes a terrible Conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Minds; creates many Scruples about the ſafety of their Condition, and they are moſt deſirous of opportunity and longer time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve their intolerable negligence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let it be our chief work and deſign to practice thoſe Chriſtian Graces and Vertues, which are moſt eſſential to our Holy Religion, and which will be the great Ornaments of our Lives. Let us be humble in our whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and never ſuffer Pride and Ambition to betray us into any deeds of injuſtice or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; let us be meek under the higheſt Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100077:16"/>
and break the Rage and Fury of our Adverſaries by our Lenity and the ſweetneſs of our Manners; let us be true to our Word; faithful in all Truſts; grateful for every Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ready to help all Men, ſtudying how we may compoſe the Differences, and heal the Breaches, which fill the World with Malice and Cruelty and Bloodſhed.</p>
            <p>Let us treat them gently who are not of our Opinion, putting the moſt candid interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon each others Words and Actions; let us ever be diſpoſed to forgive Injuries, and where we have ſuffer'd wrong, and have the Offender in our power, to accept of a moderate ſatisfaction. And as I exhort you to pay all Dues and juſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to your Superiors, to treat your Equals with Friendſhip and Reſpect; ſo alſo I moſt earneſtly beg, that you would never forget the Poor; but as you have opportunity do good unto all needy, diſtreſſed, and comfortleſs Creatures. <hi>Have thou patience with a man in poor eſtate, and delay not to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 29. 8.—13.</note> 
               <hi>ſhew him mercy. Help the poor for the Commandments ſake, and turn him not away becauſe of his poverty. Loſe thy money for thy brother and thy friend, and let it not ruſt under a ſtone to be loſt. Lay up thy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure according to the Commandments of the moſt high, and it ſhall bring theee more profit than Gold. Shut
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100077:16"/>
up Alms in thy ſtore-houſes, and it ſhall deliver thee from all affliction: it ſhall fight for thee againſt thine Enemies better than a mighty ſhield and ſtrong ſpear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Be ſincere in what ever you ſay or do; whether you go to the Houſe of God, or retire to your Cloſet to pray ſecretly; whether you are in a treaty with your Neighbours, or relieving the Poor, let vain Glory have no Influence upon your behaviour, but ſincerely and honeſtly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the honour of God and the good of your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Creatures. Diligently enquire into the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations God has laid upon eaeh of you; and when you have diſcover'd what is fitteſt and beſt to be done, undertake it chearfully, and let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World put you by the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of what you are clearly perſwaded is your Duty. And when you are arrived at ſuch a pitch of Reſolution, as never to do any thing againſt your Conſcience, but to ſecure your Virtue in all your practices; as you will find unſpeakable pleaſure in your Minds, and great eaſe in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of your Chriſtian Duties, ſo you will both guide and ſupport weaker Chriſtians by your good Example.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Be not diſcouraged at the Difficulties you ſometimes may find in the exerciſe of your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100077:17"/>
and the Hardſhips you may meet with, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the entrance of the ways of Virtue. For what courſe of Life ſoever you ſhall take, it will not be without its troubles. If you devote your ſelves to the World, or ſet your Hearts upon Riches, or abandon your ſelves to the Sins of the Fleſh, will you not meet with more diſappointments to encounter, fiercer Croſſes to ſtruggle with, more Injuries and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronts to digeſt; and more ſtubborn and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies to maſter than in the Service of God?</p>
            <p>O let it be remember'd, that if you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave your ſelves to the Luſts and Vanities of the World, as you muſt labour harder, meet with diſappointments more frequently, and fight more deſperately, ſo, which is worſt of all, your endeavours and pains will all prove fruitleſs in the Concluſion; for you will reap nothing but Corruption, the Candle of the Wicked ſhall be put out, and all his Greatneſs, Glory, and Pleaſure ſhall end in outer Darkneſs and eternal Death.</p>
            <p>Moreover you cannot hope for better uſage than your dear Lord found upon earth: but you muſt expect, as he did before you, by Afflictions, by the Croſs, and by Death, to go Heaven; for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100077:17"/>
the condition of Servants ought not to be better than that of their Maſter.</p>
            <p>If ſometimes the thoughts of death are terrible, and your faith grows cold and ſtaggers, ſo as you begin to ſuſpect your own ſincerity, and to fear you have not any true intereſt in the metcies of God, call then to mind the agony of your preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saviour, the drops of blood that trickled down his cheeks, and the earneſt prayers he made that the bitter Cup might paſs from him.</p>
            <p>I verily believe the Providence of God did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him to drink ſo deep of it, to ſupport the ſpirits of all good people under the ſoreſt diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that he might be an Example for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of all deſponding Chriſtians, who heartily love and fear God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Having determined your choice to the ſervice of God, and made ſome progreſs in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, permit nothing in the world to ſtop you, or to put you out of your way, or to make you look back; for if you make the ſhorteſt ſtay, or turn never ſo little on one ſide, your cares, and tears, and good reſolutions will prove to have been in vain; you will loſe the benefit of your paſt labours and prayers, and perplex your Soul with a multitude of troubles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100077:18"/>
We have many a time concluded that nothing deſerves our hearts but God, and that true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is no where to be found but in Heaven; and that therefore we would dedicate our ſelves and all our powers unto his ſervice: but, unhappy creatures, we have been unconſtant to our ſelves, the World has regained our affections, and we have doted again upon vanity, and wretchedly forgot our God, and our own eternal advantage.</p>
            <p>May therefore our bleſſed Lord, who has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Sin and vanquiſht Death by pulling out its ſting, and diſarming it of its terrors, ſo aſſiſt us with his Spirit, ſo guide us in our duty, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and uphold us in our ſorrows, that we may never again depart from him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our Evil ways. May we imitate him in his Humility, his Love, and his Purity; and may we never decline any ſufferings, by which we ſhall promote the Glory of God, and ſerve the Intereſts of Religion, and preſerve the Peace of our own Conſciences.</p>
            <p>May we ever tread in his ſteps, who is the way, and the Truth, and the Life it ſelf: May we ever thirſt after him, who is the Fountain of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Waters, and may all other things appear vile and deſpicable to us, in compariſon of his Love and Favour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:100077:18"/>
And may a God of Infinite Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, who is ever ready to cheriſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh all afflicted and diſconſolate Souls, have pity on us, and ſafely conduct us thorough this Vale of Troubles and Tears, unto a State of endleſs Reſt, and Peace, and Joy.</p>
