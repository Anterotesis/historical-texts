            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 COR. 1. 10.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Now I beſeech you brethren by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpake the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you: but that ye be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgement.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHAT! the great Apoſtle ſtoop ſo low as to beſeech! and ſo paſſionately too, by the Name of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt. Be the People never ſo impatient, boyl and toſs and roar like a raging Sea, ſure here's Charm enough to ſtrike the World immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into a Calm. Beſeech! 'tis tantamount to a Command: he beſeeches by a Name that cannot but prevail, a Name whom Storm and Tempeſt it ſelf muſt Obey. But beſeech or command, 'tis all one: the World is deaf to all ſuch Charms, to all ſuch Commands. <hi>Be joyn'd together in the ſame and in the ſame</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102775:3"/>
               <hi>judgement!</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> too, united in a beautiful Order and Symmetry of parts? alaſs when will this be? <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Atoms will as ſoon by croſs interfering motions, weave themſelves into a beautiful Syſtem of a World, as mens thoughts, variouſly croſs and running counter, unite in one Diſcipline, one Doctrine, one Church. We ſhall never ſee Peace, ſo long as there are rough uneven tempers in the World, as unfit for Societies, as ſome rough unhew'n Stones, or knotty crooked pieces of Timber, unfit for Building. There are certain tempers naturally ſour enough to break through Mountains and Rocks like <hi>Hanibal</hi>'s vinegar, and to diſſolve the firmeſt Foundations of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Order. And there is eſpecially a <hi>Phariſaical Leven</hi> ſour enough, to put whole Societies and Kingdoms into a perfect fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. We ſhall never be all alike, till the different humors of our ſeveral conſtitutions be quite ſpent, and we are mouldred away in our Graves to rotten Bones and Skulls; then and not till then exactly all alike with half noſes, hollow-ey'd, and grinning, as <hi>Lucian</hi> deſcribes Skulls of Wiſe-men, Mad-men, Fools, Cynicks, Politicians, Hero's, Beggers, blended together
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102775:3"/>
in <hi>Charnel Houſes.</hi> But eſpecially in Religion, men never yet wanted pretences to diſagree: <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> though Brothers, agree not in the ſame kinds of Sacrifices. Contention once intruded into Heaven amongſt the Gods, that's Romance; but 'tis too true, ſhe hath more than once intruded into the Church, a bold and troubleſome Gueſt. What? and will Religion then, Religion, which is or ſhould be the very Bond and Cement of Societies, will that alſo crumble us to pieces? Nay then there's little hope of Unity in this World. Our <hi>Corinthians</hi> divide upon pretences ſpecious enough, even of honouring ſome <hi>Apollos,</hi> others <hi>Paul,</hi> others <hi>Cephas.</hi> The leaſt pretence of dividing will ſerve the turn, when men are reſolved to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome: eſpecially in Citties of great Trade, ſuch as <hi>Corinth</hi> was, the Metropolis of <hi>Achaia,</hi> Rich, Populous, and Proud: where, as they Traffick'd with Forreigners, Goods for Goods; So they ſeem to have barter'd Religion for Religion too, the Seller baſely proſtituting his judgement to the Buyers, either Hereſie or Schiſm, to ſet off Goods the better, and to advance Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102775:4"/>
Our Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though by degrees he deals very plainly with theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> yet at the beginning of his perſuaſive to Unity, he deals with them with all the tenderneſs imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we do now? our modern Shiſmaticks are grown ſo ſtiff and ſtubborn, that 'tis to little purpoſe to Entreat them. Begg or Command, Weep or Thunder, 'tis all one; they are inexorable, they are inflexible. If the Mercy of God in ſettling Religion here upon ſo good grounds, by ſo legal and warrantable methods, according to the model of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church; if the Bloud of our Late Dread Sovereign, the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Martyr; if this King's incomparable Clemency can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail nothing; all the Paſſion of our Sacred Oratour St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is utterly caſt away.</p>
            <p>They have been gently dealt with theſe many years, and they are but the more hardned in the Schiſm. The warm Sunbeams will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times but harden that Clay, which heavier Storms may ſoften and make pliable to the Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:102775:4"/>
But I muſt remember the Apoſtles condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, I muſt remember his pitty, and his good nature, and with all the moderation I can, endeavour to remove ſome of the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices they have taken up againſt this Church. And I muſt be ſo far free with them as to charge them with the following Miſtakes, three eſpecially, the ground of all the reſt; A falſe Notion of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty:</hi> A falſe Notion of <hi>Tender Conſcience:</hi> A falſe Notion of the Nature and Meaſures of a <hi>Due Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A falſe Notion of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> The Church, we apprehend, hath a Liberty infeoffed in Her to determine this way or that in matters of Decency and Order. If this be the Churches Prerogative, conveyed to her by Scripture, particularly that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let all things be done Decently and in Order;</hi> it is certainly my Chriſtian Liberty to Obey, warranted and ſecured to me virtually by the ſame Scripture. When I am ſatisfied in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that the Church maintains the Faith, ſound in all the Doctrines ſhe profeſſes (which to ſay truth are the proper Objects about which Conſcience acts) 'tis my Priviledge to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102775:5"/>
be govern'd by her in other matters of leſs moment, which do not directly and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concern Conſcience farther then as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule of Charity obliges me to obey. For as the Apoſtles leaving out particulars, there is a general Warrant for the Church to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe; ſo is it a Warrant to me, who am a member of an Orthodox, Viſible Church-branch of Chriſts Holy Catholick Church, to ſubmit to that which makes it a Viſible Church, I mean Government and Order. So that the Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick is ſo far wide in his Notion of Liberty, that if I refuſe to obey, I in a manner fell away my Chriſtian birth-right, and baſely betray my own Liberty. For tho' we have often heard much talk to little purpoſe of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> yet as the Apoſtle uſes the word <hi>Liberty,</hi> we are able to underſtand no morethan this, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians under the Goſpel are redeemed from the bondage of the Law. So that I am at perfect Liberty to be Govern'd by a Chriſtian Church, the Obligation to the <hi>Moſaick Law</hi> being can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd. Elſe there would be a Viſible Church-Government in general Terms, ſettled upon the Apoſtles Succeſſors, without Obedience to that Government, which is an abſurd Chimera.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:102775:5"/>
Now then if the Schiſmatick tell us, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will not ſuffer him to ſubmit; where then is his <hi>Liberty of Conſcience?</hi> who put thoſe Fetters upon his Conſcience, but himſelf; what <hi>Cyclops</hi> made thoſe Fetters? where were they forged? in what <hi>Vulcans</hi> Shop? in what <hi>Aetna;</hi> but in his own zealous over-heated brain? Does the Scripture fetter his Conſcience? ſhew where? if it be truly Conſcience he pretends, he is bound to ſhew, either that to obey or not to obey, is made by ſome poſitive Rule of Scripture indifferent, as Marrying, or not Marrying is; or that the thing he boggles at, is either morally ill, or ill becauſe forbidden by a Law. Shew the Law, or I ſhall without breach of Charity tell him, 'Tis Humour not Conſcience. If he would have things of Decency and Order, left as indifferent as Marrying, or not Marrying; he roves ex-travegantly wide from the Caſe. For in the one caſe the thing is by a Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and ſo is what it is neceſſarily, indiſpenſably, and unalterably indifferent; in the other, 'tis left to the Churches Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to determine: there the indifferency being the immediate effect of that Law; here,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102775:6"/>
the Churches determination, the immediate effect of this Law. And therefore the Apoſtles General Rule is a warrant to Conſcience, to ſecure it from all ſuperſtitious fear of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed when the Church is obeyed, in things not repugnant to any particular expreſs Rule of Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A falſe Notion of <hi>Tender Conſcience.</hi> If the Conſcience be tender, 'tis becauſe there appears at leaſt ſome ill. But unleſs ſome Law or other convince me that a thing is ſinful, in truth I count I am in ſome danger of incurring a Sin, if I make that Evil which is not Evil. For who gave me Authority to call that Evil which God Almighty hath not by ſome Law or other declared to be ſo? 'tis a piece of Pride and Preſumption in me to call that Evil which is not, and I extort from God a part of his Sovereignty in doing ſo. There is as black a <hi>Woe</hi> denounced by the Prophet againſt him that calls Good, Evil, as againſt him that calls Evil, Good. And therefore, whatever the Schiſmatick apprehends of <hi>Tender Conſcience</hi> ſtartling at the appearance of Evil, <hi>Conſcience</hi> is as much in danger of being defiled by calling that Evil which is not Evil, as by calling that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102775:6"/>
not Evil which is really Evil. <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and tenderneſs of Conſcience, and I fear God, and I am afraid of Sin, and I confeſs my weakneſs, my Conſcience will not allow it!</hi> Theſe are the words, ſweet as honey, whereby the Ringleaders of our Schiſmaticks do inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their Poyſon: by ſo ſweet a breath do they convey a holy contagion through a whole Conventicle preſently, as they ſay peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſtempers are ſpread the farther by ſweet perfumes. <hi>Tender Conſcience!</hi> Who can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Charm? And, <hi>Acknowledge my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</hi> Who can reſiſt the power of the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Argument? The <hi>Tender Conſcience</hi> 'tis confeſſed, naturally moves pity: but then it muſt be the <hi>Tender Conſcience</hi> of ſuch, who make it a Caſe of Conſcience to hearken to Reaſon: who will withal be tender, leaſt they have a Conſcience too tender in punctilio's that really concern not Conſcience immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. For otherwiſe, there is a <hi>Tenderneſs of Conſcience</hi> which is cauſed by a certain ſour, fretting, grating humor, that corrodes, that ſours like the <hi>Leven of the Phariſee,</hi> I mean perfect <hi>Ill Nature;</hi> which mixed with a few unlucky grains of intemperate Zeal,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102775:7"/>
frets and galls the very heart of the man, and ſo he eaſily miſtakes in truth his Sore for the tenderneſs of his Conſcience. May not their weakneſs deſerve ſome Pitty too? Yes: Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may cover my Brother's failings: but that weakneſs will not be covered, which reſolves to break out into Rebellion the next opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Truth now, and never till now, do I paſſionately and heartily deprecate. None can more wiſh to be undeceived, than we to be deceived in what we ſay of thoſe, whoſe hands were they as ſtrong as their heads weak, would quickly ſatisfie the world what Principles they are of: then you ſhould ſee that ſame weak Conſcience all in Armour, ſtrong enough to manage a Sword againſt their King, in an Army of Rebells. Some of their late Scribling Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions flouriſhing a little in Print, to give their own Party ſatisfaction, not us; after ſome ſine harangues of inconveniency, burdens and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting; being by us preſſed to come to the main point to tell us downright, what in our Church is in it ſelf unlawful, and then prove it; not a word: they are not bound to give Reaſons, they are above the low diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:102775:7"/>
Is this weakneſs? 'Tis Pride and inflexible ſtubborneſs: To them, <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> are Sots, Cardinals veil your Caps: a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle can furniſh you with Doctors more Seraphick, more Irrefragable. The Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick that they ſay went to Convert the Pope, doubtleſs outfaced the Old Chair at <hi>Rome,</hi> with much more Infallibility than ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſit there. For moſt of thoſe that diſſent from us, are Infallibly ſure they are in the right: and by the way, it may be noted, that ever ſince the Church of <hi>England</hi> renounced the Popes Infallibility, they have leſt us, and reſolve to keep us company no longer. Theſe are the men whoſe uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Conſcience is above all Law: or but for one Law; and that is, that it ſhould be paſſed into a Law, that their Conſcience ſhall be bound up by no Law. ſhall <hi>Mahomet</hi> go to the Mountain, or the Mountain come to <hi>Mahomet?</hi> ſhall theſe Mens Conſcience come to the Law, or the Law to theſe Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? a Garment may be as ſoon ſitted to the Moon, as ſuch a ſyſtem of Laws fram'd as ſhall fit every Man's Conſcience. It Pinches here, widen the Law: now it Pinches as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102775:8"/>
much there, widen that too; till at laſt the Laws grown ſo much too wide, as that the man's <hi>Conſcience</hi> having got noom enough to turn it ſelf with freedome, wholly ſhakes off all Law, and that which at firſt pretended only to Liberty, ſhall very fairly end in Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A falſe Notion of the Nature and Meaſure of a <hi>Due Reformation.</hi> There is ſuch a thing certainly as an obligation lying upon all Churches, in all Ages ſince the firſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, to maintain a Unity in ſome meaſure with the Primitive Church, and to regulate all our Reformations by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Ruled and Laws of the moſt Ancient Church, if we are in earneſt when we profeſs <hi>We Believe one Catholick and Apoſtolick Church.</hi> Now if the new models of the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of our Reformation ſhould take place, they would ſo pare away from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> every thing almoſt that ever the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church uſed, that being reduced to a thing ſo utterly unlike what the Chriſtian Church was at firſt, we ſhould ſeem totally to have broken the Unity. The not weighing this, hath made us run ſo headlong from the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102775:8"/>
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that we ſcarce own that to be a Reformation, which rejects not almoſt every thing that ever was in uſe in that Church, right or wrong. We retain no not one thing but what was before that Churches Apoſtacy, either exactly the ſame, or very near it in the moſt Ancient Church: and to reform other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then this, (I crave leave to ſay) is to break Charity with the good Primitive Church. Theſe men may poſſibly mean well, but they ſeem only to conſider how to go far enough from <hi>Rome,</hi> never conſider to what we are in Charity bound to reduce our ſelves, I mean to that State whence by degrees <hi>Rome</hi> fell away. In truth our Controverſies with the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> move moſt upon this hinge, that we reject their Novelties, which againſt them is one of our beſt Pleas. So that ſhould we frame againſt them Arguments from ſuch Topicks as our Schiſmaticks, ſome of them, would ſuggeſt, we muſt tamely give up the Cauſe. For if we maintain not our ground, if we keep not to the firſt Ages, and the four firſt General Councils, if we ſecure not as far as may be, our Conformity with the moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church; we give them the greateſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102775:9"/>
immaginable. At our Reformation, had we (I condemn not other Churches) had we I ſay, renounced Epiſcopacy, the Ancient model of Church-Government, that bears date long before Infallibility, Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were thought of; what would the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have ſaid? how could we have avoided the juſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a moſt Uncharitable Separation from the Ancient Church? But now our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation may be an Object of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> Envy, becauſe we did thereby as it were reconcile our ſelves to the moſt Ancient Church: and our return is in truth to upbrayd them with Schiſm, and the moſt honourable way to juſtiſie our departure from them, in points wherein we and they had ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Ancient Church: which we ſhould never be able to effect, were not our conſtituted as now it is. For let the model be any other, not known to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians, men of ſuch Principles may rayl at Popery, but the Arguments they muſt be forced to uſe, will be ſuch, as will be ſcorn'd, and make the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> but the more obſtinate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:102775:9"/>
And therefore, if under pretence of flying farther from <hi>Rome,</hi> we Ruin this Church of <hi>England;</hi> we ſhall have neither Arguments enough left us to defend our ſelves againſt <hi>Romes</hi> Novelties, nor Loyalty enough left us I am ſure, to ſecure any Prince in his Throne, <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what do we talk of a Primitive Church? away with this dull Old Way; tell us Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks ſomething Brisk and New: theſe Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> can tell us nothing new; they ſay no more than Old <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Polycarp, Ireneus, Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian:</hi> they can Fight with nothing but old ruſty Weapons of Antiquity: we have Swords new burniſhed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and <hi>Francford:</hi> nay, we have Antiquity too on our ſide, we have <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Novatians,</hi> and there we gain a point. Yet Old Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks were dull heavy phlegmatick Sots, to ours: They never durſt attempt a Schiſm, but they would ſet up a Biſhop of their own making, and remain in the ſtate of their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, right Epiſcopal however, as to the Government of the Church: never hoping to gain any Proſelytes, ſhould they not pretend
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102775:10"/>
at leaſt to Epiſcopacy. But ours run down Epiſcopacy, and then cry they have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered new wonders to the world, and found out better methods of Church-Government, than their idle Predeceſſors, <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi> could ever dream of.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Epiphanius</hi> mentions a dear Friend of our Schiſmaticks, one <hi>Aerius</hi> of precious memory, who turn'd Leveller becauſe he could not get a Biſhoprick.</p>
            <p>But I muſt tell them for his Credit, he had but few Proſelytes, and they hooted at as the Owl, by the more ingenious of his winged Brethren, when he appears with his Gravity among the Airy Witts.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry for the ſake of ſome of our Schiſmaticks, who would fain be nibbling at this Story, that <hi>Aerius</hi> was not a Leveller out of pure Conſcience, becauſe then the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Parity might claim ſome kindred with Antiquity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:102775:10"/>
Thus I have briefly diſcourſed of <hi>Liberty, Tender Conſcience, Reformation,</hi> the three faireſt pretences of Schiſm. Now if this one ſingle Text prevail nothing, if neither our great Apoſtles Frowns nor Charms, nor his Excommunications, nor his Embraces, nor his Apoſtolical Authority, nor the Paſſion of his Oratorie prevail with the Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, but he will tear the Church to pieces, ungratefully rend the very Bowels of that Church that gave him Life, whoſe Breaſts he ſuck'd; What Expedients for Unity fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to propoſe, I cannot imagine.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Temper's Policy too, to Divide that he may Rule, to break the Churches Ranks and Files, that he may Enter and Conquer with Eaſe. Our Quarrels are his Conqueſts, the Ruins of our Churches are his Trophies, 'tis only our Peace that he dreads, <hi>Pax veſtra bellum eſt illi,</hi> ſaid <hi>Tertullian.</hi> In all the Apoſtles Writings there are not more Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt any one thing than againſt Schiſm. For though Schiſm in it ſelf conſider'd does not directly deſtroy any one Article of the Faith, yet by deſtroying the Churches Unity, it will in time deſtroy the Faith: Becauſe 'tis a falſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102775:11"/>
Phantaſtick Light hovering in the Air, that will lead thouſands after it into Errors, over Bogs and Precipices: and will have in time ſo fatal an influence upon the whole Body of the Catholick Church, as not only to weaken that, by drawing off great numbers from it; but alſo put the Schiſmaticks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of a Capacity of being at leaſt Confirmed in the Truths they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and ſo they will lie open to all the Temptations immaginable, of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched in the very Principles of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith.</p>
            <p>For this ſeems one deſign at leaſt, of the firſt Plantations of Churches under ſuch a model of Epiſcopacy, as might unite Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in larger Bodies, and prevent the breaking of their numbers into little Junto's and Conventicles; that ſo they might like great Armies United in Government and Order, both ſecure their own Faith by their greater Union, and alſo make more effectual Conqueſts upon the Unconverted Parts of the World, to whom it muſt needs be one great motive to come in, when they ſhould ſee Chriſtians ſo ſtrongly knit together, in ſo large
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102775:11"/>
Societies, with ſo much Charity, Order and Harmony.</p>
            <p>Why then do our Schiſmaticks by going off from our Church, from the common ſafe Path, (to ſay no more) expoſe themſelves to ſo great dangers? did they not forſake us, we might hope one day by calm reaſoning to reform their judgement.</p>
            <p>Why do they thus fight with us diſenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly and baſely, like <hi>Parthians,</hi> who tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their backs, ſcatter'd their Arrows from behind them? Why do they thus ſcatter their envenom'd Arrows, even bitter Words, and never turn their faces, either to ſurvey our Strength, or ſtay to hear what we can ſay for our ſeIves?</p>
            <p>Why do they amuſe us with Accuſations of Popery, like <hi>Atalantas</hi> Ball, with Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions back upon us, that they might get the ſtart in the Race, and get to Rome firſt?</p>
            <p>Is it Superſtition they dread? but have not they themſelves ſome Tincture of that too, at leaſt while they (I may venture to ſay) ſuperſtitiouſly avoid it? have we not known the time, when they honour'd their Factious Preachers even to Superſtition? when
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102775:12"/>
they honour'd the double lin'd Cap, equal to the Triple Crown; when they payed honours to the handerchef about his Neck, as to the Holy Rag of ſome Legend Saint; and took the ſhort Cloak hanging on one fide of the Pulpit, while the warm Orator was Tranſported with Zeal, and Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick Fire, for the Mantle of <hi>Elijah</hi> juſt dropping down from the Fiery Chariot?</p>
            <p>Do they depart from us that they may Worſhip God more in Spirit and in Truth? But with all their moſt glorious Zeal, they will never be able to expiate for their Pride and their Uncharitableneſs.</p>
            <p>The ſtricteſt Life of a Shiſmatick could never in the judgement of ſober men, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> make Apology for the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of being a Schiſmatick, did he lead the Life of an Angel.</p>
            <p>Do they depart from us, becauſe they cannot joyn in our Publick Prayers, with Devotion enough?</p>
            <p>Shall I be firſt guilty of Sin, a remiſneſs at my Prayers; and then make my <hi>Sin an Apology for my Schiſm?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:102775:12"/>
Do they diſobey becauſe the thing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different? or becauſe commanded? if the latter; you ſee where the Shoe pinches, 'tis not the Ceremony their Conſcience boggles at, but the impoſition of that Ceremony, for (by the way) they abhor Obedience as bad as Idolatry: then muſt the methods of Government be revers'd, and the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary muſt be commanded, to make theſe <hi>Antipodes</hi> proſelytes: If the former, the more unpardonable ſtill their diſobedience, one of the greateſt trials of our obedience to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being the indifferency of the thing commanded: for if we may not obey a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour in things otherwiſe indifferent, and if a Governour may not command what is not forbidden by Gods Law; there will be nothing left for Gods Vicegerent on Earth to command, and there will be no ſuch thing in the world as Obedience to a Prince.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch men have a care that they place not too much Religion in meer Notions. For 'tis poſſible men of ſuch Factious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples may talk and think too of Practical Religion it ſelf in a meer Notional way. For when men can neither talk nor think of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102775:13"/>
their Chriſtian Duties abſtractedly from this or that mode of Worſhip that accompanies them, the duties run out into certain excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies bigger than themſelves, and ſuch as will in time deſtroy the life thereof, while theſe men would level the Clergy, change the Churches Ornaments into rudeneſs and naſtineſs, and would ſeem great Patrons of humility, but how, by bringing us down to the duſt; let them ask themſelves this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Whether it be not ſome fond conceit of their extraordinary either knowledge or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or both, that makes them ſcorn to ſtoop to the Government.</p>
            <p>If they depart from us becauſe they know better things than we; if they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, let them confeſs their weakneſs; if they will not convince us, let them own their ill nature.</p>
            <p>If they depart from us becauſe they are holier than we; let them evidence to the world that they are better Chriſtians, at leaſt by being more Loyal Subjects than we.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102775:13"/>
If their Talent be extraordinary above other mens, let them fairly ſhew us that the firſt four or five Ages after Chriſt and his Apoſtles, were all in an Error: for they muſt not think their Malice is levell'd at us alone, it wounds the Primitive Church: it pretends to ſtrike at Popery, but the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd Arrows fly over the Papiſts heads, over all thoſe Ages between, and wound far beyond, at the diſtance of fourteen, fifteen, or ſixteen Ages: the Aſhes of the Holy Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Martyrs are diſturb'd, the Noble <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Ghoſt ſummon'd to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſour Tribunal, the Acts of the four firſt General Councils reſeinded, the Fathers Writings all defaced, cancell'd and burnt, and they, good men, condemn'd to ſuffer now a ſecond Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>If theſe men have new illuminations, and will make it appear to the world that the moſt Ancient Chriſtian Churches, long, long before the date of a corrupted one at <hi>Rome,</hi> were all miſtaken; let's e'ne blot out of the Churches Records, four or five hundred years, and let them paſs for nothing,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102775:14"/>
and begin Chriſtianity anew: down with our Univerſities, ſet fire to all our Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with Triumphant Bonfires in Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to welcome into the World theſe New Lights.</p>
            <p>Muſt we be thus Angry with the Primitive Church, becauſe we find too much Loyalty there? if that be the Crime; 'tis the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches unhappineſs, but our honour, that they in us their humble imitators, muſt at this great diſtance of ſo many Ages, ſuffer as it were in Effigie.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, if they are reſolved to quarrel, they may be pleaſed, as becomes all good Chriſtians, to divert their Anger upon what far more deſerves it, their own Sins.</p>
            <p>If immoderate Zeal muſt raiſe in their hearts and heads turbulent exhalations, and make them <hi>Sons of Thunder,</hi> ever fall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts heavieſt at home: ſtrike here, here's a Mountain, here's a Rock, here's a proud thought, and here's an unrelenting heart: here lodge undervaluing thoughts of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102775:14"/>
King and the Government, here lurks Spiritual Pride under the colour of Self-denyal, and Mortification, ſomething of the Publican, more of the Phariſee; and (if they have Humility to own but common Human Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities) Sins of all ſorts, whereby Gods Holy Spirit is grieved, and his Infinite Love abuſed. Here are Objects indeed, that call aloud for their juſt indignation: here if they Employ their Zeal at home againſt their own Sins, they will have but little either inclination or leiſure to quarrel with any man, much leſs with the Conſtitutions of an Excellent Well-Govern'd Church.</p>
            <p>We and they, all of us hope to attain the ſame End of our Faith, a <hi>Heavenly Canaan</hi> is all our journeys end, <hi>We are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, why ſhould we fall out by the way?</hi> Why all this Noiſe? it will not, it cannot be long, e're we all lye quiet in our Graves: thence we hope all to paſs to ſuch a State, where there will be nothing but Unity, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and Harmony: where a full Choir of Saints, in a Beautiful Church Triumphant, and a

Noble Hierarchy of Angels ſhall ſing Alelujah's and Worſhip God in the Beauties of Holineſs, for Ever and Ever.</p>
