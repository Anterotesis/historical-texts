         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>

Indicted by the Name of</hi> Elizabeth Cellier, <hi>Wife of</hi> Peter Cellier, <hi>of
the Pariſh of St.</hi> Clement Danes, <hi>in the County of</hi> Middleſex, <hi>Gent.
For that ſhe being of the Popiſh Religion, not having the fear of God
before her Eyes, but being moved and ſeduced by the Inſtigation of
the Devil, falſly and maliciouſly endeavouring and intending our
Soveraign Lord King CHARLES the Second that now is, and
the Government of this Kingdom of</hi> England; <hi>as alſo the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion within this Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>by Law Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to bring to hatred and contempt; And alſo to bring Scandal and
Infamy upon divers Perſons produced as Witneſſes, that gave Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on the part and behalf of our Soveraign Lord the King, againſt
her the ſaid</hi> Elizabeth Cellier, <hi>and other Perſons Indicted of High
Treaſon, the</hi> 1ſt. <hi>of</hi> September <hi>in the</hi> 32th. <hi>year of our Soveraign Lord
King CHARLES the Second that now is; at the Pariſh of St.</hi>
Clement Danes <hi>in the County of</hi> Middleſex <hi>aforeſaid, Falſly, Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
and Seditiouſly, did Write and Publiſh, and did cauſe to be
Writ, imprinted and publiſhed, a Scandalous Libel Intituled</hi> Malice
Defeated, or a Brief Relation of the Accuſation and Deliverance of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth
Cellier;</hi> wherein her proceedings both before and during her
Confinement, are particularly related, and the Myſtery of the Meal-Tubb
fully diſcovered; together with an Abſtract of her Arraignment and
Tryal, written by her ſelf for the ſatisfaction of all Lovers of undiſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Truth. <hi>In which ſaid Libel, are contained theſe Falſe, Feigned,
Scandalous Words and Figures following, to wit,</hi> I hope it will not
ſeem ſtrange to any honeſt and Loyal Perſon of what way or Religion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
That I being born and bred up under Proteſtant Parents ſhould
now openly profeſs my ſelf of another Church; <hi>meaning the Church
of Rome;)</hi> For my Education being in thoſe times, when my own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and Relations, for their Conſtant and Faithful Affection to the
King, and Royal Family, were perſecuted, the King himſelf murdered, the
Biſhops and Church deſtroyed, the whole Loyal Party meerly for being ſo,
oppreſſed and ruined; and all, as was pretended by the Authors of theſe
Villanies for their being Papiſts, and Idolaters, the conſtant Character
given by them to the King and his Friends to make them odious, they
aſſuming to themſelves only the Name of Proteſtants, making that the
Glorious Title by which they pretended right to all things. Theſe ſort
of proceedings, as I grew in underſtanding, produced in me more and
more horror of the Party that committed them, and put me on inquiry
into that Religion to which they pretended the greateſt Antipathy,
wherein, I thank God, my innate Loyalty not only confirmed, but incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
me. And let Calumny ſay what it will, I never heard from any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
as they call them, Prieſt, nor Lay-man, but that they and I, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41247:4"/>
all true Catholicks owe our Lives to the Defence of our Lawful King,
which our preſent Soveraign <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second is, whom God
long and happily preſerve ſo. Theſe ſorts of Doctrines agreeing to my
publick Morals, and no way, as ever I was taught, contradicting my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Ones, commending at the ſame time to me Charity and Devotion,
I without any Scruple have hitherto followed, glorying to my ſelf to be
in Communion with thoſe who were the humble Inſtruments of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
happy Preſervation from the fatal Battle at <hi>Worceſter;</hi> and who,
the poor, no temptation could invite to betray him to thoſe who by a
pretended Proteſtant Principle, ſought his innocent Blood. Theſe Truths
I hope, may ſatisfie any indifferent Perſon in my firſt Change; nor can
they wonder at my continuance therein, notwithſtanding the horrid
Crimes of Treaſon and Murder laid to the Charge of ſome Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
for their Quality and Fortunes in that Party: for when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
who were the Witneſſes, and what unlikely things they depoſed,
and obſerved that many of the chiefeſt Sticklers for the Plot, were thoſe
or the Sons of thoſe, that acted the Principal parts in the laſt Tragedy,
which Hiſtory told me too had the Prologue of a pretended Popiſh Plot;
I ſay, theſe things made me doubtful of the whole, and the more I ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for truth, the more I doubted that the Old Enemys of the Crown
were again at work for its deſtruction. I being fully confirmed in this,
thought it my duty through all ſorts of hazards, to relieve the poor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
Catholicks, who in great Numbers were lockt up in Goals, ſtarving
for want of Bread: and this I did ſome Months before I ever ſaw the
Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> or any of thoſe honourable Perſons that were accuſed,
or receiving of one penny of their money directly or indirectly, till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the latter end of <hi>January (78.) And in another part of the
ſaid Libel are contained theſe falſe feigned and Scandalous Words
and Figures following; to wit,</hi> About this time I went daily to the Priſons
to perform thoſe Offices of Charity I was obliged to, and on <hi>Thurſday
January</hi> the <hi>9th (78</hi> I dined in <hi>Newgate</hi> in the Room called the Caſtle
on the Maſters ſide Debtors, and about four in the Afternoon I came
down into the Lodge with five women, of which, three were <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>
and we all heard terrible Grones and Squeeks, which came out of the
Dungeon called the Condemned Hole. I asked <hi>Harris</hi> the Turn-Key what
doleful Crie it was. He ſaid it was a Woman in Labour. I bid him put
us into the Room to her, and we would help her. But he drove us away
very rudely, both out of the Lodge and from the Door. We went behind
the Gate and there liſtned, and ſoon found that it was the voice of a
Strong-man in Torture, and heard as we thought between his Grones the
winding up of ſome Engine. Theſe Cries ſtopt the Paſſengers under the
Gate, and we ſix went to the Turners Shop without the Gate, and ſtood
there amazed with the horror and dread of what we heard, when one
of the Officers of the Priſon came out in great haſte, ſeeming to run from
the Noiſe. One of us catch'd hold of him ſaying, Oh! what are they
doing in the Priſon? <hi>Officer.</hi> I dare not tell you. Miſtriſs. 'Tis a man upon
the Rack. Ile lay my life on't. <hi>Officer.</hi> It is ſomething like it. <hi>Cellier.</hi> Who
is it? <hi>Prance? Officer.</hi> Pray, Madam do not ask me, for I dare not tell
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41247:5"/>
you. But it is that I am not able to hear any longer. Pray let me go. With
that he ran away towards <hi>Holborn</hi> as faſt as he could. We heard theſe
Groans perfectly to the end of the <hi>Old Bayley.</hi> They continued till near
ſeven of the Clock, and then a perſon in the Habit of a Miniſter, of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Stature, Grey-haired, accompanied with two other men, went into
the Lodge. The Priſoners were lockt up, and the outward door of the
Lodge alſo, at which I ſet a perſon to ſtand, and obſerve what ſhe could,
and a Priſoner loaded with Irons was brought into the Lodge, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
a long time. And the Priſoners, that came down as low as they
could, heard the Perſon, examined with great Vehemency ſay often, I know
nothing of it, I am Innocent, he forced me to bely my ſelf, what would
you have me ſay? Will you Murder me becauſe I will not bely my ſelf
and others. Severall other ſuch like expreſſions they heard ſpoken as by
one in great Agony. About four of the Clock next morning, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
that lay in a place above the Hole heard the ſame Cry again two
hours, and on Saturday morning again, and about eight a Clock that
morning a Perſon I employed to ſpie out the truth of that Affair, did ſee
the Turn-Keys carrying a Bed into the Hole. She asked who it was for:
they told her it was for <hi>Prance</hi> who was gone mad, and had tore his
Bed in pieces. That night the Examiners came again, and after an
hours Conference <hi>Prance</hi> was led away to the Preſs-Yard. This and
many things of the like Nature, made me very inquiſitive to know what
paſt in the Priſon. Soon after this <hi>Francis Corral</hi> a Coachman that
had been put into <hi>Newgate</hi> upon ſuſpicion of carrying away Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury
Godfrey</hi>'s Body, and lay there thirteen Weeks and three days in
great miſery, got out. I went to ſee him, and found him a ſad Spectacle,
having the fleſh worn away, and great holes in both his Legs by the weight
of his Irons, and having been Chained ſo long double, that he could not
ſtand upright, he told me much of his hard and cruel uſage, as that he had
been Squeez'd and haſped into a thing like a Trough, in a Dungeon under
ground; which put him to inexpreſſible torment, inſomuch that he ſoonded,
and that a Perſon in the habit of a Miniſter ſtood by all the while. That
a Duke beat him, pull'd him by the Hair, and ſet his drawn Sword to
his breaſt three times, and ſwore he would run him through; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
great Lord laid down a heap of Gold, and told him it was five
hundred Pounds, and that he ſhould have it all, and be taken into the
aforeſaid Dukes houſe, if he would confeſs what they would have him;
and one <hi>F.</hi> a Vintner, that lives at the ſign of the Half-moon in <hi>Ch-ſi,</hi>
by whoſe contrivance he was accus'd, took him aſide, and bid him name
ſome perſon, and ſay, they imploy'd him to take up the dead body in
<hi>Somerſet-yard,</hi> and gave him mony for ſo doing; that if he would do this,
both <hi>F.</hi> and he, ſhould have mony enough. He alſo told me, that he was
kept from <hi>Thurſday</hi> till <hi>Sunday</hi> without victuals or drink, having his
hands every Night Chain'd behind him, and being all this time lock'd to
a Staple which was driven into the Floor, with a Chain not above a
yard long: that in this great extremity, he was forc'd to drink his own
water; and that the Jaylor beat his Wife, becauſe ſhe brought victuals,
and prayed that he might have it, and threw Milk on the ground, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41247:5"/>
bid he be gone, and not look at him. <hi>And in another part of the ſaid
Libel is contained (amongſt other things) theſe falſe, fained, and
Scandalous words and Figures following, to wit,</hi> My Arraignment
(which in Confidence of my own Innocency I continually preſs'd for) not

words, and in other words, I will not undertake to repeat them to you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this is a Libel ſo Complicated and General, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

his Majeſty, and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, our Laws, Government, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
Councellours of State, Courts of Judicature, the Kings

Murther of his Late Majeſty, and the greateſt Impieties that ever
were Committed.</p>
               <p>She accuſeth all that have done their Duties, or been Active
in the Diſcovery of the preſent Popiſh-Plot, to be Enemies of the
Crown; and to be the Acting over again the Tragedy of our Late
Civil-War.</p>
               <p>She Chargeth our Laws with Cruelties, as Inhumane, as they
are falſe, in permitting Priſoners to Starve under their Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in admitting of Racks and Tortures to be uſed, and that
for the worſt purpoſes, thereby to extort Perjuries and falſe Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

the beſt Quality of our Nobility, Magiſtracy, and Clergy, Privies,

               <p>She Libels and King's Evidences under the Characters of the
Devils Inſtruments, and the Hangmans Hounds, and Defames
his Majeſties Government, in ſaying it is not ſafe to ſpeak Truth,
but Meritorious and Gainful to do the Contrary.</p>
               <p>She will appear to you to be ſo Criminal, that nothing can
aggravate her Offences, unleſs the Impudence of the Delinquent,
who hath ſet her Name to almoſt every Page of this Scandalous
Libel; and ſnce the Indictment hath been depending, Owned,
Publiſhed, and put a value on her ſelf, for being the Author of ſo
Excellent a Book.</p>
               <p>To the Indictment, She hath pleaded Not Guilty, if the Kings
Evidence prove the Charge, you are to find her Guilty.</p>

is Charged with the ſetting forth this Book, in the next place there
are ſeveral Clauſes in that Book, which ſhe is particularly Charged
with. Now that which the Evidence will prove muſt be, Firſt,
that the Book was Owned by her, and Publiſhed by her, and then
that theſe particulars Charged in the Indictment were in the Book;
and then you will receive the Directions of the Court, of what
nature the Proofs are. Go on to the Evidence that is your Work,
fall to your Proof.</p>

               <p>My Lord, about the <hi>22d.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a Meſſenger
came to me from Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> to tell me She had ſomething to be Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and She ſent for me to her Houſe, and I went to her Houſe in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel
Buildings.</hi> She told me She had a Bok to Print, and it
was her own Caſe. I told her I was a ſtranger to her Concerns, if
there was nothing in it that was Offenſive, I would Print it. She
told me there was nothing but the Truth and I might ſafely do it.
She ſaid ſhe had been publickly and wrongfully abuſed, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to publiſh her Caſe, and would make the World ſenſible of the
wrong She had ſuſtained. I was apt upon the plauſibleneſs of her
Diſcourſe to believe her, and ſo I agreed with her to have 10 s. a
Ream for Printing, and I was to Print Four Ream of every Sheet.
And having Printed half the Book, the Meſſenger found it a Printing
at my Houſe, and having thus found out the Preſs he carried it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Secretary, Sir <hi>Leoline Jenkins,</hi> who granted a Warrant to
bring us both before him; and having taken our Examinations, we
were bound to appear before the Privy-Council as ſoon as Notice
ſhould be given us of it: And being diſcharged by the Council we
were bound to appear the Firſt day of next Term in the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench:</hi>
Since which time She hath Printed t'other half of her Book at ſome
other place. And whereas She promiſed to Indemnify me from
all Trouble and Charge, when I came to pay the Clerk of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
his Fees, She refuſed to pay them for me, and told me I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
her; and ſo notwithſtanding her promiſe, I was obliged to pay
the Fees my ſelf at the Council.</p>

               <p>As to that I will tell you the Occaſion of all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe,
if it may not be too tedious. Upon the Death of Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury
Godfrey,</hi> a Coachman was one day called to carry ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that were in my houſe; but they ſtaying a little longer than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
he went away, and as they ſay drop'd them, thereupon another
Coachman was called, which was this <hi>Corral</hi> mentioned in this Libel,
and he went up to the Gentlemen into the Room; and they to engage
him to ſtay, ſecured his Whip, he comes down and begs a Pipe of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi>
of my Wife in the Bar, ay, ſaid ſhe, thou lookeſt like a good
honeſt Fellow, and I believe thou haſt no hand in the Plot, a Caſual
word that was paſſant at that time, whereupon he begins to tell her,
it was very well for him, for he had eſcaped that danger: four of them
meeting him againſt St. <hi>Clemens Church-wall,</hi> and Swearing Dam
them he ſhould ſtand, and do as they would have him; and he ſaw
four and he ſaw Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfreys</hi> body in a Sedan,
and he ſham'd upon them, that he could not carry him, for that the
Axle-Tree of his Coach was broke. I was in a Room by the Bar, and
I over-heard the Fellow talk after this Rate, I came out, and asked
him, ſaid I, are you ſure of this, then he tells me the ſame Story over
again, whereupon I began to ask him if he were a Maſter for himſelf,
or Drove for another; the Fellow being ſenſible he had been too laviſh
in his Diſcourſe, pretends to light his Pipe in haſt, and to run out to
ſee whether the Seats of his Coach were not ſtolen out, and I took a
Candle with me, and went after him to take the Number of his Coach:
by that time I got to the Door, he was driving away, though he had
left his Whip with the Gentlemen, as Security for his ſtay. I come
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41247:10"/>
in, ſet down the Number of his Coach in my Book, and drew up the
ſubſtance of their Diſcourſe that hapned between my Wife and him;
and I was ſaying to my Wife I had a mind to ſtop this Fellow at the
Gate, but it rained; and ſo I did not, only kept the Number of his
Coach. The next day Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and the Secondary of the
<hi>Counter</hi> were Drinking a Glaſs of Wine at my houſe, where I told them
the Story, and they blamed me that I had not ſtopped him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> took the Number of his Coach, and the next
day ſent his Janizaries abroad, and ſecured him, and kept him in
Cuſtody for two or three days.</p>

               <p>Two or three days after the Murder was publickly
known of, I think, it was <hi>Tueſday</hi> Night that this Fellow told me the
Story, to the beſt of my remembrance; and the next day I told the
Captain and the Secondary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Fowler.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>It was the <hi>Tueſday</hi> ſevennight after. They blamed
me very much that I did not ſtop the Fellow, I told them how the
thing was, and the Captain ſent his people abroad, and took the
Coachman up by what marks I gave of him. The next day I was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to wait upon the Lords at <hi>Wallingford-Houſe,</hi> where was the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi>
two other Lords and Major <hi>Wildman</hi> the Secretary, where they
Examined me upon this thing, and what I have declared to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
I declared then. And they brought the Fellow in Face to Face;
and there he does Confeſs the whole matter, and made a great whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and clutter, that <hi>John</hi> ſuch an One, a Coachman, and Mrs.
ſuch an one, a Strong-water Woman told him this, and that, and
t'other. The Lords ſent for two of the Perſons he named, and both
of them being brought before them, the Lords were very well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
in that One of them keeps a Victualling Houſe, and they were
both of good Reputation, they were ſatisfied it was only a Sham,
and that he only Named them as the firſt Perſons that came into his
mind. Getting nothing out of him, my Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>
told him, Sirrah, if you will confeſs, there ſhall be nothing of what
the King hath promiſed, but it ſhall be made good to you, you ſhall
be ſure of it, and you ſhall be protected. My Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> told
him the ſame, but withal, if he would not confeſs; and tell him who
ſet him on Work, then nothing ſhould be ſevere enough for him; or
words to that effect.</p>

never in <hi>Newgate</hi> with any Nobleman, but once with my Lord <hi>Petre</hi>
Four years ago, and if he was with any Nobleman, he is accuſed to be
there in the preſence of a Duke, and another great Earl; and that the
Duke drew his Sword, and the other Nobleman laid down a great deal
of Gold which he ſaid did amount to 500 <hi>l.</hi> and told him it ſhould
be his, and that if he would accuſe ſome other Perſons, they would
maintain him, and then he did draw the Fellow aſide and tell him
can't you name ſome body? then you and I may have money enough.
This is the Accuſation of the Book, but now 'tis denied that ever he
was in <hi>Newgate</hi> with any ſuch Perſons, which is conſequentially a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of the whole Charge.</p>

               <p>Theſe are the Clauſes in the Book that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Exactly upon you. Now I muſt tell you, becauſe this Book doth
caſt a very great Infamy upon our Religion and on the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
it ought to be taken Notice of; For in the firſt place to
contrive to get a Man into Priſon, and by Tortures to compel him
even to commit Perjury, then to hale another Man to Priſon, and
have him thus barbarouſly uſed, as to have Nobles to come to him,
one with a Sword drawn, another with Money in his hand laying it
down as a temptation, and to force him to diſcover what he was not
willing to confeſs; and then to lay Accuſation upon the King that he
makes it a thing of ſafety to be the Hangmans Hounds, and to be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers
for Penſions, and ſhall aver that when it is as free for her to
ſpeak truth, as it is Meritorious for them to do otherwiſe, ſhe will
diſcover ſuch and ſuch things, is a ſlander that ought to receive a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
rebuke; and to ſatisfy the World of the untruth of it, I would
have you prove if <hi>Prance</hi> be here and the <hi>Coach-man,</hi> what uſage they
received, to avert that publick Calumny that is caſt upon the Nation.
For let Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> know, She hath inſinuated as tho the Murder of the
late King was a ſufficient Ground to pervert her from Proteſtantiſm,
which avowed ſuch practices, when all the World knows that at
that time there were Proteſtants that were far better Subjects, and
more Loyal than ever any Papiſt was in the World; and as great
ſufferers for their Oppoſition to that dreadful Villany, nay far more
than the Papiſts can boaſt of for their Loyalty; whereas 'tis known
they were Villains under hand all the while, and thoſe that did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
all that Roguery and ſet that Faction on Foot which brought
things to that ill Period they came to. Therefore you have ſet a fair
Outſide upon a Damnable lye. And that the Arranteſt Rebelliouſeſt
Rogues that ever lived under Heaven, are great Saints in Compariſon
of Proteſtants, no honeſt Man will believe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cellier.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay, they called themſelves Proteſtants. I know the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
were great Sufferers for the King, and I my ſelf felt it; our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
which were Proteſtants, were ſeveral times ſtript and plundered
for their Loyalty. I grant all this.</p>

               <p>Do you? Then you are an impudent ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Woman; or you had a Villanous lying Prieſt that Inſtructed
you to begin your Book with ſuch a baſe Inſinuation againſt the
beſt of Religions. But I have no more to ſay to that, for that is ſuch
a viſible Notorious Falſity to the knowledge of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men and
People of underſtanding, that it needs no greater Conviction
than the particular knowledge of thoſe Men that lived in that time.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41247:11"/>
Therefore for that Lye let it go upon the Publick Infamy that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends

               <p>The truth is, the very Book it ſelf, implyes, a
contradiction. It ſayes, there was one Tortured in the Priſon, and
the Roarings that they heard were like the Roarings of a ſtrong
Man in Torture; and yet, preſently after, it ſayes, that the Priſoner
comes up in Irons, and is Examined: Now, Could any one having been
ſo lately on the Rack be able to walk, and come to be Examined?
any Man that knows what the Nature of a Rack is, knows alſo, that
one that has been Tortured there, would not be able to heave the
Irons upon his Legs, nor be able to ſtir or walke, but that is a thing
not uſed amongſt us: It was ſome Impudent lying Prieſt that durſt
venture to broach ſuch a Calumny.</p>

much of the Evidence as falls under my Information: It had been

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baron Weſton.</speaker>
               <p>The reſt of the Evidence was but a Compariſon
of the Clauſes in the Book, with thoſe in the Indictment, which you
are to have Direction from the Court in, that they do: She ſtands
Indicted for publiſhing a Libel, and the Title of the Libel is,
<hi>MALICE DEFEATED; Or a brief Relation of the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
and Deliverance of <hi>Elizabeth Cellier.</hi>
                  </hi> Now this Libel
branches it ſelf out into ſeveral Parts; the firſt whereof is a very fine
Inſinuation, as tho her leaving the Proteſtant Religion, was, becauſe
thoſe that Murdered the King, and made that very great Subverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that was made in the Government by the late Long Parliament,
and the Army that ſucceeded them, were Proteſtants—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cellier.</speaker>
               <p>Pray my Lord, I ſay, called Proteſtants.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Baron Weſton.</speaker>
               <p>By your favour, ſhe pretends it was by thoſe that
were called Proteſtants, but if they were only thoſe that were called
Proteſtants, and not Proteſtants, What reaſon had ſhe to go off from
the Proteſtant Religion, to turn Papiſt, when there was ſuch a Body of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41247:14"/>
Loyal Proteſtants that did adhere to the Loyal Party? therefore that
was as villanous an Inſinuation as could be; as tho the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
did Nouriſh and Teach Seditious Principles, which in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of them, tended towards the ſubverſion of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Order, which certainly it does cheriſh in the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of any Religion in the World, and hath the moſt peaceable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
in matters of Duty, both in ſubjection to our Superiors, and of a
charitable Deportment of Men one towards another: and the practice
of thoſe Principles hath been ſeen amongſt Proteſtants, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Engliſh Proteſtants, as much as in any Nation of the
World; this may be ſaid of it to this day, for the Reputation
of the Engliſh Nation, that there is more Fidelity, Honeſty, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Truſt among them, than among all the Nations of the World
beſides; ſo that if a man were to go out of <hi>England,</hi> to any other
part of the World, he might very well uſe the words of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi>
upon his going out of <hi>Athens,</hi> at his baniſhment; <hi>Farewell beloved Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I am going into a World, where I ſhall not find ſuch Friends as I have
had Enemies here;</hi> Friends in other places, will be no better than our
Enemies here; the Carriage of Engliſh-men is ſo much beyond all
others, except the Germans, who, I muſt confeſs, are Famed for their
Honeſty and Integrity one to another; but if you take the <hi>French,</hi>
the <hi>Italian,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or any ſort of the <hi>Levantine</hi> People, they
live like ſo many Wolves, eſpecially in thoſe places where the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Religion is profeſſed. Now after this Inſinuation, there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
part of the Book recited in the Indictment, There was an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
barbarous Murther that was committed here, and which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did fix the Accuſation of the Plot fuller upon them, than all the
Evidence that was given beſides; the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmondbury
Godfrey,</hi> a Magiſtrate in doing of his Duty, was moſt barbarouſly
murthered, and by whom is Evidenced by one <hi>Prance:</hi> it hath been
the whole labour of the Party, to caſt this Murther upon other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and take it off themſelves; for they find if that Accuſation ſticks
upon them, it is a thing of ſo hainous a Nature, that it will make
the Popiſh party odious to all Mankind. And therefore this they
labour at mightily, and this Task ſhe hath taken on her ſelf; for
knowing <hi>Prance</hi> to be a Principal Witneſs, ſhe undertakes to let the
World know, that <hi>Prance</hi> was tortured in Priſon, to Inſinuate, that
the Evidence he gave againſt thoſe Perſons who were Executed for
this Murther, was Extorted from him by ill and cruel uſage. But
you muſt firſt know, the Laws of the Land do not admit a Torture,
and ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, there hath been nothing of that
kind, ever done. The Truth is indeed, in the 20th year of her
Reign, <hi>Campion</hi> was juſt ſtretch'd upon the Rack, but yet not ſo,
but that he could walk; but when ſhe was told it was againſt the
Law of the Land, to have any of her Subjects Racked, (tho that was
in an extraordinary Caſe, a world of Seminaries being ſent over to
contrive her death, and ſhe lived in continual danger) yet, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
done after to any one, neither in her Reign, who Reigned 25
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41247:15"/>
years after, nor in King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, who Reigned 22 years after;
nor in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt Reign, who Reigned 24 years after; and
God in Heaven knows, there hath been no ſuch thing offered in this
Kings Reign, for I think we may ſay, we have lived under as lawful and
merciful a Government as any People whatſoever, and have had as
little Blood ſhed, and Sanguinary Executions as in any Nation under
Heaven. Well, but (contrary to the Law in this Caſe) ſhe does
ſuppoſe Extraordinary Ways were uſed to make <hi>Prance</hi> give this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
She ſays, ſhe thought what ſhe firſt heard was the noiſe
of a Woman with Child, and that <hi>Harris</hi> the Turnkey did tell her
it was a Woman in Labour, but when ſhe deſired to be let in to
help her, he turned her away rudely; but liſtening ſhe perceived
it was the Groans of a Strong Man that muſt be in Torture: She
asked ſome of the Goalers what was the Matter? They told her,
They durſt not tell her, but it was ſomething they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure;
and they heard him Cry, What would you have me Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs?
Would you have me Bely my ſelf? I know nothing of it, and
ſuch words as theſe. Whereupon we have called <hi>Prance,</hi> and here,
upon his Oath, he tells you, there was no ſuch matter: that he was
uſed very kindly, had all things fitting, and under no Compulſion,
ſo that this is an high Libel againſt the Government. She ſays fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
there was one <hi>Corral</hi> a Coachman that was impriſoned by
the means of one <hi>Fowler</hi> for the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi>
that there was a Nobleman a Duke, came to him in Priſon, and drew
his Sword at him, and would have him Confeſs, That another No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
laid down a Sum of Mony, and ſaid it was 500 <hi>l.</hi> and told
him, if he would Confeſs, he ſhould have it; and that <hi>Fowler</hi> took
him aſide, and bid him lay it upon ſome Body elſe, and then he and
<hi>Fowler</hi> ſhould have Money enough. <hi>Fowler</hi> being examined, and,
upon his Oath, tells you, upon what Accompt he did Charge <hi>Corral;</hi>
he tells you, he was never with <hi>Corral</hi> in the Goal in his Life, and
never was with him in the preſence of any Duke or Nobleman, but
once in a Room, where <hi>Corral</hi> was brought to be Examined, and
then there was the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Marquiſs of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>
(who I never heard was a Man of Cruelty, or Harſh Nature) my
Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> who was Secretary, but there
was no ſuch cruel Uſage there, and he was never in the Priſon with
ſuch Noblemen; and then the Conſequence is, that the whole Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is falſe. <hi>Corral</hi> it ſeems, my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> ſays, hath been Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to this Point, and denyes it all; and is kept out of the way,
that he ſhould not give it in Evidence here: but if we had him
here it were no great matter, for if there were any thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
true, they are to proceed in a Legal way againſt them that
make theſe Tranſgreſſions of the Law, She ought to have Indicted
the Perſons, for they are highly puniſhable for ſuch Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as theſe are. But there is nothing done in that kind, but in ſtead
of that, ſhe hath Defamed them all in a <hi>Libel,</hi> and ſhe is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to have done that neither, for ſhe hath Defamed the King
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41247:15"/>
highly in His Government, and ſaid, ſhe could have Written more.
I paſs over the Buſineſs that concerns <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> wherein ſhe
complains, that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> had more Friends, and was viſited more
by Perſons of Quality, when ſhe had none came to her; every
one is Viſited according to the Intereſt they have in the World, and
the Friends they make: I have nothing to ſay to that, there is
not ſo much in it, but come to that part wherein ſhe Scandalizes the
King, which is this, ſhe ſays, <hi>Whenever His Majesty ſhall pleaſe to
make it as Safe, and Honorable, to Speak the</hi> TRUTH, <hi>as it is Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
it hath been Gainful, and Meritorious to do the Contrary, their
Villany will not want Witneſſes to teſtifie the truth of more then ſhe
had Written.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that ſhe ſuppoſes, that the King, by the Countenancing of
Lyes, and giving Penſions to Lyers, Chokes the Truth, and makes
it Dangerous for thoſe that know the Truth, to divulge it to the
World, which is a very Vile Scandal upon the King and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Theſe are the Matters of the <hi>Libel,</hi> and the things in
Proof have been Sworn by Three Witneſſes; one proves, That he
went to her to Buy one of her Books, and he asked her for One,
and ſhe gave him a Book which bears that Title Page that you hear
in the <hi>Indictment,</hi> Superſcribed with her Name, and ſhe gives it as
her Book. Now ſhe would Evade it thus, That ſhe gave it as hers,
not as though ſhe were the Author, but as if it were hers only in
Property: But, Can any ſuch thing be thought the Meaning of
her Words? or, Can there be any Greater Evidence that ſhe is the
Author of the Book, then her publiſhing of it with her Name to it?
but the Fellow goes further, and tells you, When he had the Book
he turned about, and Asked her, if it were her Book? Yes, ſhe
ſaid it was: and, ſaid ſhe, I could have Writ a great deal more,
if I would; So that her ſaying, She could have Writ
more, Implyes, that ſhe Writ that; and <hi>(more)</hi> is a Word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
which always ſuppoſes the Poſitive Propoſition. The next
is the Printer, who tells you, that he Printed the firſt 22 <hi>Folio</hi>'s,
within which, the greateſt part of this Charge, except only that laſt
about the King, is contained. He tells you, That ſhe ſent for him,
and employed him to Print it as hers; Agreed with him for Ten
ſhillings a Ream for the Printing, and that he did Print the firſt 22
Leaves at her Requeſt, and as Employed by her: <hi>Fowler</hi> tells
you, He bought 2 of the Books of her; and theſe are the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Publication of this Book. I muſt tell you this, The
Clauſes in the <hi>Libel</hi> are truly ſet down in the Indictment, for I did
Examine them one by one. Now whether or no you can doubt
ſhe was the Author of the Book, when in a manner ſhe did own it
at the Publication, by Selling it as hers, I leave to you, though I
muſt tell you plainly, I leave it as that which is to me under the
Notion of Expreſs Evidence; but I muſt leave it to you as Judges
of the Fact, and expect your Verdict in the Caſe.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>There are three things in the Indictment; <hi>Firſt</hi>
That ſhe Writ it: <hi>Secondly.</hi> That ſhe cauſed it to be Printed; And
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> That ſhe cauſed it to be Publiſhed. Now, if you find any
one of theſe, ſhe is Guilty of ſo much at leaſt, tho I think you have
heard Evidence enough for all. She told him, It was hers, and ſaid,
She could have put more in; and the Selling the Book is a Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So that if you be not ſatisfyed ſhe was the Author, yet if you
are ſatisfied ſhe cauſed it to be Printed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if you are not ſatisfied in
that, yet if you are ſatisfied ſhe cauſed it to be Publiſhed, you are
to find her Guilty of ſo much.</p>

               <p>I cannot give you any Judgment, for by the
Cuſtom of the City, that is to be done by the Recorder or his
Deputy, and ſo, what you will ſay to the Court, you muſt ſay to
them, that will be on Monday when the Seſſions is done.</p>

               <p>What I would ſay is only this, That I am a Woman, and
wherein I offended, I offended out of Ignorance, and did not know it
was an Offence, and if the Offence be mine, let not others ſuffer for
me. Have Mercy in Judgment, and conſider my Loyal Parents and
Relations, and the Services they did His Majeſty; and let this Fault
be wiped out by that Service and Duty I and they paid Him; or at
leaſtwiſe, let the puniſhment for this Offence be mitigated, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
that all my life, ever ſince I had the firſt uſe of Reaſon,
I have been a Loyal Subject.</p>

               <p>Theſe are things that will be conſidered on

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cellier.</speaker>
               <p>I will go away then, and come again on Monday.</p>

And ſo the Keeper carried her
back to <hi>Newgate,</hi> from whence on
Monday the 13th of <hi>September,</hi> ſhe
was brought to the Bar to receive
her Judgment, which Mr. Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
gave thus,</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Record.</hi>

               <p>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Cellier.</p>
               <p>THe Court doth think fit for
Example ſake, that a Fine
of One thouſand pounds be
put upon you; That you be Committed in
Execution, till that thouſand pounds be paid;
And becauſe a Pecuniary Mulct is not a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Recompence to Juſtice, which you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
the Court doth likewiſe Pronounce
againſt you, That you be put on the Pillory
three ſeveral days, in three ſeveral publick Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
In the firſt place, in regard her braided
Ware received its firſt Impreſsion and Vent at
her own Houſe, It is thought fit that ſhe
ſtand (as near her own Houſe as convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can be) between the hours of Twelve and
One, for an hours ſpace at the <hi>May-pole</hi> in
the <hi>Strand,</hi> on the moſt Notorious day, I think
there is a Market near that Place, let it be on
that day. At another time, That ſhe ſtand
in <hi>Covent-Gardeu</hi> on a Publick day, the like
ſpace of time, A Third time, that ſhe ſtand
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41247:17"/>
at <hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> on the moſt Publick day, for
the ſpace of an hour. And in the next place,
That ſhe find Sureties for the good Behaviour
during her Life; and in every place where
ſhe ſhall Stand on the Pillory, ſome Parcels
of her Books, ſhall, in her own view, be burnt
by the Hands of the <hi>Common Hangman,</hi> and a
a Paper of the Cauſe, to be put upon the
Pillory.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the Court charged the Sheriff, That
he take Care in every Place for a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Guard, that the Peace may be
kept, and ſhe was returned to the
Goal.</p>

a Coachman, that had been put into <hi>Newgate</hi> upon ſuſpicion of
carrying away Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfrey's</hi> Body, and lay there thirteen
Weeks and three days in great Miſery, got out; I went to ſee him, and
found him a ſad Spectacle, having the fleſh worn away, and great holes
in both his Legs by the weight of his Irons, and having been Chained ſo
long doubled, that he could not ſtand upright, he told me much of his hard
and cruel uſage, as that he had been Squeez'd and haſped in a thing like a
Trough, in a Dungeon under ground; which put him to inexpreſſible torment,
inſomuch that he ſoonded, and that a Perſon in the habit of a Miniſter ſtood
by all the while. That a Duke beat him, pull'd him by the Hair, and ſet
his drawn Sword to his breaſt three times, and ſwore he would run him
through; and another great Lord laid down a heap of Gold, and told him
it was five hundred Pounds, and that he ſhall have it all, and be taken
into the aforeſaid Dukes houſe, if he would confeſs what they would have
him; and one <hi>F.</hi> a Vintner, that lives at the ſign of the Half-moon in <hi>Ch-ſi.</hi>
by whoſe contrivance he was accus'd took him aſide, and bid him name
ſome perſon, and ſay, they employ'd him to take up the dead body in
<hi>Somerſet-yard,</hi> and gave him mony for ſo doing; that if he would do this,
both <hi>F.</hi> and he, ſhould have mony enough. He alſo told me, that he was
kept from <hi>Thurſday</hi> to <hi>Sunday</hi> without victuals or drink, having his
hands every Night Chain'd behind him, and being all this time lock'd to
a Staple which was driven into the Floor, with a Chain not above a
yard long: that in this great extremity, was forc'd to drink his own
water; and that the Jaylor beat his Wife, becauſe ſhe brought victuals,

not look at him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Readers farther ſatisfaction of his great
