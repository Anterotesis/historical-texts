            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="deposition">
               <p>ON the <hi>11th</hi> of this Inſtant <hi>January,</hi> I received the
annexed Note from Mr. <hi>James Nettervile;</hi> on the
<hi>13th</hi> I went to him; as ſoon as I came, he told me,
he had ſomething to impart to me in private; We
went into a Room alone, and he asked me if I did not hear that
there were perſons making inquiry to find out ſome that would
amuſe thoſe that had impeached the Lords, and thoſe concerned
about the Plot. I told him I heard nothing of it. He told me
there were ſuch, and that I ſhould find the Game would turn
another way; and that I might do my ſelf a kindneſs, if <hi>I</hi> pleaſed.
<hi>I</hi> told him my Affairs called me for <hi>Ireland,</hi> that I muſt be gone
on the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following. He told me it would be worth my
while to ſtay; and asked me if I could nor prove that one
Mr. <hi>Digby</hi> had meetings with Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow. I</hi>
told him no, for he knew there had been no great friendſhip of
late betwixt us (this I lookt upon as an introduction to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign);
but he came cloſe to me, and told me, a perſon had been
with him concerning this matter, and that indeed they had a
jealouſie of Mr. <hi>Blood;</hi> and if I would diſcover any thing of
that nature againſt him, I ſhould have 4 or 500 <hi>l.</hi> for my pains.
To this I ſeemed to hearken (but was much ſurpriſed at this
unexpected diſcourſe), and did plainly ſee their deſign was to
turn the Game another way, as he ſaid before. I did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
him, but told him I would conſider of it; and if I did
not go on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> I would ſee him again; and that he knew
well I was very hard to believe this Plot; and then he told me
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101286:3"/>
that he could bring a Priſoner in that place to drink a Pot of Ale
with me, that could give me an account what a Rogue Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
was; but I being in haſte, took my leave of him, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
me to ſecreſie. At my return I could not meet with
Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> but having ſome buſineſs with Sir <hi>Ralph Dalaval,</hi>
and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Daughter, and being full with this
Deviliſh deſign, I told the ſtory to them, and ſaid, When I was
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſhould hear, and they ſhould find that this was the
Game they intended to play, To turn the Plot from themſelves,
and doubted not they would find ſome to carry it on.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>14th</hi> (in the morning) I went to Mr. <hi>Bloods</hi> houſe,
and acquainted him with it; he deſired me to meet him in the
evening, becauſe he deſired to conſider of it; but told me then,
he had no reaſon to ſlight it, becauſe the morning before, a Knight
[Sir <hi>Thomas Longvile]</hi> had been with him, and told him there
was a deſign againſt him of the ſame kind, and deſired him to
inquire after it.</p>
               <p>In the evening I met with Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> who deſired me to keep
my Correſpondence with the ſaid <hi>Nettervile,</hi> and to know of
him how I ſhould be ſecured my payments, and what it was they
would have me do.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>16th</hi> I went accordingly to him, and told him I had
conſidered of what we had diſcourſed before, and had ſtopt my
Journey as to that day; he was very glad to ſee me, and told
me, that the party <hi>[Ruſſel]</hi> had been with him again about the
buſineſs, and I might get 500 <hi>l.</hi> without any prejudice to my
ſelf; I told him that Money would do me a great kindneſs at
this time (for he knew I had waited a long time here, and
that it was very hard with me), therefore deſired to know what
they would have me to do, and how I ſhould be ſure of the
500 <hi>l.</hi> for I expected it ſhould be a perſon of good credit that
would lay down the 500 <hi>l.</hi> He told me I ſhould not need to
queſtion that, for they were of credit enough. But he that
came to him [<hi>Ruſſel],</hi> was only imployed to pay the Money;
and if I ſhall tell him that you will do the buſineſs, you ſhall
be ſure of the Money; not ſo, ſaid I, Firſt let me know what
it is diſtinctly, and how I ſhall be ſure of the 500 <hi>l.</hi> or elſe I
will not ſtir a foot in it, but be gone on <hi>Monday.</hi> Saith he,
Would you have the Money before-hand? then it may be
you will not do it. No, ſaid I, that I do not deſire. But will
you depoſite it in a third hand? Truly, ſaid he, that is very fair,
and I doubt not but they will do it (for I told him none was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101286:3"/>
better able to carry it on than you; for Mr. <hi>Blood</hi>'s Man was
formerly your Servant, and preferred by you to him), and told
me, that on <hi>Saturday</hi> by two or three of the Clock, his friend
would be with him again; but that he would be ſhy of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
with me; and deſired that I would come to him
<hi>[Ruſſel]</hi> on <hi>Monday,</hi> and then I ſhould underſtand more. Upon
my return I acquainted Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> with the whole diſcourſe, and
that I was to leave the Town on <hi>Monday,</hi> having ſtayed my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
time, becauſe <hi>I</hi> had a Suit depending in Chancery, at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin;</hi>
and that if I were not there the beginning of the <hi>Term,</hi>
it would be great damage to me, becauſe my abſence would
be looked upon as a Contempt; but Mr. <hi>Blood</hi> requeſted
me to ſtay until he had acquainted His Majeſty, or one of his
Secretaries with it, to know his pleaſure as to my going or
ſtay.</p>

                  <hi>SAturday</hi> the <hi>18th</hi> day of <hi>January,</hi> I was with <hi>James Nettervile</hi>
in the Evening; he told me his Friend <hi>[Ruſſel]</hi> had left him
about half an hour before I came, and that he acquainted him
with what I propounded (to wit) that 500 <hi>l.</hi> ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
in a third perſons hand; and he told me his friend was
contented it ſhould be ſo, and thought it but reaſonable, and
therefore was willing to put it into a Goldſmiths hand. I asked
him if they had conſidered the method we ſhould carry this on?
and whether they had drawn up the heads of what I was to
ſwear? He told me, no; but his friend would be with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
upon <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> and that all things ſhould be prepared
and ready for me by <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning. <hi>I</hi> asked him if it would
be convenient for me to meet his Friend? He told me not as
yet, for he was very wary, ſhy, and fearful of being betrayed. I
told him I thought my meeting with him was not material; only,
ſaid <hi>I,</hi> let him be ſure to ſecure the Money, and he needs not
doubt of effecting the buſineſs. But, ſaid <hi>I, 500 l.</hi> is not all that
I expect from him for this ſervice, that is but a melting Caſh,
and <hi>I</hi> have a great Charge, and a Wife and ſix Children, and
you know I have lyen a long time waiting here, almoſt to my
utter ruin, and have been very hardly dealt with. Now, if
I accompliſh this, I ſhall loſe my intereſt in all other Parties,
and therefore expect he ſhould make me a very good intereſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101286:4"/>
with that Party. Never fear that, ſaid he, you ſhall have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
enough with them; and if we can but turn off this Plot,
there is no danger of effecting our buſineſs; for, ſaith he, the
King will believe nothing of it. Well, ſaid I, I muſt truſt to
you to make my intereſt; but I partly ſee how things are like
to go, and think it wiſdom to come in with the beginning of
the Game. Sait he (ſwearing by his Maker) Never fear, if we
turn off this Plot, we do our buſineſs, and you will be made for
ever. But, ſaid I, Why will you defer this while <hi>Wedneſday?</hi>
That is a great while, and delays are not good. Said he, I did
not expect you till <hi>Sunday:</hi> But if I hear any thing in the mean
time, I will write to you, and it ſhall be left at Mr. <hi>Brooke</hi>'s
Lodging. I hear, ſaid I, the Parliament is Prorogued; and that
is true enough, ſaid he; and till they meet again, we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no great damage. But, ſaid he, I hear the Apprentices are
ready to riſe and pull down <hi>Newgate.</hi> Said I, then I ſuppoſe that
is, becauſe the men <hi>[Jeſuits]</hi> are not executed. What elſe,
ſaid he? and that is our great danger, that the people ſhould
run into a Rebellion before we accompliſh our buſineſs. I asked
him if he had taken an Abſtract, as he ſaid he would, of what
that man in the priſon could ſwear, to take off Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s
Evidence. I have not yet, ſaid he, but we are ſure enough of
him, and ſhall make <hi>Bedlow</hi> Rogue enough. Pray, ſaid I, what
will he ſwear? That the very morning the Proclamation came
forth concerning Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> came to
his Chamber, and asked him if he had ever ſeen Sir <hi>Edmondbury
Godfrey:</hi> For, ſaid he, if <hi>I</hi> knew what a like man he was, <hi>I</hi>
could eaſily get 500 <hi>l.</hi> and however, I am reſolved to hazard my
Neck, but I will have it; and that he would have had this man
go with him to <hi>Somerſethouſe</hi> to ſee the Rooms, and promiſed
to get him Money, if he would go with him. But, ſaid I,
Mr. <hi>Nettervile,</hi> it is ſaid Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> was out of Town before
the Proclamation came out; that is not ſo, ſaith he, for this
mans Wife went into the Countrey with him. A great deal
of diſcourſe more we had, all tending to the incouraging of me
to carry on this buſineſs, to turn this Plot to be a <hi>Proteſtant Plot</hi>
for the deſtruction of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and then I ſhould be made
for ever. When I paid the Reckoning, and was coming away,
ſaid he, you will always come to your charge, but I hope the
end will pay for all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101286:4"/>
On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the <hi>22d,</hi> at Night, I went to Mr. <hi>Nettervile,</hi>
expecting to have the Model how they would have me Swear,
and in what Goldſmiths hand they would put the 500 <hi>l.</hi> But
as ſoon as ever I came to him, he told me that he had been put
into ſuch as fright, that he was never in all his life before; for,
ſaid he, Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and another

have fifty pound weight, another would have an hundred pound
weight put upon me. At length Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
me, and told me, he knew I could diſcover a great deal;
ſo I deſired the reſt might be put out of the Room, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
all to him and the other Juſtice, they both promiſing me
my pardon. Have you confeſt all, ſaid I? how could I help
it, ſaid he? I was never in ſuch a fright in all my life; and they
promiſed me my pardon. What have you confeſt, ſaid I? I have
told them, ſaid he, That 500 <hi>l.</hi> was to be depoſited in a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths
hand, and that I had ſent for a Gentleman, and treated
with him about it. Have you told them my Name, ſaid I? He
pauſed at that; No, ſaid he; but I muſt tell them, but I
thought firſt to acquaint you with it. Then ſaid I, it ſeems you
have left me in the lurch, and have made no proviſion for me;
therefore ſince it is ſo, you will give me leave to play my own
Game; and ſeeing you have confeſt, let us now play our Game
as well as we can on the other ſide, and be ſure to be ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and confeſs whatever we know. I will immediately to Sir
<hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi> and declare the whole Story. Pray do ſo,
ſaith he, neglect no time, but go this night. And ſo we parted.</p>

               <head>The Depoſition of Alderman BROOKS.</head>
               <p>THAT on or about the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1678, I was
at the <hi>Marſhalſeys</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> where was one <hi>James
Nettervile,</hi> a priſoner there for debt; who deſired me to
do ſo much for him, as to carry a Note for a friend of his that
was a Priſoner alſo, unto one <hi>Pierce Butler,</hi> that lived in
<hi>Germanſtreet,</hi> near my Lodging; and ſaid, If I would procure
any of his friends to come to his friend there, he would have
Money enough, whereof he ſhould have a ſhare; and alſo it
would be a great kindneſs to him; whereupon I told him I
would, provided he would write it quickly. Whereupon he
called forth his friend, and they two conſulted together, and he
wrote two or three Lines, and gave them me for the ſaid <hi>Butler.</hi>
But when I came to the place where I was directed, they told
me he was gone out of Town in obedience to the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.
And ſo I troubled my ſelf no further, but put the
Note in my Pocket: The next Morning he ſent a Meſſenger
to me, to know what I had done in it; I deſired him to tell the
ſaid Mr. <hi>Nettervile,</hi> that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> was gone out of
Town in Obedience to His Majeſties Proclamation.</p>
               <p>About Ten days after, I had occaſion for ſome waſte-paper;
and putting my hand in my Pocket, I lit on this Note that I
ſhould have delivered to <hi>Butler,</hi> and opened it, and read it, and
found in it theſe words written, or to this effect.</p>

and then being at Mr. <hi>Proctors</hi> Coffee-houſe at <hi>Charingcroſs,</hi>
I there met with a Paper, intituled, Mr. <hi>Praunces Diſcovery of
the Plot, and of Sir</hi> Edmondbury Godfreys <hi>Murtherers;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(amongſt other things) there was mentioned two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſts

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101286:5"/>
whereupon it came into my mind, that the man that I carried

by that Note he was committed by the name of <hi>Edmunds,</hi>
and his name was <hi>Kelly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next morning being the 16 of this inſtant <hi>January</hi> (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have found the ſame <hi>Kelly</hi> there), I came there; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the aforeſaid <hi>Nettervile,</hi> and after ſome ſecret diſcourſe, I
asked him how his friend did that I carried the Note for? he
told me he procured Bail. Then I asked him what he was? he
told me that he was a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and one of thoſe that <hi>Oats</hi> (that
Rogue) had impeached. I asked him how he could get Bail,
being a <hi>Prieſt;</hi> he told me, they did not know that he was a
<hi>Prieſt;</hi> and thoſe that were his Bail, would be Bail for any for
money; and he gave them Ten Shillings a piece, and the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that procured them, Five Shillings; and he got them the
Copy of his commitment for them to move by; and the <hi>Prieſt</hi>
promiſed him, the ſaid <hi>Nettervile,</hi> ſeven pounds. But he had
not left it him as yet; and ſo we left this diſcourſe, and came
to other.</p>
               <p>That he having ſent by me a Letter, and a Petition to
Mrs. <hi>Eleanor Wall,</hi> a Gentlewoman that belongs to the Dutcheſs
of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> (whom he calls Cozen), whereby to get him
ſome money for his preſent ſupply: but I having no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to meet with her, could give him no account of that
matter; whereupon he ſaid, that he was in ſuch want, that if
he had not help ſpeedily, he ſhould be turned into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-ſide:
I told him that money was ſo ſcarce with me, that
I could not lend him any; but if I could, I would. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he called me aſide into the corner of the Yard, by the
Gate, and told me, That if I would be rul'd by him, he would
put me into a way whereby we ſhould have money enough. I
asked him how? he told me, if I would but joyn and aſſiſt to
villify the Evidence of <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Bedlow,</hi> thoſe two Rogues;
whereupon I laughed at him, and ſaid, It is impoſſible; their
Evidence was grounded upon too good a foundation: he told
me I was miſtaken, and I ſhould hear otherwiſe in a little
while.</p>
               <p>Upon the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> I went again to him, thinking
to have gained ſomething of him, what was become of this
<hi>Prieſt,</hi> but could not; and was taking my leave of him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I muſt go home, for I had ſome buſineſs to write for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

               <p>I Being with Mr. <hi>Nettervile</hi> at the <hi>Marſhalſey</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Nettervile</hi> deſired me I would do him the kindneſs as to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
another Letter for his Friend to one Capt. <hi>Kelly,</hi> who had three

Kelly</hi> went together, and wrote a Letter to this Capt. <hi>Kelly</hi> of
the <hi>Tower;</hi> the Contents were much the ſame with that I carried
to <hi>Pierce Butler.</hi> I carried it to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Kelly</hi> was
not at home; ſo I delivered it to his Wife. As ſoon as ſhe read
it, the tears were in her eyes; ſhe ſtruck her hand on her breaſt,
ſaying, <hi>Alas poor man, is he taken? I was in hopes he had been
ſafe, of all the reſt.</hi> She thankt me very kindly, and told me, as
ſoon as her Husband came home, ſhe would give it him. When
I went to Mr. <hi>Nettervile</hi> again, he thankt me for carrying the
Letter for his Friend <hi>Dominick Kelly</hi> to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and told me
Capt. <hi>Kelly</hi> had been with them, and treated them very civilly
with wine and meat, and had ſpent five ſhillings upon them. I
asked <hi>Nettervile</hi> what Capt. <hi>Kelly</hi> was? He told me he was a
true <hi>Iriſh</hi> man. I asked him if he was a Papiſt? He hath taken
the Oaths, ſaid he; but he is a well-wiſher to us. On <hi>Thurſday</hi>
the 16 of <hi>January, Nettervile</hi> deſired me to carry a Letter from
himſelf to Capt. <hi>Kelly,</hi> which Letter ſignified to him that his
Friend <hi>Dominick Kelly</hi> was gone, and how that he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him 7 <hi>l.</hi> to diſcharge himſelf out of the Priſon, but had not
yet been ſo good as his word; therefore deſired that he would
take ſome ſpeedy courſe that he may have the 7 <hi>l.</hi> to diſcharge
himſelf out of Priſon. This Letter I delivered to Capt. <hi>Kelly</hi>'s
own hand in the <hi>Tower.</hi> He read it, and told me he was very
glad his Friend was out; but that he had never ſeen him ſince;
pray, ſays he, remember me kindly to Mr. <hi>Nettervile,</hi> and tell
him, For his kindneſs to my Friend, I will do him all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

Upon the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> I was deſired by Sir <hi>Joſeph Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamſon,</hi>
to go to Mr. <hi>Nettervile,</hi> to try what more I could get
out of him. On the <hi>30th</hi> I went to him, and told him,
that I had met with Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon;</hi> and he ſeemed to
be angry, and thought we had not diſcovered all we knew.
And I told <hi>Nettervile,</hi> that although he had promiſe of his
pardon, yet it was expected he ſhould do more for it than
he had done: As for my part, ſaid I, you know I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
nothing, but what diſcourſe paſſed betwixt you and I,
and that I have done to the full. Therefore, if you know
any more, I would adviſe you to diſcover it; for ſince you
have gone thus far, <hi>I</hi> think you ought not to conceal any
thing of what you know more. The Grand thing I perceive
they deſire of you, and that which I think is all they can
expect from you, is, That you would declare from whom the
500 <hi>l.</hi> was to come. He thankt me for my advice, and told
me, that he believed Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> had not peruſed
all his Examinations, for he had Anſwered all the Queſtions
they had asked him. And if they had any thing more to ask
him, he would Anſwer them.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>31th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> I acquainted Sir <hi>Joſeph
Williamſon</hi> with what he ſaid; he ordered him to be brought to
the Council on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, where I met him at the door,
before he was call'd; I told him, I ſuppoſed the chief Queſtion
that would be put to him, would be, Whoſe this 500 <hi>l.</hi> was?
and begged of him that he would diſcover what he knew of it.
Upon his coming out from the Council, I asked him if that was
not the queſtion they put to him? he told me it was: I asked
him what account he had given them? he told me he thought
they were ſatisfied, for they were very kind to him, and promiſed
him, that ſo long as they lived, he ſhould have the protection of
that Board.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> following, Sir <hi>Joſeph Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamſon</hi>
ſeeing me at the Council-door, called me in, and asked
me if I thought I could get any more out of <hi>Nettervile?</hi> I told
him I thought he had given him ſatisfaction when he was before
them, concerning whoſe the money was. I told Sir <hi>Joſeph</hi> the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
I had with <hi>Nettervile</hi> at his going into the Houſe, and at
his coming back; then he told me, that he had not been ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
with them, for he would confeſs nothing at firſt; but after
ſome Queſtions being asked in general terms, he told them that
it was to come from ſome of the Lords in the Tower; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101286:7"/>
me that I would go once more to ſee if I could get any thing
from him.</p>
               <p>The next morning the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> deſired to ſpeak with me;
I waited upon him at the Council-Chamber; and he deſired me
alſo, that I would go to Mr. <hi>Nettervile</hi> to ſee what I could get
further from him.</p>
               <p>So on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> I did go to Mr. <hi>Netter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi>
and told him I was not come on a bare viſit; but I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> (whom
he knew had both been very kind to him) to adviſe him, that
he would be ingenuous, and diſcover what further he knew in
this buſineſs. Truly, ſaid I, I ſuppoſe all they do expect from
you, is, that you would make ſome clear diſcovery unto them
whoſe money this 500 <hi>l.</hi> was; ſaith he (Swearing by his Soul)
<hi>I</hi> did tell them all I knew, <hi>I</hi> thought they had been ſatisfied; no,
ſaid <hi>I,</hi> they are not; and Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> ſaith, you were
not ingenuous; for you only in general terms told them it was
ſome of the Lords money in the Tower. Now if you can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
which of the Lords money it was, it may ſatisfie them; for
they judg, and ſo do <hi>I,</hi> and every one elſe, that <hi>Ruſſel</hi> would
as eaſily tell you whoſe it was, as to tell you it was ſome of the
Lords in the Tower. I could get no more from him a great while;
but after we had ſate and diſcourſed ſome time, he told me that
<hi>Brewer</hi> was to be before the Council the next day, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
he ſhould be ſent for too; I ſuppoſe not, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> unleſs I
have ſome better account to give them from you: ſo juſt upon
my coming away I told him; Mr. <hi>Nettervile,</hi> I am ſorry I can give
no better account of my Journey to you; therefore pray, if you
have any thing more to ſay, let me know it before I go. After he
had pauſed a while, By my Soul, ſaid he, I cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the particular name of any Lord but one. Who is that,
ſaid I? my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> ſaith he; but all the reſt were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to it; for <hi>Ruſſel</hi> told me he was to go immediately to the
Tower, to get the Money raiſed; and that it was a difficult thing
to get all the Lords together; and if he ſhould go to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
they might make ſcruples, and ſo delay the buſineſs;
and therefore he ſhould make all the haſte he could to get
the Money ready.</p>

for his ſervice in being one of His Majeſties Lords Commiſſioners
for managing the Government of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and in proſecution

who was formerly a Clerk in the Court of <hi>Claims,</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi>
and who pretended to inform the Captain of ſeveral concealed
Lands and Houſes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he might place his Debt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And upon the Captains receipt of his ſaid Letter of the <hi>11th</hi>
of <hi>January,</hi> 1678, deſiring a ſpeedy Conference with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
touching matters which may redound to his advantage,
which the Captain readily embraced (ſuppoſing it referred to
the ſaid concealed Houſes and Lands); and according to <hi>Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviles</hi>
requeſt by his Note, on the ſaid <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> laſt,
the Captain viſited the ſaid <hi>Nettervile</hi> in the <hi>Marſhalſey</hi> in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark;</hi>
when inſtead of a Communication as to the aforeſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
(the ſaid <hi>Nettervile</hi> being no ſtranger to the Captains long
abode here, and the expence he had been at in his ſolicitation)
took the opportunity to feel the Captains pulſe, as to the horrid
fact before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prima facie.</hi> It aſtoniſhed the honeſt Captain to think that
<hi>Nettervile</hi> had diſcovered a matter of that nature to him; and
conſidering if he ſhould reveal it to any one, there would be but
his aſſerting it, and <hi>Netterviles</hi> denial, beſides the cenſure the
World would paſs on the Captains Reputation, from the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101286:8"/>
fit to be profligated in ſuch a concern, which with the danger
and hazard he might expoſe his life to by ſuch diſcovery, and the
urgency of his particular affairs requiring his perſonal and ſpeedy
attendance in <hi>Dublin</hi> (having two Conditional Decrees award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt him, which would have been made abſolute this laſt
<hi>Hillary-Term</hi> for want of his appearance there). All theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
made him ſometimes reſolve within himſelf, to ſtifle
the wicked propoſal of <hi>Nettervile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But weighing the direful effects of ſuch a contrivance, which
if proſecuted by ſome other Inſtruments, when he was departed
this Kingdom, would not only have been the deſtruction of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
friend, and old acquaintance, Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> but prejudicial
to His Majeſty, and the whole Kingdom, in taking off the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow;</hi> and thereby the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
might ſtill carry on their deviliſh deſign and plot, when they
had waſhed their own hands, and made ſuch an alteration; when
the innocent would have been ruined, and the true <hi>Bloodſuckers</hi>
acquitted.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration ſo affected the Captain, that he reſolved
to leave the event of his particular concerns to Providence; and
as you read by his Depoſition, he repaired to Mr. <hi>Blood,</hi> and
gave him intelligence thereof. And having ſo imparted the ſame
to him, the goodneſs of God appeared much to the Captains ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
touching his troubleſome thoughts about his particular
concerns, by His Majeſties Gracious pleaſure, in ordering Sir <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph
Williamſon</hi> to write to the Lord Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that
the Captain might ſuſtain no damage in his Concerns, by his non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearance

            <p>Upon the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> laſt, as the Captain was going to
attend Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi> to give in his Depoſition, meeting

he told the Captain he had been at the <hi>Marſhalſeys</hi> the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with <hi>Nettervile,</hi> and feared he had done a very ill thing;
which upon the Captains enquiry what it was, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi>
was ſomewhat unwilling to acknowledg, until he had ſearcht fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into it. But before their departure, Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> told the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that <hi>Nettervile</hi> had procured Bail for one <hi>Dominick Kelly,</hi>
who was one of the Murderers of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey;</hi> which
Relation of the Alderman gave a Confirmation to the Captain
of the wickedneſs of <hi>Nettervile,</hi> and Gods Goodneſs in anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

own Information.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101286:8"/>
Which when he had ſignified to Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi> he was
much affected with it, and told the Captain of what great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
it was, to have the ſaid <hi>Dominick Kelly</hi> in cuſtody; and
deſired the Captain to bring the ſaid Alderman <hi>Brooks</hi> to him;
which the Captain deſired reſpite in, that Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> might make

and alſo leaſt the Information given by the ſaid Captain ſhould
be diſcovered, before there was a further progreſs made for the

            <p>Upon the [19 <hi>January] Sunday</hi> morning, Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> came to
the Captains Lodging, to know whether his Journey held for
<hi>Ireland</hi> the next day; and then told the Captain he had been the
day before with <hi>Nettervile;</hi> and upon the Captains demanding
whether he had learnt any thing more touching <hi>Dominick Kelly,</hi>
the ſaid Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> gave the Captain the full account, which the
Captain cauſed to be put in writing, and carried him to Sir <hi>Joſeph
Williamſon,</hi> to make Oath of the ſame, which he did, which
appears by his foregoing Information. And the Captain could
not but take notice of a Series of Providence all along in this
buſineſs; for by what Alderman <hi>Brooks</hi> atteſted, <hi>Dominick
Kelly</hi> was ſo infatuated, as to ſend the Letter unſealed to <hi>Pierce
Butler</hi> by the Alderman, although he was in ſuch dangerous
Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Upon Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> his free acknowledgment of theſe paſſages,
the Captain (deſiring his ſecreſie) acquainted the ſaid Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi>
of <hi>Netterviles</hi> prank with him; which on the <hi>Monday</hi> following,
Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> (being to meet Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Glover,</hi> the Keeper
and Clerk of the <hi>Marſhalſey,</hi> to conſider ſome way for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of thoſe who were Bail for <hi>Dominick Kelly</hi>) happened to
give ſome hints of the Captains Information to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Glover;</hi> whereby Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> coming to have ſome
underſtanding thereof, with Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> and by an untimely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
therein, going to <hi>Nettervile</hi> with Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> ſpoyled
the Proceedings, which otherwiſe might in a little time have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the 500 <hi>l.</hi> depoſited in the Goldſmiths hand, and full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of the parties concerned in the project, and of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
which the Captain was to have Sworn, when he received
the 500 <hi>l.</hi> from <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and the ſeizure of the ſaid <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> met with the
Captain, and told him what <hi>Nettervile</hi> had related to him of the
buſineſs of Captain <hi>Kelly</hi> in the <hi>Tower;</hi> He told him the ſtory,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101286:9"/>
as you find in his Information. And further told the Captain,
that he had another Letter, which he was going to carry to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Kelly</hi> in the <hi>Tower;</hi> and <hi>Nettervile</hi> told him the ſaid Mr. <hi>Brooks,</hi>
that if Captain <hi>Kelly</hi> did not ſend him the 7 <hi>l.</hi> he the ſaid <hi>Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervile</hi>
did know enough to turn him out of the <hi>Tower.</hi> I have,
ſaith <hi>Brooks,</hi> taken a Copy of this Letter, and the Captain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
he might ſee it, which he did; and the Contents were to
ſignifie to Captain <hi>Kelly,</hi> what a fright the ſaid <hi>Nettervile</hi> had
been put into by Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> having been with
him. And therefore <hi>Nettervile</hi> deſired Captain <hi>Kelly</hi> to ſend him
the 7 <hi>l.</hi> to diſcharge him out of that priſon, leſt wroſe ſhould
come on it; and upon the Captains reading the Copy of the ſaid
Letter, he deſired Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> not to be too haſty in delivering
that Letter to Captain <hi>Kelly;</hi> but that he would draw up by
way of Information what he had told him, and go along with
the ſaid Captain to Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi> and give in the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and take his advice.</p>
            <p>So that on <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> the Captain and Mr.
<hi>Brooks</hi> went to Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi> and gave him the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the ſaid Letter with the Copy thereof; Then Sir <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
told the Captain and Mr. <hi>Brooks,</hi> that the Committee of Lords
was going to ſit, and that they ſhould attend at the Council-door,
and he would call them in, that they might know their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
pleaſure, as to the delivery of the Letter to Captain <hi>Kelly.</hi>
After debate, their Lordſhips were of opinin, That the Letter
ſhould not be delivered, but thought they had ſufficient ground
to ſeize Capt. <hi>Kelly,</hi> and to ſearch his houſe for <hi>Dominick Kelly,</hi>
and for papers; in order to which, Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> was ſent
for his Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who immediately came to
the Council, where the Lords acquainted his Grace with the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
and deſired he would give Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> a Warrant to fetch
Capt. <hi>Kelly.</hi> His Grace was pleaſed to ſend for his Secretary, and
ordered him immediately to draw a Warrant directed to Sir <hi>John
Robinſon,</hi> to aſſiſt them with a Guard, for executing the Warrant,
and <hi>Nettervile</hi> was ordered to be brought to the Council that
afternoon.</p>
            <p>And ſo the Captain and Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> accompanied with Sir
<hi>William Waller,</hi> went to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and being guarded by Sir
<hi>John Robinſon,</hi> came to Captain <hi>Kellys</hi> houſe, and there his Foot-boy
came to the door; and upon enquiry for his Maſter, the Boy
replied, he was not within; they askt him if he knew where he
was; the Boy told them no, for he dined abroad: They went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101286:9"/>
the Houſe, and in the Room where the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
they found Capt. <hi>Kelly,</hi> and brought him to the Council
with what papers they could find; but <hi>Nettervile</hi> had been exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and was gone away before, and had confeſſed the ſending
the Letters, and Capt. <hi>Kellys</hi> being with them in the <hi>Marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Captain thereupon was put into the Meſſengers hands,
and ordered to be brought before their Lordſhips next morning,
and <hi>Nettervile</hi> alſo (who were face to face at the Council-Table).</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Kelly</hi> denied that he knew this <hi>Dominick Kelly: Netter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi>
told him he would not deny ſurely that he was with them
at the <hi>Marſhalſeys,</hi> which Capt. <hi>Kelly</hi> then confeſſed; ſome of
their Lordſhips asked what he did at the <hi>Marſhalſeys?</hi> Captain
<hi>Kelly</hi> ſaid, he went to viſit Mr. <hi>Nettervile:</hi> Truly, ſaid <hi>Nettervile,</hi>
'twas kindly done of you, Sir, for I never ſaw or heard of you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
until your Cozen <hi>Dominick Kelly</hi> told me of you, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
me to ſend a Letter from him to you.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Kelly</hi> after Examination, was committed to a Meſſenger
again; but ſoon after he put in Bail, and I have heard there was
an Order of Council to turn him out of his employment. But
whether it be ſo, or no, I know not.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Ruſſel</hi> (upon the <hi>Thurſday</hi> after Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
had been with <hi>Nettervile</hi> at the priſon) came again to <hi>Netter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi>
and inſtead of being apprehended, as <hi>Nettervile</hi> promiſed
<hi>Lowman</hi> he ſhould, <hi>Nettervile</hi> gave him notice of the diſcovery,
and he went out immediately and ſcaped. And after he was
gone, <hi>Nettervile</hi> then told <hi>Lowman</hi> he had been there; they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
him, and ſaw him take Boat, but could not overtake him.
But Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> had a Warrant from Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> to
ſearch for him at his houſe; but his Wife told them, that he was
at the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors houſe, and had not lain at home in
ten or twelve Nights; which the Council being informed of,
were very diligent to apprehend him, and offered 20 <hi>l.</hi> to thoſe
that could diſcover him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> mentioned in the Depoſition, is a Rank <hi>Papiſt,</hi>
and an <hi>Iriſh</hi>-man, who married Madam <hi>Rowſe,</hi> the Dutcheſs of
<hi>Portſmouths</hi> Gentlewoman: <hi>Nettervile</hi> and <hi>Brewer</hi> are of the ſame
Faction, and are now Priſoners in the <hi>Marſhalſeys.</hi> The Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
Capt. <hi>Bury</hi> and Alderman <hi>Brooks,</hi> are both honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and good Proteſtants; and ſuch whoſe Principles deteſted
either to engage in, or conceal ſuch abominable Villany: However,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101286:10"/>
               <hi>Nettervile</hi> was ſo infatuated, as to conceive them fit to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligated.</p>
            <p>Now Reader, thou haſt ſeen the whole contrivance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
mayeſt eaſily diſcern what the intentions of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> were;
what the natural conſequence thereof would have been, I leave
to thy own conjecture, and ſhall only add this true circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
as a farther Confirmation of their wicked deſign in this
matter, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſeveral perſons (by them appointed) were a little before
this diſcovery at the Houſes of ſome <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> well known
in the City of <hi>London,</hi> to pray their charitable contribution
towards the maintenance of Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> upon
this ſpecious, though falſe ſuggeſtion, That His Majeſties allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
was not ſufficient for their incouragement; but the parties
to whom they applied themſelves (ſuppoſing their intentions
were to abuſe their King and Countrey, and to procure Coyn
for themſelves), rejected them with checks; and it was well they
did; for otherwiſe, who knows what advantage they might have
made thereof, in order to the effecting their wicked enterprize?</p>
            <p>And thus I have done, truſting to the Readers Candor; which
if a Proteſtant, I do not doubt of; if a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> neither expect or
care for it; I being one of quite different principles, and one
whoſe prayers, as well as endeavours, ſhall be conſtantly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
for the fruſtration of their helliſh Attempts.</p>
            <p>Concerning my intentions in the publication of theſe Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they were only for the publick good, and to expoſe to
view the wicked ſubtilties of theſe men, that the Nation (and
all true Proteſtants) may be made ſenſible of their devices; that
if ever they uſe the ſame, or the like again, they may be with the
more eaſe detected, and rendred abortive. And alſo that all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Chriſtians, may aſcribe the praiſe of all their deliverances
(as well of this as others) to that God who hath ſo viſibly and
conſtantly appeared for the Vindication of his people, and for
infatuating the perſons, as well as rendring unſucceſsful the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of his and their implacable Enemies.</p>
