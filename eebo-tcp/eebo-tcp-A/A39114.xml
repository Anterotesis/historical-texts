            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A LETTER FROM A <hi>Perſon of Quality.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU may wonder, that at this time of day I ſhould begin to talk to you of Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi>'s Death, for which I dare ſay both of us have before this, paid our juſt Tribute of Sorrow, and for whoſe Memory every <hi>True Proteſtant</hi> muſt have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Reſpect, ſo long as the Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of the <hi>Seven Biſhops</hi> remains upon Record; which I verily believe will be till time ſhall be no more: But ſome (as if this Glorious Action had not been enough to have ſecured his Fame to all Eternity) ſeem rather deſirous to tranſmit him to Poſterity by another Diſtinguiſhing Character; that of the Great Champion for <hi>Paſſive Obedience;</hi> thinking that to be a greater Honour than to be recorded for one of the great Maintainers and Aſſertors of the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh Liberties;</hi> For there is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſent abroad about our Country, atteſted not only by his own Hand, but alſo by ſeveral unqueſtionable Witneſſes, wherein the Good Biſhop on his Death-Bed declares, <hi>That he had been brought up in, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93983:3"/>
               <hi>taught others that great Doctrine of</hi> Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>which he always look't upon as the Diſtinguiſhing Character of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and that he would not have taken the Oath, though the Penalty had been Loſs of Life; but found great Satisfaction and Conſolation in his Mind becauſe he had not taken it; and theſe he deſired might be look'd upon as the Words of a Dying Man, and ſo repreſented to his Friends:</hi> But whether thoſe Friends had not done him as good Service if they had kept it to themſelves, and not repreſented it to the World, I think may be a Queſtion: for I muſt confeſs 'tis a little unaccountable to me what Deſigns they could have in Publiſhing it: For 'tis ſo far from being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary on the Biſhop's account, that 'twas really imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent: For he that at that time was under, and had ſubmitted to a Suſpenſion, meerly upon his refuſal of the Oaths, had certainly given the World as convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Proof of his Opinion, as if he had printed a Thouſand Volumes about it: So that there was no more occaſion (I think of making, but I am ſure) of Publiſhing ſuch a Declaration, than there is for my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Cant.</hi> to Print <hi>Manifeſtoes,</hi> to tell the People he is ſuſpended on the ſame account. And ſince there was ſo very little Reaſon to do it on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Score, the Motives and Deſigns had need be very good that can juſtifie their doing it on their own. Had either they or the Biſhop given us the Reaſons of his adhering to that Opinion, beſides that of his being bred and born in it, (an Argument that a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> may have for the Truth of their Religion), they might have obliged the World exceedingly; but the only Motives at leaſt that are to me apparent, for telling us what we knew before, I think might as well have been ſpared: for there are Two Inferences which may very eaſily be made from the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93983:3"/>
Paper, and which I ſuſpect was the chief aim in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Firſt is to inſinuate, that from the beginning of the Reformation, ever ſince the Church of <hi>England</hi> was reſtored to its Purity, <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> was the Corner-ſtone of it: for 'tis call'd, <hi>The Diſtinguiſhing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Church of</hi> England: ſo that it ſeems none was accounted her true Sons that did not hold it. Now if this be true, here's the whole Body of the Clergy in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days cut off from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at one blow; for 'tis not the Opinion of one or two private Prelates, but the whole <hi>Convocation,</hi> who agree not only in giving the Queen ſo very large Subſidies, but alſo in declaring the accounts on which they did it; and that was aſſiſting and protecting the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> and for abating all Hoſtilities againſt the true Profeſſors of Gods holy Goſpel, and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the free profeſſion of the Goſpel within and without Her Majeſties Dominions; and a great deal more to this purpoſe, as may be ſeen at large in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambles to the Three Subſidy Bills, given the 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> l. 24. the 35<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 12. and the 43<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 17. So that 'tis apparent it was their practice for Forty years, and I hope their Faith alſo: for I cannot be ſo uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable as to think they would ſin againſt their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and purchaſe Damnation at ſo dear a rate, as thoſe vaſt Sums they gave for the aſſiſtance of thoſe that I am ſure did reſiſt their Kings, and who according to the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> ought to have been look'd upon, and uſed as Rebels. And truly, whatever is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, their Doctrine was agreeable to their practice; for altho the Book of <hi>Homilies</hi> hath been ſo often cited for the confirmation of this Doctrine, yet the Example of <hi>David,</hi> which is ſo much recommended to us in the 2<hi>d Homily</hi> againſt <hi>Rebellion,</hi> for his Loyalty and our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that is we deſire to ſtand or fall by; for if the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93983:4"/>
may be allow'd to take up (as we are ſure <hi>David</hi> did againſt <hi>Saul)</hi> Defenſive Arms, I think they would be very unreaſonable to deſire any more. But this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been enlarged on by better Pens, I ſhall ſay no more of it; but cannot paſs by the Epithet of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Character of the Church of</hi> England, without ſome <hi>Animadverſions</hi> on it: And, firſt, I would ask you, Sir, whether you think it neceſſary for particular Churches to have particular <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Doctrines? For I muſt confeſs, to me (but if I am in an Error I hope you will correct it) it appears ſo far from neceſſary; that I think 'tis very inconvenient when particular Churches have ſuch diſtinguiſhing Doctrines: for I believe it has been the occaſion of all the Schiſms in the World. For ſince, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5. there is but <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm;</hi> and I may add, <hi>one Church, and one Truth.</hi> Why ſhould we not (at leaſt endeavour to) be all of one mind, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect little diſtinctions, which oftentimes create great Animoſities? of which our preſent Age can give too many ſad inſtances. But alas, the Diſeaſe did not begin, neither will it, I fear, end with us; for we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproving it in his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as that which occaſioned all their Diviſions; while one cryed he was of <hi>Paul,</hi> and another of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and I of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> and I of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So that it ſeems they did not only give their patticular Teachers the preference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, but alſo ſet them in oppoſition to Chriſt; but to ſuch I may ask the Apoſtles Queſtion, Who is <hi>Paul,</hi> or who is <hi>Apollos,</hi> but Miniſters by whom you have believed? But if <hi>Paul,</hi> or an Angel Preach any other Goſpel, let him be <hi>Anathema;</hi> and the ſame thing may, and I think ought to be ſaid of Churches, when they impoſe any thing but what is the true Catholick Faith. Therefore to ſay ſuch a Doctrine
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93983:4"/>
is particular to ſuch a Church, and that which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth it from the Catholick, is indeed to ſay the worſt thing in the World of it; and to own that is not any part of the Catholick Faith. And why Biſhop <hi>Lake,</hi> or any body, ſhould value a Doctrine ſo much on that ſcore, is that I cannot comprehend. And in my Opinion, it would more have become his Lordſhip, if as the Office for the Sick directs, he had made a Confeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith contain'd in the Apoſtles Creed, which unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he believ'd; but it would ſatisfy us <hi>Lay-people</hi> very much, if thoſe Gentlemen who have atteſted this <hi>Recognition</hi> of his <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Faith, would Print another Paper, to aſſure us that he rehearſed the Articles of our <hi>Common Creed;</hi> that we may not be miſled by the Example of a Biſhop, to depart from the Rules of the Church when we come to die, and inſtead of the Criſtian Faith, declare we believe juſt quite contrary to his <hi>Diſtinguiſhing</hi> Faith; that in ſome caſes <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> is lawful.</p>
            <p>But I fear I have already tired you by being ſo large on my Firſt Inference, therefore ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be as ſhort on the Second as I can, and that I take to be this; that from the Biſhops decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he would not have taken the Oath to have <hi>ſaved his Life,</hi> and that his not taking it was the <hi>great Conſolation</hi> he had at that time, they would inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate that the taking of the Oath is a very wicked unlawful thing: For they being the words of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man juſt going to receive the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> ought to be the more credited, and to make the deeper impreſſion; for ſo good a Man as he could not be eaſily deceived himſelf, and at ſuch time 'tis certain did not deſign to deceive others. To which I ſhall crave leave to Reply, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That as to the main
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93983:5"/>
Queſtion of the Lawfulneſs of the Oath, it has been ſo fully and ſo ſatisfactorily diſcuſſed already, that I am very confident you and I know ſome that have taken it with as good a Conſcience as Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> or any body could refuſe it with; therefore it would be ſuperfluous to ſay any thing on that point: But only wiſh that inſtead of urging any humane Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, both ſides would remember the Divine Rule of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 14. 3. <hi>Let not him that eateth deſpiſe him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> as to the Authority that Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi>'s Dying Words ought to have over mine or any Mans judgment, I muſt declare, that till Infallibility be, I will not ſay the diſtinguiſhing Character, but the inſeparable Attendant of a good Man, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that they ought to influence any body any farther than they appear true and reaſonable. For if dying Mens Sentiments were to be the Rule of our Faith, we ſhould have a very uncertain Standard. For you muſt know that once I was acquainted with a Papiſt, that I think, ſetting aſide his Opinion, was a very good Man, for he led a good Life; and when this Perſon came to die, he did it with as great confidence, and comfort too, as could be imagined; and expreſs'd as great ſatisfaction in his not being a Proteſtant, as the Biſhop could in not taking the Oaths. So that we may ſee 'tis only the ſtrong perſwaſion of the Party, and not the truth of the Tenets, that produces that ſort of Conſolation. For I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Biſhop himſelf would not have approved of the Argument, had I turned Papiſt on that dying Mans declaration. But it ſeems ſome think it no great matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what we turn now; for I hear ſome are ſo exceeding fierce, that they will hardly allow thoſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93983:6"/>
which have taken the new Oathes to be ſo much as out-lyers of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but to be ſure none muſt be within the Pail that have not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing character; and truly the number of the encloſed will be ſo ſmall, that King <hi>James</hi> himſelf could hardly have hoped to have contracted the Church of <hi>England</hi> in ſo ſmall a compaſs; and may in part be ſaid to have got his ends of us, for I am ſure he has done more miſchief by the Diviſions he has occaſioned among our ſelves, than he could have done by his Perſecutions. But although ſome Perſons indiſcreet Zeal have made them ſo uncharitable, I am as far from ſuppoſing it the temper of all the worthy Men of that Party, as I am from believing the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> in that <hi>unlimited</hi> ſence it was Preached up by ſome, was the univerſal Opinion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in any Age. For that it was not ſo for Forty Years of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign has been made pretty evident by matter of fact; and that it is not ſo at this day, I think may be demonſtrated by the ſame way of Argumentation. For although I might have ſuppoſed it poſſible that a few particular private Perſons might for intereſt ſake have diſclaimed their former Opinion, and comply'd with any thing; yet truly I have ſo much reſpect for the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as not to believe that the whole Body of them could be guilty of ſo mean a thing; to ſay no worſe of it. For really the Diſſenters, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, are ſo few, that had there not been ſome Names of note among them, they would hardly have been reckoned a number; which gives me great hopes that thoſe great and good Men, whom we look'd upon as the Pillars of our Church, will not forſake the ſtations they ſo well became, for the ſake of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular private Doctrine, which was no way eſſential

either to the being, or well-being of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but whoſe only uſe was to diſtinguiſh the Church of <hi>England</hi> from all the Churches in the World, and that is really from the Catholick Church. For this Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> ſeems to me to own, when he calls it the <hi>diſtinguiſhing Character</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and ſo truly it may ſtill continue if they pleaſe, for I believe there is no other Church ſo fond of it, as to rob us of it, if to be carried ſo high as ſome would have it. But if taken in its limited and true ſence, <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> muſt be acknowledged ſo neceſſary a Duty, that the World could not well ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. And I am very confident, that all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about it has been occaſioned by a little miſtake, in applying thoſe Rules to <hi>Communities,</hi> which were given to particular <hi>private Perſons,</hi> and only deſigned for ſuch. For although in my ſingle private capacity I ought to ſubmit to, and ſuffer the greateſt injuſtice, rather than diſobey the lawful Magiſtrate, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Government: Yet as I am an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, I think I am as much obliged, by all tyes both Civil and Sacred, to defend and maintain that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Conſtitution of which I am a Member, as I am to obey the King; and that being the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Obligation, ought to be diſcharged in the firſt place; but the ſafety of that being ſecured, Subjects ought to obey without any other reſerve. And this ſeems to me ſo evident, that I think it needs no further proof, though 'tis capable of the cleareſt, if it were neceſſary, as I hope it is not; for after all, I am very confident that the greateſt and beſt of our Diſſenters are of my mind in this point, as might very eaſily be proved, if they would pleaſe but truly to reſolve me one Queſtion; and that is, Whether they did not both wiſh and pray, that <hi>London-derry</hi> ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93983:7"/>
be delivered out of the hands of thoſe mercileſs Butchers? and this the excellency of their temper, as well as their Chriſtianity, obliging to, I cannot at all queſtion but they did; nay, I verily believe they would have gone further, and aſſiſted them with their Purſes, if they had known how to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed them Relief.</p>
            <p>And now pray let us a little conſider the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this; for if the Doctrine is true, <hi>That 'tis unlawful to take up Arms for the Defence of our Lives and Liberties,</hi> then all thoſe great and gallant Men were certainly great Rebels, and whoſoever did aſſiſt or abet them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd the ſame guilt: ſo that for any thing I ſee, we may all ſhake hands as to that matter. But in caſe I ſhould be miſtaken, and they were not ſo good natur'd (as I do ſtill believe they were), but did deſire that ſo many thouſand innocent perſons might fall into the hands of their bloody implacable Enemies: If, I ſay, they could wiſh this, it would give me a greater preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt the Doctrine than ever yet I had. Since it not only made them put off thoſe Bowels of Mercies which Chriſtians out to have for one another, but even deveſted them of common Humanity. For unleſs it be the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> I know no other Sect that is arrived to that height of Barbarity, as to wiſh, that ſo many thouſand perſons (who they never ſaw, nor never did them any wrong) ſhould periſh, only becauſe they were not of their Opinion; and if this could be their Temper, I'm ſure I would never be their Proſelyte; for I ſhould dread it as much as <hi>Popery</hi> it ſelf; and ſo truly I believe thoſe good men do. But I forget my ſelf, having already, I fear, exceeded the bounds of a Letter, and treſpaſs'd too much on your patience. But whatever the Effect may be, I hope the Cauſe is pardonable, becauſe it proceeds
