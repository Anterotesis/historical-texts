         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the welfare of his Subjects, and being carefull they might not lacke one in his abſence to adminiſter Iuſtice unto them, thought good to ſignifie his Royall Will and  Pleaſure, which was that all Birds; of what name, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or degree ſoever, ſhould repaire unto the Wood, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sylvia;</hi> and that there he purpoſed to chuſe one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them to rule the reſt; who could declare himſelfe to be moſt worthy in merit and deſert.

no ſooner made knowne through all thickets, hedges, and buſhie fields where Birds doe reſort, but that preſently their hearts were inflamed with ambition, every one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to prove himſelfe worthy of the Vice-regency or government, during the retiring of the King.

The <hi>Hawke</hi> tooke the Pardon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reade it, he gave <hi>Flywill</hi> the <hi>Buzard</hi> many thankes, for that he being ſo ſhort of wing, had tooke the paines to bring him theſe good tidings and ſo walking aſide with <hi>Cawwood</hi> the <hi>Rooke,</hi> as if they had conſulted about go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Court; the <hi>Hawke</hi> told the <hi>Rooke</hi> that this <hi>Buzard,</hi> (albeit he was a kin unto him, was a ſhame and diſgrace unto all <hi>Hawkes,</hi> being a Coward, and not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ceaſe on any thing but dead Carrion, or ſome ſcattered guts, or to take childrens bread and butter out of their hands, all which doe ſhew the baſeneſſe of his bréeding, and that he never came out of the true Neſt or Airy of the <hi>Hawkes;</hi> and therefore friend <hi>Rooke,</hi> ſéeing thou haſt béene accounted a cunning Politition in thy dayes, I would intreats thée to inſtruct me in ſome deviſe how we might make him a way, and yet have no hand in the matter. The <hi>Rooke</hi> ſcratching his head with one of his clawes ſtood ſtill a while, till at laſt turning to the <hi>Hawke,</hi> he told him, that there was a new invention come into his braine how to make away the <hi>Buzard,</hi> and ſet him going with a powder. After this they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe unto <hi>Flywill</hi> the <hi>Buzard,</hi> who never ſuſpected what they had contriv'd againſt him, but complained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that he had gotten a great cold in his head, by flying ſo farre in a rainy day, hée being onely us'd to haunt Warrens, and there to flie from one old trée to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo paſſe away the time. But no ſooner had the <hi>Rooke</hi> heard him ſay that he had gotten a cold, but hée preſently tooke hold of the occaſion, telling him that there was no better medicine for a cold than warmth; and
<pb facs="tcp:17834:4"/>
therefore if he would but tie his head about with a cloath, he ſhould finde that the rhume would preſently void it ſelfe, and runne out of his beake in a great abundance. The <hi>Buzard</hi> being full of paine with the headach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereunto, ſo that the <hi>Rooke</hi> very carefully and cunningly tyed a clout round about his head, and ſo bid him flie to the next trée. The fooliſh <hi>Buzard</hi> thinking hée could finde out the way for all he was blindfolded, tooke wing, and flew directly againſt the body of a great Oke, which beate him backe ſo violently, that he came flutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring through the boughes, till at laſt he caught hold on one of them with his talents, and ſo having pearch'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he thought to ſit there, till the <hi>Hawke</hi> and the <hi>Rooke,</hi>

               <p>How Rapax the Hawke, and Cawwood the Rooke came to the Court, and how the Eagle declared unto the Birds the reaſon why he called them together.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe <hi>Eagle</hi> being, as before mounted upon a Cedar, all the Birds in a circle ſat round about him, making ſuch a charme of ſeverall notes, tunes, and ditties, that if you had heard them, you would have ſworne you had never heard the like. As they were thus ſitting together, in came the <hi>Hawke</hi> and the <hi>Rooke</hi> with nimble wing, and tooke their place amongſt the other Birds. And ſo the <hi>Hawke</hi> having made obeyſance to the King, began in an eloquent ſpéech, to amplifie the Kings mercy, who had not onely granted him a frée pardon for all his former bloody offences, but alſo ſafe protection to come unto that
<pb facs="tcp:17834:5"/>
place. But the <hi>Eagle</hi> cut him off in his ſpéech, ſaying, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, I hope my mercy ſhall finde that reward which I expect, which is, that you will amend your life, for that is the beſt way to give me thankes, and ſatisfie the whole Common wealth of Birds, who elſe, though they dare not ſpeake yet openly, yet in their hearts they will condemne me of iniuſtice, for remitting the bloody mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſlaughters of my Subiects which you have day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed. But I have other matters to declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, &amp; therefore I would have you give attention, and ſo with his Scepter (which he held in one of his talents) making a ſigne unto them for ſilence. He began his Roiall ſpéech in this manner. My loving Subiects, it behodeth a King to be carefull of his Subiects, even from the higheſt to the loweſt; I therefore doe here profeſſe, that all my Subiects are equally deare unto me, ſo that my Coſin the <hi>Hawke</hi> is not more deare unto me than the little <hi>Wren.</hi> It behoveth me therefore that as I have made knowne my purpoſe unto you by my Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which is, to leave my Court of <hi>Sylvia,</hi> and flye into the ſolitary Deſarts of <hi>Arabia</hi>; ſo it is neceſſary for the eſtabliſhing of peace and quiet in my abſence, that I leave one to rule and governe over you; and to this end I have called you to this Aſſembly, that whatſoever Bird among you can prove himſelfe to be the worthieſt, either by parentage, merit, or deſert, or any other way, him I will make King in my abſence. Therefore let every one ſpeake boldly in the behalfe of themſelves, and urge what reaſons they can in their owne practiſe. The Birds hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this began to clappe their wings, and with chirping and chattering gave a great applauſe to the <hi>Eagles</hi> ſpéech.</p>

So that packing up her ſelfe, and getting upon a ſmall twigge, from whence ſhee might be ſéene of all the company, ſhe began moſt earneſtly to deſire the Kingly <hi>Eagle</hi> to make her his ſubſtitute; for ſayes ſhe, though I am but a <hi>Wren,</hi> and of a ſmall body, yet my heart is as bigge as the beſt; and for my wit and policy, you may ſée it in building my neſt, and the workemanſhip thereof.

            </argument>
            <p>THe <hi>Eagle</hi> like a wiſe King having all this while colected the chiefe matter of their ſpéeches, he began to ſpeake unto them in this manner. My loving Subiects, I have
<pb facs="tcp:17834:9"/>
heard what you have ſpoken in the behalfe of your ſelves. You <hi>Robert</hi> have pleaded well for your ſelfe, and ſo have you Lady <hi>Philomel,</hi> and all the reſt, whoſe names for brevity ſake I omit. But yet you have not ſhewed me any vertues worthy of royall dignitie. For in that <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi> was a Kings daughter, and <hi>Mavis</hi> the <hi>Pye</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a King, yet theſe are but the fictions of Poets, and I had rather have you make it appeare that your breſts are filled with Iuſtice, Temperance, Magnanimitie, Mercy, and ſuch other Vertues, which are required in a King. For to boaſt of Parentage, or gifts of Nature, as your faire white feathers, or of Art, as Languages, Learning, and the like, they may be eſtéemed ornaments to private men: but Princes ſhould have Power to make them fear'd, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to make them be beloved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in none of you I finde thefe qualities: and therefore ſince you have all ſpoken your mindes, I would faire know why my Coſen <hi>Rapax</hi> the <hi>Hawke</hi> hath ſate mute all this while. The <hi>Hawke</hi> hearing himſelfe named by the <hi>Eagle,</hi> anſwered thus. May it pleaſe your highneſſe. I know that my former offences, and bloody murthers are ſo odious and hatefull in the ſight of the birds, that I dare not open my beake to pronounce a ſyllable in my owne behalfe. But yet might it pleaſe them to remit and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give my former offences, and pardon what is paſt, I would promiſe (if ſo be your Maieſty ſhould make me your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute) to rule over the Commonwealth of Birds, with Iuſtice, temperance, and equitie, inſtéed of killing and ſlaying them with my Talents, I would protect them from the inuiry of Owles and other bloud ſuckers, who in the Winter evenings doe pull the ſmall birds out of the buſhes, and ſo prey upon them Then they ſhould ſpend their dayes peaceably, ſléepe ſecurely, ſing ſwéetly, féede plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and live merrily. And beſides, as I have power to ſway the Empire, ſo I promiſe to rule over the Commonwealth of Birds, with Iuſtice and equitie, and to give them the better aſſurance that I will not prove a Tyrant, I am willing to have my Talents pared off. Therefore if the birds doe like of my offer, to ſhew their conſent thereunto let them clappe their wings.

            <p>AFter the birds had conſented to the <hi>Hawkes</hi> ſpéech. The <hi>Hawke,</hi> becauſe they had no edge tooles amongſt them, put his talents into the clift of a trée, and ſo never left pulling, till hee had pulled them quite off, and yet the hope of Soveraignety was ſo ſwéete unto him that he felt no paine therein Being thus unable to hurt The <hi>Eagle</hi> roſe out of his ſeate, and cauſed the <hi>Hawke</hi> to ſit therein, and afterward delivered his Scepter unto him, and put his Crowne upon his head, and then charged him to remember his promiſe, which was, to have a care of his ſubiects, and be loving unto them; as alſo to heare their complaints, to redreſſe their greevances, and to yéeld them reléefe. And this ſee you performe, as you tender or reſpect your owne life; for if at my returne from the <hi>Arabian</hi> Deſart. I finde that you have wrong'd my Subiects, you ſhall be ſure to die for it. The Hawke anſwered, that he hoped his Maieſtie ſhould commend him at his returne, and not finde any iuſt cauſe of puniſhment, for though I have béene heretofore counted cruell, and have plumed upon the Carkaſſe of many a ſmall bird, as Larkes, and Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and ſometimes upon Doves, Partridges, Quailes, &amp; the like, yet now your ſubiects ſhall finde me full of mercy, for indéede I was then enforced to be cruell by neceſſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At theſe words the <hi>Eagle</hi> tooke wing, ſo taking ſome few birds of note with him, he flew away, and when theſe birds
<pb facs="tcp:17834:10"/>

               <p>How the Hawke behaved himſelfe after the departure of the Eagle, and how he requited Cawwood the Rooke for teaching him to make away the Buzzard, as is ſhewed in the firſt Chapter.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe <hi>Eagle</hi> being gone, the <hi>Hawke</hi> behaved himſelfe very lovingly for the firſt wéeke; as <hi>Nero,</hi> the firſt five yeares of his raigne was counted the beſt of Kings, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he proved the worſt of Tyrants: ſo the <hi>Hawke</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his nature for a wéeke or fortnight, but afterward he had a great deſire to ſhed blood, and therefore he began to thinke how he might put <hi>Cawwood</hi> the <hi>Rooke</hi> to death, and requite him for his former kindneſſe in betraying the <hi>Buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,</hi> and making him ſtand blinde folded with a clout about his head, till one came by and ſhot him with a birding-péece. Now to bring this to paſſe, he called many of the little birds together, and told them, that what cruelty he had formerly committed, was by the encouragement of the <hi>Rooke,</hi> who made him beléeve, that ſeing nature had allotted him no other foode, it was lawfull for him to prey upon all ſorts of birds, and that now he was afraid leaſt he ſhould put into his mind, the ſame bloody principles againe, and therefore to avoid ſuſpition. My loving Subiects ſaith he, if any of you can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him of any hainous crime, (as I know he is guilty of many) I will grant you a day of hearing againſt him, that ſo, if he cannot cleere himſelfe, he may ſuffer the puniſhment of death, which is due unto his deſarts: no ſoner had the <hi>Hawke ſpoken</hi> theſe words, but preſently they told his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, that they had every one cauſe to complaine againſt
<pb facs="tcp:17834:11"/>
him, and therefore if he were once ſummoned to the Court, they would be all ready to accuſe him.</p>

               <p>THey who employ others in wickedneſſe never love them any longer, untill their owne purpoſe is effected, as may appeare by the Hawke, who ſought the life of the Rooke, after he had us'd his invention to make away the Buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.

            </argument>
            <p>THe Hawke began now to make knowne his blooddy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore ſent <hi>Corvino</hi> the Crow to ſummon the Rooke to appeare at the Court of <hi>Sylvia,</hi> who according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came at the day appointed, not doubting to receive any iniury from the Hawke, being alwayes his friend, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not fearing that now being made King, he would uſe his power to his deſtruction, but it proved far otherwiſe, for no ſooner was <hi>Cawwood</hi> come unto the Hawkes preſence but the Hawke commanded him to ſtand forth and anſwer to ſuch matters as ſhould be laid againſt him, for ſaies he, friend Rooke there are many complaints made againſt you, and I muſt doe iuſtice as I promiſed the Eagle at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. When the Rooke heard this, he began to change co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and his feathers began to ſtand up on end, what thought he ſhall I be betrayd by a Traytor, yet at laſt ſéeing no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, he was faine to ſtand to it, while the Birds gathered round about him, béeing all ready to complaine againſt him; and firſt <hi>Rubert</hi> the <hi>Robert</hi> began his enditement.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am glad that we ſmall Birds have now frée liberty to ſhew our wrongs and gréevances, which we have received from <hi>Cawwood</hi> the <hi>Rooke,</hi> who upon a time brought me in danger of my life, for one day as he and I were walking in a field by a hedge ſide, we chanced to come where there was a turfe ſet up with two ſtickes, and a little hole digged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath it; I began to aske him what it was. O ſayes hée doe you not know what this is, then you have loſt many a faire worme, for it is never without one or two, and therefore (ſaies he) if you hop into the bottome of it, you ſhall finde my words true, but quoth I is there no danger in it? O no (ſayes he) Ile warrant you for danger, whereupon I beléeving him, leapt upon the forked ſticke, and no ſooner was I lighted thereon, but preſently the turfe fell upon my head, ſo that I was made cloſe priſoner in the Pitfall, and there I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, till at laſt a waggiſh boy, who had made the Pitfall came and tooke me out, and with great ioy carried me to his mother, but ſhe telling him that it was ill lucke to hurt a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, at laſt the boy was content onely to cut of my tayle and let me flye, whereby I eſcaped the danger that the <hi>Rooke</hi> had brought me into, and therefore I deſire that we may have iuſtice on him.</p>

               <p>WIth the ſame malitious minde, though not in the ſame manner, <hi>Cawwood</hi> the <hi>Rooke</hi> brought me in danger and perill of my life. For one froſty morning there being a great many Limeſtrawes ſet on a dunghill, <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> the <hi>Rooke</hi> went amongſt them and ſpying mee upon the top of a Barne, called me downe unto him, and hid me come to him, for there were a great many Wheate eares ſcattered on the ground, whereupon I being ſomewhat hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, by reaſon of the could froſty weather came flying to him, and no ſooner had I begun to pecke on one of the eares, but ſtraight the end of one of the limed ſtrawes caught me by the backe, and another under the wing, ſo that I had much a doe
<pb facs="tcp:17834:12"/>
to get from thence, for when he that watcht the ſtrawes ſaw me limed and taken, he came running out to catch me, but then with all the ſtrength I had, I made towards a hedge, and having gotten into the bottome thereof eſcaped the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers hands.

               <head>The Complaint of the Woodcocke.</head>
               <p>MAy it pleaſe you, I was once comming through a Wood with this Trayter <hi>Cawwood</hi> the <hi>Rooke,</hi> and as we went, there was two or thrée ſtickes ſet iuſt croſſe the path, with one great bended ſticke, whereon was a nooſe of haire. And as we came to them I asked the Rooke what this meant, why ſayes he it is a ſwing, whereon I am wont many times to ſtretch my ſelfe, at theſe words like a <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke</hi> as I was, I went to take hold of the great ſticke, and thought to have ſwong upon it, but no ſooner had I ſet my foote upon the Bridge but the Spring flew up, and caught me by one of the legges, ſo that there I lay upright, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every houre when the Fowler would come to fetch me, and if the haire nooſe had not broken, I had certainly long ere this béene roſted, and ſerved up to ſome rich mans Table. The <hi>Woodcocke</hi> had no ſooner ended his complaint, but there came in a <hi>Thruſh</hi> and a <hi>Starling</hi> like maymed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers hopping upon one legge, and ſéeing <hi>Cawwood</hi> the <hi>Rooke</hi> ſtanding at the barre. The Thruſh, becauſe ſhe was the better ſpeaker began to tell their caſe; how that <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> the <hi>Rooke</hi> made them beléeve that a Birding-péece was but a pipe which men uſed to play upon, whereupon one morning a Fowler comming towards us with a Péece, we thinking to heare his pipe ſafe ſtill, ſo that he taking his ayme diſcharged againſt us, and ſhot me into the legge, and my brother <hi>Starling</hi> into the wing. Thus hath the <hi>Rooke</hi> with his craft deceived us many times, and many a bird hath hee brought to untimely end by his cunning.

               <p>How Cawwood the Rooke, would have anſwered for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but that Rapax the Hawke would not ſuffer him, but condemned him to perpetuall baniſhment.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHen <hi>Rapax</hi> the <hi>Hawke</hi> had heard theſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the <hi>Rooke,</hi> he was very glad thereof, And yet (as it is the nature of cunning trechery) he ſéemed to pitty his calamitie, and told him he was ſorry to heare ſo many foule matters urged againſt him. I have alwayes (ſaies he) had a good opinion of you, but I ſée how much we may be deceived. And I wiſh that ſome other might give judgement on your crimes and offences, but yet ſince it hath pleaſed the <hi>Eagle</hi> to give me all power, and to put the Scepter of juſtice into my talents, there ſhall no reſpect of friendſhip ſway me, and therefore you muſt looke for no more mercy at my hands, then iuſtice will permit. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit you are my friend, yet I muſt prove my ſelfe a loyall ſubiect to the <hi>Eagle,</hi> who hath put me in truſt to ſee rewards and puniſhments equally diſtributed amongſt his ſubiects, and this I take to be the true nature of Iuſtice. At theſe words the <hi>Rooke</hi> began to prepare himſelfe, and would faine have anſwered the obiection of his adverſaries, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſhew that it was not his craft, but their folly which brought them into danger; for (ſaith he) if Rubert the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> will néeds be péeping into a Pitfall, who can helpe it? or if the <hi>Woodcocke</hi> will take a Springs for a Swinge it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s not my cunning but their ſimplicitie which brings them into danger, which by eſcaping they have learned more wit, and ſo ought in iuſtice to give me thankes, for now they know how to avoide the like perills hereafter. Beſides all this, you that ſit to condemne me, ought not to ſéeke my life, but to ſave me from my enemies, for you know how for your ſake I contriv'd an excellent device to make away <hi>Fliwell</hi> the <hi>Buzzard.</hi> But at that word the <hi>Hawke</hi> commanded them to ſtop his mouth, and that with a nooſe of haire they ſhould forthwith ſtrangle him. When the <hi>Rooke</hi> ſaw there was no way but death, he began to intreat for mercy, whereupon the
<pb facs="tcp:17834:13"/>
               <hi>Hawke</hi> conſidering better with himſelfe, pronounced this ſentence againſt him. In regard that thou <hi>Cawwood</hi> the <hi>Rooke</hi> haſt highly tranſgreſſed and offended againſt the Commonwealth of Birds, by deceiving <hi>Phillip</hi> the <hi>Sparrow, Rubert</hi> the <hi>Robin,</hi> and <hi>Longbill</hi> the <hi>Woodcocke,</hi> I doe here baniſh thée out of the Country, and ſend thée to live for ever in the Citie. Since which time the Citie hath béene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes full of <hi>Rookes.</hi> For no ſooner was the ſentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but the Parliament of Birds broke up, and the <hi>Rooke</hi> flew away to the Citie, where he hath ever ſince remained, there being divers ſorts of <hi>Rookes,</hi> as for example, your chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gameſter is a <hi>Rooke,</hi> and your fellowes that cheate Countrymen are <hi>Rookes,</hi> the Tapſter that fills not his pot is a <hi>Rooke,</hi> and he that drinkes with you and ſlips away when the reckoning comes to be payd is a <hi>Rooke.</hi> And to conclude there are ſo many ſorts of <hi>Rookes</hi> that I cannot reckon them, for ſometimes your <hi>Rooke</hi> will be in the ſhape of a decayd gallant, ſometimes in a thredbare Cloake wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at Bowling Allies, ſometimes in a blew Ierkin like a Countryman, and ſometimes in the Market in the ſhape of a Cutpurſe.
