         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

without any vulgar use; but now having the approbation of some judicious Divines my Friends and Acquaintance, I am resolved (maugre all the malice of <hi>Belial's</hi> Brats, who fancy nothing but to satiate themselves with terrene pleasures and profits) to propose it to the reading &amp; perusing of all that chearfully endeavour to know the Lord Iesus, and him crucified, to the salvation of their soules; in comparison whereof the whole World, &amp; all things therin cannot afford the least parallel.</p>

I doubt not, but you well consider, what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable thing it is to be one of the Lords Iewels; as all his children are termed, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. whereas others are compared to the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somest of all vessels,<note place="margin">

Once more, meditate upon the Honourable Prerogatives Gods children have: for their noblenesse they are the Sons of God; for their education, they are the Schollers of Christ; for their protection, the Angels are their servants; for their calling, they are Saints; for their riches, it is Christ, and with him all things else; for their life, it is spirituall, for

            <p>Some Scriptures serve especially to direct, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie our affections and actions,<note place="margin">Levit. 19.2.</note> by perswading to vertue: some by disswading from vice:<note place="margin">Deut. 32.35.</note> so 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19.</p>
            <p>Againe, some texts of Scripture treate of single matters; some of sundry matters, joyned together: so <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. here <hi>Paul</hi> treateth of faith, the nature and effects of it;<note place="margin">Hab. 2.4. Lev. 18.5.</note> 
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11, 12. here he treateth not of saith simply, but of confirming a doctrine, that wee are justified by faith, and refuting an errour, that we are not justified by the workes of the Law; <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. here is treated of divers joyned together. This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Reader should observe.</p>
            <p>Having observed the nature and scope of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be handled,<note place="margin">Reduction.</note> let him that teacheth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reduce them to some generall head, as to some one of the Commandements, or to some ground of faith, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9. Or to <hi>Act.</hi> 2.25, 30. where <hi>Peter</hi> reduceth <hi>Davids</hi> 16. <hi>Psal.</hi> to the doctrine of Christs resurrection.</p>
            <p>If the Scripture serve not so much to informe the mind, as move the affections, then consider which of the affections it most concernes, whether repentance, and sorrow, or hatred and shunning of vice, or love of God and our neighbour, and of vertue and feare of God, or consolation and patience in afflictions, or mercy and compassion to the poore and afflicted.</p>
            <p>If the text be an history,<note place="margin">History.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note> (for as much as whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is written is for our learning) the teacher should
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47988:7"/>
reduce the story of some generall point of doctrine, or doctrines, either of the Law or of the Gospell; either from knowledge, or conversation. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.41. Christ draweth the history of the Ninivites to the doctrine of repentance from dead workes: so the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Elias</hi> is drawne to the doctrine of Prayer, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16, 17. so the history of <hi>Noah,</hi> is by <hi>Peter</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Doctrine of Gods mercy and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. by <hi>Paul</hi> to the Doctrine of faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7.</p>
            <p>If the text divide it selfe into sundry parts,<note place="margin">Division and Order.</note> or points of doctrine, order in handling must be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and point after point, duly entreated of without confusion, which is hurtfull both to the teacher and learner; according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. and to 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. Let not divisions be curious, or manifold, for they trouble and confound the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Weighing the words.</note>Every word in the text should be weighed with the true and proper meaning of the same, for an error in one word, may marre the whole sense of the Scripture, as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.16. some read it thus (<hi>If thou hatest her, put her away</hi>) where the text is corruptly translated, (for he hateth putting away) that is, God hateth divorce,<note place="margin">Figurative words.</note> these senses be contrary.</p>
            <p>If the Words be against the common light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, being taken properly, wee must understand them figuratively, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. reason sheweth that this is but a similitude. Figurative speeches are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and of many sorts, which by much labour, and observation, must be learned and understood, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.10.</p>
            <p>The coherence, circumstances, and scope of the Scripture handled, must be carefully weighed: so <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 3.7, &amp;c. and 4.1.7. where hee scanneth the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47988:7"/>
words, and circumstances of that sentence.<note place="margin">Scriptures compared.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The surest way to expound the Scriptures is by the Scriptures themselves, comparing place with place: so <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.9. so <hi>Paul</hi> conferreth many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p>The principall matters and circumstances in a text are most to be insisted on, others not to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but more briefly handled, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.8. here the nature of contention, and the duties of brotherhood, are duly to be particularized; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. here the word <hi>brethren</hi> is not so much to be insisted on, as the more weighty purposed doctrine.</p>
            <p>Speciall regard must be had of gathering do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,<note place="margin">Collecting doctrines.</note> and applying them: Doctrines may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the cause of a thing, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.10. where Christs God-head is proved by the making of the world. So also by the effects, adjuncts, comparisons, contraries, and as the doctrines of Christ, and his Apostles, every where from the old Testament do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</p>
            <p>Application is when the doctrine generally,<note place="margin">Application.</note> or concerning others, is by the teacher applyed to the time, or persons present:<note place="margin">Psal. 95.7, 8.</note> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23, 24. So <hi>Paul</hi> applyeth that of the <hi>Psalm.</hi> to his present time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7. and 4.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Application is to be made in wisedome, according to the time, persons, occasions, and matters in hand,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.7.</note> so <hi>Noahs</hi> history is applyed by <hi>Paul</hi> to faith, by <hi>Peter</hi> to Gods mercy and judgement, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. by Christ to the security of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.37, 38.</p>
            <p>The manner of delivering the Word, should be with simplicity, sincerity, and godly purenesse, and not with affected words, flattering speeches, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wisedome. <hi>And I brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of words, or of humane wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

               <p>God hath the most excellent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that is, the Essence of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all in God is Essentiall, therefore this is infinite, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as the Godhead is; therefore the things which it understandeth must also be eternall. Therefore it must be most perfect, as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is most perfect. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more perfect than God, therefore nothing but God can be the eternall act of Gods understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Therefore Gods understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath reflection eternally to it selfe, as when a mans mind think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon it selfe.</p>
               <p>The understanding hath in it an image of the thing understood; therefore God eternally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing himselfe, conceived a most perfect image of himselfe.</p>
               <p>This most perfect bringing forth of the Image in the Godhead, is rightly called a conception, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for it is the bringing forth of a thing most like to God, and the conception or bringing forth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47988:11"/>
of a thing most like it selfe, is generation; the more perfect the nature of the begetter is, the more neare, and conjoyned is the thing begotten; and Gods life being most perfect, and it being all an understanding, needs must this conception of his be most perfect; And so a most perfect generation, which is a second manner of beeing,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> called the Image, (or person) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Image of the Sonne of God, the Image of his <hi>hypostasis.</hi> And seeing that which God understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and his Essence is one and the same, needs must the Essence, and excellencie of the Father, and the Sonne, be both one, and eternall. Thus God cannot be minded to be, but with his coeternall Sonne.</p>
               <p>As there is an understanding in the Godhead, so needs must there be a will also, and the more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the more, and perfecter is the will, and in God there being a perfect understanding, there must be also needs a perfect will; and as the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is active essentially in the Godhead, so is the will; and as hee understandeth himselfe, as the most perfect thing, so also hee willeth himselfe as the most perfect good; and thus the will reflecteth as did the understanding. Gods infinite wil imbracing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite willed thing, there must needs be infinite love, and highest pleasure proceede there-from: so whilst the eternall Father conceiveth his Sonne, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly willeth it, there must needs be full and perfect love from the Father to the Sonne, and from the Sonne to the Father, so from both proceedeth a third manner of beeing, called the third person, the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>It is called a Spirit for three causes;<note place="margin">The Holy Spirit.</note> 1 Because love is the inforcing, or motive of the Will, to the thing loved, and as it were, a spiring and breathing to it; and because the Father breatheth in love to the Sonne, and the Sonne againe to the Father, therefore the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47988:11"/>
Holy Spirit is right said to proceed from them both. 2 It is called a Spirit, because the proceeding of the motive betweene the Father and the Sonne, is by a hidden way. 3 Because Gods children perceive Gods gifts, the gifts of love, by secret inspiration.</p>
               <p>It is called holy to discerne it from other spirits,<note place="margin">Why called Holy.</note> and because nothing can be more holy than this in God, and because it maketh holy, and sanctifieth the Church.</p>
               <p>And seeing Gods Will and Essence is one in him, the Holy Ghost must needs be one with the Father, and the Sonne, coequall, and eternall. Thus by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted principles from Gods essence, there are three manner of subsistings in God, and there can be neither more nor lesse, unlesse we will deny God.</p>

                  </note>Gods vertues in respect of his will are bounty, and justice: Bounty is that, by which out of love, God procureth to every creature the good thereof, and it is common, and particular: common bounty is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all creatures, even such as offend him, directing them to their naturall good, and sustaining them therein, so long as justice suffereth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.36. God cannot hate his creatures,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.11.</note> as his workes, for so they carry a similitude of God, the first cause: and none can hate himselfe, or his similitude, for a similitude is something of himselfe. Gods bounty to his creatures presupposeth not any debt or duty, which implyeth imperfection; and if God were bound to his creatures, he should depend on them, and be imperfect.</p>
               <p>Gods bounty which is infinite, giveth creatures good things, of nature, of soule, and body, and of outward things.</p>
               <p>Such is Gods bounty, as the creatures suffer no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, unlesse Gods justice require it, or a greater good confirme it; of this vertue God is called patient, and long suffering.</p>
               <p>Particular, or speciall bounty, is that whereby God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47988:13"/>
loved some men (in Christ) fallen into sinne,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.4, 5.</note> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth them to eternall salvation. Gods speciall bounty, is the first beginning, both of salvation, and of the meanes thereto. This bounty is no inherent quality in us, but wee are the object of it, it is a grace making us gratefull, not finding us so.<note place="margin">4 <hi>Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Gods Justice is a vertue by which he executeth his love to reasonable creatures, giving rewards to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and punishment to the obstinate, <hi>Gen</hi> 18.24.</p>
               <p>Gods Justice is essentiall and unchangeable, as hee cannot of his bounty forgive the creatures punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unlesse his justice be satisfied.</p>
               <p>Gods vertue in respect of his understanding,<note place="margin">5 <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </note> and will together, is truth, or veracity, whereby he so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesteth himselfe to the reasonable creature, both by words, signes, and workes, as indeed hee is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.3.</p>
               <p>God hath in himself the patterne of all true things, so that whatsoever in the creature is true, is so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the first truth in the mind of God.</p>
               <p>Truth in God is essentiall, and so unchangeable;<note place="margin">Rom 3.4.</note> but truth in man is contingent, and so changeable.</p>
               <p>Seeing Gods truth is essentiall, his testimony must needs be authenticke.

               </p>
               <p>Gods actions are either the decreeing of things, or the execution of the decree.</p>
               <p>Gods decree, purpose, or counsell, is his purpose of exercising operations about the creatures, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing them unto their end: God worketh all things after the counsell of his owne will, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.28.</p>

                  <hi>Mans first sinne is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called disobedience, or fall, for the Law was significatively given to testifie man to be subject to Gods Law, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. And whereas before man walked with a steady foote in Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, by this fact hee stumbled, and fell from the seat of integrity. The efficient immediate cause was man himselfe, of his owne free will, without any necessity, inward or outward, transgressing the Law. The efficient cause remote, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, was the Devill tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting man to sinne. The instrumentall cause was the serpent, whose tongue the Devill abused to frame arguments to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile with. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or causes to move inwardly were first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly perswading for good, that they should be as Gods. Secondly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading from feare of punishment. Adde to these the two qualities in the tree: first, that it was good to eate: secondly, to be desired in the eye; these two might perswade</hi> Adam <hi>to eate, if hee could do it carefully, but the other two of Satan was directly to perswade to sinne, as it is sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Angels that fell to be Devils, and malitious, sought leave of God to tempt mankind, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. with <hi>Job</hi> 1.6, 11, 12. and 2.3, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>The Devill used the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the subtillest beast of the field, for his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for it could more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily creepe into the garden secretly, and carrieth with it a shew of smooth simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: hee first assault the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and beguiled her, then by the woman the man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. The woman was stirred to sin by outward meanes, and by inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The outward meanes was partly the alluring words of the serpent, partly the forbidden fruits beauty. The serpents words, after he had made a subtill entrance of communication with the woman, containe 4. horrible evils, 1 Fraud, &amp; imposture, <hi>Ye shall not surely die, Gen</hi> 3.4. 2 Against Gods Word, and truth, in faying they should not die, if they did eate, but be like Gods, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.4, 5. 3 Calumniation of God, as if for envie of mans good, he had forbidden the eating of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47988:19"/>
the fruit. 4 Wresting of Gods Word, and of the name of the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as if it were so called, because it had vertue in it, to give men such knowledge of good and evill, as God himselfe hath, who is to continue in good, and avoid evill for ever. Thus the serpent sought to alienate the mind and will of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> from God, and from his Word.</p>
               <p>The inward meanes to draw unto sinne,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note> was the fairenesse of the forbidden fruit, which the woman saw to be gracefull to the eyes.</p>
               <p>The inward motions of the woman to sinne were generally three: first, the lust of the flesh, for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man saw that the tree was good for meate. Secondly, the lust of the eyes, for shee saw it was pleasant to the eyes. Thirdly, the pride of life, for shee saw it was a tree to be desired to get knowledge; and of these three the Apostle speaketh:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.16.</note> more particularly her inward motions may be minded by their degrees; first, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Serpents suggestions: Secondly, a dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of her thoughts concerning God, and the image of God within her: thirdly, forgetfulnesse of Gods workes, and words: Fourthly,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.22.</note> a doubtfulnesse of the truth of God: Fifthly, an affection of a better state, &amp; more dignity. Sixthly, a beliefe of the Devils impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. Seventhly, an inclination of the will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the forbidden fruit.</p>
               <p rend="small">The causes by accident were both mans affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be like God, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections God had given him to be used orderly, for Gods actions made in man tended to the glorious I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. Secondly, also natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection to the savoury tree for conserving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing naturall life, the efficacie of all these causes man could and should have resisted, rejecting the outward, subjecting, and ordering the inward: had hee so done, hee had beene conserved. The matter of this sinne, is the eating of the forbidden fruit, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse of the act, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forbidden by Gods Law. The end, or finall cause of evill is done: but the end of the act (as it had a shew of good) was that man might be as God, knowing good and evill.</p>
               <p>When these lusts had conceived they brought forth sinne, for the woman tooke of the forbidden fruit, and did eate.</p>
               <p>the woman having sinned,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47988:20"/>
sought to propagate her sinne, and was the devils instrument to tempt her husband, and he also did eate: there is no mention of the womans perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the man; nor how sinne seised upon him; but the same degrees may be minded in him also, as were in her; this one more especially, his immoderate love and affection to his wife, that made him yeeld so suddenly to her tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adams</hi> sinne yeelding, and falling as it is set downe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. noteth the marvellous force and swiftnesse that is in the first motions of sinne, whose worke even in a moment, and suddenly, doth deprive of life and grace, even as a mans naturall life is taken away in a moment of an hower, which is many monthes ere it came to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of birth.</p>
               <p>It added much to the greatnesse of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, that the fruit which hee eate was of the Sacramentall tree, and so hee violate the divine mystery through ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be like God himselfe.</p>
               <p>It much increased their sinne also, that they had Gods Image, and perfection of grace, not for them alone,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> but for all their posterity, if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Gods feare; who lost the same not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves onely, but deprived all their seed of these
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47988:20"/>
blessings: thus our first parents fall was not onely sinne, but the cause of sinne. Thus much of the first sinne, and entrance of it, now followeth a secondary sinne, which is propagation and fruit of the first, and this is of two sorts; first, native corruption; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, actuall transgression.<note place="margin">The first sin was not proper to the first parents, but common to all, who sinned in his loynes.

               </p>

               <p>This native corruption is called flesh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. It is called also lust or concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14.</p>
               <p>So then not the substance of our flesh, or nature of our flesh is sinne, but the vitious quality adherent, or cleaving thereto.</p>

               <p>Originall sinne possesseth the whole man, body, and soule,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.17.</note> and spirit, as the image of God was not in the body onely, but in the whole man, so was this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry privation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24.</p>
               <p>Native corruption is propagated from parents to children, by reason of the beginning thereof, not properly by it selfe, that is to say, that commeth from the parents to the children, whereof this sinne may arise, namely a disposition to such an evill tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of the man, as was in originall sinne: There is an impression from the mother to the children, in her wombe, of which impression, this sinne buddeth; as tinder taketh fire, which is not fire it selfe; this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression children draw, as they do naturall diseases, as stone,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.5.</note> gout, not the actuall griefes, but impressions, which are the beginnings of them: Though the soule be not in the seed, yet is there in it a dispositive vertue of the body, for the receiving of the soule, which when it is put into the body,<note place="margin">Soule of man.</note> it conformed in his manners thereunto; hence it is that one angry man begetteth another, one harty man another: for though the feet, which is the subject of the gout, be not in the head, nor the soule, which is the subject of anger, be not in the seed, a formative vertue of the naturall members,<note place="margin">Gen. 5.3.</note> and a dispositive vertue unto the soule.</p>
               <p>The soule is at one instant both created and united unto the body, and deprived of the grace of the spirit, which <hi>Adam</hi> had for all, and lost for all; as actuall sinne is done by the persons sinning, so originall sinne is the sinne of nature, done by the will of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of humane nature: for as one man hath many members, so one mankind hath many persons; and as one actuall sinne done by the hand, and not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the guilt, from the will of the hand, but from the whole heart, from which, as from a fountaine,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47988:21"/>
the motions of sinne are derived unto the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, so from the will of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of mankind, the whole inordination of nature hath the reason of guilt: and as actuall sinne, which is the sinne of the person, is drawne unto all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by some personall act, so originall is drawne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men, by naturall act, which is generation: and as humane nature is drawne by gnneration, so the defect of humane nature is drawne also,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.

               <p>Originall sinne remaineth in the baptized, and in the regenerate, and in their posterity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. and man begetteth children, not by the spirit, but by the flesh, and therefore hee draweth not the spirit, but the flesh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Ps.</hi> 51.7. yet hath not Originall sinne so great degree and efficacie in the regenerate, as in the wicked.</p>

Secondly, in respect of the will,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.5.</note> a ready inclination to take hold on, and to performe evill. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.13.</note> in respect of the affections, a prone inclination to too much, or to too little, as inordinate anger, love, and the like.

               <p>Actuall sinne is that which floweth from the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and that which is so properly called, is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from Gods Lawes, unrighteousnesse or disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the action from the Law and Will of God. The unrighteousnesse of actions must be discerned, from the actions, and motions themselves, as defects from effects: as a man goeth halting, his halting as it is a moving of the body, or naturall is good, as it is a lame, imperfect, or wrong moving, it is evill &amp; against nature.</p>

               <p>Actions are twofold, 1 Inward: 2 Outward.</p>
               <p>Inward, of the mind, and appetite: Actuall sinne of the minde, is an unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of mans thoughts, as doubtings of God, false opinions, evill imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Psal.</hi> 14.2, 3.

               <p>Outward sinnes, are the unlawfulnesse of, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderlinesse in outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as in false worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, swearing, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, stealing, lying, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and the like.</p>
               <p>Sinne is pardonable, or unpardonable; sinne unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable is the sinne against the Holy Ghost: other sins are pardonable, not of their owne nature, properly, but of Gods mercy, against whom they are done.</p>
               <p>The sin against the Holy Ghost, is the denying of

               <p>Againe, sinne either raigneth, or raigneth not: raigning sinne is that, which is against manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that the sinner doth please himselfe with it, or at least doth not repent for it;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.</note>

               <p>Election is of God the Father,<note place="margin">Election:</note> 
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.2, 3. and onely some few men are elected unto life, and they out of all sorts, Jewes and Gentiles, <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9.</p>
               <p>Election hath two acts and degrees concerning the end, which is eternall glory, the first of God, then of the creature. Secondly, the meanes to the end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11.</p>
               <p>The first act touching the end, is Gods purpose, to take some men, which were to be created to eternall grace and glory, leaving other some.</p>
               <p>The second act is his purpose, whereby hee ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth these men, being to fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> unto eternall glory through Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. &amp; 6.47. The signes, testimonies, and benefits of our election in Christ, are an effectuall calling,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.30. &amp; 9.23, 24.</note> the gifts of lively faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.4, 5. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.13, 14.</p>
               <p>Justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. and glorification, begun in this life by holinesse, being predestinated thereunto, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>That unto which God hath elected us,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.29. Act. 13.48.</note> is first, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sonnes. Secondly, Sanctification. Thirdly, Eternall life. The first, and onely moving cause of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, is the good-pleasure, and love of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. Christ being the ground-worke hereof.</p>
               <p>This is further confirmed thus, God is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his actions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. The first beginning dependeth upon no other outward beginning; but God should depend upon an other outward begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if he could not elect whom he would, without having respect of their faith: faith is the effect of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. therefore it cannot be the cause,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47988:24"/>
or before election. The meanes whereby wee are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated, is Jesus Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. Christ is not the first moving cause, but the meane,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.10, 11, 12.</note> for hee is onely Gods Sonne, and we being predestinated to the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sonnes, have the Sonne-ship by communion with Christ.</p>
               <p>Gods election is firme, and immutable, <hi>Esay</hi> 46.10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>The meanes whereby wee come to be assured that wee are elected, are these: First, the Gospell teaching, that all truly beleeving shall be saved, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. and wee knowing wee beleeve, assure our selves by the effects of election found in our selves, as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling, faith, justification, sanctification, and good workes. Secondly, by the testimony of Gods Spirit in us,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.16, 17. 1 Cor. 2.10, 11, 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.23. We judge our selves elect by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of faith, which is infallible, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.4.<note place="margin">Adoption.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Adoption is the first and proper thing whereunto we are predestinated, and there is no exceeding bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, whereof it should not be the effect: as in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the Father is first, then the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost. In the order of working our salvation: the first is the Father predestinating, the second is the Son redeeming, the third is the Holy Ghost sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That the Father is first in working, see <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19.30. &amp; 16.13, 14. Adoption being then the worke of the Father, it is before Redemption, and so before Justification, and Sanctification. The first worke of Grace in bringing us to Christ, is given by the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.65, &amp; 44, 37, 39.</p>
               <p>Opposite to Election is Reprobation,<note place="margin">Reprobation.</note> which is Gods decree, to leave some in their sinne and misery, and for sinne to damne them; or reprobation is Gods decree, to passe by some and not elect them, and to permit those to fall into sinne, and to punish them eternally for sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:47988:25"/>Herein are two acts, 1 Negative: 2 Positive.</p>
               <p>Negative, to refuse, or not elect: positive, to punish for sinne: for that from which they are reprobate, is from grace and glory, and that whereto they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, is damnation: the cause of not electing, Gods just pleasure and will, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of good or evill in the creature; the cause of the second act, (damnation) is mans sinne.</p>
               <p>God is hee that reprobateth some sinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.9. This is also from eternity, <hi>Jud.</hi> 4. and many are passed by and reprobated, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.16. The things whereof men are reprobate, are true faith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. true sanctification, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. eternall life, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38. compared with 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.9. &amp; <hi>Jud.</hi> 4. The cause of punishing the wicked is their sinne, for justice must needs respect the innocency, or guilt of the creature. The end of reprobation is properly Gods glory, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.14.</p>
               <p>The perdition of the Reprobate is also the end,<note place="margin">Esay 46.10.</note> but by accident: unchangeable also is the decree of God. Thus much of Election and reprobation.</p>

               <p>In Christ two things are to be considered,<note place="margin">By Christ.</note> 1 his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, 2 his office.</p>

               <p>Our Redeemer was to be God, because the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the evill, wherewith men were possessed, could not be taken away but by God himselfe: for Gods wrath being infinite, could not by any creature which is finite, be overcome: He also that must be our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,

It could not stand with Gods justice to punish Christ for our sinnes, if he had not our nature; neither could it have beene satisfactory for us, if it had not beene done by a man.</p>
               <p>The union of these two natures, the Godhead,<note place="margin">Their union.</note> and the manhood to make one person, and mediator Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, is the great mystery of godlinesse, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the flesh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>The manner of union of these two natures, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and therefore hath a peculiar name of Person, or hypostaticall union, and it was by the Godhead, assuming the manhood, as is shewn, <hi>He.</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p>This humane nature was to be particularly, of the seed of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.18. of <hi>David, Ps.</hi> 132, 11. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.30. of the virgin <hi>Mary, Esay</hi> 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23. to fulfull the promises, and to have right to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Israel, and to be free from originall sinne, which is in ordinary generation, the nature, seed, or blood of the woman was sanctified and formed by the Spirit of God, and thereof Christs flesh created: Christ had the same time, degrees, and progresse,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.35.</note> for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as other children have, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.26, 36, 39, 56. and 2.4, 5, 6. when the forming of humane nature was absolute, so as there was the matter, and forme of a man, then was the Godhead of Christ united thereto, by a mysticall and incomprehensible union, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p>The union is most neere, and indissoluble, that Christ from thenceforth for ever continueth God and man in the unity of one person.</p>
               <p>The union of natures is not a confounding of them, or of their properties, for the Godhead remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

Hitherto of Christs office in generall, now to the severall parts or branches: The parts or branches of Christs office are three, 1 Prophesie, 2 Priesthood, 3 Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Christs Propheticall office,<note place="margin">Christs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> is a function of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whereby he teacheth and informeth his Church, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.37. and of this office he is called the Word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. In this worke of mediation is to be considered, 1 what hee doth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God: 2 in respect of us. In respect of God, Christ the Mediator goeth up into Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. to receive the lively oracles of life; and speak things as the Father taught him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.28. In respect of men he came downe from Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38. to teach the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Father which sent him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.16. And to

give unto his Disciples the word which the Father gave to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15. even all things that he heard of his Father.</p>
               <p>This propheticall office hath two parts: first, the function of teaching: Secondly, the efficacie of things taught.</p>
               <p>The function of teaching is, whereby Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth his Church in things needfull to salvation, <hi>videlicet,</hi> by doctrine, exhortation, dehortation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, consolation, reproofe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16.</p>
               <p>This worke Christ fulfilled mediately, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
               <p>Immediately in his owne person,<note place="margin">Christs prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</note> when for three yeares and more, he preached publikely, and private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with great power of the spirit, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.14. Christs doctrine was also confirmed by signes and miracles, which partly belong to his Propheticall, partly to his Kingly office. The summe of Christs Doctrine was the two Covenants or Testaments, the Law and Gospell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. He preached the Law,<note place="margin">Mat. 5, &amp; 6, &amp; 7. chap.</note> by shewing the true meaning and fulfilling it, against the corrupt and false glosses of the Scribes and Pharisees. Againe, Christs preaching was more publike, or more private;<note place="margin">Joh. 8.20.</note> publike, when he taught in the Synagogues, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; private, when apart hee opened the mysteries of the Kingdome of God unto his Disciples.<note place="margin">Mark. 4.35.</note> Christ also foretold by the Spirit things to come, as the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Jerusalem, the comming of false Prophets,<note place="margin">Mar. 24.</note> Antichrist, and the end of the world. Christs preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was of things present, and of things to come; of things present he taught,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.</note> 1 the doctrines of faith to be delivered, good workes to be practised: of things to come, as before. Christ confirmed his doctrine by signes and miracles, by seales and Sacraments, which partly belonged to his Propheticall office, partly to his Kingdome, and Priesthood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:47988:28"/>Mediately Christ preached by his servants, which were Angels and men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19, 20. By Angels, as at the giving of the Law; by <hi>Gabriel</hi> to <hi>Daniel, Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> And by men before his comming, as Patriarchs, Prophets, Priests, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19, 20.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.11.</note> After his comming in the flesh, by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Evangelists, Prophets, Pastors, and Teachers. When Christ sendeth any, hee that receiveth them, receiveth him; and he that refuseth them, refuseth him.</p>
               <p>The meanes whereby hee furnisheth his Ministers,<note place="margin">2 Tim 3.16. Joh. 16.13, 14.</note> are two: 1 the word spoken and written: 2 the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Thus much of the function of teaching, the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of the things taught, is a vertue whereby Christ worketh in all men by his Spirit, pricking their hearts, illuminating their understanding, changing their affections, working repentance, faith and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; these effects he worketh by his Spirit, which hee sendeth into the hearts of his people, <hi>Job.</hi> 16.1.</p>

               <p>The workes of his priesthood are foure; first, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: secondly, satisfaction: thirdly, intercession: and fourthly, blessing.</p>
               <p>Touching obedience,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4. Rom. 8.3, 4. Joh. 17.19.</note> Christ having taken upon him our flesh, perfectly fulfilled the Law, that his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience might be imputed unto us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19.</p>
               <p>Touching satisfaction, Christ made satisfaction for sinne to Gods Justice,<note place="margin">Esay 53.5, 6.</note> that the elect might be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the guilt and punishment of sin; onely the expiation and satisfaction that Christ made, is the proper and perfect price, that serveth for the sinnes of the world; neither have the workes of sufferings of men or Angels any place herein, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. The expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of sinne was made by Christs suffering, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:47988:28"/>Christs sufferings are, 1 Privation of good,<note place="margin">Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> 2 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of evill.</p>
               <p>Privation of good, is the want of joy, glory, and happinesse, which otherwise hee should have had,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.5. Phil. 2.7. 2 Cor. 8.9.</note> had he not willingly emptied himselfe for our sakes.</p>
               <p>Infliction of evill, was all the miseries which hee suffered for our sakes: which we may consider in three ends; 1 the things he suffered in the whole course of his life: secondly, the speciall things hee suffered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death: thirdly, his death it selfe before his buriall. His sufferings in the whole course of his life, was outward, and inward: his outward sufferings were hunger, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.7. poverty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.20. cold, wearinesse, injuries, reproaches, perils, flight into Egypt, and from the Jewes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.14. &amp; 11.19. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.34. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21, 22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.48, 59. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.57. His inward sufferings were, griefe, and sorrow for the hardnesse of mens hearts, ignorance and temptation of the devill, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>His speciall sufferings before his death were inward and outward: inward was his trouble, agony, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow, wherein the Holy Ghost noteth the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, feare, amazednesse, agony, or conflict, grievous trouble, neere unto fainting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.37. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.33. that his soule was very sorrowfull, even unto death, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Three things are to be considered in sinne, and sinners. First, the turning away from God and his Law.

Psal. 16.11. 2 <hi>The torments and sensible paines answerable to the pleasures of sinne,</hi> Rev. 14.10.18.7. 3 <hi>The eternity of the torments, in such as never breake off, nor cease from sinne by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion unto God,</hi> Act. 25.18.

Ro. 6.1, 4. <hi>Where continuance of sinne is not, there Gods justice requireth not eternity of punishment, but onely the extremity of it for a time. Christ therefore, suffering but for the elect, whom hee converteth from their sinnes, was not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer eternall punishment; but temporary, such as for the extremity of it, and in respect of the dignity of his person, who was God and man, was equivalent to that which the elect should have suffered: bee suffered not for the damned, for why then should themselves also suffer, seeing Christs death is not in vaine? but he suffered for them which otherwise should be damned, his blood was shed for remission of sins, and where sins are remitted, punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not inflicted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This intolerable sorrow in Christs soule arose from the feeling of the burthen of all the sinnes of the elect, and of Gods wrath for them, all which as in one view were set before him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21 <hi>Esay</hi> 35.6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.12. &amp; 38.3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.14, 15. here was Christs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

               <p>The outward sufferings, was the ignominy, reproach, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of men, which he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.</p>

               <p>Christ was to die by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of blood, for to be a perfect sacrifice, and to confirme the testament by his death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16, 22.</p>
               <p>Christ was not a meere patient onely in his death, but an agent also, offering himselfe to God willingly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18.

               <p>Christs person being God and man, the sacrifice was of more worth, and esteeme, than if all men and Angels had dyed, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. Therefore was his death, not onely a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a satisfaction: Christs body was laid in grave untill the third day.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Glory.</note>Glory, is the exaltation and glorification of Christ, and that of the whole person, but in divers respects, for his divine nature was exalted, not by increase of essence, or of glory, his humane nature was exalted, both by increase and manifestation. Glory is the Kingly dignity, consisting of three things, 1 Putting off infirmities. 2 Glorification of the humane nature. 3 Triumph over enemies.</p>
               <p>Putting off infirmities, was when Christ was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from all weaknesse of body and mind, which for our sakes hee tooke upon him, as death, paine, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thirst, sorrow, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42, 43.</p>
               <p>Glorification of the humane nature, is its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by assuming new habits, and powers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39.</p>
               <p>Christs body was glorified, in that it was made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33. firme, strong, nimble, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, splendent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.43. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.2, 3. His soule was glorified by the perfection of the understanding, such as in his base estate hee knew not, even all things in all places and times, so farre forth as a created mind is capable of, and by perfection of will, and all vertues that a created will is capable of.</p>
               <p>Triumph over enemies, was his resurrection, and manifestation after, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.1. This arising againe was the restoring of the humane nature unto life, and the glorious, and powerfull lifting of it out of the grave.</p>
               <p>As by Christs sufferings and death hee wrought sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and justice for his elect, so by his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (as the principall cause) hee conferreth the effectuall application of justice and satisfaction.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.25.</note> The

               <p>Christs taking of his Kingdome, was: 1 By ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into heaven. 2 By sitting at Gods right hand, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14.

               <p>Christs sitting at his Fathers right hand meaneth a dignity next unto the power of God, and is the highest degree of exaltation: whereby hee fully occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth his kingdome, gotten by his battell, by repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his enemies, and conserving his Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1.

               <p>The Church is considered generally, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: generally, as it comprehendeth all Gods family in heaven and earth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.15. and brotherhood of all Christians, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. commonly called the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church.</p>
               <p>Particularly, when companies of Christians are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, and compact together, in particular places, townes, or cities, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. chap.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have spoken of two meanes of our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Justification.</note> and remedies of our miseries, namely of election and redemption. Now followeth the third, which is our Justification, being the absolution of sinfull man from punishment, because of the satisfaction of Christ the Redeemer, apprehended by faith.</p>
               <p>This word <hi>Justification</hi> is used here for Absolution judiciall, when God the Judge absolveth the fault of the man, that is accused before him, and pronounceth him just and innocent; and it is opposed to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47988:35"/>
as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.18.</note> Wee may not with the Papists understand here Justification to be the infusion of justice.</p>
               <p>This judiciall act is in this life exercised in a mans conscience, wherein God hath his tribunall, mens thoughts accusing or excusing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. After this life, it shall be exercised by the sentence of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. As sinne is a difference from Gods Law,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3 4.</note> so justice is a congruence with the Law, both of our nature and actions: and as there is a legall justice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in men, by fulfilling the Law, and an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall justice,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.9.</note> by God imputed to him that beleeveth the Evangell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 6. so is there also a legall justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and an Evangelicall: Legall justification, is from workes done, according to Gods Law, we stand in the tryall of the justice of God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12.</p>
               <p>Evangelicall justification is when Gods Law being violated, we are absolved from the sinne and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the grace of God, and mercy of his Sonne apprehended by faith: And by him all that beleeve are justified, in all things in which they could not be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the Law of <hi>Moses, Act.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Before the fall legall justice had place, and shall have againe in the life to come:<note place="margin">Rom. 4.5. Gal. 3.10.10, 12.</note> but since the fall in this life the Evangelicall justice is to be sought for. The reason hereof is, that justification by the Law must be upon the full, perfect, &amp; continuall keeping of the same, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. which is unpossible by mans weaknesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</p>
               <p>The Law of God being violated by sinne, his justice must be satisfied first,<note place="margin">Psal. 14. Rom. 3.24. &amp; 5 chap.</note> before any legall justice can be established in us, which being satisfied by Christ, and so wee absolved from our sinnes past, the legall justice beginneth in us againe in this life, but shall not be perfected till the next life.</p>
               <p>Justification is an act undivided, and all at
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47988:36"/>
once, and so it differeth from Sanctification which is done by degrees and parts.</p>
               <p>Justification of a sinner in this life is done essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally but once,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9.</note> though it be often repaired and renued, as faith once given to the elect, is never quite taken away, for the seede of God remaineth in him; Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Faith are most nearly united.</p>
               <p>The causes of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification are either<list>

               </p>
               <p>The principall outward cause, is the merit, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. which in respect of us is the meritorious cause, in respect of God it is the cause that is outwardly moving him to pronounce us just.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Both these are true, that we are justified for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and merit of Christ, as the outward moving cause, and yet are justified freely of meere mercy, as the inward moving cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> How can it be said that God freely forgiveth us our sinnes, out of his owne grace, and mercy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seeing hee hath required satisfaction to the full of Christ our head, and surety, and without such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction forgiveth no sinne?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though hee forgive it not freely in respect of his Sonne,<note place="margin">Col. 2.13.</note> who was wounded for our iniquities, yet in respect of us that were the sinners, it is free.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But wee merited it in Christ our head, and therefore are not freely forgiven.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:47988:36"/>As Christs satisfaction is most sufficient and full, so as it is sufficiently, and fully to justifie us, without any merit of ours, or any other creatures,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. Our workes being imperfect have no proportion to the justice of God, neither are they ours, but Gods, due unto him, and proceeding from him: now that which is not ours originally, or by possession, but is wholly owing unto another, by it we can merit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our selves.</p>
               <p>The principall inward cause of our justification is both, 1 an effectuall calling, 2 the imputation of Christs merits.</p>
               <p>The effectuall calling is the more remote cause of our justification, when God by his Spirit effectually moveth the heart, the understanding, will, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to the acknowledgement of our owne miseries, to seeke deliverance, and to beleeve the promise, or grace.</p>
               <p>This inward calling of the elect, differeth from outward calling, by the word, whereby God offereth his grace to all in generall. to this inward calling a man is meerly passive, in respect of the beginning,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.1.</note> that is, hee cannot any more prepare, or dispose himselfe by strength of nature unto this calling, or justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Herein therefore the Papists erre, who ascribe to man a preparation to justification, called the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of justification, as faith, that is, a certaine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge, and certainty of the truth of Gods Word: Secondly, an acknowledgement of our sinnes. Thirdly, feare of hell: Fourthly, love of God:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.5. Phil. 2.13.</note> Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, repentance. Sixthly, hope of salvation; which suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prepare a man (they say) to receive justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Apostle saith the contrary, that our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie is of God.</p>
               <p>The imputation of Christs merit, &amp; satisfaction, is the neere and next cause of justification,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.10.</note> and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47988:37"/>
the essence and definition of it, which is, when God for union with Christ,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.14.21. Rom. 4.5, 8.</note> doth so apply and make proper Christs merit to us, as if wee our selves had died, and satisfied for our sinnes: As from <hi>Adam</hi> wee draw, 1 guilt, 2 native evill: so from Christ we draw, 1 absolution from guilt, 2 reparation of Gods Image, called Regeneration.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Faith.</note>The instrumentall cause of justification is Faith, which is taken sometime largely, sometime strictly: largely, faith is taken for an assent to those things written in the Word, called historicall faith: strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Jam. 2.</note> faith is justifying, or miraculous; justifying faith, is a trustfull assurance, which the Spirit of God stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up in the elect,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.6, 10. Gal. 2.20.</note> firmly to apply the promises of Gods grace.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.20.</note> This faith presupposeth knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. but formally it is assertion towards Gods promise.</p>
               <p>Faith justifieth not, as it is a quality, passion, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in us, but as it is a relation, and uniteth us to Christ, whose satisfaction is imputed for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
               <p>Faith applyeth the promise to the particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">Jam. 2.20.</note> and not the generall onely: <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>Faith necessarily bringeth forth good workes, yet it justifieth not in that respect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p>The proper object of faith, is the evangelicall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of grace in Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.</p>
               <p>Faith hath degrees, increasing, and diminishing, yet the essence and force of justifying remaineth in the least degree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.24.</p>
               <p>Faith once wrought in the elect, can never be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly extinguished, for faith is of the elect onely, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.2. as the elect cannot perish,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.1.</note> neither can their faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39.</p>

               <p>Another effect of justification, is peace of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when we perceive our selves absolved from the guilt of sinne, before Gods judgement, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our owne conscience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>

From peace of conscience ariseth confidence, that our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are heard: Also assurance that our good workes please God; also patient suffering of the crosse, ariseth from the feeling of justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3.</p>

               <p>Now followeth our Sanctification or, reformation into the image of God, which is Christs worke in us; it is the change of our nature into better, that is, into the similitude of the perfection of God, called also our Glorification, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>Justification, and Sanctification differ thus: Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is the imputing of anothers justice;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> (to wit Christs) Sanctification is the impression of justice; that it may be in us: in Justification there is the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ; in Sanctification there is the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Christian: Justice is perfect and absolute, an undivided act at once; Sanctification is a work begun, not equall in all: Justification is first,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note> Sanctification is after; Sanctification: is a separation from filthinesse of sin, from common prophane use,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.29.</note> and a preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and application to holy use, by the Spirit of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.<note place="margin">Absolution.</note>

               <p>Our Sanctification hath two parts, 1 the putting off the old,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.22.</note> which is corrupt, through the deceiveable lust: 2 the putting on the new man, which is after God,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note> created in righteousnesse, and true holinesse.</p>
               <p>The putting off the old man, is the subduing, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and abolishing of the sinfull disposition, and inclination that is in our nature, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.5. and of it there be two parts, 1 Death: 2 Buriall of the old man.</p>
               <p>Death or mortification, is an actuall effect of the application of Christs death, by the holy Ghost (to our nature) whereby our corruption,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> or body of sin, receiveth a deadly wound, is feebled, and dyeth daily.</p>
               <p>Buriall, is the going forward of death, and is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the application of Christs buriall by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereby the old man, our body of sinne, is more and more corrupted, and as it were rotted in the grave, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4.</p>
               <p>Putting on the new man, is when wee take againe Godf habits, and disposition to vertue, and it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the rising or the quickning of the new man, which is an effect of the application by the Spirit of Christs resurrection, whereby inherent holinesse is begunne, and by degrees continually increased, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4.

               <p>Unregenerate men are utterly unable to keepe the Law, the regenerate are able to keepe it in part, but but not fully in this life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22, 23. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8, 10.</p>
               <p>Seeing the Law cannot be by us perfectly fulfilled,<note place="margin">Psal. 143.3.</note> wee may not seeke for justification by the workes of the same, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. &amp; 3.10, 13. <hi>Psal.</hi> 3 9.</p>
               <p>The common use which all men have of the Law, is to bind them to perfect obedience unto God, though they cannot performe it, and to rule their outward actions, and inward motions, that confusion be not amongst men, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5.</p>
               <p>The speciall use which the regenerate hath of the Law, is, 1 That they may know sin, <hi>Ro.</hi> 3.20. 2 That it might move them to repentance,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Ro.</hi> 7.23, 24. 3 That it might move them to desire mercy in Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. 4 That it may direct their motions, words, &amp; works, which by the sanctification of the spirit they walk in.<note place="margin">Jam. 2.12.</note>

               <p>The speciall use which the unregenerate hath of the Law,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.3. Psal. 37.30, 31.</note> is, 1 To torment their conscience. 2 To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them from outragious sinnes.</p>
               <p>The partition of good workes, whereof the Law is a rule, is that some are referred unto God, some to our selves, some to our neighbours.</p>

               <p>The things to be prayed for are taught by Christ, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; Luk.</hi> 11. whereof there are two parts, 1 Petitions. 2 Confession or blessing. 1 Petitions, there are 6, whereof the first concerneth the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end of our life and beeing, which is Gods glory, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second concerneth the secondary, and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate end of our life, which is our salvation; <hi>Thy Kingdome come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third concerneth the principall meanes to bring us to the foresaid ends, which is godlinesse wrought in us here on earth; <hi>Thy will be done.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The sixth concerneth the removall of such lets to come, as may hinder us, which are our future sinnes and relapse; <hi>Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Confession, blessing, or thanksgiving, is for three things belonging unto God.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Kingdome: whereby we acknowledge his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or Fatherly right, dominion or authority, over us for ever.</p>

               <p>Songs are of two sorts;<note place="margin">2 Chro. 29.30.</note> suggested to the mind by the spirit and mouth of man, or prescribed by God in his word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26.</p>
               <p>Songs of holy Scripture are to be sung in the Church; first, because God hath given his Word part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in prose to be read, partly in meter to be sung, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Songs ministred by the spirit, are to be sung by one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26.

Thirdly, because the Church of old used to sing such Psalmes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.28, 29, 30. Fourthly, because all people are exhorted to sing Psalmes, not onely by <hi>David,</hi> but by the Apostles themselves, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13.</p>
               <p>The manner of singing, is to be holy, reverent, grave, orderly, with understanding, feeling, and comfort, to the edification of the Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 93.5. and 5.7. &amp; 44. &amp; 7. &amp; 33. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15.19.44. Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               </p>
               <p>Gods Will meaneth either 1 the faculty of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or 2 the act of willing, or 3 the object, that is, the thing willed: In the first and second meaning, Gods Will differeth not really from his essence, or being; in the third, it really differeth, as hee willeth other things besides himselfe: In the first and second meaning there can be no cause properly assigned, for there is no cause superiour to God himselfe; in the third meaning, <hi>vid.</hi> the outward object or thing wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it hath a cause of absolute necessity. God willeth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47988:43"/>
himselfe onely, but of other things without himselfe, he willeth onely of conditionall necessity, or most freely: of conditionall necessity, because such things as hee actually willeth, hee cannot but will, seing his will is unchangeable, most free he willeth, because he was indifferent, by himselfe to will this, or that thing without himselfe.</p>
               <p>In the third meaning, Gods will may change, as he would of old be worshipped by sacrifices of beasts, but now since Christs death, hee will not so be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. In the 1. and 2. meaning, Gods will is unchangeable, neither doth God begin to will that which before hee would not, nor ever ceaseth to will that which before hee would. So it is one thing for God to change his will, which can never be; another thing to will the change of the thing, which before he would, which is often.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Seing Gods will is the first, and universall cause of all things, and that cannot be changed, nor hindered, whether doth Gods will impose a necessity upon the things that hee would have done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It doth on some things, but not on all, for seeing his will is most effectuall, therfore not only are these things done, which he wold have done, but they are done after that maner which he would: now God would have some things done necessarily, and some things contingently; and therefore he hath for some things fitted necessary causes, by force whereof they are necessarily done; and for some things contingent causes, whereby they are contingently done. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will is unchangeable, and not letted, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that not onely those things are done which hee would to have done, but also those things are done contingently, or necessarily, which hee would have so to be done: so things have such a necessity, as God would they should; to wit, either absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, or conditionall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:47988:43"/>Touching evill things, neither is it Gods will they should be, neither is it his will they should not be, but it is his will to suffer them to be done; it is not his will that they should be, because they be not good of themselves, but by accident: it is his will to suffer them to be done, because of his wisedome, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he can bring forth good out of sinfull actions. Things must not be esteemed as they are by accident, but as they are of themselves.</p>
               <p>God hath dominion over all things by creation,<note place="margin">Of Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and soveraignty.</note> exercised as a creator: it may be called Lordly power, which he useth, or may use without any intention of the good, or profit of the creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as a King or Father, which power hee useth of his goodnesse, and sufficient grace, with the intendement of the creatures good also, and therupon maketh atonement with men, that they might serve him, not so much of duty and necessity, as of free, and voluntary obedience: wherefore his commandement hath stipulations or duties required of us, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of further good, to be performed unto us: And the covenants of God with men are of two sorts;</p>
               <p n="1">1 Legall, when upon condition of present, and continued obedience to all his precepts, hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth life eternall.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Evangelicall, when upon condition of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith, and newnesse of life, hee promiseth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of sinnes, and eternall life through Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as Judge &amp; avenger, which power he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, when men forgetting or neglecting his covenant made out of his love, and grace, do sinne, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his wrath, whereupon hee inflicteth punishment on the bodies and soules of sinners. There is not, nor can be imagined, a greater dominion, soveraignty, and power, than the Creator hath over his creatures; for it being absolute, hee may nullifie, and bring to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47988:44"/>
nothing his creatures, as hee made them of nothing, if he so please, and so long as the creature hath beeing, he may command it wholly, and every part: and this power and dominion is so proper to God, as it cannot be to any other.</p>
               <p>After the sinne of man, there was due to all mankind, Gods wrath, and our eternall punishment: but God pitying our misery, hath restored us by grace in Christ, whereupon ariseth another right, and soveraignty, which God hath over us, not onely as Creator, but as restorer; in which name hee hath power to command, and wee are in duty to obey.</p>

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Feare is sometime by figure, put for the whole wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and service of God: <hi>Esay</hi> 29.13. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. sometime particularly for an affection of the heart shunning evill.</p>
               <p>Three sorts of feare were in <hi>Adam,</hi> and are yet in the world: 1 The feare which he had in his integrity, which is yet in the Angels. 2 The feare which he had being falne into sinne, which is yet in devils, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men. 3 The feare which he had when hee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, by the promise and grace of Christ, which is yet in all Saints.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The feare which he had in his integrity, is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he eschewed sinne, and the punishment of sinne, but without sorrow, because hee was without sinne, and free from punishment.</p>
               <p n="2">2 His feare, when hee was falne from God, was whereby he was afraid of punishment, but without faith, or desire of leaving sinne, and so fleeing from God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 His feare when he was regenerate, was whereby he acknowledging his sinne, and Gods wrath for it, he was very sorrowfull for his sinne, committed to the offence of God, and feared to sinne any more, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a care, &amp; desire to eschew all evill, because he knew &amp; felt Gods mercy towards him in Christ, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.17. God is loved in respect of his goodnesse, as a Father; he is feared in respect of his power, and justice,<note place="margin">Mal. 1.6.</note> as a Lord. The feare of the Lord is to hate iniquity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.13. and by his feare men depart from evill, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.6. but the wicked runne into evill, and the feare that is in them is in respect of Gods wrath,<note place="margin">Deut. 25.15. Gen. 20.11.</note> and their torment, not hating their sinne, but God, who punisheth them. Godly feare ariseth from the feeling
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47988:45"/>
of Gods mercy. <hi>Psal.</hi> 130.4. Sinfull feare ariseth from the feeling of mans misery onely, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>Godly feare draweth us neare to him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.7. but sinfull feare draweth men from God, as <hi>Adam</hi> fled from his presence.</p>
               <p>Godly feare is in the Saints continually,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.14. 1 Pet. 1.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.17. Sinfull feare is by fits, when God appeareth, or when his judgements are revealed, <hi>Esay</hi> 7.1, 2. but oft times the wicked are secure, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.12. Godly feare is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with faith,<note place="margin">Psal. 94.1.</note> hope, and love of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.32.40. but sinfull is destitute of faith,<note place="margin">1 Joh 5.4, 18.</note> accompanied with torment, and despaire.</p>
               <p>Godly feare is an holy affection, whereby we feare to offend God, not only because wee shall be punished, but chiefly because we account it most unworthy, and unjust to offend him, who is most great in power, and good in grace, who hath shewed such Fatherly love, and mercy towards us: To whom be all Glory for ever.</p>
