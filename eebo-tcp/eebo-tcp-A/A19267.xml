            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not ignoraunt (Gentle</hi> Reader) what daunger I drawe vpon my ſelfe, by this attempt to anſwere the quarrels and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of late time publiſhed in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Libelles, againſt the Biſhops and other chiefe of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> We ſee the eagerneſſe &amp; bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ſpirit that bee the authors of them: we taſte alreadie the bitternes of their tongues and pennes. The raging furie of their reuenge vpon all which they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, themſelues diſſemble not, but lay it downe in words of great threatnings. I muſt needs therfore looke for any hurt, that venemous, ſcoffing, and vnbridled tongues can worke toward me. And how ſhould I hope to eſcape that, when the Saints of God in Heauen doe feele it? In the courſe of their whole Libell, when they ſpeake of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Paul,</hi> or the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin Marie, &amp;c:</hi> whome other iuſtly call Saintes, their phraſe in deriſion is, <hi>Sir Peter, Sir Paule, Sir Marie.</hi> Surely it had becommed right well the ſame vnmodeſt Spirite, to haue ſaide alſo <hi>Sir Chriſt,</hi> and ſo throughly to haue bewrayed himſelf. Seeing they haue ſharpned their tongues and heartes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heauen, we poore creatures on earth muſt bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in our weakneſſe to beare them. The dartes, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, of deceitefull and ſlaunderous tongues, are verye
<pb facs="tcp:19124:3"/>
ſharpe, and the burning of the woundes made by them, will as hardly in the hearts of many bee quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as the coales of Iuniper. But I thanke God I feare them not, though they bring mee greater harme, eyther in credite, liuing or life, then I truſt that God that ſeeth, knoweth, and defendeth the trueth, will ſuffer them. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> beeing in caſe ſomewhat like, ſayeth thus, <hi>Non tanti eſt vnius vita, quanti eſt dignitas omnium Sacerdotum.</hi> If I therefore ſhoulde hazarde the one for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the other: I trust the godlye woulde iudge that I did that duetie which I owe to the Church of God, and to my brethren of the ſame function and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>What is the cauſe why wee bee with ſuch ſpight and malice diſcredited? Surely, becauſe as the duty of fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Subiectes dooth binde vs, liuing in the ſtate of a Church refourmed, we doo indeuour to preſerue thoſe Lawes, which her Maieſties authoritie and the whole ſtate of the Realme hath allowed and eſtabliſhed, and doe not admitte a newe platforme of gouernment, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I knowe not by whome.</p>
            <p>The reaſons that mooue vs ſo to doe, are theſe two. First, wee ſee no proofe brought out of the word of God, that of neceſsitie ſuch forme of Gouernement ought to be: Secondly, that by the placing of the ſame, it woulde bring ſo many alterations and inconueniences, as in our opinion woulde bee dangerous to the Prince and to the Realme. Some of thoſe inconueniences I haue in this treatiſe laid downe, and leaue them to the conſideration of them, whom God hath ſet in place of gouernment.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome will iudge that I am wordly affected,
<pb facs="tcp:19124:3"/>
becauſe I ſhewe my ſelfe ſo much grieued with loſſe of our credite, and hinderance of good name among the people. In trueth, although a godly Miniſter ſhoulde haue no wordly thing ſo deere vnto him, as his credite: yet if the hurt went no further then to our ſelues, wee ſhould make leſſe account of it. But, ſeeing by our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche and infamie, the doctrine which wee teache is greatly hindered, we ought by all lawfull meanes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. Chriſt himſelfe, in this reſpect, anſwered ſuch reproches, as the enemies obiected againſt him. As, <hi>that hee vvas a friende vnto Publicanes and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 9.</note> 
               <hi>That hee vvrought his miracles by the</hi>

               <hi>power of Beelſebub: That hee broke the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth day: That hee was a Samaritane: That hee had a deuill &amp;c. Saint Paul</hi> alſo to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> againſt his Aduerſaries ſheweth, that hee was not a <hi>vaine Promiſer:</hi> That hee was not <hi>light</hi> and <hi>vnconſtant,</hi> and <hi>a wauering Teacher:</hi> That hee did not teache <hi>craftily,</hi> or <hi>corruptly diſpenſing the worde of God:</hi> That hee did not <hi>teach ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, as ſeeking his owne glorie &amp;c.</hi> The like did a nomber of learned Fathers of the Primitiue <note place="margin">Tertul. Iuſtin. Melito. &amp;c.</note> Church, at large anſwering thoſe vile and reproche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Slaunders rayſed againſt the Chriſtians in thoſe dayes. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in a whole woorke anſwered Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions falſly fathered vpon him: and ſo did many other. Wee ſeeke not therein our owne prayſe and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If I doe inſert particular prayſes and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I muſt ſay vnto the <hi>Libellers,</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſayde to the <hi>Corinthians, Si inſipiens fui in laudando, vos me coegiſtis.</hi> If I haue bene fooliſh in ouermuch prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, your immodeſt reproches, vntrueths, and ſlaunders
<pb facs="tcp:19124:4"/>
do driue me to it. In this mine anſwere, I ſeeke not to fatiſfie all kinde of men, but onely the moderate and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the malicious Back-biter &amp; Rayler will neuer be ſatisfied: but the more he is anſwered, the worſe he will be. If my defence may take moderate place with the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort, I ſhall be glad: if not, I may not be exceſsiuely grieued with ſorowe, but I muſt ſay with <hi>Paul, Gloria noſtra haec eſt, teſtimonium conſcientiae noſtrae.</hi> And with <hi>Iob, Ecce in caelis teſtis meus.</hi> This wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in heauen, and the witneſſe of our owne heart and conſcience, is ſufficient to comfort vs. And for our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe, we muſt pray with <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably beaten and bitten with viperous tongues, <hi>Leade vs, O Lorde, in thy righteouſneſſe, becauſe of our enemies: make thy way plaine before vs.</hi> This God I truſt, will deliuer vs from the daunger of euill tongues, and open their eyes and hearts, that they may ſee and vnderſtande what hinderance they bring to the Goſpel of Chriſt, which they will ſeeme to profeſſe ſo earneſtly.</p>

            <head>¶ <hi>AN ADMONITION to the Church and people of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to take heede of the contempt of thoſe Biſhops and Preachers, which God hath ſent to them as meſſengers to bring vnto them the doctrine of their ſaluation.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I call to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, the loathſome contempt, hatred, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, that the moſt part of men in theſe dayes beare, and in the face of the vvorld declare tovvarde the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church of God, aſvvel Biſhops as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among vs here in Englande: my heart can not but greatly feare &amp; tremble at the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof. It hath pleaſed God novv a long time moſt plentifully to povvre dovvne vpon vs his manifold &amp; great benefits of vvealth, riches, peace and quietneſſe, euen in the middeſt of the flames of diſcord, diſſention and miſerie round about vs, yea, and that more is, by the ſpace of theſe thirtie yeeres, by the continual preaching of the Goſpel hath called vs vnto him (as before time he called his choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people of the Ievves by his Prophets) and yet do vve not only not ſhevv any ſound token, either of our returning to him
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19124:6"/>
that called vs, or of our thankefull receiuing his worde which he hath ſent vs, or of conforming our liues thereunto, as hee willeth vs: but alſo euidently to the eyes and eares of all men, ſhew our hatred and miſliking of thoſe reuerend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whome it hath pleaſed God to vſe as his meſſengers to call vs vnto him, and as his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bring vnto vs the glad tidings of the Goſpel, which before with ſworde and fire was taken from vs. For who ſeeth not in theſe dayes, that hee who can moſt bitterly inueigh againſt Biſhops and Preachers, that can moſt boldely blaze their diſcredites, that can moſt vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſlaunder their liues and doings, thinketh of himſelfe, and is eſteemed of other, as the moſt zealous &amp; earneſt furtherer of the Goſpel? Yea, they thinke it almoſt the beſt way, &amp; moſt ready, to bring themſelues in credite and eſtimation with many. A lamentable ſtate of time it is, wherein ſuch vntemperate boldneſſe is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without any bridle at all. What man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that feareth God, that loueth his Church, that hath care of his Prince and countrey, can remember this thing, and not dread in his heart the ſequele thereof? When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and contemned the Prophets which God <note place="margin">4. Reg. 17. &amp; 18.</note> had ſent among them, his wrath was ſo kindled, that hee brought the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> vpon them to their confuſion. When the tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi> did the like to <hi>Ieremie</hi> and other meſſengers of God, <note place="margin">4. Reg. 24.</note>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:19124:6"/>
they were caſt into the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon.</hi> When the Iewes reprochefully vſed Chriſt, <note place="margin">Matth. 23. Luke 13.</note> and with vvicked ſlaunder perſecuted his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles that brought to them the light of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their Citie and Temple vvas burned, their people ſlaine, and (as Chriſt threatned) their countrey made deſolate, and giuen ouer to the ſpoyle. And ſhall wee thinke that God vvill not remaine the ſame God tovvard vs? Is his minde changed? is his iuſtice ſlaked? is his hand ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that either he wil not, or cannot reuenge, as he hath bin wont to doe? No (good Chriſtians) let vs neuer deceiue our ſelues with ſuch vaine and godleſſe cogitations. God remaineth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one, and is not mutable. His benefits to the Iſraelites and Iewes were neuer greater, then they novv theſe many yeeres haue bene toward vs: they were neuer more earneſtly, eyther by Gods bleſſings allured, or by preaching called to repentance then vve haue bene. And yet our vnthankefulneſſe, in ſome reſpectes is greater then theirs, and our vncourteous vſing of his meſſengers not much inferiour: yea, if the willes of many were not brideled by Gods ſingular grace, in our Prince and gouernours, it is to bee feared, it woulde ſhewe it ſelfe as outragious as theirs did. We haue iuſt cauſe therefore to feare the like plague, which they in like caſe ſuſtained: And ſurely, it cannot bee, but that it haſteneth faſt vpon vs.</p>

               <hi>Obiection.</hi>
But ſome will ſay (I knowe) That I doe great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury to the Prophets, the Apoſtles, and other meſſengers of God, to compare them with ſuch wicked men, ſuch blinde guides, ſuch couetous hypocrites, ſuch antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prelates, ſuch ſymonicall Preachers, as our Cleargie men now are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
I doe not compare them (good Reader) in worthines of grace and vertue, but in likeneſſe of office and miniſterie. Theſe haue brought vnto this realme, the ſame light of the Goſpell, the ſame trueth of doctrine, the ſame way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, that the Apoſtles brought to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in their time. They are the mouth of God whereby hee ſpeaketh to vs and calleth vs to his knowledge, as hee did his choſen by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Primitiue Church. And howſoeuer by the libertie of this time, it pleaſeth men in the heate of their ſpirite to boyle out with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull choler againſt them: yet I am ſure, they are not able to vſe more bitter and vncour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſpeech, then the like affection vttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prophets, againſt Chriſt himſelf, and his Apoſtles, as after more euidently ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. I knowe, they being but fraile and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men in compariſon of thoſe bleſſed Saintes of God beforetime, may giue more iuſt cauſe of reproche, and miniſter more matter to euill tongues, then they did: And yet I doubt not but the tenth part of that euil that vnthankefull
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19124:7"/>
mindes vtter againſt them, ſhall neuer be found to be true. They that haue the feare of God, will not raſhly iudge of other, and chriſtian charitie will hide the blemiſhes and faultes of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſpecially of the preachers of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſincerely teaching Gods trueth. Charitie woulde conſider, that the times are dangerous, and that wee are lighted into theſe corrupt and perillous laſt daies, whereof Chriſt prophecied in the Euangeliſts, and therfore may thinke our ſelues thriſe happy, if wee haue tollerable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, though they bee farre from that rule that Chriſtian perfection requireth.</p>
            <p>Theſe dayes bee like the times <hi>Nazianzen</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Apolog.</note> writeth of. <hi>When they heare any thing ſpoken of a Miniſter or Prieſt, they by and by conceiue that of all, which is reported of one. And wee are become a The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater, not to Angels and men, (as that Champion Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,) But wee are become a Stage to the most vile and abiect men at all times, and in all places, in the Streetes, in Shoppes, at Tables, at feaſts, at Councels, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the very playing ſcaffoldes, which I ſpeake with teares, and are ſcoffed at, euen of the vile and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible players, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The time was</hi> (ſaith <hi>Caluine) when no man durst open his mouth againſt the Miniſters or Preachers of the worde: But nowe there is no ſpeech more plauſible. None of theſe baſe perſons would ſpeake a word, if they did not ſee themſelues backed by men of great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and receiue reward for ſo dealing. Such vntrueths
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19124:8"/>
woulde ſoone vaniſh and bee forgotten, vnleſſe they were nouriſhed by them for whoſe pleaſure they were deuiſed.</hi> It may be hardly thought, that the true zeale of God, and loue of his Goſpell is in that heart, that can eaſily breake out to the diſcredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the miniſters and teachers therof. They woulde rather ſigh in their hearts and groane in their conſciences, and pray vnto God in the ſpirit of mildenes, to take away ſuch blemiſhes from the face of his Church, and to amende the faults thereof, if not all at once; yet by little and little, as to his gratious prouidence might ſeem beſt. For ſurely where hatred and contempt of the miniſters is, there all goodnes muſt needes growe to confuſion. And that maketh mee to feare, that to our great euil, the ruine of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is at hand among vs. For where God is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and feared, there his word is imbraced, and his miniſters reuerenced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the cauſe of all euil</hi> (ſayth <hi>Chryſoſtome) that the authoritie of ſpirituall gouernours is decayed, no</hi>

               <note place="margin">De zelo &amp; liuore.</note> 
               <hi>loue is violated: Of this cauſe is it, that trueth is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vnitie is broken, that men leane to Schiſmes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Prieſtes are ſlaundered, Biſhops are enuied, and euery man, either complaineth that hee is not ordeined rather then another, or elſe diſdaineth to haue another aboue him. &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The Iewes were eſteemed to deſpiſe God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Nom. 16.</note> they made ſo ſmall account of his ſeruant <hi>Moſes.</hi> And to <hi>Samuel</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>They haue not deſpiſed thee, but me. Yea, if it be an euill Miniſter,</hi> (ſayth <hi>Chryſoſtome) yet God marketh, that for his ſake thou doeſt reuerence and obey him, that is not worthie honour of himſelfe, and therefore will he pay thee thy rewarde. If he that receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, receiue the rewarde of a Prophet, it cannot be that he that reuerenceth and obeyeth his ordinarie Miniſter, ſhall want his reward.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould remember that Biſhops and Preachers are <hi>the Angels of God,</hi> the <hi>Ambaſſadours of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi>

               <hi>of our ſaluation,</hi> and therefore that they can not be ſlaundered or abuſed, but the reproche muſt touch God himſelfe. <hi>Eſay</hi> ſheweth, when <note place="margin">Eſay. 57.</note> the vnthankeful &amp; diſobedient Iewes did mocke the Prophets, did put out their lips, and lell out their tongues in diſdaine of them, that God was diſhonoured with the reproch there of. Happily it will be doubted, whether our Biſhops &amp; Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19124:9"/>
bee the miniſters and meſſengers of God, or no. Yea, ſome dare affirme boldly, that indeede they be not. But (good Chriſtians) beware of ſuch cogitations, as diſpleaſant and miſliking affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may raiſe in you. If they be not the miniſters and meſſengers of God, if they bee not ſent of him, then it is not the meſſage of God that they haue brought vs: it is not his worde that they haue taught vs: they be not Gods Sacramentes that they deliuered vnto vs, and ſo doe a great nomber of vs remaine as no Chriſtians. Though they were ſuch vnworthy perſons, as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull mindes of many doe imagine them, or as the vncharitable tongues and pennes of ſome of late time haue blazed them: yet bringing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnto you, but Gods will out of his holy Scriptures, (for in deede they haue not done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, howſoeuer their doctrine be defaced) you ſhoulde aſſuredly bee perſwaded, that they are the inſtruments of Gods bleſſing vnto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Although they that be ſuperiours,</hi> ſaieth Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, <hi>and Gouernours, were euill, and ſpotted with</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in 2. ad Cor.</note> 
               <hi>manye faultes: yet ſhoulde not the Diſciples with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe them from their inſtruction. For if Chriſt ſpeaking of the Doctours of the Iewes, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſate in</hi> Moyſes <hi>Chaire, they were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to bee hearde of their Diſciples; although their woorkes were not commendable: what fauour are they woorthie of, which contemne and trample vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote (as it were) the Prelates of the Churche,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19124:9"/>
which by Gods goodneſſe liue moderately? If it bee a foule matter for one to iudge an other, howe much more is it vnlawful to iudge their Maiſters and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters? Baalam</hi> was a couetous prophet, and yet by him GOD bleſſed his people. Nowe ſurely, if you haue receiued at their handes the bleſſing of Gods trueth, and the light of his holie worde, as in deede you haue: the cogitation of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite ſhoulde moue your mindes more fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to thinke of them, and more charitably to iudge of their doinges. Or if you doe not, looke that you leaue not great occaſion to men to thinke of you, that you make light accompt of that doctrine of the Goſpell, which aſwell their predeceſſours as they, haue, and doe daily preach vnto you: and ſo that you bee not thoſe men that you would pretende to bee. For men will thinke this: If theſe perſons did fauour the Goſpell, they woulde rather ſeeke meanes to hide the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes and imperfections of their Prelates and Preachers, then thus odiouſly to amplifie and paint foorth their diſcredite to their vtter ſhame and reproche in the worlde. For, as much as in them lyeth, through their ſides (in the hearts and mindes of manie) they giue a mortall wound to the doctrine, which by them hath now theſe manie yeeres beene taught in this Realme. For will men iudge (trowe you) that after ſo great darkeneſſe and ignoraunce of Gods woorde, as the Churche of Chriſt is reported by vs to haue
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19124:10"/>
beene wrapped in, that God woulde reſtore and ſende vnto the ſame the light of his trueth, by ſo wicked and naughtie inſtruments, as theſe men be imagined to be? (For they condemne not onelie thoſe Biſhops and miniſters that be now in place, but their predeceſſors alſo, whoſe place theſe men occupie, and whoſe doctrine they confirme.) Men will thinke ſurely, either that that doctrine which we call darkneſſe and errour, was the true light, or that theſe Preachers can not be ſo euill perſons, as malice doth make them. Chriſt would not ſuffer that the deuill ſhoulde vtter any thing to the glorie of God, and will he ſuffer deuilliſh and Antichriſtian perſons to bee the chiefe Preachers and reſtorers of his Goſpell? GOD alwaies hath appointed godlie men to be the teachers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuers of his trueth, as <hi>Abraham</hi> with the other Patriarches, <hi>Moſes, Aaron, Dauid,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> And in our dayes <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius, Cranmer, Ridley, Iewell, &amp;c.</hi> For God is neuer deſtitute of his godly captaines to gouerne his Church, and to ſet foorth his word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiection.</hi>
Oh, but our Biſhops and preachers bee couetous: they giue not to the poore: they imbeſill the goodes of the Church: they bee woorkers and clokers of Simonie: they hinder reformation of the Church, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
But how know you that? It were ſafe for your
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19124:10"/>
conſciences firſt to trie and knowe the trueth, before you raſhly, to condemnation, iudge your brother. Common ſpeeches, and coniecturall <note place="margin">Chryſ in 2. ad Timoth.</note> collections doe oftentimes prooue falſe. Doe you think that al is true which is ſpoken of your ſelues? I appeale to your owne conſciences. Surely hee muſt bee a very happie man in theſe dayes, of whome ſome euill is not ſpoken, which, in his owne conſcience, hee knoweth not to bee true. Nowe if this may, and doeth happen to moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſons, howe is it not likely that it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth alſo to Biſhops and eccleſiaſticall Miniſters? Yea, of all other it is moſt like, that they ſhoulde feelethe bitterneſſe of falſe and backbiting ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: The Miniſters of God haue beene alwayes ſubiect to that croſſe. And in theſe dayes, they haue to doe with ſo manie and diuers kindes of enemies, as it is not poſſible for them to eſcape the daunger thereof. On the one ſide is the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> whoſe errours they confute, whoſe obſtinacie they puniſh: On the other ſide are the <hi>phantaſticall ſpirites of Anabaptiſts, Of the families of the loue,</hi> and ſundry others of the like ſort, whoſe wickedneſſe and corrupting of the church, is by our eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal gouernors drawen into the light, reproued, &amp; repreſſed. Yea, &amp; beſide theſe, there are an infinit number of <hi>Epicures,</hi> and <hi>Atheistes,</hi> which hate the Biſhops and ſpeake euil of them, and wiſh them to be taken away: partly becauſe they are as bridles to their looſe and wicked life: partlie becauſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19124:11"/>
they ſtaye from them, that ſpoyle and praye, which nowe for a fewe yeeres with great hope they haue gaped after, and with much adoe is holden out of their iawes. Moreouer, who knoweth not that they which haue the office of iudging, correcting, and reproouing other, bee their doinges neuer ſo ſincere, ſhall often light into the diſpleaſure and miſliking of manie, and thereby gette miſreport? Therefore ſeeing Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes, and other chiefe of the Clergie, are beſette with ſo manie difficulties, and lie in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ofſo manie aduerſaries: no maruaile though their blemiſhes bee amplified, and (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is) of euery moul-hill made a great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Yea, no maruaile, though their beſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges and ſincereſt meaninges, by miſlikers are depraued, and with hard and vncharitable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations wreſted to their reproofe. Wherfore al Chriſtians that haue the feare of God, &amp; loue his trueth, but principally the chief gouernours, that haue authoritie to deale with the Clergie, ought to take great heed, that by ſuch deprauing reports they bee not carried to miſlike or diſcredite them, which neuer iuſtly deſerued ſo great reproofe. Let them diligently conſider what may fall vnto themſelues alſo, beeyng in place ſubiect to like obloquie. What meant Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaide, <hi>Againſt an elder, receiue no accuſation vnder two or</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.</note> 
               <hi>three witneſſes?</hi> Surely he did ſee that the office of teachers and reproouers, iudges and gouernors,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19124:11"/>
lieth in great daunger of euill ſpeech and falſe accuſations, and therefore would not haue them raſhly condemned, either in priuate or publike iudgement, much leſſe to bee defaced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, to be diſobeyed and reſiſted, yea, though they were more grieuous offenders, then ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with the worthineſſe of their offices. <hi>Aaron</hi> had grieuouſly offended, and greatly diſtayned <note place="margin">Nom. 16.</note> his calling, when hee was the Miniſter to make the golden Calfe, and to further the peoples hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and ſhamefull idolatrie. I truſt all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that the Biſhops and Cleargie men of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> haue; ſhall neuer bee able to prooue, that in this time of the Goſpell, anie one of them did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer commit an offence either ſo horrible, and diſpleaſant in the ſight of God, or ſo hurtfull and offenſiue to the Church. And yet after that, when <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and other did call him proude Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and ſaide that hee, and his brother vſed ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie ouer the people of God, howe grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God did take it, and howe dreadfull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came vpon them for miſuſing the Miniſters of GOD, the historie doeth ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare: yea, though many of the offenders were of the higheſt ſtate, birth and linage, among the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiection.</hi>
But it is a common Obiection, &amp; many thinke they ſufficiently excuſe their contempt, when they ſay, That our Biſhops &amp; Preachers ſpeake well, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19124:12"/>
teach other to doe well, but they followe not the ſame themſelues, and therefore men doe not beleeue them, nor be any thing mooued with their preaching.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
But I ſay vnto you, if you followe any doctrine in reſpect of the perſon that ſpeaketh it, you doe not like good Chriſtians: yea, if Paul ſpeake any thing of himſelfe, you doe not well, if in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect you beleeue him: but you ſhoulde embrace <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 1.</note> his doctrine and followe his teaching, becauſe he is the Apoſtle and meſſenger of God ſent to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his holy will out of the ſcriptures, and as it were from the mouth of God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiection.</hi>
It will be ſayd that Biſhops ſhould be The light of the world, the ſalt of the earth, patternes and examples <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 1. Pet. 2.</note> to the flocke of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
I graunt they ſhould be ſo, and if they be not, the daunger is theirs: but Chriſt is the iudge, whoſe office thou mayeſt not preſume without danger, to take vpon thee, in iudging his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. If they be not ſuch as they ſhoulde be, wilt <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> thou headlong therefore runne to thine owne perdition, and caſt thy ſelfe into the danger of Gods wrath and diſpleaſure, aſwell by reiecting the trueth of his doctrine, as alſo by raſhly iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and condemning his Miniſter?

Some perchance will aske me, whether I entend by this meanes to cloake and hide the corrupt and naughtie life of the chiefe miniſters of the Church, whereby they ſlaunder the Goſpel, deface their calling, and be an open offence to a great number of godly.</p>

I anſwere, God forbid I ſhould haue any ſuch meaning. Their great offences I greatly reproue, and thinke them woorthy, vpon triall of trueth, not only of blame, but alſo of more ſharpe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then any other, for that the offence giuen by them is greater. And we haue a Prince and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who by Gods lawe, if there be ſo iuſt cauſe, both may, and ought to deale with them, neither can their authoritie bee refuſed, they claime not exemption.</p>
            <p>But as for their ſmaller faultes, Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie forceth me to winke at them, becauſe I know
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19124:14"/>
greater matter in my ſelfe. And I ſee they are men, and no Angels, and they liue in a perillous time, and haue many occaſions to offend, ſo that it is harder for them to ſtande vpright, then for ſome other that are in priuate ſtate. Hee is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell that neuer falleth, hee is no man. Men are fraile, and in daunger to ſinne, though they haue otherwiſe great graces. If any of them haue fallen with Aaron, to anie great and horrible offence, I truſt they are with him alſo riſen by repentaunce, and with teares, in the mercie of God, waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their wickedneſſe: Or, if they haue not, I muſt needes ſay with Chriſt, <hi>Better it were that a Milſtone were hanged about their neckes, and they caſt into the ſea,</hi> then that by their continuance in euil, they ſhoulde bee occaſion that anie ſhoulde fall from God, or reiect his Goſpell. As their vertues are more profitable and beneficial to the Church of God, then the vertues of other priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: ſo are their vices and faults more hurtfull &amp; daungerous. They ſtande on an high place where all mens eyes are faſtened vppon them: their leaſt faultes cannot be hidde, and the greateſt are of all men abhorred. A wart in the face, and a blemiſh in a Biſhoppe, is no ſmall diſfiguring of either of them. If other mens faults be ſeene, the offence is not accounted great: but if a biſhops be eſpied, it is eſteemed, not according to the greatnes of the thing, but according to the dignitie of the perſon. <hi>Hee that knoweth the will of his Maſter and doth it not, ſhalbe beaten with many ſtripes.</hi>

Surely, if all bee true that is vvritten and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt them, (as I truſt, and in part I knovve, it is not) I muſt needs confeſſe, and vvere vvicked if I vvoulde denie, that they had iuſtly deſerued vvhatſoeuer euill coulde be vttered of them.

            <p>What ſhall I ſay of the looſeneſſe of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and adulterie? the wrongfull wreſting by extortion, bribery, and vſury? the crafty coſening for priuate commoditie? the libertie in falſe ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and periurie? with the heape almoſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices where with mans life may be diſtained? ſo that if ſome ſtay were not by moderat gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſome meane number reſtrained in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by the doctrine of the Goſpell: it were greatly to be feared, that our wickedneſſe would growe in haſte to ſuch perfection, as it woulde preſently pull out of heauen Gods wrath againſt vs. But all theſe thinges are wrapt vp in deepe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence among moſt of theſe men, vnleſſe it bee to vpbraid Biſhops as cauſes thereof, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt gouernment, as it is thought, of this Church, with the rich and wealthy ſtates of Biſhops, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bee the onely cauſe of Gods indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on toward vs. But this is the wicked working of the deuill, to turne mens eyes from their owne
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19124:16"/>
ſinnes, that they may not acknowledge them, and by repentance turne away the diſpleaſure of God and his iuſtice hanging ouer vs, and, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, alſo to deſtroy the courſe of the Goſpell, that hath bene ſo long with ſo ſmall fruit among vs.</p>
            <p>But here I haue to aduertiſe the godly, and chiefely the Prince and Magiſtrates, that they be not abuſed and ledde by the cunning that Sathan hath alwayes vſed, to deface the glory of God, and diſturbe his Church. When Sathan ſeeth the doctrine of Trueth to ſpring vp amongſt men, and ſomewhat to proſper: when hee ſeeth wickedneſſe and vice by diligent preaching to bee repreſſed, and thereby his kingdome of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and wickedneſſe to decay, and the glorie of God to increaſe: then hee beſtirreth him by all meanes hee can. And if by Gods good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence the Princes and Magiſtrates bee ſuch, as by ſword and fire he cannot either ouerthrowe it, or worke ſome miſchiefe againſt it: then ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hee by lying and ſlander to diſcredit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the meſſengers that GOD ſendeth with his worde, and inſtruments that he vſeth to aduance and ſette foorth his trueth, by this meanes to worke hinderance to the trueth it ſelfe. When <hi>Ieremie</hi> preached the will of God earneſtly and truely vnto the Iewes, were there not falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and other very neere the Prince, which perſwaded him and other rulers, that hee was a naughtie man, not worthie to liue? that hee was an enemie to his Countrey? that hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and was with money
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19124:17"/>
or otherwiſe corrupted by them, to perſwade the people of <hi>Iuda,</hi> not to refuſe their ſubiection? When God by the Ievves in captiuitie, and by the fauour of the Queene <hi>Heſter,</hi> began to ſpread <note place="margin">Heſt. 3. &amp; 4.</note> his knovvledge among the Gentiles, ſo that their heatheniſh idolatrie vvas ſomewhat blemiſhed, the deuil raiſed vp a fit inſtrument by ſuch meanes as before is mentioned, to vvork their confuſion. For <hi>Haman</hi> came to king <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>There is a people diſperſed throughout all the prouinces of thine Empire, not agreeing among themſelues, vſing newe lawes, and contemning thy ordinances, and thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it is not expedient for thy kingdome, that they ſhould bee ſuffered to waxe ſo inſolent. And if it ſhall pleaſe thee to appoint, that they may be all put to death, I will bring in tenne thouſand talents into the kings treaſure.</hi> It vvas a ſhrevvd tale to perſvvade a Prince. For he tempered his hateful and ſlaunderous lying with the ſweete ſavvce of gaine and commoditie. The ſubtile Sathan did ſee, that ſometime they which othervviſe are good Princes, vvhen hope of great benefite is offered, vvill be more eaſily perſvvaded to ſome kinde of hard dealing, vvhich othervviſe they themſelues vvould not like. When <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> was ſent to prepare the vvay for the comming of Chriſt, though hee vvere a man of very auſtere liuing, did not the Phariſees perſvvade the people and chiefe rulers, that hee was but an hypocrite? that he vvas poſſed vvith a deuill, and therfore that his doctrine ſhould not be beleeued? When <note place="margin">Matt. 11. Iohn 8.</note> Chriſt himſelfe came, a perfect patterne of all temperance and godly vertue, did they not ſay,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19124:17"/>
that he was a glutton, and a wine bibber? a Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane? a friend of Publicanes and ſinners? a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker with deuils? a ſeducer of the people? &amp;c. and by this means in the hearts of many wrought the diſcredite both of his doctrine, and of his myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? In like manner dealt Sathan with his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the Apoſtles and godlie profeſſors of Chriſtian religion in the Primitiue Church, as it appeareth in the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories and auncient Fathers. For malitious tongues and pennes did ſpreade abroade of them, that they <note place="margin">Tertull. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polog in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. Mar.

Yea, and this craft of the deuill ceaſed not vnder the Chriſtian Emperours. For then ſtirred hee vp ſchiſmes and factions, errours and hereſies, almoſt in number infinite, and ſtill by backebiters and ſlaunderous inſtrumentes, defaced and brought out of credite the godly and learned biſhops, which were as the pillars of Chriſtian trueth, againſt the enemies of God and his Church.</p>

            <p>And although it pleaſed GOD by ſtrange meanes at that time to reprooue ſundrie of thoſe ſhamefull vntrueths deuiſed againſt manie: yet by ſtoute affirmation and colourable proofe, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row friendſhip, many of them tooke ſuche effect, that ſundrie woorthy and good men were put out of their biſhoprikes, driuen into baniſhment, and put to death, to the great trouble of the Church, and exceeding hinderaunce of chriſtian faith for the ſpace of many yeeres. We reade in hiſtories, that <hi>Philip</hi> king of <hi>Macedony,</hi> a ſubtile and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique prince, who is thought to haue conquered more by craft and cunning, then by force of warre &amp; dint of ſworde, minding to bring the <hi>Graecians</hi> vnder his ſubiection, in concluding an agreement with them, conditioned that they ſhoulde deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto him their Orators as the very firebrands of diſcord among them, and the onely occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of that diſpleaſure and miſliking, that was betweene him and them.

The wolues pretending deſire of agreement between them and the ſhepheards, perſwaded them, that all the cauſe of their diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, was the vnſeaſonable barking of the dogges: and promiſed great amitie, ſo that they woulde put away their ill-fauoured curres and maſtiues. But when the dogs were remooued, the wolues
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19124:19"/>
tooke their pleaſure in ſpoyling the flocke more cruelly then euer they did before. So (ſayth <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes)</hi> this King <hi>Philip,</hi> vnder pretence of friendſhip, ſeeking his owne benefite, would haue you to deliuer vp your Orators, which from time to time call vpon you, and giue you warning of his ſubtile and craftie deuiſes, to the ende, that when you haue ſo done, ere you bee ware, he may bring you and your citie vnder his tyrannie. And this ſaying of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> proued after verie true indeede.

            <p>The craftie enemie of the Church of GOD, doeth well knowe the frailetie and corruption of mennes nature, that they will not of them-ſelues eaſily bende to that is good, vnleſſe they bee allured vnto it, by the hope of benefite. Hee

vnderſtandeth that <hi>Honos alit artes,</hi> and if he ſhall by any cunning bee able to pull away the reward of learning, hee right well ſeeth that hee ſhall haue farre fewer dogges to barke at him, and almoſt none that ſhall haue teeth to bite thoſe hell houndes, that hee will ſende to deuoure and deſtroy the flocke of Chriſt. Happily there may bee ſome young Spanielles that will queſt lauiſhly ynough, but hee will not feare them, becauſe hee knoweth they will haue no teeth to bite. If the ſtate of the Cleargie ſhall bee made contemptible, and the beſt reward of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a meane penſion: hee foreſeeth that neither yong flouriſhing wittes will eaſily incline them-ſelues to godly learning, neither wil their parents and friendes ſuffer them to make that the ende of their trauaile. To bring this to paſſe, hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his deuiſes by ſundry kindes of men: firſt, by ſuch as be Papiſts in heart, and yet can clap their handes, and ſet forwarde this purpoſe, becauſe they ſee it the next way, either to ouerthrowe the courſe of the Goſpell, or by great and needeleſſe alteration, to hazard and indanger the ſtate of the common weale. The ſecond ſort are certaine worldly &amp; godleſſe Epicures, which can pretend religion, and yet paſſe not which end thereof goe forwarde, ſo they may bee partakers of that ſpoyle, which in this alteration is hoped for. The thirde ſorte, in ſome reſpect the beſt, but of all other moſt dangerous, becauſe they giue the opportunity and countenance to the reſidue, and make their indeuours ſeeme zealous and godly.</p>

But in this place mee thinketh I heare ſome crie out with earneſt affection againſt me, and ſay, that I ſhew my ſelfe to bee a carnall man, and in this matter of the Church vſe carnall and fleſhly reaſons out of humaine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, and doe not ſtay my conſcience vpon Gods word &amp; the holy Scriptures, where unto only, in the gouernment of the Church wee ſhoulde cleaue, though all reaſon, and policie ſeeme contrary.</p>

If I doe ſtay my ſelfe, and grounde my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vpon humane policie, in any matter of faith and religion, I muſt needes confeſſe my ſelfe to be worthie great blame: But if in ſome things perteining to the externall fourme of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the outwarde ſtate of the Church, I haue reſpect to Chriſtian policie, not contrary to Gods word, I ſee no iuſt cauſe, why I ſhoulde

be miſliked, if, in conſideration of the corrupt affection of mans nature, I wiſh the ſtate of a Chriſtian Church &amp; common weale to bee ſuch, that yong and towardly wittes, not yet mortified by Gods ſpirit, may bee allured with the hope of benefite, to the ſtudie of learning, and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the holy Scriptures, leauing the ſecret di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their minde to God.

            <p>Many Pamphlets haue bene of late yeres part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written, and partly printed, againſt the whole gouernment of the Church by Biſhops, and thoſe in ſundrie ſortes, according to the nature and diſpoſition of the Authors, but in all, great proteſtation of euident and ſtrong proofe out of the Scriptures, and other writers: But eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally there is one which I haue ſeene, the writer whereof maketh this ſolemne proteſtation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>That as he looketh to be acceptable to the Lorde, at the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the immaculate lambe, in his accuſation that he maketh againſt the Clergie of this Realme, hee will not cleaue to his owne iudgement, nor will followe his owne braine, nor wil of himſelf inuent ought, nor vntruly blame ought, but will faithfully and vntruly, ſincerely and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly,

rehearſe the holy Scriptures, and the ſentences, actes, and deedes of other learned men, which determine and agree vpon thoſe things, that he layeth downe againſt them.</p>
            <p>You may well vnderſtand therefore, that ſuch an accuſation will not bee anſwered and ſhifted away with humane reaſon onely. The matter muſt haue more pith and ſubſtance in it. But howſoeuer that accuſation will bee anſwered, I woulde the authour had perfourmed his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation as faithfully, as, to carry ſome credite and fauour, he layde it out ſolemnely. Then ſhoulde not his writing containe ſo manie vncharitable, and contemptuous ſpeeches, ſo many ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vntruethes, ſo many wreſted Scriptures, ſo many falſe concluſions, ſo many impertinent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, as he doth vſe.</p>
            <p>The purpoſe to perſwade ſo great and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a mutation in a common weale, ſhould haue carryed with it, not onely more trueth, and comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpeech, but alſo more weight of matter, &amp; ſound ſubſtance of proofe.

               <p>There are of late time, euen within theſe fewe weekes, three or foure odious Libels againſt the Biſhops, and other of the Clergie, printed and ſpread abroad almoſt into all Countreyes of this Realme, ſo fraught with vntrueths, ſlaunders, reproches, raylings, reuilings, ſcoffings, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vntemperate ſpeeches: as I thinke the like was neuer committed to Preſſe or paper, no not againſt the vileſt ſort of men, that haue liued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth. Such a preiudice this is to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this State and Gouernment, as neuer was offered in any age.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19124:23"/>
For theſe things bee done with ſuch impudencie and deſperate boldneſſe, as if they thought there were neither Prince, nor Lawe, nor Magiſtrate, nor ruler, that durſt controll them, or ſeeke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them.</p>
               <p>The author of them calleth himſelfe by afai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned name, <hi>Martin Marprelate:</hi> a very fit name vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly.

               <p>When there is ſeene in any Common vvealth ſuch a looſe boldneſſe of ſpeech, againſt a ſetled lavve or State, it is a certaine proofe of a looſe boldneſſe of minde.

The Calumniation touching the Preſſe and <note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> Letters in the Charterhouſe (which preſſe <hi>Wald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue</hi> himſelfe ſoulde to one of the <hi>Earle of Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> men, as it is ſince confeſſed) muſt receiue the ſame anſvvere with the other of <hi>Thackwell:</hi> ſauing that to M. <hi>Yong</hi> muſt bee added alſo, ſome other of greater authority, who can tel <hi>Martin,</hi> that his ſpirite is not the ſpirit of God, which is the ſpirit of trueth, but the ſpirite of Sathan, the author of lyes. Charge them, O ſhameleſſe man, with this matter, who are able to anſwere thee, and not the Archbiſhop, vvhome it toucheth not, though it becommeth not euery common &amp; baſe perſon, to demaund an account of the doings of men in authoritie.</p>
               <p>The decree there mentioned, being firſt peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Queenes learned counſell, and allovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lords of her Maieſties moſt honorable priuie Counſel, had his furtherance in deede, and ſhould haue, if it were to doe againe. It is but for the maintenance of good orders amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, approued and allovved by the moſt, the beſt, &amp; the wiſeſt of that company, &amp; for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of inordinate perſons, ſuch as <hi>Waldegraue</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Hee erected no newe Printer, contrary to that decree: but vſed meanes by vvay of perſvvaſion <note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> for that partie, commended to him by his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, to be a very honeſt and poore man, hauing maried alſo the vvidovve of a Printer: and hee did very well like and allovve of his placing by ſuch as haue intereſt therein. Neither did hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heare, (but by this Libeller, vvho hath no
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19124:26"/>
conſcience in lying) that hee uer printed any ſuch bookes. This I knowe of a certaintie, that <hi>Thomas Orwin</hi> himſelfe hath vpon his booke oath denied, that he euer printed, either <hi>Ieſus Pſalter,</hi> or <hi>Our Lady Pſalter,</hi> or that hee euer was any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker about them, or about any the like bookes. <hi>But the poyſoned ſerpent careth not whome hee ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Waldgraue</hi> haue printed any thing againſt the ſtate, or no, let the bookes by him prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, be iudges.</p>
               <p>I doe not thinke, that eyther hee, or any <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſt</hi> euer heard any Papiſt ſay, that there was no great iarre betweene the Papiſtes and the Archbiſhop in matters of Religion. It is but the Libellers Calumniation. If they did, what is that to him? I thinke <hi>Martin</hi> him ſelfe doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not of the Archbiſhops ſoundneſſe in ſuch matters of Religion, as are in controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Papiſts and vs. If hee doe, the matter is not great.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vniuerſitie</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where hee liued aboue thirtie yeeres, and publiquely read the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie Lecture aboue ſeuen yeeres, and other places where he hath ſince remained, will teſtifie for him therein, and condemne the Libeller for a meere <hi>Sycophant,</hi> and me alſo of follie, for anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo godleſſe and lewde a perſon.</p>
               <p>It is no diſparagement to receiue teſtimonie of a mans aduerſarie: and therefore if Maſter <hi>Reinolds</hi> haue giuen that commendation to his booke in compariſon of others, it is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19124:27"/>
to the trueth thereof. I haue not ſeene <hi>Reinolds</hi> his booke: the Libell is ſo full of lies, that an honeſtman cannot beleeue any thing contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it.</p>
               <p>My Lorde of <hi>Canterburie</hi> woulde be ſorie from the bottome of his heart, if his perſwaſion, and the grounds thereof were not Catholike: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth and abhorreth ſchiſmaticall grounds and perſwaſions: and thereunto hee profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an open enemie, which hee woulde haue all <hi>Martiniſts</hi> to knowe.</p>
               <p>That of the Spaniardes ſtealing him away, &amp;c. is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and ridiculous. I would the beſt <hi>Martinist</hi> in <hi>England</hi> durſt ſay it to his face before witneſſe.</p>
               <p>Hee firmely beleeueth that Chriſt in ſoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into hell. All the <hi>Martiniſts</hi> in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are not able to proue the contrary: &amp; they that indeuour it, doe abuſe the ſcriptures, and fall into many abſurdities.</p>
               <p>Hee is likewiſe perſwaded that there ought to be by the word of God a ſuperioritie among the Miniſters of the Church, which is ſufficiently prooued in his booke againſt <hi>T. C.</hi> and in D. <hi>Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> booke likewiſe, and hee is alwayes ready to iuſtifie it, by the holy Scriptures, and by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of all antiquitie. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Auguſt:</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them heretikes, that holde the contrary. The Arguments to the contrary, are vaine, their anſweres abſurd, the authorities they vſe, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abuſed, and the Scriptures wreſted.</p>
               <p>He hath ſhewed ſufficient reaſon in his booke againſt <hi>T. C.</hi> why Miniſters of the Goſpell, may
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19124:27"/>
be called Prieſts. The ancient fathers ſo cal them. The church of <hi>England</hi> imbraceth that name, and that by the authoritie of the higheſt court in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And vvhy may not <hi>Presbyter</hi> be called <hi>Prieſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe three points (vvhereof the laſt is of the leaſt moment) he doth agree vvith the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, vvith the vniuerſall Church of God, vvith all antiquitie, and in ſome ſort vvith the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But he doth diſagree from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that now is in the dregges, which it hath added: as, that Chriſt ſhould harrow hell: that the Pope ſhould be head of the vniuerſall Church: that hee, or any other Prieſt, ſhoulde haue authoritie ouer Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to depoſe them, to deliuer their ſubiects from the othe of their obedience. &amp;c. Theſe things haue neither the word of God, nor the decrees of ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, nor the aucthoritie of antiquitie to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue them, but directly the contrary. As for the name of Prieſt, as they take it, hee doeth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe condemne in our Miniſters, neyther doe themſelues aſcribe it to them. And therefore the Libeller in theſe poyntes writeth like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Touching Wigginton, &amp;c. <note place="margin">Libel, pag. 26. 27. Anſwere.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That which he ſpeaketh of <hi>Wigginton,</hi> is like the reſt, ſauing for his ſaucie and malapert be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour towarde the Archbiſhoppe: wherein in trueth, hee did beare with him too much. <hi>Wigginton</hi> is a man well knowen vnto him, and if hee knewe himſelfe, he woulde confeſſe that hee had great cauſe to thanke the Archbiſhoppe. As hee was a fooliſh, proude, and vaine boy, a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19124:28"/>
laughing ſtocke for his follie to all the ſocietie with whome hee liued: ſo doeth hee retaine the ſame qualities being a man, ſauing that his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, pride, and vanitie is much increaſed: ſo that nowe hee is become ridiculous euen to his owne faction.</p>
               <p>The honeſteſt, the moſt, and the beſt of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh did exhibite to the high Commiſſioners, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of very great moment againſt him: the like whereof haue ſeldome bene ſeene in that Court. The moſt and woorſt of them are prooued by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſufficient witneſſes, and ſome of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by himſelfe, as it appeareth in record. For which enormities, and for that he refuſed to make condigne ſatisfaction for the ſame, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe to the orders of the Church, by lawe eſtabliſhed: he was by due order of lawe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed from his Miniſterie, and depriued of his benefice, and ſo remayneth, being vnfit and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of either.</p>
               <p>The tale of <hi>Atkinſon</hi> is a lowde, notorious, and knowen lie. For neither did he euer ſay ſo to the Archbiſhop, neither woulde hee haue taken it at his handes, neither was that any cauſe of <hi>Wiggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> depriuation: but vanitie and hypocriſie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this man to haue ſo ſmall conſcience in ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to that ſaying, <hi>Omnis hypocriſis mendacio plena eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That heatheniſh vntrueth vttered diuers times in this booke, that the Archbiſhop ſhoulde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt preaching of the word of God to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and mortally abhorre and perſecute it, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19124:28"/>
to bee pitied then anſwered. If man puniſh not ſuch ſycophants, God wil do it, to whoſe iuſt iudgement the reuenge of this iniurie is referred. He doth bridle factious &amp; vnlearned Preachers, ſuch as the more part of that ſect are, vvho not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding crye out for a learned Miniſterie, themſelues being vnlearned, and ſo vvould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of all men, if it were not <hi>propter ſtudium partium.</hi> I ſay vvith S. <hi>Hierome, Nunc loquentibus &amp; pronunciantibus plenus eſt orbis: loquuntur quae ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciunt, docent quae non didicerunt, magiſtri ſunt cùm diſcipuli antè non fuerint.</hi> The vvorld is full of them that can ſpeake and talke: but they ſpeake the thinges they knovve not: they teache the things they haue not learned: they take vpon them to teach before they vvere ſchollers to learne. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede our Church is too full of ſuch talkers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſober teachers, vvhome hee profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe greatly to miſlike.

               <p>That of <hi>Euans</hi> concerning the Vicarage of <hi>Warwike,</hi> is maliciouſly reported. Hee reiected him for lacke of conformitie to the orders of the Church. If hee haue done him any vvrong thereby, the lavve is open, hee might haue had his remedie. That honourable perſon mentioned by the Libeller, I am ſure, accepted of his anſwer. And I knowe, that according to his honourable
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19124:29"/>
diſpoſition, he thinketh himſelfe greatly abuſed by the libeller in this point. But vvhat careth ſuch a corner-creeper what he ſaith of any man, be he neuer ſo honourable? The reſt of that tale is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, not worth anſwering. And if the relator there of durſt appeare and ſhevv himſelfe, <hi>Martin</hi> could not bee long vnknovven. If any of his men at any time reported, that hee ſhould ſay, hee vvould not bee beholding to neuer a noble man in this land, &amp;c. he ſhevveth himſelfe to be of the Libellers conditions, that is, a common lyar. For hee neuer ſpake the wordes to any man, neither doeth hee vſe that familiaritie vvith his men. But the Libeller careth not vvhat he ſpeaketh, either of him, or of his men, ſo that he may fill vp his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell with vntrue ſlaunders.</p>
               <p>That vvhich follovveth of the Archbiſhops words to the knight, that he was the ſecond perſon of the land, &amp;c. is of the ſame kinde. The knight I am ſure is liuing, let him be examined of that matter. True it is, that there was a good knight with him, an old friend of his about ſuch a ſute: but that he euer ſpake any ſuch wordes vnto him, as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller vvoulde make the vvorlde beleeue, is moſt falſe: the Knight liueth and can teſtifie the ſame. But the Libeller thinketh all men to be as proude and malapert as himſelfe and other of his faction are, whoſe pride the world ſeeth, and it is vntole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>He was neuer <hi>D. Perns</hi> boy, nor vnder him at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> time, but as fellow of the houſe where he vvas maſter. Neither did he euer cary his, or any other
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19124:29"/>
mans cloake bagge: Although if he had ſo done, it had bin no diſgrace to him. Better mens ſonnes then the Libeller is, haue caried cloakebags. But the levvde man is not aſhamed to lye in thoſe things, that are open to euery mans eyes: ſuch is his malice and impudencie.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19124:31"/>
from purloyning or miſcarying, appoynted the ſame to be watched diuers nights: and in the ende hearing neither of the owners, nor of them that ſo waiued it, willed the ſame to bee brought to his houſe in Fulham, and there to be kept for him or them which by law ought to haue it, were it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the firſt property, or of the alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by meanes of the liberties. Wherupon, a good ſpace after, the Dyars indeed came to the Biſhop, and claimed the cloth, &amp; ſought by earneſt means to haue it again, without making any proofe, that the cloth was theirs, or that the ſame cloth was it, for which the theeues were executed, or that freſh ſute was made after the ſaide theeues for the ſame. But vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference had with learned Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers therein, it was reſolued, that the propertie of this cloth was altered and transferred to the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties: and ſo it ſeemeth the Dyars themſelues haue found, els woulde they by lawe haue ſought remedie therefore yer nowe, it being vvell nie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards three yeres ſince. Yet neuertheles, ſo farre hath the ſayd Biſhop bene from exacting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, that offer hath bene made to the Dyars of a good part of the cloth, where in the rigour of law they haue loſt all: And further to reſtore all, or to make ſufficient recompence therefore, if by law it ought to be ſo, vpon the examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the trueth of the caſe. And as for <hi>Martins</hi> erronious iudgement, that this is theft, being taken and claymed by right and lawe, as aforeſay de, becauſe the true owners are defeated (as hee ſaith) ſurely, he might knowe if it were matter for his humor,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19124:31"/>
that the Lawe worketh this in other caſes, as in ſtrayes proclaymed and kept a yeere and a day, according to the law, the propertie is altered, and transferred to the Lord from the true owner: ſo is it for ſtollen cattel, brought <hi>bona fide</hi> to the ouert market: The firſt owners propertie is gone, and the buyer hath it: And ſo is it for waiued goods, as vvas this cloth. And to ſhewe that the ſayd Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop had not ſo great a deſire to detaine the cloth as the Libeller hath preſumed, hee often times asked an officer of his, howe it happened that the Dyars came not for it: for he vvas euer ready, and yet is, to deliuer it to them, or the value thereof, if it prooue to be theirs. And thus much is to be anſvvered to that matter.</p>
               <p>The Libeller obiecteth againſt the Biſhop as a great heinous fault, that of his Porter hee made a Miniſter: which, al things conſidered, he thinketh that doing to be iuſtifiable &amp; lavvfully done, and not to lacke example of many ſuch that haue bin after that ſort admitted, both ſince her Maieſties co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the Crovvne, by many good Biſhops, and by ſound hiſtories Eccleſiaſticall, that where the church by reaſon of perſecution or multitude of Hamlets, and free Chappels, which haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very ſmal ſtipends for the Miniſter, honeſt godly men, vpon the diſcretion of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, haue and might be brought in to ſerue in the vvant of learned men, in prayer, adminiſtration of Sacraments, good example of life, &amp; in ſome ſort of exhortation.

and long experience to be one that feared God, to be conuerſant in the ſcriptures, &amp; of very honeſt life &amp; conuerſation: he allowed of him, to ſerue in a ſmall congregation at <hi>Padington,</hi> where co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the meanneſſe of the ſtipend, no Preacher could bee had, as in many places it commeth to paſſe where the Parſonage is impropriat, and the prouiſion for the Vicar or Curat is very ſmal. And how this poore man behaued himſelfe there, time and tryall prooued him: for he continued in that place with good liking of the people 8. or 9. yeres, till he grew dull of ſight for age, &amp; thereby vnable for to ſerue any longer. It is to be founde among the Greeke Canons, that in <hi>Spaine</hi> &amp; <hi>Africa</hi> when the Goathes &amp; Vandalles had by extreme perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution made hauocke of the Church men, thoſe fewe that were left there aliue, made their moane to the Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; <hi>Italy,</hi> that their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſtoode emptie, becauſe they could get none to ſerue, no not ſuch as were vnlearned. Whereby it appeareth, that in the time of neceſſitie, and ſuch great want, the Church did allowe of very meane Clarkes, &amp; ſo did they in the beginning of hir Maieſties raigne. But <hi>Martin</hi> &amp; his complices, hauing a deſire to throwe out of the Church, the booke of common prayer, would rather haue the Churches ſerued by none, then by ſuch as by prayer and adminiſtration of Sacraments ſhoulde keepe the people together in godly aſſemblies. But this Libeller being as a botch in the body, wherunto all bad humors co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly reſort, &amp; fewe good, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to take this report of this poore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19124:32"/>
man, and not at all to make mention, as he might haue done, of that preciſe &amp; ſtraite order vvhich the Biſhoppe obſerueth in making Miniſters. For moſt true it is, that the ſaide B. admitteth none to orders, but ſuch as he himſelf doth examine in his owne perſon in points of Diuinitie, &amp; that in the latin tongue, in the hearing of many: vvhereby it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that none lightly come at him, but ſuch as be Graduats, &amp; of the vniuerſities. But <hi>Martin</hi> neither himſelfe nor his cole cariers ſeeke for any thing that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable, but like the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that gathereth all that may turne to poyſon.</p>
               <p>Further, for lacke of true matter, <hi>M. Maddockes</hi> muſt be brought in by the Libeller to furniſh his railing comedy. It were inough to ſay of that thus much, that the moſt reuerent Father the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> examining that matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Biſhop &amp; <hi>Maddockes,</hi> with ſome other Biſhops aſſiſting him, founde the matter to make ſo ſore againſt the Biſhop, that <hi>Maddockes</hi> himſelf was content before them to aske him forgiuenes, and to promiſe that hee would euer after haue a reuerent regard of his duetie towards the ſaid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, as his Ordinarie. For if he ſhould ſo vntrue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue played with the name of <hi>Aelmer,</hi> by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it into the name of Mar-elme, hee ſhoulde haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt his conſcience, as he himſelfe knoweth, and all the Court, and her Maieſtie her ſelfe can teſtifie, that it vvas a moſt ſhamefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth blaſed abroad by one <hi>Lichfield</hi> a Muſicion, vvhich is novv departed.</p>
               <p>Heere might bee noted, hovv <hi>Doctor Perne,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:19124:33"/>
being at no meane mans table, &amp; hearing of ſuch ſlanderous rayling of felling of the Elmes at <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> he asked one of the company being an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Lavvyer, hovv long the Elmes of <hi>Fulham</hi> had bin felled. Said the Lavvyer, ſomehalfe yere paſt. Novv truely ſaide <hi>D. Perne,</hi> they are marueilouſly grovven in that time: for I aſſure you I vvas there vvithin theſe foure daies, &amp; they ſeeme to be tvvo hundred yeeres old. And maſter <hi>Vicechamberlaine</hi> at her Maieſties being at <hi>Fulham,</hi> tolde the Biſhop that her Maieſtie miſliked nothing, but that her Highneſſe lodging vvas kept from all good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects by the thickneſſe of the trees. Lo, you may ſee hereby, that the Libeller to ſet out his <hi>Paſquil,</hi> raketh all things by all reportes from all the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants in the vvorld, and maketh no choiſe of man or matter, ſo that it may ſerue his turne.</p>
               <p>And for any Letter vvritten by the maiſter of Requeſts ſo ieſtingly, as the Libeller reporteth, Maddockes hath deceiued him: for there vvas no ſuch matter, nor the man for vvhom the Biſhop vvrote, vvas none of his ſeruant, nor is.</p>
               <p>Novve commeth in Dame <hi>Lawſon</hi> to frumpe the Biſhoppe vvith impudent and vnwomanly ſpeech, and vnfit for that ſexe, vvhom <hi>Paul</hi> vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbiddeth to ſpeake in the congregation. But conſidering the circumſtances of time, place, and perſons, it is to bee thought that Dame <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> came at no time to the biſhoppe in that bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie: for if ſhee had, the biſhop is not ſo ſoft, but ſhee ſhoulde haue felt of Diſcipline, and of the Queenes authoritie. Surely the Biſhop and ſuch
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19124:33"/>
other of the Reuerend fathers that are ſo bitten by this Libeller, may comfort themſelues by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and others as I before haue ſaid, which vvere moſt ſhamefully accuſed by the heretikes, of murder, robbery, enchantment, whoredome, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt deteſtable crimes, to deface them to the worlde, to the ende that their hereſies might be the better liked of. But <hi>Martin</hi> remember that ſaying, <hi>Vae homini per quem ſcandalum venit,</hi> and that <hi>Iude</hi> ſaith, <hi>that</hi> Michael <hi>when he diſputed with the Deuill about the body of</hi> Moſes, <hi>the Angel gaue no rayling ſentence againſt him, but ſaid, the Lord rebuke thee, Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And if it pleaſed you to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that booke that is fathered vpon <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> in <hi>Greeke</hi> which attributeth ſo much to the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, you would be good maſter to biſhops, againſt whom ſo vnreuerently you caſt out your ſtomacke.</p>
               <p>And for your ieſting at the Biſhop for bovvling vpon the Sabboth, you muſt vnderſtande that the beſt expoſitor of the Sabboth, which is Chriſt, hath ſaide, that the Sabboth was made for man, and not man for the Sabboth: and man may haue his meate dreſſed for his health vpon the Sabboth, and vvhy may he not then haue ſome conuenient exerciſe of the body, for the health of the body?</p>
               <p>You vvill take ſmall occaſion to raile, before you will hold your tongue. If you can charge the Biſhop that euer he withdrew himſelf from Sermon or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice by any ſuch exerciſe, you might bee the bolder with him: but contrariwiſe it is wel knowen, that he and his whole familie doeth euery day in the weeke twiſe ſay the whole ſeruice, calling vpon God for them ſelues, the State, and the Queenes Maieſtie, praying for her highneſſe by that meanes deuoutly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19124:34"/>
and heartily many times: I pray God you do the like. But, <hi>oratio animae maleuolae non placet Deo:</hi> The prayer of a malicious heart neuer pleaſeth God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martin</hi> vvith his bitter ſtile of malicious <hi>Momus</hi> dipt in the gall of vngodlineſſe, proceedeth in a ſhameleſſe vntrueth touching the Biſhops anſvvere to the executors of <hi>Allein</hi> the Grocer, as though he ſhoulde flatly denie the payment of a certaine debt, due to the ſayde <hi>Allein:</hi> vvhich is as true as all the reſt of <hi>Martins</hi> vvritings is honeſt and ſober. For bee it that at the firſt demaunde, the Biſhoppe vvas ſomevvhat mooued to heare his name to bee in the Merchants bookes, vvhich hee euer ſo preciſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded, that commonly he ſendeth to them vvhom hee hath to doe with, vvarning them to deliuer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his name, without his ovvne hand or ready money, vſed peraduenture ſome ſharpe vvordes in a matter that was ſo ſudaine and ſo ſtrange to him Yet moſt certaine it is, that though not at that time, yet very ſhortly after, the debt was diſcharged, as ſhall be prooued, long before <hi>Martins</hi> railing booke vvas heard of or ſeene: ten pound excepted, which the ſayde executors for a time reſpited. But this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovve vvill trauaile farre before he will lacke matter to furniſh a lye.</p>
               <p>Another mountaine that he maketh of molehils (for ſuch is all his blaſphemous buildings) is, that one <hi>Beniſon</hi> a poore man, vvas kept in the Clincke I cannot tell howe long, vniuſtly vvithout cauſe, &amp;c. The trueth is this: <hi>Beniſon</hi> comming from <hi>Geneua,</hi> full fraught with ſtudie of <hi>Innouations,</hi> and vtterly emptie of obedience, vvhich <hi>Beza</hi> that learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had or might haue taught him, as by his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19124:34"/>
appeareah, both to the Queene and the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church: ſet vp in <hi>London</hi> his ſhop of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, being maried in a contrary order to the booke and vſage of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> abuſing good M. <hi>Foxe</hi> as hee himſelfe in griefe of heart after confeſſed. After that, the ſaid <hi>Beniſon</hi> gathering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticles, and refuſing to goe to his owne pariſh church, ſeeking to ſet al in combuſtion with ſchiſme in the Citie, was long before the B. heard any thing of him, called before Sir <hi>Nicholas Woodroofe</hi> a graue Citizen, &amp; the Recorder: who found him in ſuch an humour, that they meant to haue ſent him to priſon. But becauſe hee was of the Clergie, they thought good to commit him to his Ordinarie, who trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with him moſt earneſtly to bring him to the Church and become orderly, when he coulde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite nothing with him, ſent him againe to the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Lord Maior and the Iudges. After they had dealt with him, and could finde at his hands no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but railing, they ſent him againe to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and he finding him in vnſpeakeable diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to her Maieſtie and her Lawes, offered him the oath, which he contemptuouſly and ſpitefully refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Which being certified according to order, he was ſent to the Queenes bench, &amp; was condemned, and thereupon ſent to priſon. And this is that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull tragedie wherin this fellow ſo greatly trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth, wiſhing belike (as his whole Libell ſeemeth to deſire) that no malicious ſchiſmatike ſhoulde be puniſhed for moouing ſedition in the lande. But to this vnbrideled tongue, it may be ſayd as the Pſalme ſayth, <hi>Quid gloriaris in malitia tua? &amp;c.</hi> Where hee courſeth the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> with the lewde lying

Epithete of <hi>Dumbe Iohn,</hi> fetched I cannot tell from what groſſe conceite, either as willingly ſtumbling vpon <hi>Dumbe</hi> for <hi>Don,</hi> or for that he preacheth not ſo oft, as hee and other of his crewe babbling in their verball ſermons vſe to doe, or from whence elſe I knowe not, vnleſſe it pleaſe his wiſedome to play with his owne conceite, and miniſter matter to the Prentiſes and Women of <hi>London,</hi> to ſport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in that pretie deuiſed and newe founde name. If the Biſhop ſhoulde anſvvere for himſelfe, I knowe he might ſay ſomevvhat after this ſort: Good chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Martin,</hi> hovv olde are you? how long haue you knowen the man? what reports in the booke of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, in Maſter <hi>Aſkams</hi> booke of his Schoolemaſter, and in ſome learned men that haue vvritten from beyond the Seas, haue you heard of him?

D. Snepphinus,</hi> called <hi>alter Luther,</hi> vvith diuers others, where belike he was not dumbe. And after comming home, was appoynted among the famous learned men, to diſpute againe with the enemies of the religion, the papiſticall biſhops, and like, that if the diſputations had continued, to ſhew him not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in all the three tongues, as he will yet if <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Malapert</hi> prouoke him too farre, not to be dumb. Is he dumbe becauſe he vvas the onely Preacher in <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> for a ſpace, as the noble Earle of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington</hi> can vvitneſſe? and by their tvvo meanes, that ſhire, God be bleſſed, was conuerted &amp; brought to that ſtate that it is now in? which in true religion is aboue any other place, becauſe they retaine the Goſpell without contention, which fewe other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe. And in <hi>Lincolneſhire</hi> did he nothing? did he not firſt purge the Cathedrall Church, being at that time a neſt of vncleane birdes, and ſo by preaching and executing the Commiſſion ſo preuailed in the countrey (God bleſſing his labours) that not one recuſant was left in the countrey, at his comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to this ſea of <hi>London?</hi> Is this to be dumbe? howe many Sermons hath he preached at <hi>Paules</hi> croſſe? ſometime three in a yeere, yea, ſometime two or three together, being an olde man, to ſupply ſome yonger mens negligence.</p>
               <p>It is omitted, that Epiſcopomaſtix had a fling at the Biſhoppe of <hi>London</hi> for ſwearing by his faith, wherefore he termeth him a Swag. What he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by that, I will not diuine: but as all the reſt is lewd, ſo ſurely herein he hath a lewde meaning. It is to be thought, that the Biſhop will take profite here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, being a man that hath diligently read <hi>Plutarke,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19124:36"/>
De vtilitate capienda ad inimico.</hi> If it bee an othe, as this gentleman hath cenſured it, it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that he will amend it: but if it were lawful, as it may be for any thing <hi>Martin</hi> can ſay, to aske his brotherhood, what <hi>Amen</hi> ſignifieth, or whether it be an othe: then in his wicked and malicious wiſhes for the ouerthrow of the Clergie, how oft is he to be found to ſay <hi>Amen?</hi> for in the phraſe of our ſpeech, <hi>by my faith</hi> ſignifieth no more, but, <hi>in very trueth, bona fide, in trueth, aſſuredly, id eſt, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be thought, that <hi>Martin</hi> miſliketh to ſay by his faith, becauſe a railing and ſlanderous ſpirite can haue no faith: for where Charitie is away (the ſoule of all good workes) there can be no faith. Read that of <hi>Paul, Charitas non inuidet, non eſt ſuſpicax, &amp;c.</hi> The contraries whereof ſwell in <hi>Martin</hi> as venemous humours in an infectious ſore.</p>
               <p>Among other their reproches, they affirme of the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> that hee preſented him ſelfe to a benefice. I doe not thinke it to be true, for that I know it can not be good in Lawe. If he hath procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a benefice in way of <hi>Commendam</hi> (as they call it) it is by lawe allowed, and hath bene done by other.</p>
               <p>The biſhop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> is knowen to bee learned and zealous in religion. There are few men toward her Maieſtie that haue preached in the court, either oftner times, or with more commendation, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter liking, as well before he was biſhop, as ſince. It is therefore maruaile, that none in all this time coulde eſpie his inclination vnto corrupt and Papiſticall doctrine, vntill the chickens of the ſcratching kite
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19124:36"/>
yong <hi>Martiniſts,</hi> got wings to flee abroad, &amp; cric out vntrueths againſt euery man that diſpleaſeth them.</p>
               <p>If the Biſhoppe of <hi>Lincolne</hi> had not euen of late ſhevved himſelfe in the Commiſſion Court, at the examination of ſome of them, hee had now eſcaped this ſcratch of the lewde lying kite <hi>Martin Marpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi> What his words were I haue forgotten, &amp; yet I heard them deliuered by a learned man that vvas preſent. For I did not then meane to deale in this cauſe, but they were nothing ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to that which the Libell layeth downe. And the perſon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at whoſe funerall hee preached, hee could not with comelineſſe ſpeake leſſe in her commendation then hee did, vnleſſe they vvoulde haue had him as raſh and furious as themſelues, and to enter into Gods ſecrete iudgement, and openly to condemne her as a reprobate. God may vvorke great matters in a moment.</p>
               <p>THE biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> is charged vvith cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vvordes vttered in two Sermons the laſt Lent: the one in the Queenes Chappell, the other at S. <hi>Marie Oueries</hi> in <hi>Southwarke.</hi> The wordes of the challeng are theſe, Like a flattering hypocrite, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted before God and the congregation, that there was not in the worlde at this day, nay, there had not beene ſince the Apoſtles time ſuch a flouriſhing ſtate of a Church, as nowe wee haue in Englande. Surely, if hee had vttered theſe wordes for the ſtate of the Church appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by lawe and order, not reſpecting the faultes of particular perſons, it might in Chriſtian duetie bee well defended. But it was not vttered in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor for the matter, nor for the time. The firſt part of thoſe wordes hee doth not acknowledge at
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19124:37"/>
all, for they are purpoſely inſerted to ſtirre enuie. Thus in deede it vvas deliuered: <hi>As for the trueth of doctrine, according to the worde of God, for the right ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, for the true worſhip of God in our prayer, laide downe in the booke of ſeruice: ſince the Apoſtles age, vnto this preſent age of the reſtoring of the goſpell, there was neuer Church vpon the face of the earth, ſo nigh the ſinceritie of Gods trueth, as the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is at this day.</hi> Theſe vvords vvith Gods helpe, he vvil iuſtifie to be true, vpon the daunger, not of his liuing only, but of his life alſo, againſt any man that vvil withſtand it: and yet therein ſhall not ſhew him ſelfe either deſperate Dicke, or ſhameleſſe, impudent or wainſcot faced Biſhop, as it pleaſeth the Libeller to rayle. Neither doth he thinke, that any learned man that fauoureth the Goſpell, though he miſlike ſome things and perſons novv in preſent vſe, vvill reproue it. The Papiſts I knovv in deede doe deteſt the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thinke their Synagogue blaſphemed by it: No refourmed Church can iuſtly take offence at it. Where the biſhop is burdened by this ſpeeche to excuſe the multitude of <hi>Thieues, Drunkards, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, Adulterers, &amp;c.</hi> that bee in our Church: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did his thought conceiue, nor his wordes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any ſuch matter. But what doeth not malice, enuie, and ſpite vtter againſt the moſt innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is? The biſhop of Wincheſter hath openly more impugned the vices of this age heere in the Church of Englande, then the vvhole broode of them that are of the Anabaptiſticall Conuenticles, and the reſidue of theſe Libellers. <hi>Woe bee to them</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet) <hi>that ſpeake euil of good, and good</hi>

               <p>This may be a ſufficient anſwere to the vntrueth fathered vpon the B. of Wincheſters words, &amp; that hee is not for the ſame iuſtly tearmed Monſtrous and flattering hypocrite, ſpeaking againſt his owne conſcience. But I ſee in theſe wordes the reproch not only of the biſhop, but much more amalicious ſpite againſt this Church of England, and that ſo deepely ſetled in their hearts, that their eares cannot, without griefe, he are any good ſpoken of it. Therefore I thinke my ſelfe in Chriſtian dutie bound, ſomevvhat farther to follovve this matter, and with ſome ſignification of thankefulneſſe, to acknowledge and confeſſe thoſe excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bleſſings, which it hath pleaſed God, of his great mercies, to beſtowe vpon the ſame, as vvell in King Edward the ſixts dayes, as much more in her Maieſties reigne that now is: and firſt, to beginne with that which is the principall, that is, the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of doctrine, and all branches of true religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, profeſſed, taught, and eſtabliſhed in this Realme. In which point, I thinke it very ſuperfluous &amp; needles for me to recite the particular branches, and to make a nevv catechiſme, or to pen a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Church of England, ſeeing they both are ſo ſufficiently performed, that (vvithout enuy be it ſpoken) there is none better in any refourmed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19124:38"/>
Church in <hi>Europe.</hi> For a Catechiſme, I refer them to that which was made by the learned and godly man <hi>Maſter Nowel,</hi> Deane of <hi>Paules,</hi> receiued and allovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Church of England, and very fully groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and eſtabliſhed vpon the vvorde of God. There may you ſee all the parts of true Religion receiued, the difficulties expounded, the trueth declared, the corruptions of the Church of Rome reiected. But this I like not in our Church, that it is lawful to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to ſet foorth a nevve Catechiſme at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I read, that in the Primitiue Church, that thing did great harme, and corrupted the mindes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſimple perſons, with ſoule errours and hereſies. I ſee the like at this day: for thereby many honeſt meaning hearts are caried avvay to the miſliking of our manner of prayer, and adminiſtration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and other orders: vvhereby it is made a principall inſtrument to maintaine and increaſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and diſſention in the Church.</p>
               <p>For a ſound and true confeſſion acknowledged by this our church, I refer them to that notable Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of the Engliſh Church, written not many yeeres ſince, by that Iewel of England, late Biſhop of <hi>Sarif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie.</hi> Wherein they ſhal finde all parts of Chriſtian religion confeſſed &amp; proued, both by the teſtimony of the canonicall ſcriptures, and alſo by the conſent of all learned and godly antiquitie for the ſpace of certain hundred yeres after Chriſt. For the integrity and ſoundnes, for the learning and eloquence ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame Apologie, they (that contemne that notable learned man becauſe hee was a Biſhoppe) may haue very good teſtimonie in a litle Epiſtle, vvritten by <hi>Peter Martir</hi> vnto the ſaid biſhop, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19124:38"/>
nowe printed, and in the latter edition ſet before the ſame Apologie: where they ſhall finde that hee ſpeaketh not for himſelfe onely, but for many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned men of the church of <hi>Tygure,</hi> and other places. Nowe, as this learned Biſhop doeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and confeſſe for this Church, all trueth of doctrine: ſo doeth hee reprooue, condemne and deteſt all corruptions brought into the ſame, either by the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or by any other ancient or newe heretikes, whome he there particularly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: yea, and to the great comfort of all them that are members of the ſame church, and acknowledge the ſame confeſſion, hee prooueth and euidently ſheweth, that the teſtimonies of the Scriptures, whereon that confeſſion is grounded, for the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them, haue the witneſſe &amp; conſent of all the learned antiquitie, as I haue ſaide, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hundred yeeres. Which I take to bee a very good comfort and confirmation to all honeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in theſe captious and quarelling dayes.</p>
               <p>That which I meane, I will declare by ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. What is more euident, certaine and firme for the article of the <hi>perſon of Chriſt in his Godhead &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> then thoſe things that the ancient Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed out of the canonicall ſcriptures in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of <hi>Nice, Conſtantinople, Epheſus, Chalcedon;</hi> &amp; ſome others againſt <hi>Arius, Samoſatenus, Apollinaris, Neſtorius, Eutiches,</hi> and thoſe heretikes that were termed <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholetes &amp;c?</hi> Therefore whoſoeuer do teach contrary to the determination of thoſe councels (as ſome do in theſe dayes) they do not iuſtly hold that principal article and foundation of Chriſtian religion.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as touching the grace and benefite of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19124:39"/>
Chriſt, the beginning whereof riſeth from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>loue</hi> of God toward vs, and from the free <hi>election</hi> to redemption and eternall ſaluation: and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to our vſe and benefite, by the diſpenſation of Chriſt once offred vpon the Croſſe, by effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wrought by the holy Ghoſt in preaching of the Goſpell, by our iuſtification, ſanctification, and the gift of perſeuerance and continuance in the faith, thereby in the end to obtaine reſurrection and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life: touching (I ſay) this free grace of God (ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principall ground of Chriſtian religion) what coulde be, or can bee more certainly or abundantly layde downe out of the holy Scriptures, then was determined in the Councels of <hi>Carthage, Mileuitane, Auraſicane &amp;c.</hi> againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the free grace of God in Chriſt Ieſu our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour? Eſpecially if you adde the writings of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> and other ancient Fathers for defence of the ſame.</p>
               <p>As to that which is neceſſarie to be knowen tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the true Catholique Church (a matter of great importaunce euen at this day) vvhat can be more copiouſly or with more perſpicuitie declared, then is by that learned father <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as well in other places, as principally in his bookes againſt the Donatiſts?</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, for the matter of the Sacrament of the Lordes Supper, (if ſimple trueth coulde content men) what is more euident, then that doctrine, which hath bene laid downe by the ancient Fathers, <hi>Iuſtine, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Auguſtine, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete,</hi> and a number of other? For proofe whereof, I referre you to B. <hi>Iewell,</hi> in his worthy booke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he anſwereth <hi>Hardings</hi> reply againſt his 27. que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19124:39"/>
propoſed at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſſe, &amp;c. I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this matter of the Sacrament, <hi>Occolampadius,</hi> a man of great reading &amp; godlines, ſaith of <hi>S. Auguſt. Is primus mihi vellicauit aurem.</hi> He did firſt put me in minde of the true vnderſtanding of this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Theſe foure principal Articles I haue laid downe for example, that the Chriſtian Reader may the more eaſily perceiue vvhat comfort it is to any Church, to haue the grounds of their faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſo eſtabliſhed vpon the holy Scriptures, that for the interpretation of the ſame, they haue the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie &amp; conſent of the Primitiue Church, &amp; the ancient learned Fathers. From which <hi>Conſent</hi> they ſhould not depart, either in doctrine, or other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of weight, vnleſſe it ſo fall out in them, that we be forced thereto, either by the plaine wordes of the Scriptures, or by euident and neceſſary concluſions following vpon the ſame, or the Analogie of our faith. Which thing if we ſhall perceiue, we ought, &amp; ſafely may, take that liberty that themſelues, &amp; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath vſed, &amp; requireth other to vſe. <hi>Nec Catholicis Epiſcopis, &amp;c. Wee muſt not conſent</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">De vnitate Eccle. cap. 10</note> Auguſtine,) <hi>ſo much as to Catholike Biſhops, if they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and be of opinion contrary to the Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Againe, <hi>I am not tied with the authoritie of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Contra Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. lib. 2. ca. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>For I haue not the writings of Cyprian in like eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as I haue the Canonicall Scriptures, but I meaſure them by the rule of the holy Scriptures. If I finde any thing in his writings agreeing to the Scriptures, I receiue it with commendation and reuerence: if otherwiſe, with his good leaue, I refuſe it.</hi> The like you haue, <hi>Epiſt. 48. 111. &amp; 112. In Prooemio li. 3. de Trinitate,</hi> and many other places. Otherwiſe, to reiect the teſtimonie of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19124:40"/>
ancient Fathers raſhly, is a token of too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in our owne wits. It was noted as a great fault in <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and a chief cauſe of his hereſie, that contemning the Fathers, hee reſted too much vpon his owne iudgement. The like confidence drew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men, and of great gifts, to be Patrons of ſundry foule and ſhamefull errours. How came it to paſſe, that after that notable Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſo many deteſtable hereſies aroſe againſt the Deitie &amp; the Humanitie of Chriſt, againſt the vniting of both natures, and the diſtinction of the properties of them? &amp;c. but onely out of this roote, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the graue ſentences, interpretations, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of thoſe famous Confeſſors and great learned Fathers, as were in the ſame aſſembled, and had too much liking in their owne wits &amp; learning. But <hi>woe be vnto them</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eſay) that are ouerwiſe in their owne conceite. Vigilius</hi> in his firſt booke againſt <hi>Eutyches</hi> ſaith thus. <hi>Theſe cloudes of fond and vaine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations are powred out by them chiefly, which are diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either with the ſickeneſſe of ignorance, and of a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious appetite: and while they being puffed vp with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a proud ſtomacke, for this only cauſe they reiect the rules of faith, laide downe by the ancient fathers, that they may thruſt into the Church their owne wauering deuiſes, which they haue ouerthwartly conceiued.</hi> This ſentence, I would our vncharitable accuſers &amp; troublers of the Church would well weigh and conſider with them-ſelues. Therfore (good reader) I proteſt for my ſelfe, and for the reſidue of this church, that we dare not in conſcience, nor thinke it tollerable, with contempt to reiect the teſtimonies of antiquitie in eſtabliſhing any matter of weight in the Church. We leaue that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19124:40"/>
to our <hi>haſty Diuines,</hi> that in three yeeres ſtudy thinke themſelues able to controll all men, &amp; to haue more learning then all the Biſhops in England: And for this cauſe vvil they giue no credit to ancient writers againſt their new found equality. For with them, it is a foule fault once in a ſermon to name an ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to alledge any teſtimonie out of his workes.</p>
               <p>Novve (good Chriſtian Reader) ſeeing by the good bleſſing of God, vve haue all parts of Chriſtian fayth and Religion profeſſed and taught in this Church, and the ſame grounded vpon the canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scriptures, vvith the conſent and expoſition of the Primitiue Church and ancient Fathers: What a vaunting pride is it? (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaketh) vvhat an vnthankefulneſſe to God? vvhat vncharitable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection toward the Church of their naturall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that they cannot abide any good to be ſpoken of it? pretending nothing but the priuate faultes and vices of ſome men, or the diſagreeing from them in ſome orders and partes of Gouernement, which they vvill neuer be able to proue by the word of GOD to bee of neceſſitie. In other reformed Churches, vvhome they ſo greatly extolle, and vvould make paterne to vs, haue they not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? Haue they not foule faults, and great vices among all ſortes of men, as well Miniſters as others? Surely, their worthieſt writers &amp; graueſt Preachers doe note, that they haue. And if they woulde denie it, the world doth ſee it, and many good men among them doe bevvaile it. I vvill not ſtay in the other blesſings of God, vvhere with he hath adorned this Church. I ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake ſomewhat more of it hereafter, and God ſend vs grace, that we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19124:41"/>
may vvith true thankefulneſſe acknovvledge it. But this I may not omitte vvithout great note of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulneſſe towarde our mercifull God, vvhich hath not onely preſerued, maintained and defended the State, but alſo appoynted this Church to be as a Sanctuarie or place of refuge for the Saints of God, afflicted and perſecuted in other Countries for the profesſion of the Goſpell: for whome I am perſvva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vvee doe fare the better at Gods hande. And I doubt not but in that reſpect, al reformed Churches in other places, feeling the blesſing of God by vs, thinke reuerently of our State, and pray to God for vs, as all good men vvith vs ought to doe for them, that the true linke of Chriſtian charitie may ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knitte vs together in one body of right faith and Religion. If ſome fevve perſons thinke amiſſe of our Church, I impute the cauſe thereof only to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious &amp; vntrue reports made by ſome of our owne Countreymen vnto them. Which perſons, if they did vnderſtande the true State of this our Realme, would thinke farre othervviſe, as diuers of the moſt graue &amp; learned writers haue already euidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. This alſo is not the leaſt blesſing of God, as well in the time of <hi>K. Edward,</hi> as in the reigne of our gracious Soueraigne, that this Church hath had as ample orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of learned men, <hi>(Rumpantur vt Ilia Momo,)</hi> as the moſt reformed Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> &amp; farre more plentifully then ſome place, whoſe ſtate they ſeeke to frame vs vnto. Only I except thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God had prepared in the beginning to be the reſtorers of his Trueth, &amp; doctrine of the Goſpel in thoſe parts: Namely we haue had B. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Ridley, Latimer, Couerdale, Hooper,</hi> &amp; diuers other,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19124:41"/>
vvhich were no Biſhops, as <hi>M. Bradford, M. Sanders, M. Rogers, M. Philpot, D. Haddon,</hi> &amp;c. Moſt of vvhich, as they haue left good proofe of their learning in vvriting: ſo did they confirme the ſame vvith their blood in the ende. The like I may iuſtly ſay of them vvhome God hath ſent to reſtore his Trueth ſince the beginning of her Maieſties reigne, (hovvſoeuer it pleaſeth the Broode of the <hi>Martiniſts</hi> to deface them) as Biſhoppe <hi>Coxe, Pilkington, Grindall, Sands, Horne, Iewell, &amp;c.</hi> vvhich haue good teſtimonie of their learning giuen them by as graue, learned, and zealous men, as any haue liued in this age, among vvhome for certaine yeeres they liued. A nomber of other haue proceeded out of both our Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, vvhich though <hi>Martin Momus</hi> will ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, deſerue ſingular comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation for their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and haue declared the ſame to the vvorlde in anſvvering and confuting the opprobrious writings of the common Aduerſaries. In vvhich their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvveres (without enuie and diſpleaſure be it ſpoken) there appeareth as ſufficient learning, as doeth in the moſt workes at this time publiſhed by the vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of forreine Countreies. If Engliſhmen at this time ſo greatly diſprayſed, vvere giuen vvith like paynes to ſet foorth the exerciſes of their ſtudie and learning, as in other places they doe: they vvoulde dravve as good commendation of learning to their Countrey, as moſt other Churches doe. To vvhich nomber of ours, I adde alſo ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvhom cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine occaſions haue caried away to the miſliking of the preſent ſtate of this Church: vvhich I knowe haue receiued of God ſingular good giftes, which I pray earneſtly they may vſe to his glory, and the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19124:42"/>
procuring the vnity &amp; peace of the Church, vvhich our <hi>Haſtie Diuines of M. M.</hi> his brood, ſeeke to breake and diſturbe. This teſtimonie, I thought my ſelfe bounde in conſcience to yeelde to that Church of my naturall Countrey, in vvhich, and by vvhich, through the mercie of our gracious God, I am that I am. The godly, I truſt, vvill interprete all to the beſt: the reſidue I looke not to pleaſe.</p>
               <p>The B. of Wincheſter is further charged in this maner, He ſaid that men might find fault, if they were diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to quarrell, aſwel with the Scriptures, as with the booke of common prayer. Who could heare this compariſon without trembling? Let the Libellers, whatſoeuer they are, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, <hi>Os quodmentitur, occidit animam.</hi> At that time, in <hi>S. Mary Oueries</hi> church, in a large diſcourſe, he did anſwere the obiections that many make at this day, againſt the booke of common praier, &amp; towarde the end vttered theſe words, <hi>If it could be without blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, they might picke as many &amp; as great quarrels againſt the holy ſcriptures the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. For euen the beſt writings are ſubiect to the ſlanderous malice of wicked men.</hi> This aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was found fault with all, by a Ieſuite or Masſing prieſt at that time in the Marſhalſey, &amp; therfore the B. the next Sunday following, expounded his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at large ſhevved, that that might be done, which beforetime was done by a great number: and that he was not ſo far beſide himſelfe, as to compare the booke of <hi>common prayer</hi> vvith the holy ſcriptures in dignity, trueth, or maieſtie: He leaueth ſuch blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous dealing to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the <hi>Family of Loue,</hi> &amp; ſome other <hi>Sectaries:</hi> but he compared them in this, (as it is before ſaide) that the Scriptures themſelues vvere ſubiect alſo to ſlaunderous and deprauing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19124:42"/>
tongues, and yet not therfore to be reiected, wherof he recited ſundry examples. <hi>Celſus</hi> that heatheniſh Epicure (againſt whom <hi>Origen</hi> writeth) in his booke <note place="margin">Lib. 1. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Celſum.</note> called <hi>Verax,</hi> doth powre out many railing &amp; ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous reproches, not onely againſt the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but alſo againſt the courſe of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: as that they receiued their religion &amp; doctrine of the barbarous Iewes, that is, out of the bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. The like did <hi>Porphyrius</hi> an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 6. cap. 19.</note> Philoſopher, and in his bookes reprooued the Scriptures in many places: for hee wrote thirtie bookes againſt Chriſtian religion.

Who knoweth not, that ſome Heretikes reiected the moſt part of the olde Teſtament, as falſe and fabulous?

Tatian</hi> alſo depraueth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, reiecteth the Actes of the Apoſtles, and picketh ſundrie other quarrels againſt them. There was neuer any Heretike, but that to giue counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to his opinion, hee would ſeeme to ground it vpon the Scriptures. And what is that but wickedly to father lies vpon the Scriptures? And for this cauſe you know, the Papiſts thinke it no ſure ground
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19124:43"/>
to reſt vpon the ſcriptures onely, affirming blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, that <hi>the Scriptures are darke, vnperfect, and doubtfull, becauſe they may bee wreſted cuery way, like a noſe of waxe, or like a leaden Rule.</hi> Wherefore, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charitie and modeſtie woulde not thus malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſlanderouſly wreſt and wring the words of the Biſhop, tending to a good and godly meaning.</p>
               <p>Of like trueth it is, that he burtheneth the Biſhop of Wincheſter, to affirme that it was hereſie to ſay, The preaching of the worde was the onely ordinarie way to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which he neuer thought, or ſpake, either the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or at any other time of his life. But in handling of that controuerſie, <hi>Penrie</hi> ſpake things ſo ſtrangely &amp; obſcurely, that he ſeemed to attribute that effect to the preaching of the word only, &amp; not otherwiſe vſed by reading: And being vrged with that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by occaſion of reading the Scriptures in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, his anſwere was ſuch, as hee euidently ſhewed himſelfe to meane, that that effect of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could not be wrought by hearing the worde of God read, with ſome other wordes, giuing ſuſpition of worſe matter. And then indeede the B. roſe not out of his place, (as theſe honeſt men doe carpe) nor ſpake in ſuch cholerike maner, as they pretend: but quietly ſaid, My Lord, this is not farre from hereſie. What were the words that <hi>Penry</hi> vſed, &amp; eſpecially moued the B. to ſpeake, hee doeth not at this time remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: but ſure he is, they were as far from that, which is laide downe in the Libel, as falſhoode can be from truth. I wonder that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which profeſſe God, yea, or that beleeue there is a God, can with open mouth ſo boldely powre foorth ſuch heapes of vntrueths. <hi>Detractor abominabilis eſt Deo.</hi> The counſell of the

               </p>
               <p>As for the reproch of want of learning, he will not ſtriue much with them. The Biſhop hath not vſed (God bee thanked) to vaunt himſelfe of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

               <p>AS touching the Gouernment of the Church of England, now defended by the biſhops, this I ſay. When God reſtored the doctrine of the Goſpel more ſincerely and more aboundantly then euer before, vnder that good yong Prince, <hi>King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 6. at vvhich time not the gouernours onely of this Realme vnder him, but a number of other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen &amp; Gentlemen, were well knovven to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the fauor of the trueth: by conſent of all the States of this Land, this maner of gouernment that now is vſed, was by law confirmed as good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The biſhops &amp; other of the clergy that gaue their aduiſe and conſent to the ſame, vvere learned &amp; zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, <hi>biſhop Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer,</hi> and many other, vvhich after ſealed their doctrine vvith their blood, all learned, graue and vviſe in compariſon of theſe yong Sectaries which greatly pleaſe themſelues. <hi>M. Couerdale</hi> &amp; <hi>M. Hooper,</hi> neuer thought to be ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or inclining to Antichriſtian corruption, were contented to vſe the office, authority, and iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of biſhops, the one at <hi>Exeter,</hi> the other at <hi>Gloceſter. Peter Martyr, Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Alaſco,</hi> graue men, and of great knovvledge and godlineſſe, did liue in that ſtate vnder the Archbiſhops and biſhops that then vvere, and vvrote to them moſt reuerendly, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to giue them thoſe Titles, that novv bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted Antichriſtian. The like they did to other of late time. Reade the Preface of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> ſet before his Dialogues againſt <hi>Vbiquity,</hi> &amp; ſee what honourable teſtimonie hee giueth to biſhop <hi>Iewell,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:19124:45"/>
and what titles he affoordeth him. To condemne all theſe as Reprobate and Pety Antichriſts, were great raſhneſſe, and ſuch impudencie as ought not in any Chriſtian Church or common weale to bee borne without puniſhment. When God had marueilouſly preſerued for vs our gracious ſoueraigne <hi>Queene E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi> &amp; ſet her in her Fathers ſeat, being brought vp from her tender yeres, in the inſtruction of Gods trueth, ſhee tooke aduiſe of her moſt honourable Counſell, Nobles, and learned of the Realme, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſuch as were moſt forward in religion, and with conſent of all the States of this Realme, by law receiued, confirmed and eſtabliſhed the manner of Gouernment, and other orders of the Church now obſerued. The learned men that yeelded their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and conſent to the ſame, were thoſe reuerend &amp; godly perſons, that came lately out of baniſhment, from the ſchoole of affliction, &amp; could not ſo ſoone forget their Lorde God, and the zeale of his trueth, namely, Maſter <hi>Cox, Grindall, Sands, Horne, Pilkington, Iewell, Parkhurſt,</hi> and a number of other, vvho vvere after choſen to be biſhops, and executed thoſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without grudging or repining of any, vntill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the tenth yeere of her Maieſties raigne, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deuiſes beganne to be more common. Since vvhich time, by the countenauncing of ſome, they haue greatly increaſed in ſtrange aſſertions, &amp; now be come almoſt to the higheſt. The reproches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that are giuen to this State by theſe Libellers, touch not onely the Biſhoppes, but the Prince, the Counſell, and the honorable; woiſhipfull, wiſe, and learned of the Realme.</p>
               <p>As for this queſtion of Church-gouernment, I
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19124:45"/>
meane not at this time to ſtand much on it. For let them ſay what they luſt, for any thing that hath beene written hitherto touching it, it is ſufficiently anſwered. Onely this I deſire, <hi>That they will lay downe out of the worde of God ſome iuſt proofes, and a direct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that there ſhoulde be in all ages and ſtates of the Church of Chriſt, one onely forme of outward gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that they will note and name ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine particular Churches, either in the Apoſtles time, or afterward, wherein the whole gouernement of the Church was practiſed, onelie by Doctours, Pastours, Elders, and Deacons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd none other, and that in an equalitie; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuperioritie in one aboue an other.</hi> If this bee done ſoundly and truely, without any wreſting or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnderſtanding of the places of Scripture: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt they will ſhake that opinion that nowe I haue of this preſent gouernement of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande.</hi> Yet vnder correction (I will not ſay, that I know) but I am ſurely perſwaded, that they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to doe it.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, <hi>I woulde wiſh them vnfaignedly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, whether all the Churches at this day reformed in Europe, where the light of the Goſpell was firſt restored, and ſpecially of</hi> Saxonie <hi>and</hi> High Almaine, <hi>haue this gouernement, which by theſe men is nowe required, and none other.</hi> If they haue, it is a good preiudice for their cauſe: if they haue not, it is hard, that the example of two or three Churches ſhoulde ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule all the reſidue, in which the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell beganne before them. And it may bee well ſayde, <hi>Did the Goſpell beginne firſt with you?</hi> Wee may not pull downe one <hi>Rome</hi> and ſet vp an other.

in this time, euidently affirme the contrarie, &amp; do make good proofe of this propoſition. <hi>That one forme of Church-gouernment is not neceſſarie in al times and places of the Church, &amp; that their Senate or Segniorie is not conuenient vnder a Christian Magistrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Denmarke</hi> they haue biſhoppes both in name, and office, as it appeareth in certaine Epiſtles of <hi>Hemingius</hi> written to ſome of them.

Godly Fathers aſſembled in the name of the Lorde, with common conſent and without contradiction to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, proceede from the holie ſpirite of GOD: and therefore I dare not inconſcience improoue them.

Senate of Elders, nor thinke it tollerable vnder a Chriſtian Magiſtrate: nor the Diſcipline by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which they more miſlike. I thinke it be not much differing at <hi>Berne</hi> (one of the greteſt Churches) as I gather by <hi>Aretius</hi> in ſundry places. At <hi>Geneua,</hi> and ſome other places, eſpecially ſuch as haue had their beginning from thence, they haue a gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not much vnlike that platforme, which is deſired to be with vs, and is nowe in <hi>Scotland.</hi> I might ſay the like for ſome ceremonies &amp; outward orders. In <hi>Saxony</hi> and at <hi>Baſile</hi> they kneele at the Lords Supper. At <hi>Tygure</hi> they ſit, and it is brought to them: In other places they go and receiue it, for the more expedition, as they paſſe.</p>
               <p>The like libertie and diuerſitie vſe they in ſome other externall things, which I am not willing for ſome cauſes to lay downe in writing. All thoſe Churches, in which the goſpell in theſe dayes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter great darkeneſſe, was firſt renewed, and the learned men whome God ſent to inſtruct them, I doubt not but haue beene directed by the ſpirite of God to retain this liberty, that in external gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; other outward orders, they might chooſe ſuch as they thought in wiſdome and godlineſſe to bee moſt conuenient for the ſtate of their Country, and diſpoſition of the people. Why then ſhoulde this libertie, that other Countries hauevſed, vnder any colour bee wreſted from vs? I thinke it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great preſumption and boldeneſſe, that ſome of our nation, and thoſe (whatſoeuer they thinke of themſelues) not of the greateſt wiſedome and skill, ſhoulde take vpon them to controll the whole Realme, and to binde both prince &amp; people,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19124:47"/>
in neceſſity of conſcience, to alter the preſent ſtate, and to tie themſelues to a certaine platforme deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome of our neighbours, which in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of manie wiſe and godly perſons is moſt vnfit for the ſtate of a kingdome, or to bee exerciſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Chriſtian Prince that defendeth the Goſpell, as in part, experience already hath taught in ſome. I pray God they looke not further, and haue not a deeper reach, then good ſubiectes that loue their Prince and countrey, ſhould haue.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I would wiſh them (leauing the long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes where unto Doctor <hi>Bridges</hi> was drawen by ſome of their ſtrange and intricate aſſertions) they woulde briefly without corruption lay downe his arguments and allegations, touching the ſupreme authoritie of the Prince, and the ſuperioritie of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and modeſtly, and ſoundly anſwere the ſame, not reiecting the teſtimony of the ancient Writers and Hiſtoriographers, eſpecially ſuch as were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 400. yeeres after Chriſt, ſo farre as they may bee <hi>Teſtes temporum.</hi> For if they ſhall otherwiſe deale, and ſeeke to ſhift off the matter with reproches, ſcoffes, and ſlaunders: they wil diſcredit their cauſe, and make good men thinke, that the ſpirite with which they are carried, is not the milde ſpirit of Chriſt, but the ſpirit of him that is condemned for the father of lying, murdering and ſlandering from the beginning.</p>
               <p>The reaſon that mooueth vs not to like of this platforme of gouernment, is, that when we on the one part conſider the thinges that are required to be redreſſed, &amp; on the other, the ſtate of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, people, and common weale: we ſee euidently,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19124:48"/>
that to plant thoſe things in the Church, will drawe with it ſo many, and ſo great alterations of the State of gouernment, and of the lawes, as the attempting thereof might bring rather the ouerthrowe of the Goſpell among vs, then the ende that is deſired. The particulars hereof in ſome fewe things, in ſteade of many doe here follow, and hath bene opened to you before, if reaſonable warning would haue ſerued.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the whole ſtate of the lawes of this Realme will be altered. For the <hi>Canon lawe</hi> muſt be vtterly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, vvith all offices to the ſame belonging: which to ſupply with other lawes &amp; functions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many inconueniences, wilbe very hard. The vſe and ſtudie of the Ciuil law wil be vtterly ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en: For the <hi>Ciuilians</hi> in this Realme liue not by the vſe of the Ciuill law, but by the offices of the <hi>Canon law,</hi> and ſuch things as are within the compaſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And if you take thoſe offices and functions away, and thoſe matters wherewith they deale in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Lawe:</hi> you muſt needes take away the hope of rewarde, and by that meanes, their whole Studie. And matters of <hi>Tithes, Teſtaments, and Matrimonie, iudgements alſo of Adulterie, Slaunder, &amp;c.</hi> are in theſe mens iudgements meere temporall, and therefore to bee dealt in by the temporall Magiſtrate onely: Which, as yet haue eyther none at all, or very fewe lawes touching thoſe things. Therefore the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and Common lawe of this Realme, muſt by that occaſion receiue alſo a very great alteration. For it will bee no ſmall matter to apply theſe things to the Temporall lawe, and to appoynt Courts, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and maner of proceſſe and proceedings in iudgement for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:19124:48"/>
Beſide this, the Iudiciall law of the Iewes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for ſuch offences as are againſt the lawe of God, muſt bee brought into this Common weale. For to this opinion doe they plainely incline. For they ſay already flatly, that no Magiſtrate can ſaue the life of a blaſphemer, ſtubborne Idolater, murderer, Adulterer, Inceſtuous perſon, and ſuch like, which God by his Iudiciall lawe hath commaunded to be put to death. The ſame aſſertion muſt haue like aucthoritie for the contrary, that is, that a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ought not to puniſh by death thoſe offences that God by his Iudicial lawe hath not appointed to be puniſhed by death, and ſo may not our lawes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh theft by death, nor diuers other felonies: and ſo ſome of them haue openly preached. The lawes alſo mainteining the <hi>Queenes ſupremacie in gouerning of the Church, and her prerogatiue in matters Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> as vvell Elections as others, muſt be alſo abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thoſe lavves likevviſe muſt bee taken away, whereby <hi>Impropriations</hi> and <hi>Patronages</hi> ſtand as mens lavvfull poſſeſſion and heritage. In theſe <hi>Impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Patronages,</hi> as I doe confeſſe, there is Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table abuſe, and vviſh the ſame by ſome good Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to bee remedied: ſo howe the thing it ſelfe can vvithout great difficultie and danger be taken away, being ſo generall as it is in the ſtate of this Realme, I leane to the iudgement of the vviſe and godly.</p>
               <p>The lawes of <hi>England</hi> to this day, haue ſtoode by the aucthoritie of the three Eſtates: vvhich to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now, by leauing out the one, may happily ſeeme a matter of more vveight, then all men doe iudge it. If there vvere no more then this one thing, vvhich hitherto I haue ſpoken of, that is, the alteration of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19124:49"/>
the ſtate of all the lawes of this Realme: I thinke there is no wiſe man but ſeeth what daunger may followe in theſe perillous times, not onely by fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the thing, but alſo by offering to doe it.</p>
               <p>It hath beene alwayes dangerous, to picke quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels againſt lawes ſetled. And I pray God, that the very rumour hereof, ſpread by theſe mens bookes, haue not already bred more inconuenience, then without hurt will bee ſuppreſſed: I may not put all that I thinke, in writing.</p>
               <p>The fourme of finding of Miniſters by Tythes, muſt with the Canon lawe be aboliſhed. For it was not vſed in the gouernment of the Apoſtles time, nor a great many of yeeres after, and therefore may ſeeme Papiſticall and Antichriſtian. There muſt bee ſome other order for this deuiſed. Which, with howe great alteration it muſt bee done, and how hard it will be to bring to good effect, I thinke there is no man but he ſeeth: For the liuings of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes and Cathedrall Churches, (whereat they carpe) though they were all that way beſtowed, will not ſerue the third part.</p>
               <p>If this gouernment, whereof they ſpeake, be (as they ſay) neceſſary in all places: then muſt they haue of neceſſitie in euery particular pariſh one Paſtor, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of Seniors, &amp; a Deacon or two at the leaſt, and all thoſe to be found of the pariſh, becauſe they muſt leaue theſe occupations, to attend vpon the matters of the church. But there are a number of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in <hi>England</hi> not able to find one tollerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, much leſſe to find ſuch a company. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hereof muſt bee, to vnite diuers pariſhes in one, wherof this inconuenience will follow, that people
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19124:49"/>
in the countrey muſt come to Church, three, foure, or fiue miles off: whereas now they that dwel in the ſame town, can ſcarcely be forced by any penalties of Law orderly to come vnto the church, to ſeruice or ſermons, ſo that they will growe to barbariſme in many places.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is required, that the people ſhoulde chooſe their Paſtours, Elders, and Deacons: it is greatly to be feared, that it wil be matter of ſchiſme, diſcord and diſſenſion in many places: or that one or two buſie heads ſhall leade the reſidue to what purpoſe they will, to the great diſquieting both of the Church and of the common weale. Examples heereof did commonly appeare in the olde Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, while that manner of Election did continue, as the eccleſiaſticall hiſtories in manie places doe declare. And that inconuenience cauſed Princes and biſhops ſo much to intermeddle in that matter. The common people through affection and want of right iudgement, are more eaſily wroght by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious perſons to giue their conſent to vnwoorthy men, as may appeare in all thoſe offices of gaine or dignity, that at this day remaine in the choice of the multitude, yea, though they be learned.</p>
               <p>Men doe knowe by experience, that pariſhes, vpon ſome priuate reſpect, do ſend their Letters of earneſt commendations for very vnfit and vnable perſons: whereby it may bee gathered, what they would do, if the whole choiſe were in their handes, eſpecially, being ſo backwardly affected toward the trueth of religion, as a great part of men are. They will aunſwere (perhappes) that they ſhall bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene by the Paſtours neere about them in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19124:50"/>
Synode, and forced both to be quiet, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to make more fitte elections. But vvho ſeeth not vvhat matter of trouble this vvil be, vvhen vpon the occaſion almoſt of euery election, they muſt haue a particular Synode? And if the pariſh vvil not be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (as ſurely many vvil not) then muſt they bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and appeale made vnto the Prince and Magiſtrate. And that vvhich paſſeth novv with quietneſſe, and vvith a little amendment may bee vvell vſed, ſhal be continuall occaſion of broile and trouble, whereto this nation is more inclined vpon light cauſes, then any other.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, that vvhich is moſt of all pretended for this manner of common Election, that they may knovee their miniſter, and thereby haue the better liking of him, can not poſſibly bee brought to paſſe, vnleſſe they vvill imagine, that euery pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſhall haue within it ſelfe a Schoole or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, where thoſe ſhall bee brought vp, that ſhall bee preferred to the miniſterie among them. But howe poſſible that is to bring to paſſe among vs, let anie man iudge. If their miniſters ſhall come vnto them from the Vniuerſities or other ſchooles, they ſhall haue as little acquaintance with them, as now they haue, and farre greater occaſion of partiall ſutes, then nowe there is. So that inconueniences by this meanes ſhall bee increaſed and not reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died.</p>
               <p>That euery pariſh in Englande may haue a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and diſcreete miniſter, howſoeuer they dreame of perfection, no man is able in theſe dayes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, how to bring it to paſſe, and ſpecially when by this change of the clergie, the great rewards of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19124:50"/>
ſhall be taken away, &amp; men thereby diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to bring vp their children in the ſtudie of good Letters. Furthermore, who ſeeth not howe ſmall continuance there ſhall bee in the Vniuerſities, to make men of any profound knowledge, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſity of places, ſhall drawe men away before they come to any ripeneſſe? the effect whereof, is partly perceiued at this day already, &amp; much more would be, if their deuiſe ſhould take place.</p>
               <p>Touching the inconuenience of Diſcipline by excommunication onely, which they ſo much crie for, how it will be of moſt men contemned, and of how ſmal force it wil be to bring to effect any good amendment of life, ſome learned men of this age in their workes ſet foorth to the vvorlde, haue at large declared. I let paſſe, that experience teacheth, that men of ſtubburnneſſe vvil not ſhunne the company of them that be excommunicated, and then muſt they bee excommunicated for keeping of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vvith them, and ſo will it fall out, that more vvill be excommunicated, then in Communion: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vvhat deformities and inconueniences vvil ariſe, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doeth reach vs. The looſeneſſe of theſe dayes requireth Diſcipline of ſharper lavves by puniſhment of body and danger of goods: which they doe, and vvill more feare, then they vvill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. And, God bee thanked, (if men would be contented with any moderation) we haue a very good manner of diſcipline by the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call commiſſion, vvhich hath done, and doeth daily much good, &amp; would do more, if it were more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, &amp; men would take more pains in it. But this is that which they be moſt grieued with, becauſe they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19124:51"/>
are not doers in it themſelues.</p>
               <p>The deciding of matters in controuerſie by the Paſtours and Elders of the Church, beſide that it will interrupt the courſe of the lawes of the realme, it will be great occaſion of partiall and affectionate dealing, and thereby of further ſtrife and diſcorde, and a matter of ſchiſmes and diuiſions, as is to bee perceiued aboundantly in the Eccleſiaſticall Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For ſome will incline to the one part, and the reſidue ſhall be wrought to fauour the other: which hath beene the principal roote of al ſchiſmes in the Church, yea, and thereby of many hereſies. Wee muſt not onely looke in theſe corrupt times, howe vprightly men ſhould deale, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider by preſent experience of ſundrie perſons and places, howe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately they do deale in ſome like matters, and thereby gather what they will doe, when they haue greater authoritie. This order was good, where the church was in perſecution vnder tyrants: but where the aſſiſtance may be had of a Chriſtian Prince, or Magiſtrate, it is neither neceſſarie, nor ſo conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as it may be otherwiſe. Surely common electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of miniſters, and this deciding of matters in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie by a multitude, will breede greater ſtrife and contention, then without danger will bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, their whole drift, as it may ſeeme, is to bring the gouernement of the Church to a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie</hi> or <hi>Aristocracie.</hi> The principles and reaſons whereof, if they bee made once by experience fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar in the mindes of the common people, and that they haue the ſenſe and feeling of them: It is greatly to bee feared, that they will very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19124:51"/>
transferre the ſame to the Gouernement o of the common weale. For by the ſame reaſons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And what heereof may follow, I leaue to the iudgement of other. The way hereof is alreadie troden foorth vnto them by ſome that haue written and ſpoken in that matter: Which ſpeeches I woulde bee loath to touch particularly, becauſe I thinke diuers of them not to haue any meaning to indure that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell. But men muſt conſider, not onely what they meane preſently themſelues, but what other may gather vpon them hereafter. <hi>Cyprian, Hillarie,</hi> and other ancient writers, did not meane ſo ill in ſome things that they left written, as ſome Heretikes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing did father vpon them, vſing their ſayinges, as the groundes of their falſe and erronious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. The Preachers of the Goſpell in <hi>Germanie,</hi> at the beginning, were farre from the meaning to mooue the people to rebell againſt their Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: but ſome part of doctrine vndiſcreetely vttered by diuers of them, ſpeaking againſt ſome abuſes, gaue a great occaſion thereof to the griefe of all good men, in ſuch ſort, as they were not able by any perſwaſion to quiet them, vntill it had coſt a hundred thouſand of them their liues. The looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and boldneſſe of this time in many, may iuſtly cauſe ſome feare that the like will happen hereafter among vs. Anomber of other like inconueniences I might lay downe in this place, and diuers of them

of as great weight as theſe. By theſe fewe, ſome taſte may be taken of the reſidue. But I will now returne in a word or two to the <hi>Martiniſt</hi> againe.</p>
               <p>NOw becauſe <hi>M.

I ſawe his figure drawen and ſet forth in a table when I was a yong man: the paynter was one very nigh of his kinne: His name was <hi>Lucian.</hi> The figure vvas this, An ancient man of ſome authoritie ſate vpon the iudgement ſeate: hee was like <hi>Mydas</hi> that coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous King: for hee had long eares like an Aſſe, and had ſitting on eche ſide of him a woman: the name of the one was <hi>Ignorance,</hi> the other was called <hi>Ielous Suſpition,</hi> which two made him very raſh in credite. Then commeth in <hi>M.

In his left hand, he caried a flaming firebrand to note his furie. With his right hand he drewe by the haire of the head a yoong man, his name was <hi>Innocencie,</hi> who lifted vp his handes to heauen, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting before ood that he was giltleſſe in the cauſe. There folowed two or three, much like to ſchollers: their names were <hi>Dolus, Fraus, Inſidiae.</hi> Theſe clapped their Maſter on the backe to encourage him. And becauſe Maſter <hi>Martin</hi> will be a Gentleman, he had a <hi>treader</hi> before him, an olde fellowe: his eies were

fierce, his face thinne &amp; withered, his whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance much like to one pined away with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly &amp; fretting furie.

Surely, this is a grieuous and an horrible accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the eares of any chriſtian Magiſtrate: and if it be found true, the offendours not vvorthy to liue in this Common vvealth: Or if it be falſe and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, the Accuſer not meete to eſcape vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. The example of the ſlaundering the Miniſters of the Church, is a matter more dangerous, then in theſe daies it is eſteemed. But as touching the thing it ſelfe, I am of opinion, that no man of meane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or any experience, hauing regarde of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, vvould vndertake to iuſtifie ſuch an accuſation in the hearing of any honeſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For, this I dare ſay, and vpon hazard of that is moſt deere vnto mee in this world wil proue, that where the ſtate of this our Church of England doeth leaue to an euill diſpoſed biſhop one occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the practiſe of Simony, &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous oppreſſion of the people, that the B. of Rome had fourtie.

Yea, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hiſtories of this Realme can vvitneſſe, that by Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony &amp; couetous oppreſſion, the biſhops of Rome haue had yeerely out of this Realme more money, then at that time the reuenevv of the Kings crovvne did extend vnto, or at this day (as I thinke) all the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks in England be worth.

                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:19124:54"/>
had yeerely out of this Lande 60000 markes: vnto which if you doe adde his like dealing in <hi>Germanie</hi> and other countreys, you ſhall perceiue the value to be ineſtimable. And ſurely I am of that hope, and in my conſcience I think it to be moſt true, that all the Biſhops in this land, by Simoniacal practiſe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous oppreſſion, doe not gaine the hundred part thereof. And if it doe riſe to that value, it is a great deale too much: yea, if it be one peny, it is wicked, and by no good man ought to be defended, &amp; much leſſe by them to bee practiſed. I hope well of all, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I wil not take vpon me to excuſe all: But for ſome, I aſſuredly know, &amp; in my conſcience dare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that ſince they were made Biſhops, they haue not wittingly gained that way, one twenty ſhillings. Therefore in equalling the biſhops of Englande in the practiſe of Simonie vvith the Pope of Rome, there muſt needs be great oddes in the compariſon, and the whole ſpeech may well be called <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> that is, an vncharitable amplification, ſurmounting all likelihood of honeſt and Chriſtian trueth.</p>

Oh, a worthie reaſon. Is this to iuſtifie ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of the church of God, vnder a chriſtian Princes gouernment? Is that Chriſtian Preacher and Biſhop, (if any ſuch be) that vſeth Simoniacall practiſe in two or three points of ſmal importance, and litle value in grieuouſneſſe of offence before God and the vvorlde, to be equalled to the head of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19124:54"/>
Antichriſt, and the principall enemy of the Goſpel, practizing the ſame in a thouſande of great weight and vneſtimable value? I cannot but wiſh more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable hearts to them that will take vpon them the zeale and profeſsion of the Goſpel. Let ſinne be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, euen in them that fauour the word, and chiefly the Clergie: but yet ſo, as trueth will beare, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie with Chriſtian charitie doeth require, leſt in much amplifying of ſmall offences, you become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments not onely to diſcredit the parties blamed, but alſo to ouerthrowe the doctrine that they teach. There ought to be great difference betweene Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Preachers &amp; writers inueighing againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and his members enemies of the Goſpell, and zealous profeſſors, blaming &amp; reprouing the faults of their owne Biſhop and Clergie in the eſtate of a Church by authoritie ſetled. The one part is kindled with an earneſt zeale &amp; deteſtation of the obſtinate patrones of errour and idolatrie: the other ſhoulde bee mooued onely with a charitable ſorowe and griefe, to ſee Preachers of the trueth not to declare in life that, which they vtter to other in doctrine. They that by humane frailtie offende in blemiſh of life onely, are not with like bitterneſſe to bee hated, harried, rated and defaced, as they that with obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and vnrepentant hearts, offend both in life and doctrine, and to the face of the worlde ſhewe them-ſelues aduerſaries of the truth. Chriſt after one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner blameth the Scribes &amp; phariſes, &amp; after another he reprooueth the ignorance, the dulneſſe, the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and carnal affection of his owne Diſciples that followed him. But I pray you, let vs conſider the particular proofe of this generall accuſation, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19124:55"/>
odious compariſon, Surely they are ſo trifling, that I am aſhamed to ſtay vpon them, and yet I muſt needes ſpeake a word or two of them. The Church of England retaineth a good and neceſſarie order, that before the celebration of marriage, the Banes ſhould be asked three ſeuerall Sabboth dayes.</p>

The order I thinke very good and meete to bee obſerued in a Chriſtian Church, and not without good cauſe to be altered: and yet doth it not beare any neceſsitie in Religion and holineſſe, whereby mens conſciences ſhould be wrung or wreſted. But I will demaund of the accuſer, whether there be not ſome caſes, wherein, the circumſtances being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, this matter may bee diſpenſed withall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians? And if there bee (as no reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man can deny) then I aske further, whether there bee any lawe in this Church of Englande, whereby, with the authoritie of the Prince, it is granted, that a Biſhoppe may in ſuch conuenient caſes diſpenſe with this order? And if there bee ſuch lawe of the Church and of the Realme: I marueile, howe it can be counted Simonie, or couetous ſelling of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the Goſpell, to diſpenſe with it.</p>

The order is good, no man can deny it, or without good cauſe alter it: but there is no externall order ſo
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19124:55"/>
neceſſary, but that authoritie may in ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations lawfully diſpenſe therewith. It was a good order and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God, that none but the Prieſts ſhould eat of the ſhew bread, and yet in a caſe of neceſſitie, <hi>Abimelech</hi> the hie Prieſt, did diſpenſe <note place="margin">1. Sam. 21.</note> with <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; his company in eating the ſame bread. The external obſeruation of the Sabboth day was a good order, and a commandement ſtreightly giuen by God: and yet we read that the Iewes in neceſſitie <note place="margin">Maccab.</note> did breake it, and fought on the Sabboth day. And <note place="margin">Marke 2. Matth. 12.</note> Chriſt himſelfe defended his Diſciples, that on that day did bruiſe Corne and eate it. Therefore by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authoritie, ſuch orders may bee diſpenſed with, and not deſerue iuſt reproofe, much leſſe the crime of Couetouſneſſe and Simonie.</p>

By as good reaſon may they excuſe any Iudge, or chiefe officer in this Land of extortion and bribery: becauſe his Clearkes and vnder officers take money for the writing &amp; diſpatch of Proceſſes, Writs, and other like matters, where of happily ſome ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commeth to the Iudge or chiefe officer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the ſame alſo warranted, and made good by the lawes of this Realme. If either Eccleſiaſticall Miniſters or other officers and Magiſtrates, ſhall by extortion wreſt more, then by order is due: there li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth lawfull remedie and ſharpe puniſhment for the ſame. And in all ſocieties and common weales that euer haue bene, aſwell among Chriſtians as other, it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19124:56"/>
hath bene counted lawfull, that the Miniſters to higher officers, aſwell Eccleſiaſticall as other, ſhould haue lawfull portions and fees allowed them for ſuch things where in they trauell. Therefore, how this may be imputed to Biſhops as Simonie, and ſale of Chriſtian libertie, I ſee not.</p>

If that be true, I praiſe it not, I defend it not, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it not: and I thinke the fault more in inferiour Officers, then in Biſhops themſelues. But in whome ſoeuer the fault be, that cannot be ſo great and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, that Biſhoppes of England may iuſtly bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Antichriſtian Prelates, Petie Antichriſts, Subuice-Antichriſts &amp;c. as ſome in the heate of their zeale, doe tearme them. But God I truſt, in due time, will coole their heate with the ſpirite of mildeneſſe and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. If many Biſhops haue gained by this kinde of Diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I maruaile. Surely I know ſome, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receiued pennie in that conſideration, but haue giuen ſtrait charge to their inferiour officers, neuer to diſpenſe with that matter, but vpon great and weighty cauſe: &amp; ſuch order is now generally taken. But (good Chriſtians) here is the griefe, that moueth all this grudge: that euill perſons, when, either to cloke their whoredome, or to preuent another of his lawfull wife, or ſome other like purpoſe, will marrie without orderly asking in the Church, they bee for the ſame conuented &amp; puniſhed by the magiſtrate: This they be grieued at, &amp; count it great extremitie:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19124:56"/>
for, becauſe they ſee the lavvfull Magiſtrate, vpon good conſiderations ſometime to diſpenſe with this order, they thinke it as conuenient for them vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaue, of their ovvne heads to vſe the ſame, to the ſatisfying of their vnlavvfull luſt, or other lewde affection. For ſuch is novv the ſtate of this time, that vvhatſoeuer an Officer, ſpecially Eccleſiaſtical, may do by lawful authoritie, the priuate ſubiect thinketh he may doe the ſame, at his owne vvill and pleaſure. And if he be brideled thereof, why then it is Lordli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Symonie, Couetouſneſſe, and Crueltie. And I pray God, the like boldeneſſe grovve not tovvard other Officers and magiſtrates of the Common vveale al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Surely, vve haue great cauſe to feare it: for the reaſons vvhereon they ground their doings, may be applied as vvell to the one, as to the other.</p>

Another Argument of couetouſneſſe in biſhops <note place="margin">The ſecond proofe of couetouſnes forbidding of Mariage.</note> is farre vvorſe, as it is ſaid, then the former: that they prohibite marriage at certaine times, moſt contrary to Gods worde: that is (ſay they) a Papiſtical practiſe, to fill the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies purſe: yea, it is a doctrine of Antichriſt, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill him ſelfe, prohibiting Marriage euen in Laye men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to S.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
Surely, for my part I confeſſe, and before God and the vvorlde proteſt, that in my conſcience I thinke, that who ſoeuer forbiddeth Marriage to any kinde of men, is tainted vvith the corruption of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian doctrine, and hath his conſcience ſeared with an hot iron, bearing the marke of the beaſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the <hi>Apocalypſe:</hi> but I am clearely reſolued <note place="margin">Apoe. 13</note>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:19124:57"/>
that the Biſhoppes of Englande are free from any touch of that opinion, and doe account it no leſſe then a token of Antichriſt noted by <hi>Daniel,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite lavvfull Matrimonie. Their doctrine openly taught and preached, and the practiſe of their life doth ſhevve it to be ſo, that no man vnleſſe hee bee blinded with malice, vvill impute that errour vnto them. Who ſeeth not, that by exerciſe of mariage in their ovvne perſons, they caſt themſelues into the diſpleaſure and miſliking of a great nomber, in that onely they bee married, contrary to the corruption of the Popiſh and antichriſtian Church? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I pray you (good Chriſtian readers) weigh and conſider with your ſelues, what vnchriſtian and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh dealing this is toward the miniſters of God, of purpoſe onely to deface them, and bring them in miſliking by ſiniſter interpretations, to caſt vpon them the filth and reproche of that corrupt doctrine of Antichriſt, vvhich moſt of all other they doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne in their teaching, and withſtand in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Is there feare of God in thoſe hearts that can doe this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi>
Why? (they will ſay) It is euident that Mariage is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by them at certaine times of the yere, and thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion giuen to weake &amp; fraile perſons, to fall into whoredome and fornication, or to burne in their conſciences with great danger of their ſoules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
Vndoubtedly this muſt needs be thought a capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and rigorous interpretation, to ſay that a ſtay of mariage for certaine daies and weekes, is an vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian forbidding of mariage, &amp; vvorthy ſo grieuous
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19124:57"/>
blame, as is caſt vpon biſhops for it. For then it is a <hi>Popiſh diſorder alſo, and Antichriſtian corruption, to ſtay marriage for three weekes, vntill the Banes bee asked:</hi> for in that ſpace, light and euill diſpoſed mindes, may eaſily fall to offence. And yet this order both is, and ought to bee accounted of them, a godly and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary order in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi>
They will anſvvere, that it is Popiſh and ſuperſtitious, to tye the order of Marriage vnto any time or ſeaſon, more then other. For the thing beeing good and lawfull by the worde of God, why ſhould it bee (ſay they) asſigned to any time or place? There is no place more holy then Paradiſe was, nor no time ſo good as was before Adam fell by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
I anſvvere, if any man appoynt Marriage to bee vſed at this or that time and place, for conſcience ſake, or for holineſſe, as though the time or place coulde make the thing eyther more or leſſe holy, ſurely I muſt needs condemne him as ſuperſtitious, and cannot thinke well of the doing, though all the biſhoppes in Englande ſhoulde affirme the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For to make holy, or vnholy, thoſe things that God hath left free, and bee of them ſelues indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, is one of the chiefe groundes of all Papiſticall corruption. But I ſuſpect no biſhop in this Realme to be of that iudgement, and I dare ſay there is not. A thing left by Gods lawe free and indifferent, may bee accounted more conuenient, comely, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, at one time and place, then at another: but more holy it cannot bee.</p>
               <p>All meats are free at all times by the law of God: <hi>for nothing is vnclean that is receiued with thankeſgiuing:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19124:58"/>
neither doeth any thing that goeth into the mouth defile a man.</hi> And yet becauſe it is now a Poſitiue law in this common vveale, not for holineſſe, but for orders ſake: it is not ſo comely and conuenient for an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman to eate fleſh on Fridayes and Saturdayes, or in the Lent, as it is at other times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi>
Heere they will crye and ſay, that both the one law and the other is ſuperſtitious and naught, and proceeded both out of the Popes mint, and there were coyned, and had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and therefore that the Biſhops doe wickedly, and like to popiſh Prelates, that ſo retaine in the Church and common weale, the dregs of Antichriſtian corruption.</p>

This is the voice &amp; opinion of them only, vvhich thinke not any thing tollerable to be vſed, that hath bin vſed in the church before time, were it of it ſelfe neuer ſo good. Theſe vvill haue no Font, but chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten children in baſons. They wil weare no caps nor ſurplices: many of them vvil not vſe the old pulpits, but haue nevv made: they wil not accept a collect or praier, be it neuer ſo agreeable to the vvord of God. I maruaile, that they vſe the Churches them ſelues, then which, nothing hath bin more prophaned with ſuperſtition and idolatrie. They ſhould do that <hi>Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Mileuitanus</hi> writeth, that the Donatiſts were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to do, that is, when they obteyned a Church, vvhich before had bene vſed by Catholikes, they vvoulde ſcrape the walles therof, and breake the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tables &amp; cups. But it may appeare, that the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned father <hi>Auguſt.</hi> vvas not of that opinion. For in his epiſtle vvritten to <hi>Publicola,</hi> a queſtion was moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto him, whether in deſtroying the idoles tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or their groues, a Chriſtian might vſe any part
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19124:58"/>
of the wood, or water, or any other thing that did apperteine vnto them: His anſwere was, that men might not take thoſe things to their priuate vſe, leaſt they run into ſuſpicion, to haue deſtroyed ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for couetouſnes: but that the ſame things might be imploied in <hi>pios &amp; neceſſarios vſus.</hi> But I recite not this, to defend that law, whereby mariage for a time is forbidden. For I thinke it not a matter of ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, neither is it ſo greatly preſſed, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. I thinke there is no lawe remaining, that is ſo little executed, as that is.</p>
               <p>The other law of forbearing fleſh on Fridayes, in Lent, and other dayes, for the ſtate of our countrey I thinke very conuenient, and moſt neceſſarie to be vſed in Chriſtian policie. I woulde to God thoſe men, that make ſo ſmall accompt of this lawe, had heard the reaſons of the graueſt, wiſeſt, and moſt expert men of this realme, not only for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of this Lawe, but alſo for ſome addition to be made vnto it. How God hath placed this land, there is no reaſonable man but ſeeth: The Sea are our walles, and if on theſe walles we haue not ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable furniture of ſhips, we ſhal tempt God in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing open our countrey to the enemy, and not vſing thoſe inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which God hath appointed. There is no ſtate of men, that doeth ſo much furniſh this realme with ſufficient numbers of mariners for our nauie, as fiſhers doe. And how ſhall fiſhers be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, if they haue not ſufficient vtterance for thoſe things, for which they trauell? And howe can they haue vtterance, if euery daintie mouthed man, without infirmitie &amp; ſickeneſſe, ſhall eate fleſh at his pleaſure? They cannot pretend religion, or reſtraint
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19124:59"/>
of Chriſtian libertie, ſeeing open proteſtation is made by the lawe, that it is not for conſcience ſake, but for the defence and ſafetie of the realme. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this crying out againſt this lawe, is not onely needeleſſe, but alſo vndiſcreete and factious.</p>

But there bee other matters that more nighlie <note place="margin">The crime of making vnlearned Miniſters.</note> touch the quicke, and if they be true, can receiue no face of defence. They make lewde and vnlearned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for gaine: they maintaine pouling and pilling courtes: they abuſe the Churches diſcipline, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
As touching the firſt, if they make lewde Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, it is one great fault: if they doe it wittingly, it is farre a more heinous offence: if they do it for gaine, it is of all other moſt wicked and horrible, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede ſhoulde directly proue deuiliſh ſimonie to be in them. That ſome lewde and vnlearned miniſters haue bene made, it is manifeſt: I will not ſeeme to defend it: I woulde they had had more care herein, that the offence of the godly might haue bene leſſe. And yet I knowe, all their faults in this are not alike, and ſome haue ſmally offended herein. And in them all, I ſee a certaine care and determination, ſo much as in them lyeth, to amend the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that hath riſen by it. Which thing, with profeſſours of the Goſpell, ſhoulde cauſe their fault to bee the more charitably borne, leaſt they ſeeme not ſo much to haue miſliking of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as of the perſons themſelues, for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe, then they will bee openly knowen of. But if they ſhoulde doe, as they be (I truſt) vniuſtly reported of, that is, to make lewde and vnlearned
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19124:59"/>
Miniſters for lucre and gaine: truly, no puniſhment coulde be too grieuous for them. Which way that ſhould be gainefull to Biſhops, I ſee not.</p>
               <p>The Clarke or Regiſter, I knowe, hath his fee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the writing of letters of Orders: but that euer Biſhop did take any thing in that reſpect, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard, neither thinke I, that their greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be able to proue it vpon many of them.

Or if there hath bene any one ſuch euil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed perſon that hath ſo vtterly forgot his duetie and calling, that eyther this way, or any ſuch like, in making of Miniſters hath ſought his owne gaine and commoditie: it is hard dealing, with the reproch thereof to defame the innocent, together with the guiltie, and to diſtaine the honeſtie of them that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deſerued it.

It will bee ſayde that all this is but a gloſe or colour, to hide and turne from you thoſe great crimes that you are iuſtly charged withall.

Hereby commeth it to paſſe, that the people of God bee not taught their duetie, eyther to God, or to their Prince: but, by their ignoraunce, are layde foorth as a pray to Sathan. For, by that occaſion, they bee ledde away to euill with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery light perſwaſion that is put into their heads, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God or their prince, ſo that it may bee iuſtly thought that all thoſe miſchiefes that of late haue fallen foorth, haue ſprung out of this onely roote, aſwell in them that haue ſlidde backe and reuolted from religion, as in thoſe that haue

This is ſurely a grieuous accuſation: but God, I truſt, will iudge more vprightly, and regard the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie of our hearts, in theſe horrible crimes laid to our charge. Theſe accuſers, to ſatiſfie their miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king affection towarde our ſtate, not onely ſuffer themſelues to bee deceiued with falſe and captious reaſons, but dangerouſly alſo ſeeke to ſeduce other. Logicians, among other deceitfull arguments note one principally, <hi>A non cauſa vt cauſa,</hi> that is, when men, either to praiſe, or diſpraiſe, doe attribute the effects of either part to ſome things or perſons, as cauſes therof, which indeed are not the true cauſes. Which falſe reaſoning hath done great harme at all times, both in the Church of God, and in common weales. After the aſcenſion of Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſent his Apoſtles and other holy men to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of our ſaluation in Chriſt, and the ſame was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men vnthankfully receiued: God did caſt ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry plagues &amp; puniſhments vpon them, as <hi>dearth and ſcarcitie, famine &amp; hunger, the peſtilence, and ſundry other diſeaſes, warre &amp; tumult, earthquakes and great deluges in ſundry places.</hi> The cauſes of al this, very ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derouſly &amp; blaſphemouſly they imputed to Chriſtian Religion, and therby raiſed thoſe dreadfull perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which at that time were exerciſed againſt the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>This errour was the cauſe that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> wrote his notable worke <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi> and that <hi>Oroſius,</hi> by the counſell both of Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and

Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> vvrote his hiſtorie: vvherein he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvereth this falſe argument, and ſhevveth that God in all times, had ſent the like plagues for the ſinnes and offences of mankinde, and for the reiecting of his vvorde and trueth.</p>
               <p>In the fourtie foure Chapter of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> The Ievves deceiue themſelues with the like argument, to confirme their conceiued ſuperſtition and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. <hi>But we will do</hi> (ſay they) <hi>whatſoeuer thing commeth out of our owne mouth: as to burne incenſe to the Queene of Heauen, &amp; to powre out drinke offerings vnto her as we haue done, both we and our Fathers, our Kings &amp; our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Cities of Iudah, and in the ſtreetes of Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: for then had we plentie of victuals, &amp; were well, and felt no euill. But ſince wee left off to burne incenſe to the Queene of Heauen, and to powre out drinke offerings vnto her, we haue had ſcarceneſſe of all things, &amp; haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the ſword and by the famine.</hi> In theſe vvordes you ſee, to the hardening of their owne hearts, they attribute the good giftes of God to their idolatrie, and their dearth and trouble to the preaching of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi> and other Prophets, vvhich indeede were not the true cauſes thereof. In like maner reaſon rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubiects in common vveales, when they ſeeke to make odious the Princes &amp; gouernors vnder whom they liue, vniuſtly imputing to them the cauſes of ſuch things, wherwith they finde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues grieued.</p>
               <p>So reaſoned the rebels in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Walſingham</note> the ſecond, againſt the King, againſt the Counſell, and chiefe Nobilitie of the Realme, againſt the Lavvyers, and all other States of learning, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had reſolution among them, to haue deſtroyed and ouerthrovven them all, and to haue ſuffered
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19124:61"/>
none other to liue in this Realme with them, but the Gray Friers onely.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore this manner of reaſoning is ſo perillous, it behooueth all them that feare God, and loue the trueth, and will not vvillingly be caried into errour, to take diligent heed that they be not abuſed herewith. And ſo I pray God they may doe, vvhich at this time ſo earneſtly ſeeke to make odious the ſtate of the Clergie of <hi>England,</hi> imputing to them the cauſes of thoſe things, vvhich they moſt deteſt and abhorre.</p>
               <p>For if they vvill ſee the trueth, and iudge but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, they ſhall finde that there is no ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Miniſterie, as they complaine of: neyther ſuch vvant of preaching, as may iuſtly prouoke the wrath of God, to ſend ſuch plagues &amp; puniſhments vpon vs, as they recite. This I dare iuſtifie, that ſince <hi>Englande</hi> had firſt the name of a Chriſtian Church, there was neuer ſo much preaching of the vvorde of God, neuer ſo many in number, neuer ſo ſufficient and able perſons to teach and ſet forth the ſame, as be at this day, hovvſoeuer they be defamed and defaced. There bee, I confeſſe, many vnlearned and vnſufficient Miniſters: but yet I take it to bee cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and odious, in reſpect of them to name the whole Miniſterie vnlearned or ignorant. For the ſimplicitie and charitie of Chriſtian iudgement, doth giue the name of any Societie, according to the better part, and not according to the vvorſe.</p>
               <p>There were in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> many euill perſons, aſwel in corruption of doctrine, as wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life: and yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> noteth that Church to bee a reuerend and holy congregation. The

Church of Chriſt militant heere in earth, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a great number of euill mixed vvith them that be good; &amp; oftentimes the worſe part the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: yet were it reprochfull and ſlaunderous to call the Church vvicked. In like ſort may it vvell bee thought vncharitable, to call the miniſterie of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ignorant, when that (thenkes be to God) there bee ſo many learued and ſufficient preachers in this lande, as neuer vvere before in any age or time, and the ſame adorned with Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good giftes, and comparable to any other Church refourmed in <hi>Europe.</hi> If men would caſt ſo curious and captious eyes vpon the Miniſters of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countreyes, and note the blemiſhes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in them, as they doe in our owne: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded (vnder correction) they would not thinke ſo meanely of the ſtate of the Miniſterie of <hi>England,</hi> as they doe. But this is the generall diſeaſe of vs Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen, to haue in admiration the perſons and ſtates of other foreine countreyes, and loath their owne, bee they neuer ſo commendable or good. I ſpeake not this, to note with reproch any refourmed Church in forreine countries, or to diminiſh the commendations of thoſe excellent giftes, which it hath pleaſed God plentifully to powre downe vpon them, as the firſt renuers and reſtorers of the Goſpel in this latter age, to whome, in that reſpect, we ovve great loue and reuerence: But yet they ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that they haue imperfections, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue churches in this world without blemiſhes. Notwithſtanding it is not free among them, no not for the beſt learned, or of greateſt authority, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſpeech or vvriting, to vtter thoſe things vvhich
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19124:62"/>
may tend to the generall reproche of their Church or common weale, as it is commonly vſed vvith vs at this day: Or if they doe, they are ſharpely dealt vvithall for the ſame. For, as vviſe gouernours, they ſee, that ſuch doings is the very ſeede of diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſcorde, and faction; the very peſtilence of all Churches, common vveales, and ſocieties. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in moſt Churches, they doe tollerate ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections ſetled by order, at the beginning, leaſt by change of lavves, there ſhoulde bee greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience.</p>

               <p>And yet, that men doe not conceiue euill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Biſhops, for that which cannot bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied: it behooueth the vviſe and godly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the ſtate of this Church is ſuch, as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie there muſt bee ſome of very meane abilitie, in compariſon of that perfect rule of a Miniſter that S. <hi>Paul</hi> requireth.</p>
               <p>It is wel knowen, as it is before recited, that there be a number of pariſhes in this Realme, the liuings vvhere of are ſo ſmall, that no man ſufficiently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, will content himſelfe vvith them. In ſome one
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19124:62"/>
meane ſhire there bee aboue foure ſcore Chappels to be ſerued, onely by Curates, with very ſmall ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. To place able men in them, is vnpoſſible: For neither ſufficient number of learned men can be had, nor, if there coulde, woulde they be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee to ſuch places appoynted. And to leaue thoſe pariſhes and places vnſerued of common prayer, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, were an inconuenience as great on the other part: For it bringeth men to an heatheniſh forgetfulneſſe of God. To eaſe this matter by combinations and ioyning of many pariſhes together (as ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe) beſides other inconueniences, the thing is not in the Biſhops authoritie, nor poſsible for him to doe, Euery pariſh hath a ſundrie patrone, which wil neuer bee brough to agree to that purpoſe, and to forgoe their patrimonie and heritage. Nowe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the matter, by making a law for that purpoſe, woulde be occaſion of ſo great troubles and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as would draw with them more inconnenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then would ſtand with the ſafe ſtate of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, as the wiſer ſort doe ſee, and were eaſie for me to declare, if it were pertinent to this matter here to lay them downe in writing. The only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that neceſſitie beareth, is, to tollerate ſome of the meaner ſort of Miniſters, hauing carefull conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſo much as diligence can doe, that the ſame may be of life &amp; behauiour, honeſt, and godly, and ſuch at the leaſt, as may bee able to inſtruct the pariſh in the Catechiſme. And ſurely, I hope, by the care of the Biſhops, that they haue alreadie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, this thing will be, either altogether, or in a good part brought to effect ere long time paſſe.</p>

                  <hi>Obiection.</hi>
But ſome will ſay, that all this is but a cloake of colourable reaſon to hide an vnexcuſable fault. For that no neceſsitie can excuſe a man, to breake the law of God: and Gods holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is vttered by Saint Paul, that among other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> a Miniſter ſhoulde bee <hi>Aptus ad docendum,</hi> that is, able to teach, and therefore no Biſhop can bee borne with, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an vnlearned Miniſter. For he may not doe euill that good may come thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
For anſwere hereunto, it cannot bee denyed, but the rule which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth, is an exact rule, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. Tit. 1.</note> and ſuch an abſolute deſcription of a Miniſter, as is according to Chriſtian perfection: and therefore that all Miniſters ought to bee correſpondent to the ſame: And ſo much as they want thereof, they lacke of their perfect ſtate. Yea, and eccleſiaſticall gouernours ſhoulde carefully ſee, ſo much as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailtie and the miſerable ſtate of this worlde will ſuffer, that al Miniſters of the Church of God be ſuch. And when they doe faile heerein, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and goe from that perfection that the worde of God requireth. But yet I doubt not, but God of his great mercie in Chriſt our Sauiour will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly conſider, that he hath to doe with fleſh and blood, and that euen his beſt children liue not here in an heauenly ſtate, but in a miſerable and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched world, and ſpecially when hee ſeeth, that they offend not of negligence or malicious wickedneſſe, but are carried with the neceſſitie of this earthly frailtie. For if GOD ſhoulde meaſure all things done in his Church by the perfect rule of his word, who ſhould be able to ſtand before him? We
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19124:63"/>
may not therefore, either condemne other, or eſteeme our ſelues condemned before God, if through the frailtie of the worlde, we be not able to frame all things in his Church to ſuch perfectneſſe, as his holy word appoynteth.</p>
               <p>As the deſcription of a Miniſter, deliuered by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> is perfect, ſo doth it containe many branches &amp; properties to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of (I thinke) twentie or aboue: As, that he muſt bee vnreproueable, the husband of one wife, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, temperat, modeſt, not froward, not angrie, one that loueth goodneſſe, righteous, holy, harberous, apt to teach, holding faſt the wholeſome worde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to doctrine, able to exhort with wholſome doctrine, and conuince them that ſay againſt it, not giuen to much wine, no ſtriker, not giuen to filthie lucre, gentle, no quarreller, not couetous, one that can rule his owne houſe, keeping his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in honeſt obedience, not a yong ſcholler leaſt hee be puffed vp with ſelfe liking, well reported of, graue, not double tongued, holding the myſterie of the faith in a pure conſcience.</p>
               <p>If they will admit no Miniſters as lawful, but ſuch as ſhall haue fully all theſe properties: Surely they will cut from Churches the greateſt part, or all the Miniſters that they haue. Euen that one propertie which they ſo greatly call vpon, as of all other moſt neceſſarie, that is, that hee ſhoulde be apt to teach: that is, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth himſelfe, to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently able to teach them that bee willing, and to conuince the aduerſarie: If it be preſſed to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie and rigour thereof, it comprehendeth ſo much, as it will exclude a great many of Miniſters
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19124:64"/>
and Preachers, which in their meaſure doe good ſeruice in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>The beſt writers that euer I did reade vpon that, ſay, That to the performance of the ſame, a man muſt haue readie knowledge in the Scriptures, the vnderſtanding of the tongues, the reading of the ancient Fathers, and hiſtories of antiquitie. If a great many of them woulde looke into their owne boſomes, and meaſure themſelues by this rule of ſufficiencie: they woulde not iudge ſo rigorouſly of other, nor be ſo raſh to condemne them.</p>
               <p>Wee ſee in the Scriptures, that God ſometime beareth with breach of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, falling by <note place="margin">Exod. 29.</note> the neceſſitie of our fraile life. God gaue in charge, as before is ſayde, that none ſhoulde eate of the Shew-bread, but the Prieſtes: And yet in neceſſitie <hi>Dauid</hi> did eate of it, though he were no Prieſt. <note place="margin">1.

               <p>Chriſt himſelfe may ſeeme to giue the reaſon for their defence, when he ſaith, <hi>The Sabboth was ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for man, and not man for the Sabboth.</hi>

and married her, if ſhe finde no fauour in his eyes, &amp;c. then let him make a bill of diuorcement, and put it in her hand, and ſend her out of his houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this mercifull bearing of God with the breach of his commandement, Chriſt ſhevveth the reaſon, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. ſaying in this wiſe. <hi>For the hardneſſe of your hearts God ſuffered you to put away your wiues, but from the beginning it was not ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere we learne that our gracious and mercifull God, for the ſhunning and auoyding of a greater miſchiefe among ſtubborne people, ſuffered his ſeruant <hi>Moſes</hi> to giue foorth a more fauourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of his iuſt and perfect Lavve, and to ſuffer diuorcements in ſuch caſes, as the right and rigor of his iuſtice in itſelfe, had forbidden.</p>
               <p>This haue I written, not of purpoſe to incourage men to breake and alter the Lawes and ordinances of God, but rather to comfort thoſe conſciences, whith in this caſe may bee troubled, and to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that opinion, wherewith ſome are led to thinke that that Congregation is not vvorthie the name of a Chriſtian Church, nor meete vvherein a good Chriſtian man ſhoulde abide as Miniſter, where all things are not reformed, to the perfect rule of Gods holy worde.</p>
               <p>Surely the auncient Fathers of the primitiue Church doe not ſeeme to be of that iudgement. For they did all find fault with many enormities in their time, as vvell in outvvarde ceremonies, as corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, yea, &amp; in ſome point of doctrine alſo: and yet it is not read that they did therefore ſeparate themſelues from the Churches, or thinke that they could not as faithfull Miniſters ſerue in them.

               <p>That you may the better conceiue, that an vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Miniſtery for want of preaching of the Goſpel, is not the cauſe of the backeſliding and reuolting of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19124:65"/>
ſo many in theſe dayes, nor of ſundry other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences imputed to the ſame: you ſhall eaſily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, if you will call to your remembrance, that when there were fewer Preachers and leſſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by great oddes, then oflate yeres hath bene, the people did not reuolt as now they doe. There is therefore ſome other cauſe, if we will with vpright mindes looke into it. There were fevver Preachers and leſſe teaching in the dayes of that King of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed memorie <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, and yet did not the people then reuolt, as novv, although the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Church was then but greenely ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. They had the ſame imperfection and want of Miniſters, which wee haue novv, and that in greater meaſure: in ſo much as they were faine to helpe out the want with reading of Homilies, as you knowe. Which deuiſe, although it be greatly miſliked and inueighed againſt in theſe dayes, as intollerable: yet did that reuerend and learned father <hi>M. Bucer</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend the ſame, and ſhewed his good liking thereof, willing moe Homilies to bee prepared for that purpoſe. And vvhat were they that were then Preachers, and in the ſtate of gouernment of the Church? Surely ſuch perſons as did diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue thoſe orders in outwarde thinges, vvhich the Biſhops now, for feare of further inconuenience, deſire and ſtudie to maintaine. In the firſt ten yeeres of her Maieſties moſt gracious reigne, there was little or no backſliding from the Goſpell, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that now is: yet was there not then ſo much preaching, by the halfe, nor ſo many Preachers in the Church of England by 1000. as now there are. And ſince that time (I ſpeake of good experience,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19124:66"/>
and better knowledge then gladly I would) that in diuers places where there hath beene often prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and that by learned &amp; graue men, there haue bene many that haue reuolted, and litle good effect declared among the reſidue. You will aske me then, what I thinke to be the true cauſe thereof? Surely, the cauſes are many: but I will note vnto you onely two or three, that bee of greateſt weight. Firſt, to <note place="margin">The firſt cauſe why the Goſpell proſpereth not ſo well here.</note> haue the fruites of the Goſpell ſetled in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, and declared in their liues: It is not ſufficient to haue often and much preaching, but alſo to haue diligent and reuerent hearing. Though the Preachers be neuer ſo learned and diſcreet, if it bee not heard as the worde of God, it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But in theſe dayes, as in all other, men be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induced to disburthen themſelues, and lay the whole fault vpon the Miniſters and Preachers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi>
Oh, ſay they, if wee had good and zealous Biſhoppes, and godly Preachers, ſuch as the Apoſtles were: vndoubtedly this doctrine of the Goſpell woulde haue had better ſucceſſe, and would more haue preuailed in mens hearts. For they are not zealous, nor ſeeme to bee mooued with the ſpirite of God: therefore it cannot be, that they ſhould moue other.</p>

                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
Though this reaſon ſeeme ſomewhat plauſible to ſome kind of men, and to be of great force to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the common people: yet I aduertiſe all them, that haue any ſparke of the feare of GOD in their hearts, that they take heede of it, &amp; beware, that, to their own great da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, they be not caried away with it. For it hath bene ſeldome or neuer heard or read, that the people of God among whom true doctrine hath bin preached (as the Lorde be thanked it hath
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19124:66"/>
bene with vs) did euer vſe ſuch allegations for their ovvne excuſe and defence. It hath beene alwayes the pretence of the reprobate and wicked, to colour their owne obſtinacie, and contempt of Gods word, vvhen they vvere offered the light of the Goſpell and called to repentaunce. But that theſe kinde of men may not flatter and deceiue themſelues: I let them vnderſtande, that the Scriptures in no place teach them, that the offences and faultes of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, are alwayes the onely cauſe, why the word of God doth not take place in mens hearts. It is more commonly, and almoſt alvvaies imputed to the <hi>way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, vnthankefulneſſe</hi> and <hi>obſtinacy</hi> of the people that heare it. Therefore it vvere good for alſortes of men, of what calling ſoeuer, to looke into their owne boſomes, &amp; carefully to conſider, whether the fault thereof be not in themſelues. For they knowe right vvell, that the maſter may bee learned and diligent, and yet the ſcholler not thriue, by reaſon of his owne dulneſſe. The Phyſition may bee honeſt and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the obſtinate Patient make light of his vvholeſome counſaile. The ſeede may be good, and the ſeede ſower a paineful and skilfull husbandman, and yet the fruite not to bee anſvverable to his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, becauſe of the naughtineſſe and barrenneſſe of the ground. This our Sauiour Chriſt teacheth vs in the parable of the Seede-ſovver. <hi>Matth. 13. The Sower</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>went foorth to ſowe his ſeede, and ſome fell in the high way,</hi> that is to ſay, into the heartes of them that vvere continually trampled vvith vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vngodly cogitations, ſo that the ſeede coulde not ſinke into their hearts, but by thoſe birds of the deuill, vvas caried avvay vvithout fruite.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19124:67"/>
                  <hi>Some fell into ſtonie ground,</hi> that is, into ſuch hearts as wanted the good iuice and moyſture of Gods holy ſpirite: and therefore when the heate of perſecution ariſeth, or ſome great temptation aſſaulteth them, their zeale is withered, and they reuolt from the trueth. <hi>Some fell into busſhie ground,</hi> that is, into the mindes of them, that were troubled with the cares of the worlde, with the loue of riches, and with the pleaſures of this life, which wholly choked vp the good ſeede of the Goſpell of Chriſt, ſo that it could not in any wiſe proſper and bring foorth fruite. Heere you may perceiue, that for one fourth part of good grounde, that yeeldeth fruite of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of God, there are three greater partes of euill ground, wherein it nothing at all proſpereth. But in theſe our dayes amongſt vs, we haue a fourth ſort of men, which obſtinatly at al refuſe to heare the word of God, and do ſhut vp their eares, not onely againſt preaching, but againſt priuate exhortation alſo. If there were leſſe ſtore of theſe euill groundes in this land at this day, vndoubtedly wee ſhould ſee more ſucceſſe of the Goſpell, and more ample fruite of our teaching then novve wee doe. It were good for men to looke that theſe quarrellings at other mens liues, bee not one of the <hi>coardes of vanitie</hi> that <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh of. <hi>Woe be to them</hi> (ſaith God by his holy <note place="margin">Eſay. 5.</note> Prophet) <hi>that drawe on iniquitie with coardes of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and ſinne, as it were with a Cart-rope,</hi> that is, Woe bee to them, that imagine excuſes and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, to nouzell and mainetaine them ſelues in contempt of Gods vvorde, and vvant of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce. Let men take heede of ſuch dealing, that ſuch <hi>Coardes of vanitie</hi> pull not on iniquitie ſo faſt,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19124:67"/>
that it draw them to the vtter contempt of God and his trueth. Example where of is ſeene at this day, in too many, to the griefe of all good mens hearts: For the ſchoole of <hi>Epicure,</hi> and the Atheiſts, is mightily increaſed in theſe days. The like effect <hi>Eſay</hi> noteth to haue fallen out among the Iewes, at that time. For this he maketh them to ſay in deriſion of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Prophets, <hi>Let God make ſpeede, and hasten his worke, that wee may ſee it. Let the counſell of the holy one of Iſrael drawe neere, and come, that wee may knowe it.</hi> And in like manner dealeth the wicked in <hi>Ieremie</hi> Chapter 5. <hi>They haue denied the Lorde, and ſayde, It is not hee. Tuſh, the Sword, and the plague ſhall not come vpon vs, neither ſhall we ſee it. The threatnings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are but wind, &amp; the true word of God is not in them. They vtter their owne fantaſies, and theſe things ſhall come vnto themſelues.</hi> Euen with like contempt and deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, many at this day abuſe the Preachers of Gods worde. <hi>When we lay before them the terrible threatnings of Gods wrath and indignation, if they reuolt from the trueth of the Goſpell, or ſuffer the ſame to bee betrayed into the hands of the enemie, ſaying, that God wil for ſake them: that he wil take his defence from them: that he will ſet his face against them: that he will bring ſtrangers vpon them to destroy their countrey and poſſeſse their great landes and goodly buildings:</hi> Oh, ſay they, Theſe Preachers make great outcries: they put ſtrange expectations into the peoples heads: they are vndiſcreete: they medle with matters, which doe not appertaine vnto them, if matters goe amiſſe, the greateſt fault is in them: ſelues.

Moreouer, many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, both vndiſcreete and vnlearned, becauſe they will not bee accompted <hi>Dumbe dogs,</hi> haue taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to preach without licenſe or triall: and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into diſcuſſing of matters nowe in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betweene vs and the aduerſarie, haue handled them ſo coldly, nakedly, and vnperfectly, that many haue beene grieued to heare them, &amp; ſome brought in doubt of their conſciences, which neuer doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before. Many ſtrange Aſſertions, either plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe, or as Paradoxes, true in ſome rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie ſenſe, haue beene by ſundry perſons, and ſome of them well learned, vttered and taught, to the troubling of many mens mindes, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as were not able to reach to the depth of them. As for example, that it is a grieuous offence to kneele at the receiuing of the Communion. A gentleman of good countenaunce hath affirmed to my ſelfe, that hee woulde rather hazard all the land hee had, then bee drawen to kneele at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. An heauie burthen to lay vpon a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for an externall geſture. The doctrine of <hi>the Lords Supper,</hi> hath bene ſo ſlenderly taught by ſome, that a number haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued with themſelues, that they receiue nothing but the externall elements, in remembrance that Chriſt died for them. And theſe their cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue they vttered to other to their great miſliking. Priuat baptiſm, yea, &amp; publike alſo, if it be miniſtred by one that is no preacher, hath bin ſo impugned, as if it were no ſacrament at all: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue bin raiſed by ſundry perſons, what is become of them that were neuer baptized other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: Or whether it were not neceſſary, that all ſuch
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19124:69"/>
perſons, as are certainly knovven, not to haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any other baptiſme, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that was priuatly done, ought not to bee baptiſed againe, becauſe the other is eſteemed as no Sacrament?</p>
               <p>The article of the common Creed touching Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes deſcenſion into hell, contrary to the ſenſe of all ancient writers, hath bin ſtrangely interpreted, and by ſome, with vnreuerent ſpeeches flatly reiected. Theſe and a number of ſuch other, haue vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bred great offence, and wounded the hearts of an infinite number, cauſing them partly to reuolt to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry, partly to Atheiſme, and neglecting of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as is ſeene by the liues of many, to the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding griefe of all them that feare God and loue his trueth. As I haue talked with many Recuſants, ſo did I neuer confer with any that would vſe any ſpeech, but that he hath alleadged ſome of theſe offences to bee cauſe of his reuolting. And ſome haue affirmed flatly vnto me, that in ſeeking to preſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come to our Church and ſeruice, we do againſt our owne conſciences, ſeeing our moſt zealous preachers (as they be taken) openly ſpeake and vvrite, that as well our ſeruice, as the adminiſtration of the ſacraments, are contrary to the word of God. I beſeech Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God of his great mercie, that he vvill open the eyes of them, vvhich thus eagerly haue ſtriuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preſent ſtate of this Church, to ſee vvhat hurt and hinderance hath come to the profeſſion of the Goſpell, by theſe vncharitable and neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe contentions. And vndoubtedly, if God moue not the heartes of the chiefe Rulers and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to ſeeke ſome ende of this Schiſme and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, vvhich nowe renteth in pieces this Church

of England: it cannot bee, but in ſhort time for one Recuſant that now is, wee ſhall haue three, if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of that number, which I mention, be not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For I doe heare and ſee thoſe things, that it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth my heart to conſider. What hurt and trouble Satan hath at all times raiſed in the Church of God by occaſion of diſſention and diſcorde, mooued not only by heretikes &amp; falſe teachers, but alſo by them, vvhich othervviſe haue bene good and godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories doe euidently declare.

of other like factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, vvhich grew in the ſame age, to the trouble and hinderance of true Chriſtianitie, as many godly and learned men did then complaine. And ſundry graue authours vvhich haue written in this our time, and before, iudge, that theſe wayward contentions in the Eaſt Church, vvere the chiefe cauſes that brought vpon them afterward, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie wrath of God that tooke his Goſpel from them, and caſt them into the tyrannie of <hi>Saracens</hi> &amp; <hi>Turkes,</hi> as we haue ſeene novv theſe many yeeres.

that without all pitie, they did moſt cruelly teare in pieces the flocke of Chriſt, ſo that if euer, nowe it is verified that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, From among your ſelues ſhall riſe men ſpeaking peruerſe things, that they may drawe Diſciples to followe them.</hi>

               <p>The third cauſe and the principall of all other is, <note place="margin">The third cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolting.</note> 
                  <hi>that the ramping &amp; roaring Lion that goeth about ſeeking whome he may deuoure,</hi> and watching all occaſions to doe miſchiefe in the Church of God, hath taken the opportunitie of this Schiſme &amp; diuiſion among our ſelues. And therefore euer ſince that began, he hath not ceaſed from time to time, out of his ſcholes and Nurceries, to ſende into this Realme fit inſtruments for that purpoſe, Ieſuites, Maſsing-prieſts, and Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie men, &amp; ſuch other of our owne nation, as haue bene purpoſely by them corrupted: which being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſome ſhew of learning, but ſpecially with readines of tongue &amp; boldneſſe of ſpeech, with ſome outward ſhew of holineſſe in words, haue mightily preuailed againſt the ſubiects of this Realme, taking co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly reaſons of perſwaſion, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diſcord that is among our ſelues, as by particular dealings with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue learned. The indeuours of theſe men haue taken the greater effect, by one perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they principally haue vſed: which is, that they haue put into their minds a certain expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a ſpeedy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration &amp; change to be, not only in religion, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the ſtate of the realme.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19124:71"/>
in this lande, to remaine in the fauour and liking of the Goſpell of Chriſt, which they blaſphemouſly call horrible ſchiſme and hereſie, which woulde bee reuenged to the vttermoſt. To worke this deuiſe, they were let to vnderſtand, what plots and meanes were made, howe eaſie, howe likely, how certaine to come to paſſe within few yeeres, yea, moneths, yea, dayes. For they confirmed the hearts of all them that bende to their perſwaſion, with all hope that might be: In ſo much that I knowe ſome, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe two yeeres were very forwarde in religion, and not onely heard Sermons diligently, but alſo were at ſundrie conferences, for their better confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: yet within fewe Moneths, with the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſwaſion of this expectation, were cleane caried away, and ſo remaine peruerſe and obſtinate Recuſants, with the example thereof ſhaking the conſciences of many other. In theſe their wicked and deuiliſh practiſes againſt God and his trueth, and againſt the ſtate of this lande, they were not a little imboldened by ſlacke and remiſſe dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them. The lawes were not executed: the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage was giuen to ſome, that did fauourably compound with them.</p>
               <p>Hereby I knowe by good experience, that much harme hath bene done in diuers places. They haue alſo comforted and imboldened themſelues in this, that mercie and fauour ſhoulde bee ſhewed them. For this they can ſay, that Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates, eſpecially ſuch as be Proteſtants, by their owne doctrine, ſhoulde ſhewe mercie and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, chiefly in matters of conſcience. But what a malicious hypocriſie is this, to call vpon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19124:71"/>
Magiſtrates for mercie and fauour, and they themſelues in the meane time, breath nothing but crueltie and blood in their hearts?

Faith (ſay they) is the gift of God, it cannot be forced by any puniſhment: by hardneſſe and extreme dealing men may be made hypocrites, but not religious: yea, they adde further, that the Apoſtles vſed no ſuch helpe of Princes power to bring men to the faith, or to pull them away from errour.</p>

Such offences wil they commit, but yet ſuch puniſhments will they not ſuffer. For vnderſtand you what they doe, and what they ſuffer?

For firſt mine owne Citie of</hi> Hippo <hi>was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected againſt mee, which was wholly carried away with the opinion of the Donatiſtes, and yet through
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19124:72"/>
feare of the Emperours lawes was turned to the Catholike vnitie. Which Citie, we now ſee ſo to deteſt that pernitious errour, as if it had neuer bene among them. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diuers other cities, were namely rehearſed vnto mee, ſo that by experience I learned, that my former iudgement was not right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Chriſtian Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his Lieutenant <hi>Taurus, It hath pleaſed mee</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>that in all the places and Cities, all the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the idoles ſhould preſently be ſhut vp, and all wicked perſons forbidden to haue acceſſe vnto them.

               </p>
               <p>But I wil make no longer diſcourſe herein. Such as doe doubt hereof, and deſire to be better ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I referre them to a Treatiſe which Maiſter <hi>Beza</hi> hath writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that matter. I haue taried the longer in this part, for that I am deſirous to let the indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t chriſtian reader vnderſtand, that it is but an aſſectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſome, when they impute the only cauſe to be in biſhops, why there is in theſe dayes ſo great back ſliding from the Goſpell, &amp; ſo great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe deuiſed againſt the Prince &amp; the State. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth their mindes are blinded with affection, that they cannot ſee the trueth.</p>
               <p>AN other crime layde againſt Biſhoppes, is, <note place="margin">The quarel of maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Courts.</note> that they maintaine pilling and pouling, and (as ſome in deſpite terme them) bawdy courts. If they maintayne courtes for the adminiſtration of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19124:73"/>
Iuſtice, in ſuch thinges as are vvithin their charge: they doe, as I am perſvvaded by Gods law they may doe, and as by the lawes of this Realme, and ſtate of this Church they ought to doe. But if they mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pouling in their Courtes, that (in deede) is vvorthy blame, and by no pretence can bee ſalued. For, as all Magiſtrates ought to deale vprightly, and vvithout corruption: ſo principally, ſuch as be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and of the Church of God. But hovv is it prooued, that Biſhops maintaine pouling Courtes? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I knovve not: For they doe not lay it dovvne in particulars. If they did, I thinke the matter might eaſily be anſwered vvith good reaſon.</p>
               <p>It may bee they thinke, the vnder-Officers take money and bribes, where they ſhould not: For that is polling and extortion. If it bee ſo, it is euill, and not to be ſuffered, and vpon proofe, the Lavve ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynteth ſharpe puniſhment. Though it bee true that they ſurmiſe in this caſe, that Officers are ſo corrupt: it is one thing to ſay, The Officers vſe pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and another to ſay, The biſhop maintaineth a pouling Court.</p>
               <p>A biſhop may haue an euill Officer, vvhome yet he vvill not maintaine, no nor ſuffer, if he knevve it, and be able to redreſſe it. I am in perſvvaſion, there is no biſhop in this Realme, but if it be complayned of, and proofe made vnto him, that his officers take more then is preſcribed by order and lavv that they may doe, but wil miſlike with the thing, and doe his beſt to ſee it redreſſed: Or if hee will not, I fauour not their State ſo much, but that I could vviſh him to be puniſhed himſelfe. But if a Biſhops Officers ſhall be counted to poule, when they take no more
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19124:73"/>
then the ordinary fees and duties by Lawe allowed, &amp; the biſhop when he beareth with the ſame, ſhall bee called a maintainer of a poulling Court: this is a matter in a ſlaunderer to be puniſhed, and not a fault in a biſhop to bee blamed. By this meanes all the Courtes in Englande may bee defamed, and called poulling Courtes, and the Officers or Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, vnder whoſe authoritie they ſtande, may bee reprooued as mainteners of poulling Courtes. Bee it, that there is vnlawfull taking in many Courtes of this Realme, as happily there is in ſome by greedie Officers: were it therefore the duetie of chriſtian &amp; godly ſubiects, to ſpread libels againſt the Prince or chiefe gouernors, as mainteners of corruption, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie, and pouling?</p>
               <p>An hard matter it is, in ſo corrupt times, for anie magiſtrate, to warrant the doinges of all inferiour officers: I pray God this making of exception to Courtes and officers, goe no further then to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of biſhops and of the Cleargie. Whatſoeuer they pretend, the very root of the matter is this: The whole ſtate Eccleſiaſticall, by the looſeneſſe of this time, is growen into hatred &amp; contempt, &amp; all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſubiectes diſdaine in any poynt to be ruled by them. And therfore when they be called, conue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted and puniſhed for ſuch things, wherin they haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, or be brideled of that they would do diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly: they grudge at it, their ſtomackes riſe againſt it, and thinke al that is done to be vnlawfull, though it be neuer ſo iuſt. And becauſe they are not able o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to be reuenged, they crie out, that they be cruel and poulling Courts.</p>

To cut off the whole matter, it wil be ſaid, that by the word of God it is not lawfull for biſhops to haue ſuch Courtes, nor to exerciſe ſuch iuriſdiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
Yet truly I muſt anſwere, that it is lawful for chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſubiects to obey it, and vnlawfull for them to kicke and ſpurne againſt it, ſeeing it ſtandeth by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Lawes, and of our Chriſtian and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious prince, by whom God hath ſent to vs, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth continue with vs, the free courſe of his Goſpell. But why may not a biſhop exerciſe iuriſdiction, &amp; haue a Court to iudge, determine, and ende mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Surely, Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth to <hi>Timothie, Againſt</hi>

               <p>They will ſay, It was not Timothies Court onely, but ioyntly exerciſed with the reſidue of the Elders, that had the gouernement.</p>
               <p>Vndoubtedly, there is no ſuch thing there in that place. The words are directed to <hi>Timothie</hi> only: the adioyning of ſome other, is but the interpretation of ſome fewe: vpon which, to build the neceſsity of a doctrine in the Church of Chriſt, is but hard dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and not ſufficient to ground mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon. And yet here note you, that by this place it is euident, that eccleſiaſticall perſons may haue, and vſe iuriſdiction.</p>

If he ſhal heare thee, thou haſt wonne thy brother: but if he wil not heare thee, take yet with thee one or two: if he wil not heare then,</hi> Dic Eccleſiae, <hi>Tell it to the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here (ſay they) we are willed to tel the Church: but the Church cannot be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be one perſon, as the biſhop or ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Firſt I anſwere, that by the conſent of moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, that place ſpeaketh not of the exerciſe of publike iuriſdiction, but of a charitable proceeding in priuate offences.

If ſome do interpret the place otherwiſe (as I haue before ſaid) Chriſtians ſhoulde not build thereupon a generall doctrine of neceſsitie.</p>
               <p>It will be asked what Chriſt meant when he ſaid, <hi>Dic Eccleſiae.</hi> As ſome interprete it, he meant, <hi>Tell the Gouernours of the Church.</hi> After ſome other, <hi>Tell it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in the Church or congregation,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Vt qui non potuit pudore ſaluari, ſaluetur opprobriis,</hi> that is, <hi>that hee which could not be ſaued by ſhame, might haue his ſaluation wrought by reproch.</hi> For a great thing it is to one that hath any feare of God, to haue reproch in the face of the Church.</p>
               <p>And to this interpretation, the moſt of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers agree.</p>

I grant it was ſo: But it doth not follow thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is a commaundement, that for euer in all places and times, it ſhould be ſo.

That is not yet proued: but let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtruggle while they luſt, theyſh al neuer find a commandement in the ſcriptures, charging that it ſhuld for euer be ſo. It were to great a bridle of chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liberty in things external, to caſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church of Chriſt. So lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as the church of God was in perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder tyrants,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19124:75"/>
might well ſeeme to be the beſt and fitteſt order of Gouernment: But when God bleſſed his Churche with Chriſtian Princes, the Scriptures doe not take away that libertie, that with the conſent of their godlie magiſtrates they may haue that outwarde forme of iuriſdiction, &amp; deciding of Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, as to the ſtate of the Countrey and people ſhall be moſt conuenient. And that libertie haue diuers reformed churches, ſince the reſtoring of the Goſpell, vſed.</p>
               <p>Now, as when other churches in their externall order of gouernment, differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ours, we neither do, nor ought, to miſlike with them: ſo if ours differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theirs, retaining ſtill the ſinceritie of the goſpel and trueth of doctrine, I truſt they will euen as charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thinke of vs.</p>
               <p>If any deſire further aunſwere in this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of church gouernment, I refer them to the reply of D. <hi>Bridges,</hi> vntill they haue with modeſtie and grauitie anſwered his booke.</p>
               <p>It is obiected alſo againſt Biſhops, that they abuſe <note place="margin">The crime of abuſing Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Diſcipline.</note> Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline. I take Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline to conſiſt in reprouing, correcting and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating ſuch as be offendors in the Church. And I thinke their meaning is here, that biſhops &amp; their officers abuſe <hi>Excommunication,</hi> in puniſhing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thoſe perſons, which obſtinately &amp; with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt refuſe, either to appeare, when they bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to aunſwere their offences: or when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, diſobey thoſe orders and decrees by Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall officers appoynted. Howe this part of Church Diſcipline was abuſed by the Pope, it is well knowen: and that hee made <hi>Excommunication</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:19124:76"/>
an inſtrument to bring the neckes of Emperors and Princes, ynder his girdle, and to make the whole world ſubiect to him. For this was almoſt the onely meane, whereby he became ſo dreadfull to all men, and got to himſelf ſo great autoritie. The perpetual courſe of the hiſtories, euen ſuch as were written by his owne Paraſites, and chiefly of this Realme of <hi>England,</hi> declare this to be moſt true. For triall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, reade the hiſtorie of <hi>Thomas Becket.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I thinke no man is ſo caried with the miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our Biſhops, that he wil accuſe them, in this ſort to abuſe <hi>Excommunication:</hi> ſeeing by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching they haue binprincipall inſtruments to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ſame in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They cannot ſay, that any Biſhop of this church, euer ſince the reſtoring of the Goſpell, indeuoured to excommunicate the Prince and gouernours, of purpoſe to make them ſubiect to their authoritie in the Church. And happily that may bee a fault, yea and a great fault that is founde with them in theſe daies, that they do not ſo, and conſtraine the prince and Rulers to doe that, which by perſwaſion they will not doe.</p>
               <p>But howe expedient this maner of <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is for this time, I leaue to the wiſe and godly to conſider. Sure I am, that ſome of the moſt zealous churches reformed haue it not, nor thinke it tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And yet ſuch a maner of <hi>Excommunication</hi> it is, <note place="margin">Tygure.</note> that many ſtriue at this day to haue brought into the Church, vnder the name of <hi>Diſcipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how eaſily it would grow to abuſe, and what danger it might bring in this ſtate of time, I thinke there is no wiſe man that doth not foreſee: vnleſſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19124:76"/>
it be ſuch, as to bring their purpoſe to paſſe, and to ſettle their deuiſe in the Church, thinke no danger to be ſhunned.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Excommunication</hi> practiſed in our Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Courtes, for contumacie in not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or not ſatisfying the iudgement of the Court: if it had pleaſed the Prince, and them that had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie to make Lawes for the gouernment, to haue altered the ſame at the beginning, and ſet ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order of proceſſe in place thereof: I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Biſhops and Clergy of this Realme woulde haue bin very wel contented therewith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gualter</hi> a learned man of the Church of <hi>Tygure,</hi> writing vpon the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> hauing ſhewed the danger of this other <hi>Excommunication,</hi> ſpeaketh of a maner of ciuile diſcommuning, vſed in that Church: Which, or the like good order, deuiſed by ſome godlie perſons, if it might bee by authoritie placed in this Churche, without danger of further innouation, I thinke it woulde be gladly reciued to ſhunne the offence that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at the other, and yet ſurely, vnder correction, the Law of alteration woulde breede ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience.</p>
               <p>But the perpetuall crying of many to haue a mutation of the whole ſtate of the Clergie, and a number of other thinges in the Church beſide, (which muſt needes draw with it a great alteration in the ſtate of the Realme alſo) maketh the Prince, and other Gouernours to bee afraide of any mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For they knowe what daunger may come in theſe perillous dayes by innouations: And if they ſhoulde once beginne, things are ſo infinite,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19124:77"/>
ſhat they can ſee no ende of alterations. Therefore eeing wee haue a Church ſetled in a tollerable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reformation, and all trueth of doctrine freely taught and allowed by the authority of this realme, yea, and the aduerſaries of trueth by lawe repreſſed: they thinke it better to beare with ſome imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then by attempting great alterations, in ſo dangerous a time, to hazard the ſtate both of the Church and of the Realme. And the like toleration in ſome meane things, I vnderſtand, vpon like conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hath bin vſed in other churches reformed beyond the Seas.</p>

For my part, ſurely, I do reuerence and maruell at the ſingular gifts of God that I ſee in many. But theſe things bee wincked at, and paſſed with ſilence, and the ambitious doings of ſome few, brought in, as matter to diſcredite the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Preachers.</p>

               <p>Ambition, I knowe and confeſſe, is very wicked, &amp; hath euer beene a perillous inſtrument of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil to make miſchief. By this he drew our firſt pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to the diſobedience of the commandement of God, perſwading them not to be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with that happy ſtate that God had placed them in. By this he incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> with other, to rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> By this he thought to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſt, when hee ſawe he could not preuaile
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19124:78"/>
by other meanes. By this he hath always rayſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, diſſention, rebellion, warre and tumult, not onely to the troubling and diſquieting, but to the ſhaking and ouerthrowing almoſt of all common weales that euer haue beene, and thereby alſo hath wrought the murther and deſtruction of an infinite number of the creatures of God. By this he hath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time raiſed many ſchiſmes &amp; hereſies in the Church of Chriſt. By this, vndoubtedly I thinke he worketh no ſmall euill nowe at this day, in this our Church of England. But what then? Doe they thinke, that if the biſhoppes landes, and the rich li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings of the Cleargie be taken away, that they ſhall extinguiſh <hi>Ambition</hi> in the heartes of the miniſters? Was there no <hi>Ambition</hi> in the Church before that biſhops had lands, or before preachers had ſo large liuings? No man can ſo thinke, but they that are ignorant of the eccleſiaſticall hiſtories. What was the firſt root of the troubleſome ſchiſme of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts?</hi> Whereof ſprang firſt the hereſies of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatians</hi> at <hi>Rome?</hi> What gaue the firſt occaſion of the <note place="margin">Optat.

But what ſhoulde I number vp any more examples? Fewe ſchiſmes and hereſies in the Church, but had their beginning out of this roote. And many knowe, that a repulſe of a dignitie deſired, was the firſt cauſe that our ſchiſme brake forth, &amp; hath ſo eagerly continued. Surely, though I confeſſe, that I ſee and knowe in our church more corruption that way, then I am gladde to beholde, and ſo much eſpecially in ſome kinde of Miniſters, as I praie GOD by ſome ſharpe order may bee
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19124:78"/>
diminiſhed: yet this I dare ſtande to iuſtifie, that all the enemies of the biſhoppes, and better ſorte of the cleargie, ſhall neuer be able to proue, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the daunger of this corrupt time, that there is at this day in this Realme, ſuch heauing and ſhoouing, ſuch canuaſing and working for biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rikes and other Eccleſiaſticall liuings, as I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto them to haue beene in the ancient time aboue a thouſand yeeres ſince, in the beſt ſtate that euer was in the church, from the Apoſtles age vnto this time. That there is no <hi>Ambition</hi> vſed among vs, (as I haue ſaide) I dare not affirme: but ſurely, if there bee any, there can be no <hi>Ambition</hi> on the one part, but there muſt bee corruption on the other: therfore let them looke vnto themſelues, that haue authoritie to beſtow the liuings. The beſt ſorte of the eccleſiaſtical liuings are in the diſpoſition of the princes authoritie. And thoſe honorable that haue to doe therein, and are counſailers to her Maieſtie, be not ſo vnwiſe, but they can eſpy <hi>Ambition</hi> in him that ſueth and laboureth for them. And if they do perceiue it, they are very greatly to blame, if they ſuffer it to eſcape without open ſhame, or other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table puniſhment, and thereby bring ſuſpition, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon themſelues, or vpon thoſe that be about them.</p>
               <p>As for the corruption in beſtowing other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner liuings, the chiefe fault thereof is in patrones themſelues. For it is the vſuall manner of the moſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (I ſpeake of too good experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) though they may haue good ſtore of able me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, yet if an ambitious or greedie miniſter come not vnto them, to ſue for the benefice, if there bee
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19124:79"/>
an vnſufficient man, or a corrupt perſon within two ſhires of them, whom they thinke they can draw to any compoſition for their owne benefit, they wil by one meanes or other finde him out. And if the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſhall make curteſie to admitte him, ſome ſuch ſhift ſhall be found by the lawe, either by <hi>Quare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit,</hi> or otherwiſe; that whether the biſhop will or no, he ſhalbe ſhifted into the benefice. I know ſome biſhops, vnto whom ſuch ſutes againſt the patrones haue bene more chargeable in one yeere, then they haue gained by all the benefices that they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſince they were biſhoppes, or I thinke will doe, while they bee biſhoppes. They haue iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie therefore, to bee ſo openly ſlaundered in the face of the worlde. If there bee any biſhoppe that corruptly beſtoweth his liuinges by ſute of Maiſter Chauncellor, or Maiſter Steward, or any other: looke what puniſhment I woulde haue any lay-man in that caſe to ſuſtaine, I woulde wiſh to a biſhoppe double or triple.</p>

               <p>As touching this preſent point of the accuſation of Biſhops, I haue to admoniſh the godlie Reader, that in Chriſtian charitie and wiſedome they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, aſwell, what diuers of thoſe perſons which now bee Biſhoppes, haue beene before time: as alſo, in what ſtate they are nowe in this Realme, and howe they are beſet on euery ſide with aduerſaries and euill ſpeakers of diuers ſortes, and then to weigh with themſelues, whether it bee likely that all is true, which is vttered againſt them, or rather that for deſpite and diſpleaſure, many things are ſpoken falſly and ſlanderouſly, and manie other meane and ſmall blemiſhes amplified and exaggerated to the worſt, more then trueth.</p>
               <p>That thoſe which now bee, or of late haue beene Biſhops in this Church, ſhoulde be ſo carnally and groſly giuen ouer to the world and the cares therof,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19124:80"/>
as they are by ſome defamed: my heart abhorreth to thinke, neither will the feare of God ſuffer me to iudge it to be true. I ſee what they are preſently in all truth of doctrine: I ſee how earneſtly and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly they teach and defend the ſame in their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings: I ſee howe carefully they beate downe the groſſe ſuperſtition of Antichriſt and his miniſters: I call to remembraunce, that of late yeeres, in the time of perſecution, when the moſt of them were in ſtate wel able to liue, that they were contented for the freedome of their conſciences, and that they might enioy the doctrine and liberty of the Goſpel, to forſake their liuinges, to leaue their friendes, to hazard their liues, to be accompted Traitours, and to ſuſtaine all thoſe miſeries &amp; troubles, that might followe vpon baniſhment, and caſting out of their Countrey.</p>
               <p>And I ſee nothing in them, if God, as wee by our vnthankfulneſſe daily deſerue, ſhould caſt the like ſcourge vpon this Realme againe, but that they would be moſt readie to do the ſame, although hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily proſperitie in the meane time may drawe them to ſome offences. May any chriſtian heart then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of them, although there be faults in them moe then the worthineſſe of their office requireth, that they be ſo carnally &amp; fleſhly giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer to the world, as the immodeſt accuſations of many their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do make them? Mans nature is corrupt &amp; fraile, and therfore may fal to much euil: but that ſo many learned men trained in the ſchoole of the Croſſe, &amp; continuing in teaching &amp; preaching of the trueth, ſhould bee ſo vtterly caried away from God, I can not beleeue, &amp; I truſt, God ſhall giue ſome enident
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19124:81"/>
token of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. If there now be, or before time haue bene ſuch, as haue giuen iuſt occaſion in ſuch things, as they are accuſed of: I cannot but blame them, and wiſhe to the reſidue more feare of God, and care of their calling. I neuer entred into other mens hearts to ſee their conſciences: I neuer looked into their Cofers to ſee their treaſures: I neuer was deſirous to be priuie of their ſecrete doinges. I muſt therfore by that I ſee, heare, &amp; know, iudge the beſt.</p>
               <p>Hee that ſhall charitably conſider the ſtate of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as they are by the authoritie of the Prince and lawes of this Realme, will not thinke it impiety in them, againſt the time of neceſſary ſeruice of their countrey, to haue ſome reaſonable ſumme of money before hande, gathered in honeſtie, and iuſt vſing of their owne. But if they hoarde vp heapes, either for greedineſſe and loue of riches, or of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to put their truſt in them in time of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they are reported: ſurely their offence cannot be excuſed.</p>
               <p>As touching their purchaſing of lands, I haue not heard much. The greateſt value that euer I heard of, doth ſcant amount to one hundred pound: &amp; that in very few, ſcarce to the number of 3. perſons. Which in them, that ſo long time haue enioyed ſo large be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of liuing, may ſeeme no great matter, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward the relieuing of their wiues and children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi>
They will ſay perhaps, that Preachers ſhoulde not bee ſo carefull for their children, nor Biſhoppes ought not to make their wiues Ladies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
If any looke to leaue them like Ladies in wealth
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19124:81"/>
and riches, they are to blame: but moderatly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for their wiues &amp; children, I thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bound in conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, eſpecialy in this vncharitable, vnkind, &amp; vnthankful world. For we may ſee the wiues and children of diuers honeſt and godly preachers, yea, &amp; of ſome biſhops alſo, that haue giuen their blood for the confirmation of the goſpell, hardly to ſcape the ſtate of begging, euen amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs that profeſſe the goſpell, to our great and horrible ſhame. The ſight wherof, I thinke, doth moue ſome biſhops, &amp; other Eccleſiaſticall perſons, to bee the more carefull for their wiues &amp; childre, that they may haue ſome ſtay after their time, and not to be turned to liue vpon Almes, where charitie and chriſtian conſideration is ſo clean baniſhed. Eccleſiaſtical perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are not as other pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are For ſo ſoon as they depart this life, or otherwiſe be put from their liuing, becauſe they haue no ſtate but for life, their wiues and children without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration are turned out of the doores. And if in their husbandes time they haue not ſome place prouided, they hardly can tel how to ſhift for themſelues. And ſurely experience teacheth me ſo much, that I muſt needs bewaile and lament the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull caſe of diuers honeſt matrons, and poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, which in my knowledge, at the death of their husbands and fathers, haue beene driuen to great hazard &amp; diſtreſſe. And this cauſeth, that moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt women, of ſober and good behauior, are loath to match with miniſters, though they bee neuer ſo well learned, becauſe they ſee their wiues ſo hardlie beſted, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are dead. They that are not moued with this, haue but cold zeale toward the goſpell.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing the caſe is ſo among vs in this realme:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19124:82"/>
as he is worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an heathen by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that in his life time doth not prouide for his family: ſo ſurely hee cannot eſcape the blame of an vnkind husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or vnnatural pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that hath not ſome care of his wife and children, after his time.</p>
               <p>I write not this to defend the peruerſe or coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous affection of any, neither do I thinke that there be many ſuch in this church. Diuers I knowe, that when God ſhall call them, will leaue ſo litle, as their children, as I think, muſt comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d themſelues only to the prouidence of God. And therefore it is not well, that the fault of a fewe (if any ſuch be) ſhould bee taken as a matter, to diſcredite the whole cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>But ſurely, they that murmure ſo greatly againſt the moderat prouiſion of the wiues and children of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and turne that as matter of hainous ſlaunder vnto them: let them pretend what they wil, it may be ſuſpected, they ſcantly think wel of their marriages: Or if they doe, the very Papiſtes themſelues are more fauourable and charitable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries to preachers, then they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For ſeeing the ſtate of our Church alloweth miniſters to be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they thinke it to ſtand with godly reaſon alſo, that they ſhould in honeſty prouide for their wiues and children.</p>
               <p>Diuers perſons of other calling, by the exerciſe of an office onely in fewe yeeres, can purchaſe for wife and children many hundreds, and all very well thought of: but if a biſhop, that by ſtate of the lawe hath the right vſe of a large liuing many yeeres, doe purchaſe one hundred markes, or procure a meane Leaſe for the helpe of his wife and children, it is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19124:82"/>
accompted greedie couetouſneſſe, and miſtruſt in the prouidence of God. I woulde it were not ſpite and enuie, with greedie deſire of biſhops liuings, that cauſed this euill ſpeech, rather then their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous and corrupt dealing. They feare that all will be taken from themſelues.</p>
               <p>As touching that biſhops are blamed for taking of <note place="margin">Of taking of Fines, &amp;c.</note> vnreaſonable Fines, and furniſhing of their Cupboardes with ſiluer veſſel and plate, I truſt euery charitable man, that hateth not the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtate, may eaſily ſee what is to be anſwered. To take Fines for their leaſes &amp; lands, is as lawfull for them, by the word of God, &amp; by the law of this Realm, as for any other chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubiect, that hath poſſeſſions. And likewiſe, to haue plate or ſiluer veſſell, their condition beeing conſidered, is a thing indifferent, &amp; not worthy ſo great reproch or biting ſpeech as is vſed. If they had not ſuch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, it is likely a great number would thinke euil of it, and in an other ſort blame them as much for it. But if they take immoderate Fines, or let vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Leaſes, to the grieuing and burthening of their poore &amp; honeſt tenants: or if they pompouſly auaunce themſelues, &amp; ſet their glorie in the gorgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous plate and gay furniture: I am ſo farre from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending that abuſe, that I will be as ready to blame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as any man. And ſo much do I miſlike ſuch dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, as I would wiſh thoſe that can be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d faultie in theſe things, by the Princes and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to be examined and tryed, and vpon iuſt and lawfull proofe of their offences, to be puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their demerits: And, ify<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weight of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo required, to be depoſed, for the example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and better ſet in their places. But if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> trial were
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19124:83"/>
made, as ſome faults perchance might be found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy their calling: ſo I am in hope, they woulde not appeare ſo great &amp; ſo grieuous, as to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſcredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their doctrine, ſhould deſerue ſo heinous &amp; bitter exclamations, and ſo reprochful libels, as are giuen abroad againſt them. Faults, in all ſtates, and ſpecially of miniſters, woulde bee examined, tried, iudged &amp; puniſhed, by the law and ordinarie magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: and not an vnchriſtian looſeneſſe and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie left to vnquiet &amp; vngodly ſubiectes, either by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſpeeches, or vncharitable writings to ſlaunder them, &amp; bring them into hatred and miſliking. The example whereof may grow to great daunger, and hath bene counted perillous in al common weales, and much more in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>But, I pray you, what is meant by this diſgracing of biſhops, &amp; other chiefe miniſters of the Church? For what purpoſe are their liues in ſuch ſort blaſed? to what ende are their doings ſo defamed? Why is their corruption, their couetouſneſſe, their Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, their extortion, and al other vices, true or falſe, laide abroad before mens eies? Why is the perfect rule of their office &amp; calling, according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of the Apoſtles time, required at their hands onely? Is God the God of eccleſiaſtical miniſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? Is he not the God of his people alſo? doth he require his word to be exactly obſerued of biſhops and miniſters alone? doth he hate vice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in them alone? Or doth he lay downe the rule of perfect iuſtice to them onely, and not comprehend in the ſame all other ſtates of his people, as well as them? Yes truely, I thinke no Chriſtian is otherwiſe perſwaded.</p>
               <p>

Perhaps they will ſay, that all other States do wel, and liue according to their calling. The worde of God is ſincerely euery vvhere imbraced: Iuſtice is vprightly in all places mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred: the poore are helped and relieued: vice is ſharpely of all other men corrected: there is no corruption, no coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, no extortion, no Simonie, no vſurie, but in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and in the Cleargie. There are no Monopolies in this Realme practiſed to the gaine of a fewe, and the vndoing of great multitudes, that were wont to liue by thoſe trades. All courtes be without fault, and voyde of corruption, ſauing the Eccleſiaſticall courtes onely. All officers are vpright and true dealers ſauing theirs. None other doe ſo carefully and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly prouide for their wines and children. They onely giue the example of all euill life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
I would to God it were ſo: I would to God there were no ſuch euils as are recited, but in them: Yea, I woulde to God there were no woorſe then in them, on condition that neuer a Biſhop in Englande had one groate to liue vpon. The want ſurely of the one would eaſily be recompenſed with the goodneſſe of the other.</p>
               <p>What then is the cauſe that Biſhops and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers haue in theſe dayes ſo great fault founde with them? Forſooth it followeth in the next branch of a certaine Accuſation penned againſt them.</p>

This is the end, why biſhops and other chiefe of the Clergie are ſo defaced, why their doings are ſo depraued, why ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon obloquie is in all mens mouthes vpon them rayſed, that is to ſay, that the mindes of the Prince &amp; Gouernours, may thereby be induced to take away the lands and liuings from them, and to part the ſame among themſelues, to the benefite (as ſome thinke) and to the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of their countrey and common weale. But it behooueth all Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates to take heede, that they bee not intrapped with this ſophiſtrie of Satans ſchoole. This is that Rhetorike that he vſeth, when he wil worke any miſchief in the Church of God, or ſtirre vp any trouble or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſtate in a common weale.</p>
               <p>Firſt by defaming and ſlandering, hee bringeth the parties in hatred and miſliking, and when the peoples heads be filled therewith, then ſtirreth he vp buſie and vnquiet perſons to reaſon thus:</p>

Therfore bring them to an accompt: let them anſwere their faults: pul them downe: alter their ſtate &amp; condition: let vs no more be ruled vnder ſuch tyrants and oppreſſours: we are Gods people, as well as they. <hi>Did not he deale thus in</hi>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19124:84"/>
of the Lord, &amp; behaued themſelues too Lordly ouer his people? that they brought the Iſraelites out of a lande flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with milke and honie, of purpoſe to worke vnto them-ſelues a dominion ouer the people, and to make them to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the wilderneſſe?</hi> By this meanes they ſo incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the hearts, not onely of the common people, but of the Noblemen alſo, that they led a great number with them to rebell againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and to ſet themſelues in their roomes and offices. In like maner, and by like policie, hath hee wrought in all common weales, in all ages and times, as the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doe ſufficiently declare.</p>
               <p>In this Realme of England, when the lewde and rebellious ſubiects roſe againſt <hi>K.

               <p>At the beginning (ſay they) when God had firſt made the worlde, all men were alike, there was no principalitie, there was nor bondage, or villenage: that grewe afterwardes by violence and crueltie.

He that is authour of all perillous alterations, and ſeeketh to worke miſchief by them, will not attempt all at once, but will practiſe by little and little, and make euery former feate that hee worketh, to bee a way and meane to draw on the reſidue. For he ſeeth all men will not be ouercome with all temptations, nor will not be made inſtruments of all euill purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, though happily by his colours and pretenſes he bee able to deceiue them in ſome. The practiſe hereof, wee haue ſeene in this Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to the great trouble and daunger thereof. At the beginning, ſome learned and godly Preachers, for priuate reſpectes in themſelues, made ſtrange to weare the <hi>Surpleſſe, Cap,</hi> or <hi>Tippet:</hi> but yet ſo, that they declared themſelues to thinke the thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and not to iudge euil of ſuch as did vſe them. Shortly after roſe vp other, defending that they were not thinges indifferent, but diſtayned with Antichriſtian idolatrie, and therefore not to bee ſuffered in the Church. Not long after came forth an other ſort, affirming that thoſe matters touching Apparell, were but trifles, and not worthie conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church, but that there were greater thinges farre of more weight and importance, and indeede touching faith and religion, and therefore
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19124:85"/>
meete to be altered in a Church rightly refourmed: As <hi>the booke of Common prayer, the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, the gouernment of the Church, the election of Miniſters,</hi> and a number of other like.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, now breake out another ſort, earneſtly affirming and teaching, that we haue no Church, no Biſhops, no Miniſters, no Sacraments: and therfore that all they that loue Ieſus Chriſt, ought vvith all ſpeede to ſeparate themſelues from our congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe our aſſemblies are prophane, vvicked, and Antichriſtian.</p>

I truſt you ſhall perceiue, that this doctrine is neither vttered by God, nor taught by Chriſt, nor writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his Apoſtles, nor witneſſed by ancient writers, nor vpholden by learned men of our time: but that it is rather a bolde and dangerous aſſertion, vttered by ſome man of very ſmall skill, countenanced with a fevv wreſted Scriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the true meaning of God the father, Chriſt his ſonne, and of his holy Apoſtles, and a little ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with vaine allegations of writers, either of no
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19124:86"/>
credite, or little making to the purpoſe. And ſurely, how great and earneſt zeale, how vehement &amp; loftie wordes ſo euer the vtterer of this aſſertion vſeth: it may be ſuſpected, that either he is not himſelf ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded in true religion, or if he be, that of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, negligence or ignorance, he was abuſed by ſome ſubtile and craftie Papiſt, that woulde ſet him forth to the deriſion of other, to thruſt out into the world, and openly broach this corrupt and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous doctrine.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it were good, that they which wil take vpon them to be the furtherers of ſuch new deuiſes, ſhould better looke to their proofe &amp; witneſſes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they wil ſeeme to abuſe al men, &amp; to thinke that they liue in ſo looſe &amp; negligent a ſtate, that nothing ſhalbe examined that they ſpeake, but that al things ſhalbe as eaſily receiued, as they may be boldly vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But I truſt, thoſe that haue the feare of God, and care of their ſoules, will not be afraide of vaine ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, nor by and by beleeue all glorious brags, but take heed that they be not eaſily led out of the way, by ſuch as wil ſo quickly be deceiued themſelues.</p>
               <p>I do not anſwere their vaine Arguments, becauſe I feare that any diſcreete or learned man wil be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded with them: but becauſe I miſtruſt, that the ſimple and ignorant people, or other that be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Scriptures, by the very name and reuerence of the word of God, will be carried away, without iuſt examination of them.</p>
               <p>To deſcend ſomething to the conſideration of the matter, marke, I pray you, the Propoſition that is to be proued. It is not, that they may be good Biſhops and miniſters of the Church, which haue neither
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19124:87"/>
glebe nor temporall landes to liue on: It is not, that there were in the primitiue Church, and nowe are in ſundry places, churches well gouerned, which haue not lands allotted vnto them: It is not, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had no lands, nor any other a number of yeeres after Chriſt: For theſe poynts, I thinke no man will greatly ſtand with them. But this is the Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi>
No Prince or magiſtrate by Gods worde may lawfully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne lands to the miniſters of the church to liue on, but ought to ſet them to penſions: Nor any of the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate can by the Scriptures enioy, or vſe any ſuch landes, but ſhould deliuer them vp to the Prince, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
Looke, I pray vou, vpon this Aſſertion, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it well. Doe you not ſee in it, euen at the firſt, eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent abſurditie? Do you not ſee a plaine reſtraint of Chriſtian liberty, as bold and as vnlawfull a reſtraint as euer the Pope vſed any? Do you not eſpy almoſt a flat hereſie, as dangerous as many branches of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts errors? It is no better then an hereſie to ſay, that by the word of God it is prohibited for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to marry. It is no better then an hereſie to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that Chriſtian men, by the lawe of God, may not eate fleſh, or drinke wine. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate theſe to be <hi>Doctrines of Deuils,</hi> and therefore <note place="margin">1. Tim. 9.</note> not of the church of God: and the Primitiue church doeth confirme theſe to bee hereſies in <hi>Saturninus, Marcion, Tatian, Montane,</hi> and many other. And I <note place="margin">Theodoret. Epiphan. Clem. Alex.</note> pray you, what doth this Aſſertion differ from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when it is ſaid, It is not lawful for Eccleſiaſticall perſons to haue temporall landes to liue vpon? As mariage is the ordinance of God, and left free by his <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:19124:87"/>
word to al men: As meates and drinkes are the good creatures of our God, and to be vſed of al ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them with thankeſgiuing: ſo are landes, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, money, cattell, the good giftes of God, and the right vſe of them, not prohibited to any of his people: For to their benefite he ordained them, as his good bleſſings. Chriſt by his death made vs free from all ſuch legall obſeruations. Therefore S. <hi>Paul Coloſ. 2. If ye be dead with Chriſt to the iudgements of the worlde, why are you ledde with traditions, Touch not, Taſte not, Handle not, which all doe periſh in abuſing?</hi> This boldneſſe to bridle Chriſtian libertie, and to make it ſinne and matter of conſcience, to vſe the creatures of God, was the very foundation of al Papiſtical and Antichriſtian ſuperſtition. Vpon this foundation was builded the holineſſe in vſing, or not vſing of this, or that manner of apparell: in eating or forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe or thoſe kindes of meates: in obſeruing this or that day, or time of the yeere: in keeping this or that externall forme of life, with 1000. like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions and traditions of men. Neither do I thinke euer any errour did greater harme in the Church, or brought more corruption of doctrine then that did. Therefore I am ſorie to ſee ſome in theſe dayes, to leane ſo much to that dangerous ſtay, for the helpe of their ſtrange opinions in things externall. For, what doe men when they ſay, It is not lawfull for a Chriſtian man to weare a ſquare Cappe, to vſe a Surpleſſe, to kneele at the Communion? What (I ſay) doe they but bridle Chriſtian libertie, and to the burden of conſciences, make ſinnes vvhere GOD made none? And in like maner, hee that ſayeth, It is vvicked and not lavvfull,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19124:88"/>
that Biſhops, Preachers, or Eccleſiaſticall perſons ſhoulde haue any temporall landes to liue vpon, hee ſeemeth to finde fault with the creature of God. For, that Biſhops may haue liuing allowed them, is not denied: but to liue by landes, that (ſay they) is ſinne, and prohibited, and therefore the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lands and glebe muſt be taken from Biſhops and other Miniſters.</p>
               <p>This doctrine notwithſtanding, muſt bee proued <note place="margin">Biſhops muſt haue no landes.</note> and iuſtified by the Scriptures, and firſt by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God himſelfe in the olde teſtament. In the <hi>Numbers,</hi> when God had declared to <hi>Aaron</hi> what <note place="margin">Numb. 18. The anſwere to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the lawe and ordinance of God.</note> portion he ſhould haue to liue vpon, hee addeth: <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no inheritance in their lande, neither ſhalt thou haue any part among them. I am thy part, and thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among the children of Iſrael. Behold, I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the children of Leui all the tenth of Iſrael to inherit, for the ſeruice which they ſerue in the Tabernacle.</hi> And againe after, <hi>It ſhalbe a law for euer in your generations, that among the children of Iſrael, they poſſeſſe no inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And</hi> in Deut. 10. <hi>the Lorde ſeparated the tribe of Leui, &amp;c. Wherefore the Leuites haue no part, nor inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with their Brethren, but the Lorde is their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as the Lord thy God hath promiſed them.</hi> In the 14. Chapter, and in the 18. and in diuers other partes of the law, and in <hi>Ioſua 14. Moſes gaue inheritance vnto two tribes and a halfe, on the other ſide of Iordan, but vnto the Leuites hee gaue no inheritance among them.</hi> Vpon theſe teſtimonies, the application and concluſion is inferred in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi>
Here it may bee ſeene what liuing God appoynted his Prieſtes to haue: not landes and poſſeſsions, but tithes and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19124:88"/>
offerings. Seing then God denied it to his Prieſtes, it is not lawfull for our Prieſtes. Whoſe Prieſtes are they? If they be Gods Prieſts, it is not there permitted: If they be Antichriſts prieſts, what doe we with them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
As this reaſon may haue ſome ſmall ſhew or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoode to the ignorant: ſo I am ſure, they that haue trauiled in the Scriptures, &amp; any thing vnderſtand the ſtate of Chriſtianity, vvil marueile to ſee this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Texts and the concluſion inferred, Shall the Miniſters of the Church of God, novve in the time of grace, by neceſſitie be bound to thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that vvere among the Ievves appoynted for Prieſtes and Leuites by <hi>Moſes?</hi> Will they bring the heauie yoke and burthen of the Lavve againe vpon the people of God, after that Chriſt hath redeemed vs, and ſet vs free from it? Wil they haue Aaronicall and ſacrificing Prieſtes againe to offer for the ſinnes of the people? When it is in deriſion asked, Whoſe Prieſts ours are, if they be not Gods Prieſts? giuing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that they be the Prieſtes of Antichriſt, it may be right vvell and truely anſvvered, that they are the Prieſtes of Gods holy, bleſſed, and true Church, and yet that they are not ſuch ſacrificing Prieſts of God, as are mentioned in thoſe places, nor in any way bound to thoſe things that they were, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lawe of God onely excepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi>
It is obiected to our Biſhoppes and Miniſters, that in their Landes and poſſeſſions, they reteine the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
But I marueile to ſee them vvhich ſo boldely
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19124:89"/>
controll other, to builde their aſſertions vpon the ruinous foundations of the Synagogue of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. <note place="margin">Theaduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries build vpon Popiſh foundations.</note> As I noted a little before, that they layde their grounde vpon the reſtraint of Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: ſo nowe they ſettle it vpon the imitation of the legall and Aaronicall prieſthood, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Whence (I pray you) came the maſſing apparel, and almoſt all the furniture of their Church in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſinging &amp; burning of Tapers? their altars, their propitiatorie ſacrifice, their high Biſhop and generall head ouer all the Church, with a number of other corruptions of the Church of God, but onely out of this imitation of the Aaronicall prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and legall obſeruations? Surely, while they thus vphold as good, the wicked foundations of the Synagogue of Sathan, they ſhall neuer ſo purely builde vp the Church of Chriſt, as they vvould bee accounted to doe. They may ſeeme to be in a hard ſtreight, that to batter down the ſtate of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> muſt craue ayde of Antichriſt, to ſet vp a fort vpon his foundation.</p>
               <p>The learned fathers of the primitiue Church, did, ſo much as they coulde, ſtriue to be furtheſt off from the imitation of the Iewes, and of the Aaroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call prieſthood, in ſo much that they vvould needes alter not onely the Sabboth day, but alſo the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing of the feaſt of Eaſter: And ſhall the Lawe of the Leuites, and maner of their liuing bee layde downe to vs as a patterne of neceſſitie, vvhich the Prince muſt follovve in refourming her Church, or elſe the prieſtes thereof ſhall not be the prieſtes of God, but of Antichriſt? Is there no more reuerence
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19124:89"/>
and feare of the maieſtie of Gods Prince and ſacred miniſter, then by ſuch groſſe abſurdities to ſeeke to ſeduce her? If this be a concluſion of ſuch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then let them go further: for by as good reaſon they may.</p>
               <p>God ſayeth to <hi>Aaron, Thou ſhalt not drinke wine,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Leuit. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>nor ſtrong drinke, thou, nor thy ſonnes that are with thee, when ye goe into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, leaſt ye die. Letit be a Lawe for euer throughout your genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In an other place commaundement is giuen to <note place="margin">Leuit. 22.</note> the Prieſtes, <hi>That they may not eate of that which is rent of wilde beaſts.</hi> And in the ſame chapter. <hi>If the Prieſtes daughter bee married to any of the common people, ſhee may not eate of the hallowed offerings: but if ſhee be a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, or diuorced from her husbande, and haue no childe, and is returned into her fathers houſe againe, ſhee may eate of her fathers meate, as ſhe did in her youth, but there ſhall no ſtranger eate thereof.</hi> In the 21. of Leuiticus it is ſayde, <hi>Speake vnto the Priests the ſonnes of Aaron, and ſay, Let none bee defiled by the dead among their people.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Let them not make baldnes vpon their head, nor ſhaue off the lockes of their beard.</hi> And againe, <hi>Let him take a Virgine to wife: but a widowe, a diuorced woman, or a polluted &amp;c. ſhall he not marry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the obſeruation of the orders appoynted by God to the Prieſts and Leuites of the olde Law, be a thing ſo neceſſary in the church of God: Why, <hi>then the Ministers of the Goſpell may not drinke wine or ſtrong drinke: they may not ſuffer their daughters mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth, if they come vnto their houſes, to eate any of the tenths and oblations, whereby they liue: they may not come nigh a dead body, nor bury it: they may marry no widowes,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19124:90"/>
but maydes onely.</hi> And ſo likewiſe ſhall you bring in by as good authoritie, infinite numbers mo of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall orders into the Church, and make it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like a ſuperſtitious Synagogue, as the popes church was, then like a ſincere &amp; vndefiled Church of God, as you would pretend to do.</p>
               <p>But let vs deſcende further into this allegation, and ſee howe they ouerthrowe themſelues in their owne purpoſe. If vpon this proofe it be ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that biſhops and other miniſters ſhoulde not liue by landes: then, as the negatiue is neceſſarie in the one branch, ſo is the affirmatiue in the other. When God hath ſayd, <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no inheritance in their land,</hi> he addeth, <hi>Beholde, I haue giuen the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Leui all the tenth of Iſrael to inherite for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, which they doe, &amp;c.</hi> Then it is of neceſſitie by the Lawe of God, that biſhops and preachers ſhoulde liue vpon tenths and offerings, neither may this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be altered by any authoritie.</p>
               <p>And here is an other errour of the Papiſts, that tenths and offerings are in the Church <hi>Iure diuino,</hi> by the lawe of God, and not by any poſitiue Law of the Church. Thus we ſee that theſe men are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſtand to their poſitions, but they muſt ioyne arme in arme with the Papiſts, in their greateſt and groſſeſt errors. And if it be of neceſſitie, that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt liue by oblations and tithes, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: howe can the prince by Gods Lawe take away their Landes, and ſet them to meere penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in money? Or if princes haue libertie by the Lawe of God, according to their diſcretions, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt the liuings of miniſters, by penſions of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, contrary to the order that God hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19124:90"/>
to his prieſts in his Law: why haue they not like authoritie by the ſame worde of God, (if they ſee it conuenient for the ſtate) to allot vnto them ſome portion of temporall Landes, and much more, to ſuffer and beare with that order, being alreadie ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Church? By this it appeareth, that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the aduerſaries doeth not hang together in it ſelfe, but that the one part impugneth and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth the other.</p>
               <p>But mee thinkes theſe men deale not directly, but ſeeme to hide and conceale that which maketh againſt them. For in the ſame place of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> by <note place="margin">Ioſh. 14.</note> which they will prooue, that biſhoppes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may not haue any poſſeſſion of Landes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſaith, <hi>To the Leuites he gaue no inheritance among them,</hi> Immediatly hee addeth, <hi>Sauing Cities to dwell in, and the fieldes about the Cities, for their beastes and cattell.</hi> And in like manner, <hi>The Lorde ſayde</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nom 35.</note> 
                  <hi>to Moyſes, Commaunde the children of Iſrael, that they giue vnto the Leuites of the inheritaunce of their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Cities to dwell in. And yee ſhall giue alſo vnto the Cities Suburbes hard by their Cities rounde about them, the Cities they ſhall haue to dwell in, and the Suburbes or fieldes about their cities for their cattell, and all manner beastes of theirs. And the Suburbes of the Cities which you ſhall giue to the Leuites, ſhall reach from the wall of the Citie rounde about outward a thouſande cubites, &amp;c. And you ſhall meaſure on the East ſide two thouſande cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, and on the West ſide two thouſande cubites, &amp;c.</hi> In the twentie one Chapter of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> The number of theſe Cities is mentioned, <hi>And the lotte came out of the kinred of the Caathites, the children of Aaron the Prieſt, which were of the Leuites, and giuen them
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19124:91"/>
by lot out of the tribe of Iudae, Simeon, and Beniamin, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Cities. And the rest of the children of Caath had by lot of the kinreds of the tribe of Ephraim, Dan, and halfe the tribe of Manaſſes, tenne cities. And the children of Gerſon, had by lotte out of the kinred of the Cities of Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char, Aſer, Nepthaly, and the other halfe of the tribe of Manaſſes in Baſan, thirteene cities. And the children of Merari, by their kinreds, had out of the Tribes of Ruben, Gad and Zabulon, twelue cities. The whole number ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the cities aſsigned to the Leuites in the lande of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, amounted to fortie eight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe I woulde demaund of indifferent Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that vvere not obſtinately ſet to maintaine an euill purpoſe, Whether the ſtate of inheritance without rent, of fortie eight Cities in one Region, no bigger then England, with the fieldes almoſt a mile compaſſe, may bee thought in trueth, to bee temporall poſſeſſions or no? Surely I thinke there is no man ſo wayward, that will denie it to be moſt true.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, eyther the worde of God muſt bee found vntrue, (which is blaſphemie to thinke) or els that boulde aſſertion, that is made of the contrary, is found vaine, and the argument to prooue it, falſe and deceitful. They that had to their portions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie eight Cities, with the fields thereof, did not liue by tithes and oblations onely.</p>
               <p>You ſee therefore (good Chriſtians) howe they vnderſtand the Scriptures, that in ſuch immodeſt and confident maner take vpon them to be maſters and controllers of other: and by how fleight allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; abſurde arguments they ſeeke to leade men into error, euen in great &amp; weighty matters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19124:91"/>
feare of God himſelfe, or reuerence of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with whome they deale. God bleſſe them with more grace of his true, milde, and humble ſpirite, that they runne not ſo headlong, to the daunger of their owne ſoules, and the trouble of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And for the better vnderſtanding heereof, let vs conſider, what ſtate the Leuites had in this Lande that was allotted vnto them. They might ſell, and alienate it, but not to any other Tribe or family, but to ſome of the ſame family, whereof they were.</p>
               <p>The Lawe therein ſaith, Leuit. 25. <hi>Notwithſtanding, the cities of the Leuites, and the houſes of the cities of their poſſeſsion, may the Leuites redeeme at all ſeaſons. If a man purchaſe of the Leuites, the houſe that was ſoulde ſhall goe out in the yeere of Iubile. But the fields of their Cities may not be ſolde, for it is their poſseſsion for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet we read that the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> bought <note place="margin">Iere. 32.</note> a piece of land of <hi>Hananael</hi> his Vncles ſonne, which I take to bee, becauſe <hi>Ieremie</hi> was his next of kinne, to whome by Lavve after him it ſhoulde come: So that <hi>Hananael</hi> ſoulde onely the intereſt of his life time.</p>
               <p>Thus, by the way you may note, that buying and purchaſing of ſuch grounde as was lawfull to them, was not prohibited to Gods Prieſts in the olde law.</p>

Happily they will ſay, That although they had ſome temporall Landes, yet it was in compariſon of the large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the other Tribes, but a ſmall portion: And as the Miniſters of God they liued meanely and poorely vpon it.</p>

To which, if you adde Gods part, that is, the oblations, the firſt fruits and the tenths of their fruites, and cattell beſide, you ſhall perceiue, that the Prieſts, Leuites, and Miniſters of the Temple of God were not left in meaner or poorer, but rather in as good or better ſtate, then any of the other Tribes.

For God hath appoynted them, as Shepheards, as guiders, and patrons of his people, to direct them, to keepe them, to defend them in his true worſhip, and right ſeruice, and, if they will bee wandering from him, eyther by errour in Religion, or by wickedneſſe in life, to inſtruct &amp; teach them, and by all meanes that may bee, to call them home againe: or if they will not bee ruled, by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bridle and reſtraine them, yea, and by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to correct them.

pleaſure of the world, or to couetouſneſſe, briberie, and extortion, to iniurie, violence and oppreſſion, and in their gouernment ſeeke their owne pleaſure and commoditie, and nothing regarde, either the benefite of the people, or the glory of God: then (I ſay) theſe ſpeeches of the Prophets lie directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and may well be vſed to declare the wrath of God towards them. But what maketh this to the purpoſe pretended? howe hangeth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon together? God by the prophets earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth the Gouernours, aſwell of the Church as of the common weale, for their wickedneſſe, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and extortion: therefore biſhops, and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall miniſters may not by the word of God enioy temporall landes &amp; poſſeſsions. Or this, God blameth the prieſtes of the olde lawe for couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: therefore the biſhops of the church of Chriſt may haue no landes and poſſeſsions. They that wil be perſwaded with ſuch reaſons, wil eaſily be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away into error. If it were certaine, and did of neceſsitie followe; that all they, which haue great liuings and poſſeſsions, muſt needes be couetous: then happily this reaſoning might bee of ſome force. But I thinke there is no reaſonable man that wil graunt it, and therefore this reaſoning is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all reaſon. The Prieſts &amp; Leuites, as themſelues confeſſe, had no great lands and lordſhips, and yet wee finde them often in the prophets accuſed and blamed for couetouſneſſe: therefore it is not the want of temporall lands and liuings, that can bring <note place="margin">Neither doth pouerty bring a contented mind: neither great poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions cauſeth couetouſnes.</note> a poore heart and contented minde, voide of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes. Wee ſee often as couetous and greedie hearts in meane mens boſoms, as in the greateſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19124:95"/>
landed Lordes in a whole Countrey. And on the contrary part, we find in them that haue very great poſſeſſions, as humble, and as contented mindes, &amp; as farre from the affection of couetouſnes, as in the meaneſt man that is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iob</hi> was of great wealth and poſſeſſions, and yet wee reade not that hee was euer blamed for coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe: Yea hee beareth witneſſe of his owne free heart and liberalitie, and ſaith, <hi>Hee neuer ſet his heart vpon Gold, nor ſaide to the wedge of Golde, Thou art my hope, nor reioyced of beeing rich, nor becauſe his hande</hi>

                  <hi>is poſsible with God.</hi> Albeit mans corrupt nature, as it is generally giuen to all ill, ſo it is chiefely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to couetouſneſſe, and delight of the worlde: Yet the good grace of Gods holy Spirite doeth ſo guide the heartes of his faithfull, that in the middeſt of greateſt abundaunce of his plentifull bleſſinges,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19124:96"/>
they can retaine the feare of God, and contempt of the worlde. Wherefore, it is great raſhneſſe and preſumption, to condemne all them to bee giuen ouer to couetouſneſſe and delight of the worlde, whome they ſee by the ſtate of the Commonweale, or by the goodneſſe of the Prince, or by any other lawfull and iuſt meanes to haue landes and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or wealth and riches, according to their ſtate. Such perſons as ſo raſhely deeme of other, may ſeeme rather to bewray the ſickneſſe and ill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their owne mindes, then to iudge truely of them, whome in ſuch caſe they condemne. It is the pouertie and humbleneſſe of Spirite and minde, it is not the pouertie and baſeneſſe of outwarde eſtate <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> and condition, vnto the which Chriſt imputeth Gods bleſſings. If couetouſneſſe be <hi>a deſire to haue, for feare of want and ſcarcitie,</hi> as ſome learned men haue defined it: then is a poore eſtate to a corrupt minde a greater ſpurre to couetouſneſſe, then lands and plentie of liuing can bee. Before that biſhoppes and Miniſters had any Landes aſſigned vnto them, yea, when they were yet vnder the Croſſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution in the time of <hi>Cyprian:</hi> wee reade, that he <note place="margin">Serm. delap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.

               <p>In like manner complaine <hi>Hierome, Augustine, Chryſostome, Baſile,</hi> and other auncient Writers, and Hiſtories of their time. Yea, in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time wee ſee ſome giuen ouer to the worlde, and ledde away with couetouſneſſe, when Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19124:96"/>
as yet liued onely vpon the free beneuolence of the people. Wherefore, it is not pouertie, or a lowe and contemptible ſtate in the face of the worlde, that can bring a ſatisfied and contented Spirite. And ſurely I am of this opinion, that a poore and ſtraight ſtate of liuing in the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, eſpecially in theſe dayes, woulde be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſe of euill and inconuenience in the church, and a more vehement temptation to carrie away their myndes from the care of their Office, then nowe their ample and large liuinges are. I could, and will (when God ſhall giue occaſion) declare good reaſon of this my opinion: which for ſome conſiderations I thinke good at this time to lette paſſe.</p>
               <p>If our biſhops and other chiefe of the Cleargie, beeing nowe in the ſtate of our church, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, &amp; ſingular goodnes of our Prince ſo amply prouided for, be ſo vnthankfull vnto God, and ſo giuen ouer to the worlde, as they are bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed to bee: ſurely their fault muſt needes bee the greater, neyther will I, or any other that feareth God, in that poynt excuſe them, but praie to God (if there bee any ſuch) that theſe odious reportes ſpredde vpon them, may bee a meanes to put them in remembraunce of their duetie, and to amend. But vndoubtedly (good chriſtians) I ſpeake it with my heart, me thinketh I doe foreſee at hand thoſe dayes, and that time, when GOD of his iuſtice will both condignly rewarde our vnthankful receyuing of his Goſpell, and contempt of his Miniſters, and alſo giue to them iuſt occaſion to declare vnto their aduerſaries and euill ſpeakers,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19124:97"/>
that they are not ſuch bond-ſlaues of the world, nor bee ſo lead away captiue with the luſts of the fleſh, as they are defamed. Yea, I thinke, this croſſe of contempt, ſlaunder and reproch, that now is layde vpon them, is Gods fatherly admonition to warne them: and as it were a meane to prepare them to that day that is comming: which day vndoubtedly will bee <hi>a day of wrath, a day of trouble and heauineſſe, a day of vtter deſtruction and miſery, a darke &amp; gloomy day, a cloudie and ſtormie day, a day of the trumpet &amp; of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme againſt the ſtrong cities.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19124:98"/>
whome <hi>Malachie</hi> reprooueth: they neglected the true worſhippe of God, and yet woulde they bee accompted his good and true prieſtes, becauſe they were of the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> with whom God had <note place="margin">Nom. 25.</note> made his couenant, that hee and his ſeede ſhoulde haue the office of the high prieſthood for euer. But <hi>Malachie</hi> ſayth they haue broken the couenaunt on their part.</p>
               <p>That our biſhoppes and miniſters doe not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to holde by ſucceſſion, it is moſt euident: their whole doctrine and preaching is contrarie: they vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and teach, that neither they, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other can haue Gods fauour ſo annexed and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, but that, if they leaue their dueties by Gods worde preſcribed, they muſt in his ſight leeſe the preheminence of his miniſters, and bee ſubiect to his wrath and puniſhment. They knowe, and declare to all men, that the couenaunt on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of <hi>Leui,</hi> that is, on the behalfe of the miniſters of God to be perfourmed, conſiſteth in theſe three branches: by preaching to teach the right way of ſaluation, and to ſette foorth the true worſhip of God: to keepe peace and quietneſſe in the Church of God: and thirdly, by honeſt life to bee example vnto others.</p>
               <p>Theſe branches of the couenant, if our biſhops and preachers haue corrupted and broken, they haue to anſwere for it before God, and their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment will be exceeding grieuous.</p>
               <p>As for their doctrine, I am right ſure, and (in the feare of GOD I ſpeake it) will hazard my life to trye it, that all their enemies ſhall neuer bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo to prooue it, but that it ſhall bee founde
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19124:98"/>
ſincere and true: ſo that I doubt not, but God him ſelfe will beare witneſſe with them, as hee did with <hi>Leui,</hi> that <hi>Trueth is in their mouth,</hi> and (as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their doctrine) <hi>no iniquitie founde in their lippes.</hi> For they doe both teach the trueth according to the Scriptures, ſincerely, and confounde the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Antichriſtian Church, learnedly and truely.</p>
               <p>They therfore that ſpeake ſo much againſt them, may ſeeme leſſe to regarde this part of their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the couenant of <hi>Leui,</hi> then the duetie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians requireth. But I truſt, our mercifull God will fauourably conſider it, and beare with ſome other their imperfections in them. I pray God wee bee not lighted into that time, that men haue itching eares, and can like no preachers, but ſuch as clawe their affections, and feede their fantaſies in vanities and newe deuiſes. The couenaunt of peace they keepe alſo, liuing in vnitie and peace among them-ſelues, and ſtudying (ſo much as they can) by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and by good order, to keepe it among other. And that is no ſmall cauſe of their miſliking at this time, becauſe they, being in ſome place of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to their dueties ſtriue to repreſſe thoſe, which by vntemperate zeale ſeeke to diſturbe the Church, and to giue cauſe of faction and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by altering things externall in a ſetled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed ſtate.</p>
               <p>As touching their liues and conuerſations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Lawe of God, (as before I haue ſaid) if I muſt iudge according to that I knowe, I muſt thinke the beſt, becauſe I know no ill. Though there bee imperfections in ſome things: if men woulde
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19124:99"/>
charitablie conſider, in what time wee liue, and whoſe Meſſengers they are, and ſomewhat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deſcend into their owne boſomes, and lay their owne dueties before their eyes: I thinke ſurely they woulde iudge of them more chriſtianly then many doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiection.</hi>
But they will ſay, that according to the wordes of Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, God ſheweth his iudgement againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, becauſe hee hath made them ſo contemptible, ſo vile and deſpiſed before all the people: for (ſay they) wee may ſee how all men loath and diſdaine them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
It muſt needes be true (I confeſſe) that <hi>Malachie</hi> ſpake of the Prieſts of his time: but I doe not take it to be alwayes an vnfallible token of euil Prieſts and Miniſters, or a certaine ſigne of Gods diſpleaſure towarde them, when the people do hate, diſdaine, and contemne them. I ſee more commonly in the Scriptures, that it is a token of vnthankefull, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and hard-hearted people, which ſmally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde the worde of God, and therefore alſo miſlike his miniſters. <hi>Elias, Micheas, Amos,</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were ſmally eſteemed, you knowe, among the Iſraelites. <hi>Eſay, Ieremie, Ezechiel,</hi> were euen of as ſmall credite and eſtimation among the lewes. It may appeare ſo to bee, ſeeing <hi>Eſay</hi> ſignified, that they lilled out their tongues, in mocking of him, and other of his time. And I am ſure, you knowe the fauour and entertainement that the Apoſtles had alſo among the ſame people. I truſt then you will not ſay it was a token of naughtie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19124:99"/>
Miniſters, or of Gods iuſt iudgement againſt them: for they were the right and true Prophetes, Apoſtles, and Meſſengers of God, and yet were in great hatred and miſliking of them that thought themſelues to be the people of God.</p>
               <p>It may be ſurely, and in deede I thinke it to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, that God hath touched our biſhops &amp; Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers with this ſcourge of ignominie and reproch, for their ſlackeneſſe and negligence in their office: And I pray God they may take this mercifull war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſhunne his greater plagues. But I muſt ſay withall, as Chriſt ſayeth of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> whoſe blood <hi>Pilate</hi> mixed with their ſacrifice, and of them <note place="margin">Luke 13.</note> vpon whome the Tower of <hi>Siloe</hi> fell: <hi>Doe you thinke, that they onely are ſinners? nay I ſay vnto you, if you do not repent, you ſhall all taſte of the ſame ſharpe iuſtice.</hi> If God puniſh his Miniſters, he will not ſuffer the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched. <hi>Now the time is come that the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>at the houſe of God,</hi> and if God puniſh thoſe that he ſent with his worde, what will hee doe to them that vnthankfully receiue his worde?</p>
               <p>THAT this matter of Eccleſiaſticall mens li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings <note place="margin">Proofes out of the Newe Teſtament againſt the rich liuings of Miniſters.</note> may ſeeme to be of great importance, and ſuch in deede as God hath had much care of in all times: as before it hath beene countenanced by the Lawe and Prophets, ſo muſt it nowe bee drawen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo through the whole courſe of the nevve Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yea, whatſoeuer is vſed, eyther of Chriſt himſelfe or of his Apoſtles, againſt couetouſneſſe, or the loue and care of this worlde, and delight of this life: all that, either by faire meanes or foule, is brought into this fort, to batter and ſhake the lands
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19124:100"/>
and poſſeſſions of Biſhops, and other of the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</p>
               <p>And firſt men are willed, to cal to remembrance the example of Chriſt our Sauiour, his birth, the ſtate of his life, the choiſe of his apoſtles, &amp; his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall doctrine, exhorting to pouertie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the worlde. His parents (ſay they) were poore, and liued by an handie craft, deſcended of a ſtocke and kinred growen altogether out of credite in the worlde: in ſteede of a princely chamber, borne in an Oxe ſtall: wrapped in poore clothes, in ſteede of white and fine linnen: layde in a cribbe for want of a rich cradle: and in place of worthie ſeruitours, hee had the preſence of an Oxe and an Aſſe. And that hee might ſhewe himſelfe to delight in pouertie and contempt of the world, his natiuitie was firſt reuealed vnto poore Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards watching their flockes. As hee was borne, ſo was he bredde, in the poore and contemptible Towne of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> out of the which <hi>Nathaniel</hi> thought nothing woorthy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite coulde come: in which Towne, as it may bee thought, by the exerciſe of an handie craft, hee liued in obedience of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and of his Mother. Such as his birth and breeding was, ſuch was the ſtate of his liuing, when the full time of his diſpenſation came: for hee was not borne to anie Landes or poſſeſſions, neyther had hee any great wealth and riches to ſuſteine himſelfe, yea, not ſo much as an houſe to put his heade in, but was mainteyned by the almes as it were, and by the charitable deuotion of certayne wealthie vvomen of Galiley, and other godly perſons. His Apoſtles that he choſe to follovve him, and to bee the Miniſters of his kingdome, hee tooke not out of the ſtate of Princes, noble men, or great and rich Lordes, with Landes and dominions: but out of the poore ſtate, and condition of fiſhers, Tent-makers, and toule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers. And thus may we ſee our Lorde and Chriſt altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrapped in pouertie, and beſette on euery ſide with the baſe and contemptible ſtate of the vvorld.</p>
               <p>But to what purpoſe is all this alleaged? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19124:100"/>
that wee may vnderſtande, that it is not lawfull for ſuch as bee guides of the Lordes flocke, to liue in any other ſtate, then in that the Lorde gaue example of: For vvhoſoeuer ſeeketh Chriſt (ſay they) in other ſtate and ſort, then hee gaue example of, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not Chriſt, but Antichriſt and the pompe of the vvorld So that the ſenſe and effect of the reaſon is this: Chriſt was borne, bredde, and liued in pouertie, and choſe vnto him Apoſtles of poore condition: therefore biſhoppes and Miniſters of the church muſt haue no Landes or poſſeſſions, but ſtay them ſelues in like poore ſtate, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles did. I doe not frame this argument (good Reader) of purpoſe to cauill, but to admoniſh thee of the principall ſtate, and that conſidering the proofe to bee naked in it ſelfe, thou maieſt the better iudge of the ſtrength thereof.</p>
               <p>Surely, I will hencefoorth ceaſe to marueile at the wreſted and violent interpretations that Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Monkes and friers haue made vpon the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to iuſtifie and ſet foorth their ſuperſtitious life of voluntary pouertie and forſaking the worlde: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profeſſors of the goſpel, to mainteine their new doctrines, take vpon themſelues the like liberty and boldeneſſe, in abuſing the holie Scriptures and worde of God: And yet ſurely it doth grieue mee, and make my heart bleede to ſee it. What ſhall the aduerſarie thinke of our dealing with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Surely, that wee doe in ſo earneſt manner pull them from the interpretation of the Fathers &amp; of the Church, to the ende that by applying them according to our owne fantaſies, we may ſet foorth
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19124:101"/>
and ſeeme to iuſtifie to the worlde, what doctrine ſoeuer we ſhall thinke good our ſelues: And ſo ſhall this bee an occaſion to diſcredite all the particular doctrines of the Goſpell, which hitherto, as well this Church of England, as other churches refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med haue taught. But to vnderſtande the weight of this reaſon before vſed againſt the wealthie li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings of our Clergie, wee muſt trie it by a right and iuſt balance: that is, by the true meaning of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. Firſt therefore, let vs conſider the cauſes of Chriſtes pouertie, and of the choyce of ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which in mine opinion are two: The one is <note place="margin">The right cauſe of Chriſtes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie and his Apoſtles.</note> the neceſſitie of our redemption: the other is an example and iuſt inſtruction ſet foorth vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. As touching the firſt, when the certaine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God had determined that his ſonne ſhoulde come into the worlde, to worke the redemption of mankinde, and his deliuerance from ſinne: neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie it was for him to ſatisfie the iuſtice of God, in ſuſtaining all thoſe difficulties and puniſhmentes, that were due to man for ſinne: that is to ſay, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ignominie, reproch, contempt, pouertie, and all worldly troubles and miſeries, and laſt of all, death. This is that the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpake of long before. <hi>Hee is deſpiſed and abhorred of men, hee is ſuch a man as</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 53.</note> 
                  <hi>hath good experience of ſorowes and infirmities: we reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him ſo vile that we hidde our faces from him. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it hee onely hath taken our infirmities on him, and borne our paines. Yet wee did iudge him as though he were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued and caſt downe of God.</hi> This is that humiliation and debaſing of himſelfe that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, when hee ſaith, <hi>Hee beeing in the forme of God, thought it no</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>robberie to be equall with God, but made him ſelfe of no
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19124:101"/>
reputation, taking on him the forme of a ſeruant, and made in the likeneſſe of men, and founde in figure as a man, hee humbled himſelfe, made obedient vnto death, euen to the death of the Croſſe.</hi> Theſe places (good Chriſtians) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto vs, both the pouertie and contemptible ſtate of Chriſt here in earth, and alſo the very roote and principall cauſe thereof: that is, the ſaluation of mankinde. The ſonne of God became the ſonne of man, that he might make vs the children of God: he vvas borne a weake and tender babe, that he might make vs ſtrong men in him: he was tied in ſwadling bands, that he might looſe and deliuer vs from the bondes of the fraile and ſinful fleſh: he was wrapped in poore clowtes, that with the garment of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, he might hide our nake dnes: he was borne &amp; liued poorly, that he might make vs rich &amp; plentiful in him: he was a ſtranger in the world, &amp; had not an houſe to put his head in, that he might purchaſe for vs a citie &amp; heritage in heauen: he was borne vnder bondage, and payed tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that hee might deliuer vs from the tyrannie of Hel: he was debaſed euen to the company of bruite beaſts, that he might bring vs to the glorious company of Angels: he lay in hay in a Crib, that he might procure euerlaſting foode for our ſoules: finally, he was accuſed of ſin &amp; put to moſt cruel death, that we being iuſtified by his merite, might appeare innocent in the ſight of God. Theſe be the ſweet &amp; comfortable cogitations that good chriſtians ſhould conceiue vpon the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſts poore &amp; baſe ſtate in this life. For pouerty in Chriſt was not ſo much for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of life, as to ſatiſfie a puniſhment due to ſinne. Riches is the good bleſſing and gift of God: but pouertie came in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19124:102"/>
at the ſame doore that death did, that is, by the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of our firſt father. Wee may not therefore thinke with Monks &amp; Friers, that pouerty in it ſelf is a more holy ſtate of liuing, then wealth &amp; riches is. But of that more hereafter. Novv let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider what maner of pouerty this was in Chriſt. Chriſt vvas in himſelf exceeding rich, both as the ſonne of God, &amp; as the ſonne of man. As God, he had all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with his father. <hi>All thinges that my father hath</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 16.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>are mine.</hi> And againe. <hi>All thine are mine, and mine are thine.</hi> As touching his humanitie, he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> of great poſſeſſions. For his Father ſaith vnto him, <hi>Deſire of me, &amp; I ſhal giue thee the heathen for thine inheritance, &amp; the vttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 2.</note> How hapned it then, that Chriſt being in right Lord of ſo great poſſeſſions, became in the time of his diſpenſation, almoſt in the ſtate of a beggar? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, <hi>quia ipſe voluit,</hi> becauſe he would himſelf. For he that filleth heauen &amp; earth, was borne in an Oxe ſtall in <hi>Bethleem:</hi> he that had al power in the vvhole vvorld, vvas a baniſhed perſon for a certaine time in <hi>Egypt:</hi> he that feedeth with ſuſtenance man &amp; beaſt, foule &amp; fiſh, partly by labor gat his liuing, partly was fed with the liberalitie of other. He that prouideth apparel foral things, hung naked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſſe: he that ſitteth in heauen as his throne, &amp; hath the earth for his footeſtoole, at an other mans charge was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and layd in a ſtrange Sepulchre. Chriſts pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie therfore was vvilling, not of any necesſitie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, as I haue ſaid, but to beare that vvhich for ſinne was due to vs. Now, I pray you, mark y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrength of the former reaſon. Chriſt, to ſuſtaine the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to our ſinnes, liued in great pouerty &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in this world: therfore biſhops &amp; miniſters of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19124:102"/>
the Church, of neceſſitie, muſt liue in pouertie, and not haue any wealthy liuings, by lands or otherwiſe. I truſt they that haue care of their conſciences, will not eaſily be led to any perſwaſion by ſuch reaſons. They will ſay, Chriſt did this alſo for our example. I graunt, in ſome reſpect he did ſo: By his example he teacheth vs humbleneſſe and modeſtie, that we may not be loath to doe thoſe things, that he did, for the benefite &amp; commoditie of our Chriſtian brother. If we ſo ſwell with pride, that in reſpect of our Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or birth, or great eſtate in the worlde, wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine other, and thinke our poore neighbour doeth vs iniurie, if he in reſpect of Chriſtian brotherhood require of vs a benefit for his better reliefe: then is it time for vs, to behold the Sonne of God lying poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a cribbe or manger, betweene beaſtes: who, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were God eternall with his Father, and by his mother borne of the moſt noble family of many Kings and Prophets: yet for our ſake he did ſo humble &amp; debaſe himſelf, that he came in ſo poore and vile condition before men. Furthermore, Chriſt by his example, hath as it were conſecrated pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, trouble, miſerie, and affliction, that they may not be accompted tokens of the wrath of God, or ſuch things as do hinder true pietie &amp; holineſſe, or let the ſaluation of our ſoules. For as mans nature doeth abhorre all afflictions: ſo chiefly do men thinke po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie and neede, to be not onely one of the greateſt miſeries that can happen to man, but alſo hatefull to God himſelfe. Thus we ſee men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly to thinke of ſuch, as are any way fallen into pouerty &amp; miſery. Let <hi>Iob</hi> hereof be an example. In this cauſe alſo it is expedient for vs to looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our poore Chriſt, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19124:103"/>
to ſet him before our eyes, that wee may both more patiently beare theſe things, vvhen for Gods cauſe they light vpon vs, and more charitably iudge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom God therewith toucheth: yea, it is good to teach vs to pul downe our briſſles, when we waxe proude of thoſe gifts of plenty and riches, that God hath giuen vs. Thus you ſee what profit the example of Chriſtes pouertie bringeth: but I pray you, to whom is Chriſt an example? to biſhops and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters only? did he liue in poore &amp; miſerable ſtate for Miniſters only? did he die for their ſinnes only? God forbid. He was borne, he liued, he died for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and all faithfull haue the fruite of this his birth, his life, and his death. Therefore the example of Chriſts life muſt ſtretch further then to Biſhops and Miniſters. It is a farre truer argument to ſay, Chriſt liued a ſimple and poore life, while hee was here on earth: therefore all Chriſtians ought to liue in the ſame maner that he did, then to apply the ſame onely to Miniſters and Eccleſiaſticall perſons. Therefore I will all Chriſtians to beware of this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall and Anbaptiſticall aſſertion:</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer ſeeketh Chriſt in other ſtate and ſort then hee gaue example of, ſeeketh not Chriſt, but Antichriſt, and the pompe of the world.</p>
               <p>For if this ſentence be applied to the example of the poore ſtate of Chriſt, it is the very ground of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſticall communitie, and that none can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but ſuch as renounce al their goods &amp; poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Albeit the example of Chriſt in this place be applied to Miniſters onely: yet in trueth it appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to all other faithfull, as well to them. And if the Argument ſhalbe counted good now: hereafter,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19124:103"/>
with as good liklihood, and farre truer interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it may be vſed againſt al that ſhal truely profeſſe Chriſt. As touching that Chriſt choſe ſo ſimple Apoſtles, and of ſo poore eſtate, <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſheweth the reaſon and cauſe thereof. <hi>Brethren</hi> (ſaith hee) <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>you ſee your calling, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mightie, not many Noble are called: but God hath choſen the fooliſh things to confound the wiſe, and the weake things to confounde the mightie, and vnnoble things of the world, and things that are deſpiſed, God hath choſen, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are, that no fleſh ſhoulde glorie in his preſence.</hi> If Chriſt in the entrance of his Kingdome, going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſubdue the world to his knowledge, ſhould haue vſed the ſernice and miniſterie of Princes, Noblemen, great, wealthie, and rich men: or of ſuch as hadbene wiſe, learned, and eloquent, and politique: the glorie of his mightie conqueſt would haue bene attributed to the power and might, to the wealth and riches, to the wiſedome and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to the eloquence and policie of thoſe, which had bene his miniſters, and ſo the glorie of God in that worke of mans ſaluation, ſhould haue bene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed. Therefore God, to ſhewe his power in heauenly thinges, ouerthwarted the wiſedome of the worlde, and choſe his Apoſtles poore, vnnoble, ſimple, vnlerned, without eloquence, farre from the cunning, wiſedome, and policie of the world, &amp; by them and by their preaching in fewe yeeres wanne the whole worlde to his knowledge, and defaced the kingdome of Sathan, conſiſting in ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, idolatrie, and wickedneſſe. And indeede, this order of Gods woorking by theſe poore and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19124:104"/>
men, preuailed againſt all the Nobilitie, the honour, the power, the might, the wiſedome, the policie, learning, the eloquence of the worlde, ſo that it might bee truely ſayde, <hi>Non eſt potentia, non eſt prudentia, non eſt conſilium aduerſus Dominum.</hi> But what hereof is to bee concluded to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? forſooth, that as Chriſt thought it fitteſt to chuſe onely poore men to his Apoſtles, and ſent them abroade without any ſtay of Lining in the worlde: ſo hee thinketh it meeteſt, that his Miniſters in his Church in all times and places ſhoulde be in poore eſtate, and not to haue any wealth or riches.</p>
               <p>It is good to conſider this reaſon alſo, that you bee not more ledde with it, then the weight &amp; force of it requireth. The office of the Apoſtles was, to goe from Countrey to Countrey, from place to place, to plant Churches vnto God, ſo that they could not haue any certaine ſtay of Liuing: It is not therefore like reaſon, that in a ſetled Church where the Goſpel is receiued, the Miniſters and Preachers thereof may haue no certaine forme of Liuing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted them, eyther by land or otherwiſe. As Chriſt choſe his Apoſtles poore, ſo he choſe them ſimple, and vnlearned, without eloquence, or any kinde of knowledge, that his glorie thereby might the more be ſet foorth: Shall wee therefore inferre thereupon, that it is fitteſt alwayes for the Miniſters of the Church, to bee ſimple, without learning, eloquence, and knowledge? It is well knowen that the Anabaptiſts, and ſome other phanaticall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits troubling the reformed Churches beyonde the ſeas, vpon the ſame example of the Apoſtles haue gathered, that learning and knowledge is not to bee reſpected in the choyce of Miniſters: becauſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19124:104"/>
God needeth no ſuch helpes to ſette foorth his Goſpell, yea they ſay that learning and eloquence are perillous inſtruments, to corrupt the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell, and to giue countenance to errour. Wherefore ſuch perſons doe vſually admit among them to the Miniſterie handicrafts men, and ſuch as challenge to themſelues the ſpirite of God onely, vvithout further knovvledge. But the godly, I doubt not, vnderſtand that all things neither can, nor ought to bee like in the ſtate of the Church begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vnder perſecution, and in the Church ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and liuing in peace and quietneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters and Preachers of our church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles liuing in pouertie, are vvilled diligently to looke into the perpetual doctrine, which Chriſt in all the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts doeth teach them, touching the ſtate of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, namely againſt riches, couetouſneſſe, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the vvorld, &amp; care of this life. To this doctrine apperteineth that vvhich Chriſt teacheth. <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. That they <hi>ſhoulde not hoarde vp treaſure for themſelues</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 6. Luke 12.</note> 
                  <hi>vpon earth, where thieues breake through and ſteale them, but that they ſhould lay vp treaſures in heauen &amp;c. That they cannot ſerue two maſters, God and Mammon:</hi> That they ſhoulde not <hi>bee carefull for their life, what they ſhoulde eate, what they ſhoulde drinke, or what apparell they ſhoulde put on: but cast all their care vpon God, and ſeeke his kingdome, and the righteouſneſſe thereof,</hi> for that it is heatheniſh carefully to ſeeke after thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which God of himſelfe will plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt vpon his: that riches, and the pleaſures and cares of this life, are reſembled to <hi>thornes</hi> which <note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> choake vp the good ſeede of Gods word, and make
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19124:105"/>
that it cannot proſper: <hi>That it is as vnpoſsible for a</hi>

                  <hi>rich man to enter into the kingdome of God, as for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell to goe thorowe the eye of a needle:</hi> That hee cryeth out, <hi>woe to them that are full, for they ſhall bee hungrie:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 6. Luk. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>and to them that be rich, becauſe they haue alreadie their comfort and conſolation:</hi> yea, he willeth them to <hi>ſell all that they haue, and giue vnto the poore,</hi> with a number of other places: wherein he inſtructing his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples &amp; followers, vtterly willeth them to renounce this vvorld and the treaſures thereof. Whereupon it is thought it may be very well concluded, that the Miniſters of the Church may not haue any wealthy liuings, and eſpecially by landes and lordſhips: and therefore that our Biſhops be not the true follovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt, but walke in the ſteppes of Antichriſt. Surely our Sauiour Chriſt did ſee, that as the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enemie of mankinde did continually ſeeke by all wayes to dravve men from God: ſo he did not vſe any meane more commonly, then by honour, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, riches and vvealth. And therefore when he ſavv that Chriſt coulde not by other temptations bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, he aſſaulted him with ambition and deſire of principalitie, honour, and lordſhip. This tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is therefore the more dangerous, becauſe mans corrupt nature is of it ſelfe greatly inclined to the loue of the world &amp; earthly pleaſures. Wherefore I cannot denie, but that our careful &amp; louing ſauiour did often &amp; in many places warne his diſciples, and by them all vs, to beware of this working of Sathan, and ſo much as they could, to ſhunne his ſnares. But ſhall vvee thinke therefore, that hee condemneth principalitie, lordſhip, dominion, vvealth, riches, landes, in them that bee his true and faithfull fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovvers?
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19124:105"/>
No ſurely: for that is the full ground of the Anabaptiſts doctrine, to be ſhunned of alright chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And yet before I begin to anſwere this, I muſt needes proteſt it is a queiſie &amp; dangerous matter, to ſpeake of wealth and riches of the world, for feare of miſtaking, either on the one part, or on the other. For vvhatſoeuer a man ſhall ſay in that caſe, among the vngodly vvill be dravven according to their priuate affections.</p>
               <p>The rich, when they heare the poſſesſion of riches &amp; the right vſe of them defended, by and by if Gods ſpecial grace ſtay them not, vvaxe more confident and ſecure, and vvith contempt &amp; diſdaine of other, thinke themſelues free maſters and Lordes of Gods giftes, to vſe them euen at their ovvne pleaſure, &amp; to the fulfilling of their ovvne fleſhly fantaſies. On the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary part, when they that be poore &amp; deſtitute of thoſe gifts, ſhall heare the rich blamed for the abuſe of their wealth, &amp; ſignification giuen, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is aboue the ſufficient maintenance of their own ſtate, is due vnto the poore: they alſo as raſhly enter into iudgement, &amp; condemne all rich men as coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, as griedy gatherers, as thieues &amp; extortioners, &amp; cruel detainers of that which by Gods law is due to others. Some there be alſo, that thinke all vſe and adminiſtration of riches to be dangerous, &amp; to bring no ſmal hinderance to the ſaluation of mens ſoules. Vnto vvhich perſwaſion, the phanaticall ſpirits of the Anabaptiſts adde more difficultie, not onely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away all poſſesſion &amp; property, and allowing a <hi>Platonicall</hi> community of al things: but alſo denying ſuperioritie, and Lordſhip and dominion, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in a general equality, moſt dangerous to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19124:106"/>
of man. Wherefore, it behooueth me ſo to ſpeake of riches and poſſeſſions, that (ſo neere as I can) none of theſe offences may be iuſtly taken.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore to begin, vve may not thinke that Chriſt in them that be his, condemneth eyther the poſſeſſion or the right vſe of Lordſhip, dominion, la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, riches, mony &amp; ſuch like: for they are the good gifts of God, wherwith he bleſſeth his people, as the whole courſe of the ſcriptures declare. <hi>The bleſsing of</hi>

Wee may not thinke therefore, that Chriſt condemneth the giftes and bleſsings of God, or the vſe of them, in his ſeruants. And that the trueth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Scriptures may be of more authoritie vvith you, I wil let you vnderſtand it by the words of the ancient &amp; learned Fathers: ſo ſhal you perceiue, it is not my interpretation, but theirs.

beloued of God, that aboue all the</hi> Patriarkes, <hi>he was a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of two Tribes.</hi> Daniel, <hi>and the three young men, had ſuch rule ouer the power and riches of Babylon, that in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell they ſerued Nabuchodonoſor, but in minde they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God. Mardocheus and Heſter, in the middeſt of their purple, ſilke, and precious iewels, ouercame pride with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and were of ſuch worthineſſe, that they being Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, bare rule ouer Conquerours. My ſpeech tendeth to this ende, that I may declare that this yong man that I ſpeake of, had kinred of royall blood, aboundance of riches, and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of honour and power, as matter and inſtruments of vertue vnto him.</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> diſputeth this queſtion, <note place="margin">Epiſt. 89.</note> writing to <hi>Hillarius, Thou writeſt vnto me,</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>that ſome ſay, that a rich man remaining in his wealth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the kingdome of God, vnleſſe that hee ſell all that he hath, and that it ſhal not profit, though in his wealth he keepe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of God. Our fathers, Abraham, Iſaac and Iaacob, vnderſtood not this reaſoning: for they all had no ſmall riches, as the holy Scriptures witneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And leaſt that ſome might ſay, that thoſe holy men were vnder the old Teſtament, and vnderſtood not the perfect lawe that Chriſt giueth, when he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <note place="margin">Matt. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Goe &amp; ſell all that thou haſt, and giue it vnto the poore, and thou ſhalt haue treaſure in heauen,</hi> the ſame <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> addeth, <hi>If they will ſay ſo; they may ſpeake with ſome reaſon: but let them heare the whole, let them marke the whole: they may not in one part open their eares, and in an other part ſtoppe them. Hee ſpake that to one that asked him, What ſhall I doe to obtaine euerlaſting life? and Chriſtes anſwere is not, If thou wilt obtaine euerlaſting life, ſell all that thou haſt: but, if thou wilt haue euerlaſting life, keepe the Commandemements, &amp;c. And a little after, our good Maister doeth make
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19124:107"/>
a diſtinction betweene the keeping of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, and that other rule of perfectneſſe.</hi> For in the one part he ſayde, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> And in the other he ſayde, <hi>If thou wilt bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſell all thou haſt, and come and followe me. Howe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can we denie, that rich men, although they haue not the perfection, ſhall come into euerlaſting life, if they keepe the commandements, and giue, that it may be giuen vnto them?</hi> And in the ende he concludeth his reaſon in this manner, after hee hath ſpoken of the vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable minde of the rich glutton. <hi>This pride</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hee) <hi>wherewith this rich man did contemne the poore</hi> Lazarus <hi>lying before his gates, and that truſt that he did put in his riches, whereby he thought himſelfe a bleſſed man, becauſe of his purple, ſilke, and ſumptuous feaſtes, did bring him to the torments of hell, and not his riches.</hi> By which wordes of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, it is not riches, Landes and poſſeſſions, that GOD condemneth in his ſeruantes, but the euill vſe of them. Wherefore the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>When the Lorde had ſayde, It is eaſier for a Camell</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal 51.</note> 
                  <hi>to paſſe thorowe the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of God: and the Apoſtles maruailing thereat, anſwered, Who then can bee ſaued? What reſpected they I pray you? ſurely,</hi> non facultates, ſed cupiditates: <hi>not great ſubſtance, but greedie deſire of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Immediately hee ſheweth, that rich Abraham had preheminence in heauen, before poore Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <hi>Reade the Scriptures,</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>and thouſhalt finde rich Abraham, that thou mayeſt knowe, it is not riches that is puniſhed.

brought into his boſome: the poore man in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the rich, or rather both rich before God, and both poore in ſpirite &amp;c. Marke this, that you do not commonly blame rich men, or put truſt in poore eſtate. For if a man ſhould not put his truſt in riches, much leſſe in pouertie.</hi> To the like effect ſpeaketh <hi>Hierome, Is it euill to haue riches iuſtly gotten, ſo that a man giue thankes to God that gaue them? No, but euill it is to put a mans truſt in riches. For in another Pſalme it is ſayde, Ifriches come vnto thee, ſet not thine heart vpon them. A man may haue riches for his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie, but hee may not poſseſſe them to delight in them.</hi> Well therefore ſaith <hi>Chriſoſtome, As I haue ſayde, wine</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Homil. 13. ad popul. Antioch.</note> And to the ſame meaning in an other place: <hi>Let vs not falſely accuſe either riches or pouertie: for both riches and pouertie are ſuch, as, if we will our ſelues, bring inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vertue. Let vs therefore ſo frame our ſelues, that we iudge not ſo, as we may ſeeme to blame Gods giftes, but the euill affections of men.</hi> The ſame <hi>Chryſoſtome, Riches</hi>

And againe, the rich glutton was puniſhed, not becauſe he was rich, but becauſe he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mercie. For it may bee, that one hauing riches, ioyned with mercie, may attaine to all goodneſſe.</hi> By theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the ancient learned Fathers, grounded vpon the examples and doctrine of the Scriptures, you may perceiue, that riches are the good gift and bleſsing of God: that the Saintes of God haue vſed and enioyed them: that welth &amp; poſſeſsions of them ſelues are not hinderous to pietie &amp; godlineſſe, but rather inſtruments of vertue and meanes to come
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19124:108"/>
to heauen: that God doeth not condemne them in his ſeruants: that it is not a man voyd of lands and poſſeſſion, but a heart voyde of couetouſneſſe that Chriſt deſireth: that it is not riches, but the ſinfull affections of men that he reproueth. How then can it bee prooued by Chriſts doctrine, that any ſtate of his diſciples or faithfull ſeruants and followers, ought not to haue landes, poſſeſſions, or ample and large liuings? or that they be by his word ſo expreſly prohibited, that neither Prince may ſuffer it vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, nor faithfull Miniſter with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience inioy them? Let vs ſomewhat better conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the particular places of this doctrine of Chriſt, whereon this aſſertion is grounded. Where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Hoarde not vp treaſures for your ſelues on earth,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> he ſaith not, you ſhall haue no treaſures. To haue treaſures, and to hoarde treaſures, be diuerſe. Hee that hoardeth vp treaſures, ſheweth that hee hath a carefull minde to keepe them: but a man may poſſeſſe treaſures, and yet with free heart bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to imploy them to godly purpoſes: like as <hi>Iob</hi> did, who had his riches alwayes ready to pleaſure other. When Chriſt affirmeth, that <hi>where a mans treaſure is, there is his heart:</hi> by treaſure, he meaneth not the poſſeſſion of riches ſimply, but hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that, wherein a man repoſeth his chiefe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and felicitie to conſiſt. And in deede it can not bee, but that hee that eſteemeth his chiefe felicitie in any thing, doeth ſet his heart alſo vpon it. He that ſetteth his felicitie in honour and dignitie, hath his heart poſſeſſed with ambition. Hee that thinketh it to bee in worldly pleaſure, hath his whole minde on playing, banqueting, feaſting
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19124:108"/>
and riot. He that repoſeth his felicitie in building, giueth ouer his cogitations vnto that. So hee that iudgeth his bleſſednes in this life to be in poſſeſſion of riches &amp; lands, vndoubtedly can not but haue his heart faſtened vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. And ſeeing that God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth vnto himſelfe all our whole heart, and our whole ſoule and minde, they that ſo do, muſt needes offend God moſt grieuouſly, &amp; make of their riches their God, and ſo as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, become very idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Therfore if either Eccleſiaſticall perſons, or lay men, do ſo ſet their minds on riches, this place nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toucheth them. When Chriſt ſaieth, <hi>No man can ſerue two maſters; &amp;c. and ye cannot ſerue God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Marke, I pray you, that he ſaith not: <hi>No man can ſerue God &amp; get riches.</hi> For godly men both haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time, &amp; now may get lands &amp; riches, procured either by heritage or by gift, or by any other lawfull meanes. Conſider the Patriarch <hi>Iacob:</hi> who paſſed <note place="margin">Gene. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Iordane</hi> onely with a ſtaffe in his hand, &amp; in the time of his liuing in a ſtrange Countrey gate ſo great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as he returned with two great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants &amp; cattel. And yet vndoubtedly this Patriarch was a good Chriſtian, being ſaued by the ſame reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that his grandfather <hi>Abraham</hi> was, the father of the faithfull, who with reioycing ſawe the day of Chriſt. Neither doth Chriſt ſay, <hi>No man can ſerue God and poſſeſſe riches.</hi> For as it is ſaide before, <hi>Abraham, Iob,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> poſſeſſed great wealth &amp; riches, and yet vndoubtedly, truely, and ſincerely ſerued God. Riches are the bleſſings of God, neyther may anie more rightly or with better title poſſeſſe them, then the good and faithfull ſeruants of God. What ſaith Chriſt then? forſooth, <hi>No man can ſerue two masters:</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:19124:109"/>
or <hi>No man can ſerue God and Mammon.</hi> Getting or poſſeſſing is one thing, &amp; <hi>ſeruing</hi> is another. <hi>Seruing</hi> preſuppoſeth a maſterſhip or dominion in him that is ſerued. He that <hi>ſerueth riches,</hi> acknovvledgeth them to be his Lord and Maſter. <hi>Seruitude</hi> or bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage hath this condition, that hee wholly obey his maſter: that night and day he doe nothing but that pleaſeth his maſter: that he ſhall be contented to haue the diſpleaſure of all other, ſo that he may haue the good vvil of his maſter: Finally, vvhatſoeuer a ſeruant doth, what labour ſoeuer he taketh, vvhatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer by his paines he getteth, he doth it to the vſe &amp; behalfe of his maſter. Whoſoeuer is ſuch a bond-ſlaue to riches, is a traytour reuolted from God, neither can it be posſible for him to ſerue God. Such a ſeruing of <hi>Mammon</hi> it is that Chriſt in this place rebuketh, vvith vvhich ſeruice, the ſeruice of God cannot be ioyned.</p>
               <p>But it vvere great raſhneſſe to thinke all that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe lands, lordſhips, and riches, of necesſitie to be ſubiect to this ſlauiſh ſeruice of <hi>Mammon,</hi> as ſome men vncharitably iudge of the Biſhops and Clergie of England. Ioſeph of <hi>Arimathea</hi> vvas a rich man, and yet in time of great perill did more ſeruice to Chriſt, then all his poore Apoſtles vvhich had ſo little to leeſe. It is vvritten in the Euangeliſts, <hi>When Euen was come, there came a rich man from Arimathea</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>named Ioſeph, which alſo himſelfe was Ieſus his diſciple. He went to Pilate and begged the body of Ieſus.

Iudge therefore more charitably of your Miniſters &amp; Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, (O ye Engliſh profeſſours) which haue ſeene theſe things with your eyes, &amp; know not how ſoone, to the ſorowe of your owne hearts, yee may ſee the ſame againe. But they which at this day miſlike the ſtate of biſhops, &amp; do write or ſpeake againſt them, are thoſe perſons, which in the time of affliction, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were not borne, or els were very yong, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue no ſenſe of that temptation, which that perſecution did then bring. As God of his goodnes graunteth vs now ſome <hi>Halcion</hi> dayes: ſo I beſeech him againſt that day, to giue vs the grace of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſpirit, ſo that we may haue the like conſtancie.</p>
               <p>It is further alledged out of Chriſts doctrine, that when he anſwered the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. he giueth a <note place="margin">Matt. 22.</note> plaine commandement, that landes and poſſeſions ſhould be at the pleaſure of the Prince, &amp; that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:19124:110"/>
of the church ought to giue them vp vnto him. For this he ſaith, <hi>Giue to Caeſar that which is Caeſars, and to God, that is Gods:</hi> But (ſay they) all temporall landes are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> therefore they ought to giue them vnto <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and our <hi>Caeſar</hi> is our gracious Prince and Soueraigne.</p>
               <p>Truely it woulde make any Chriſtian heart to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe dayes, to ſee Gods holy word ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably drawen, racked, and pulled in ſunder from the true meaning thereof. If the biſhops, and other of the Cleargy of England did grudge or murmure to haue their landes and Liuinges to bee tributarie to the Prince, and ſubiect to all taxes and ſeruices, that by the laws of this Realm may be, either to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of her perſon, or to the defence of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: Or if they did challenge ſuch an immunitie or exemption from the authoritie of the Prince, as the Pope and his Cleargie did: Or if they did find them-ſelues grieued to bee puniſhed by the Prince for the breach of her Lawes, as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in old time did, and ſome nowe in our age do: If they were ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to Princes and Gouernours, as they woulde exempt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the ſtate of true chriſtianitie, &amp; of the Church of God, and make them onely to ſerue their turne in euill affaires: then in deede did this place make ſtrongly againſt them. But I truſt the Cleargie of Englande, are with all good men out of the ſuſpition of theſe pointes. They are as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and readie at all times to bee contributarie, as any other ſubiectes are: they claime no exemption from her authoritie: they willingly ſubmitte them-ſelues to her correction: they humbly acknowledge their obedience in all thinges, that anie Chriſtian Prince may require: and this doe they principallie
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:19124:110"/>
for conſcience ſake, becauſe it is the ordinance and commandement of God: but much mooued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to alſo, as men, in conſideration of their ovvneſtate, vvhich next vnder God dependeth of her maieſtie. Seeing therfore the hand of God hath more ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bounde them vnto her, then other common ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects: I doubt not, but ſhee vvillingly hath, and ſhall haue all dueties of obedience at their handes, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtian ſubiects by the word of God are bound vnto. Neither are they in any feare that her Maieſtie vvill preſſe them to any thing, vvhich ſhall not ſtand vvith the glorie of God, and furtherance of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. But hovv theſe vvords of Chriſt before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand them preſently to yeeld vp into her Maieſties hands ſuch landes &amp; poſſeſsions, as by the grant of her goodnes, &amp; by the law of this realm they nowe inioy, indeede I ſee not. If ſuch a Prince ſhall com (as I truſt in my daies neuer to ſee) that ſhal put them to this choiſe, either to forgoe their lands &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, or to looſe the free courſe of the Goſpell: it is before declared, what their duty is to do therin. And I doubt not, but in the late time of perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there were many of them that would haue bin glad with al the veines in their hearts, by that choice to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed in this Realme the freedom of their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, though they had bin put to as pore eſtate, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly men might haue liued in. But how that chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> princes are warranted, either by this place of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, or by any part of the word of God, ſo hardly to deale with the ſtate of the miniſtery, I haue not as yet learned, though it be in theſe dayes by ſome boldly affirmed. <hi>Amb.</hi> hath a worthy ſaying, wherin he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noteth both what a chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prince may do in theſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:19124:111"/>
things that appertaine vnto the Church, and howe a godly biſhop ſhoulde in that caſe behaue himſelfe. <hi>When it was propoſed vnto me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. lib. 5. in Orat. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Auxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</note> 
                  <hi>the plate or veſſell of the church, I made this anſwere: If there were any thing required that was my owne, either land, houſe, gold or ſiluer being of my owne priuate right, that I would willingly deliuer it: but that I coulde not pull any thing from the Church of God. And moreouer I ſayde, that in ſo doing I had regarde to the Emperours ſafetie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not profitable either for me to deliuer it, or for him to receiue it. Let him receiue the words of a free Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God. If he will doe that is for his owne ſafety, let him forbeare to do Chriſt iniury.</hi> By theſe words ye may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, both that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> wold not deliuer the church goods, nor that he thought it ſafe for the Emperour to require it. The mening of Chriſt is in thoſe words, to teach his to put a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between the duty that they owe to the Prince, &amp; that they owe to God: and to declare, that vvithin their due boundes, they may both ſtand together. Therefore they that wil rightly folow Chriſt in this doctrine, muſt conſider, in what conſiſteth the dutie towards a Prince or Magiſtrate, and wherein reſteth our duetie towardes God. Wee owe to the Prince, honour, feare, and obedience: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience (I ſay) in al thoſe things that are not againſt the worde of God and his commandements. Thoſe things that God commandeth, a Chriſtian Prince cannot forbid: Thoſe things that God forbiddeth, no Prince hath authority to command. But ſuch things as be external, and by Gods word left in different, the Prince by his authoritie may ſo by lawe diſpoſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding, or forbidding, as in wiſedome &amp; diſcretion he ſhall thinke to make moſt to the glorie
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19124:111"/>
of God, and to the good and ſafe ſtate of his people. Among theſe things external, I thinke lands, goods, and poſſeſſions to bee, and therefore that the ſame ought to be ſubiect to taxe and tribute in ſuch ſort, as the lawes &amp; ſtate of the countrey requireth: yea, and if there ſhal happen in any country a magiſtrate, which by violence and extortion ſhall wreſt more vnto him of the landes and ſubſtance of the people, then lawe and right requireth: I ſee no cauſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Gods word, that the inferiour ſubiectes can rebell, or reſiſt the Prince therein, but that they ſhal euidently ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to reſiſt the ordinance of God. For they haue not the ſword of correction committed into their hand, and oftentimes God by euill Princes correcteth the ſinnes of the people. Wherefore, if ſubiects reſiſt the hard dealings euen of euill Magiſtrates, they doe in that reſpect ſtriue againſt God himſelfe, who will not ſuffer it vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Wherefore <hi>Ieremie</hi> willeth the Iewes to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <note place="margin">Ierem. 28.</note> themſelues to the obedience of <hi>Nabuchodonoſor,</hi> a wicked and cruell king: and <hi>Baruch</hi> teacheth them <note place="margin">Baruc. 1.</note> to pray for the good eſtate of the ſayd <hi>Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi> and his nephewe <hi>Balthaſar.</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and <note place="margin">1.

               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:19124:112"/>
                  <hi>A Chriſtian</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is enemie to none, and leaſt of all to the Emperour, whome he knowing to be ordeined of God, muſt of neceſsitie loue, reuerence, and honour, and wiſh to bee in ſafetie together with the whole Romaine Empire.</hi> And againe, <hi>We pray for all Emperours, that God woulde graunt vnto them long life, proſperous reigne, ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>

                  <hi>faithfull Counſell, obedient Subiects. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may learne then by this, that Chriſtian due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a ſubiect conſiſteth in louing, in reuerencing, in obeying the Prince and Magiſtrate in all things, that lawfully hee commandeth: and in thoſe things that he commandeth vnlawfully, not by violence to reſiſt him, though the ſame touch our goods, our lands, yea and our life alſo. As touching our duetie towarde God, wee owe vnto him our ſelues whollie, both body and ſoule, and all things and partes to the ſame appertaining, according to that his Lavve requireth, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoule, with all thy minde, and with thy whole power.</hi> For wee are his creatures, and hee is our Lorde and maker. But foraſmuch as Princes, Magiſtrates, Rulers, Parents, Maſters, and all ſuperiours, haue a portion of Gods authoritie ouer vs, as his officers and Lieutenants in their callings: therefore God doeth permit vnto them ſome part alſo of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but ſo farre, and in ſuch things, and ſuch maner as before is declared, retaining vnto himſelfe our faith and religion, vvith all the partes of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine vvorſhippe conſiſting in Spirite and in trueth, the calling vpon his bleſſed name, the confeſſion of his holy trueth, and the obedience of his morall Lavve: vvhich thinges hee doeth not make ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to any Princes authoritie. And if any Prince
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:19124:112"/>
or Magiſtrate by violence and crueltie ſhall breake into the boundes of our duetie towardes God, I ſaie not that priuate ſubiects may by violence reſiſt it: but ſurely they may not obey it, but rather yeelde into his handes, goods, landes, countrey, and life too. For ſo did the Prophet <hi>Daniel:</hi> ſo did the yong men his companions: ſo did the whole number of the martyrs of God, by whome the Church of Chriſt increaſed as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaieth, <hi>Non reſisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>

                  <hi>ſed perferendo,</hi> not by reſiſting but by ſuffering. And <hi>Hierome: The Church of Chriſt was founded by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hierom ad Theophil.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuffering reproch, by perſecutions it increaſed, by martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes it was crowned.</hi> To this ende, ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Semen Euangelij Sanguis Martyrum.</hi> This is the true doctrine of the wordes of Chriſt before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, by which wee are taught to put a difference betweene our duetie towards God, and that we owe towarde the Prince, yeelding to each that vvhich is his: A doctrine moſt profitable and neceſſarie to all Chriſtian Churches and common weales. But who can gather of this, that the Miniſters of the Church of Chriſt, liuing vnder a Chriſtian Prince fauouring and defending the Goſpel, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie giue vp into the Princes hands thoſe landes and poſſeſſions, which by the graunt of the ſame Prince and the Lawe of the Lande is aſſigned vnto them? For if the land be <hi>Caeſars</hi> and therefore muſt bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> then are all goods, <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and muſt be alſo yeelded into his hands.</p>
               <p>God ſaue vs from Princes that will vſe like vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and tyrannie towarde our Landes, goods, and bodies, as theſe men vſe to the worde of God. I haue not as yet noted vnto you (good Chriſtians)
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:19124:113"/>
the very grounde of this corrupt interpretation of the doctrine of Chriſt, and the miſchiefe that is hid vnder it. I pray you therefore conſider, to vvhome doth Chriſt ſpeake in al thoſe places of his doctrine before mentioned? Whome doeth he teach? whom doth he inſtruct, that they ſhoulde not hoarde vp treaſure vpon earth? that they may not ſerue God and Mammon? that they may not bee carefull what to eate and what to drinke? that they muſt ſell all that they haue and followe him? that they muſt renounce all that they haue if they will bee his true Diſciples? And laſtly that they muſt yeelde to Caeſar that which is Caeſars? Are theſe things ſpoken to Miniſters onely? doeth Chriſts doctrine pertaine to Biſhops and Miniſters onely? Is it his will that they onely ſhoulde followe his godly inſtructions and commaundements? Then of likelihoode, as hee came onely to teach Miniſters, and to bee exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life to them alone: ſo hee came to ſaue Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters onely. But what a wicked vanitie were it ſo to ſpeake or thinke?</p>
               <p>Now if Chriſtes doctrine bee generall to all the faithfull, as in deede it is: (that beeing the true interpretation that they vvoulde haue to bee) it muſt of necesſitie followe, that no true Chriſtian can keepe landes and poſſesſions, nor abide in any wealthie or rich eſtate: which is the very ground of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> doctrine, as all learned men do know. In ſo much, that all the famous men, that in this our age haue expounded the Scriptures, or written againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſtes,</hi> doe note, that by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the ſpeeches of Chriſt before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, they doe grounde their communitie, and taking away of proprietie and poſſeſsion of goods,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:19124:113"/>
with ſundry like other doctrines. We may ſee ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp; it is time to take heed of it, how ſatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnder pretences ſeeketh to thruſt the ſpirit of the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> &amp; the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of their learning into this church of <hi>England.</hi> The inconuenience then of this kinde of reaſoning is, either, that theſe ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the goſpel touch biſhops and miniſters only, and all other are left free, which is a very great abſurditie: or els that the ſame doctrine gathered out of theſe places in the ſame ſenſe that they vſe, doth belong to al chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which with the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> taketh away al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie &amp; poſſeſſions of lands &amp; goods, &amp; (as I haue before ſaide) bringeth in a Platonicall community. I ſay not, that they which vſe theſe places do meane it: but ſurely that inconuenience &amp; danger follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon it. Therefore, they that haue any feare of God, ought to take heed, that their immoderat ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack &amp; affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt biſhops &amp; other miniſters, do not ouermuch blind them, &amp; carry them away, either to the affirming, or to the maintening of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and dangerous doctrines, both to the Church and commonwealth. If this their doctrine ſpread in libels, ſhall once become familiar vnto the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people of this Realme: it may happily breed ſuch a ſcab and dangerous ſore, as all the cunning in this land will ſcant be able to heale it. God ſend grace, that heede may be taken thereof in time.</p>
               <p>They wil ſay (I know) That this is but a ſhift of Logike that the falſe ſophiſters the biſhops do vſe to turne the matter from themſelues, when they ſay, that this doctrine of Chriſt pertaineth to al Chriſtians, aſwell as to them: &amp; will aske me how they will auoid thoſe plain &amp; euident words that Chriſt ſpeaketh to his Apoſtles and diſciples only, when he ſendeth
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:19124:114"/>
them abroad two and two, to preach the kingdome of God. This (ſay they) doth belong to Miniſters and Preachers only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As ye go, preach, ſaying, that the kingdome of heauen is</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Luke 9.</note> 
                  <hi>toward your iourney, neither two coates, neither ſhooes, nor yet a ſtaffe, For the workman is worthy of his meate.</hi> Theſe words, I muſt confeſſe, do not appertaine generally to al chriſtians, no more do they generally to al mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters &amp; preachers of al times &amp; places. Is it euil in it ſelfe to haue golde or ſiluer? or to haue a ſtaffe on the way to walke with? or to weare ſhoes to ſaue his feet in iourneying? I think there is no chriſtian that will ſo iudge. Chriſt himſelfe had a purſe, wherein <hi>Iudas</hi> caryed mony for his prouiſion, &amp; he ſuffered certaine rich women to go with him, &amp; to miniſter to him &amp; to his diſciples. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo bare a ſworde, &amp; ware ſandalles on his feete, when the Angell bade him put on his ſandalles. And <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,</hi> willeth him to bring his cloake with him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though vndoubtedly hee had an other garment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We muſt conſider then what it is that Chriſt in this place meaneth, ſeeing neither himſelfe nor his Apoſtles did obſerue it according to the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the letter.</p>
               <p>There be ſome that ſay theſe precepts be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and for a time onely, not generall or perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: for that which goeth before may ſeeme to take away the continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of theſe precepts, <hi>Go not in the way of the Gentiles, but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> Which precept the Apoſtles at this time obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but afterward they preached the goſpel vnto al
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19124:114"/>
the nations of the earth: ſo doe they thinke, that Chriſt, for the time of this meſſage only, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to poſſeſſe no gold nor ſiluer, &amp;c. &amp; from thenceforth that this commandement was abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This interpretation I cannot reiect as euill, or not pertinent to the meaning of Chriſt. There bee alſo ſome hypocrites, &amp; Pope-holy perſons, which wil haue theſe precepts perpetuall, and build there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on friery &amp; monkiſh ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: They wil not touch any money: They wil weare no whole ſhooes: They wil not haue a ſtaffe to walk with, thinking that they ſhew themſelues the holy ſeruants of God therein. To this interpretation very nighly commeth that, which theſe men vſe to proue, that biſhops &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers may haue no lands nor poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nor riches, no nor money, further then will barely prouide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meat, and drinke, and cloth, &amp; whatſoeuer is aboue, to be of ſuperfluitie. Some other thinke, that Chriſt in thoſe words onely compareth the Ambaſſadors of other princes with his: as if hee had ſaide, I ſend you foorth to preach the kingdome of God: and the ſtate of an ambaſſade or meſſage doeth require, that I ſhould deliuer vnto you money, and all other like things conuenient for this voyage, as Princes vſe to their ambaſſadours: but deceyue not your ſelues: the maner of this meſſage is diuers from ſuch meſſages as ciuill princes vſe. In ciuill ambaſſades, great furniture (I know) is thought conuenient: but this meſſage of mine is ſuch, as nedeth no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſet it out. For the maieſtie of the thing it ſelfe, &amp; the myracles that you ſhal worke, ſhall ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue authoritie vnto it. This interpretation alſo I thinke not amiſſe: but in my opinion, &amp; that by the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19124:115"/>
iudgement of ſome other learned men, alſo the true &amp; ſimple meaning of Chriſt was, to teach his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to put their truſt &amp; whole confidence vpon the prouidence of God only, &amp; for the better perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would haue them at this time to make trial ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and by experience to learne, that though they haue nothing in the ſight of the world to feede the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to helpe or to defend them: yet that he will ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for them, if they continue in their vocation &amp; calling faithfully, that they ſhal want nothing: yea, that the fowles of the aire ſhall rather feed them the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they ſhould lacke ſuſtenance. That this was Chriſtes meaning, it may appeare in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> where he ſaith to his Apoſtles, <hi>When I ſent you forth without wallet or ſcrippe, or ſhooes, lacked you any thing? and they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaid, No. Then ſaid he vnto them, But now he that hath a wallet, let him take it vp, and he that hath none, let him ſell his coate and buy a ſword.</hi> The Apoſtles vndoubtedly had great need of this inſtruction, and to be taught to put their whole truſt in the prouidence of God, and to depende vpon that onely. For he did ſee that in the execution of their office they ſhoulde be caſt into all the difficulties of this worlde, which either Sathan or his miniſters were able to raiſe againſt them. This leſſon is very neceſſary alſo for all other chriſtians, but principally for the miniſters &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel, whenſoeuer God for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion &amp; teaching of his trueth ſhall caſt them into the like difficulties. For if they do not reſt vpon that onely, they ſhall finde lands, poſſeſſions, power, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, kinred, friendſhip, &amp; all other helps of this world, to be but as a broken ſtaffe to leane vnto.</p>
               <p>But what maketh this againſt that, that miniſters

Who ſeeth not (good Chriſtians) whereat theſe men ſhoote, and what ſtate of the Miniſterie, this earneſt zeale that now is pretended, woulde ſettle in this Church? that is, more miſerable and worſe prouided for, then any other ſtate of the lande be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.

What ſpirit this is therefore that would ſo hard ly pinch &amp; wring the miniſters of the church, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently to be gathered. The principall purpoſe at the beginning was, to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Miniſters might not by the word of God inioy any temporall lands: but now forſooth, through the goodneſſe of their cauſe, in the vehemencie of their reaſoning, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their proofe, it falleth out ſo, that Miniſters may not haue ſo much as any peny in their purſe to prouide them ſuſtenance: but muſt liue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable almes of the people, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with meat, drink, and apparel onely, as the Apoſtles did. For they are no ſpiritual men (ſay they) that haue temporall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Yea, of the very tithes they ought to claime no more, then may ſerue them to meat, drink, &amp; cloth. And if the ſame be denied them, they may not by law ſue for it. <hi>For if their coate be taken from them, they ſhould deliuer their clokealſo.</hi>

               <p>This doctrine doth very wel iuſtifie the couetous and vncharitable dealinges of many Pariſhioners, which partly by violence, partly by craftie meanes detaine from the Miniſters their portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of tithes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the lawe. This doctrine giueth good countenance to corrupt patrones, who wil not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow their benefices, but by compoſition of a good part of the fruits to their owne vſe &amp; commoditie. And when the liuing ſhall be worth 100. pounds by the yeere, they will aske, whether thirtie or fourtie pounds bee not a ſufficient portion for the Parſon? This dealing before time hath bin accounted little better then ſacrilege or ſimonie: but now it may be thought (if this doctrine be good &amp; allowable) that it is lawfully done, and according to the worde of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:19124:116"/>
God: yea, and that the miniſter is a couetous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and worthy great blame, that will not content himſelfe with ſuch a rate, as they willingly ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. What care they which thus reaſon haue, I wil not ſay of the preaching of the goſpel, but of the ſtate of learning and knowledge in the Church of Chriſt, all men may euidently perceiue. Either they iudge, as I haue before written at large, that men be Angels without corruption, and will followe the courſe of learning for conſcience ſake, though there be no hope of reward to allure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: or els they think, that God wil miraculouſly giue knowledge to ſuch as he ſhal incline to the Miniſtery, as hee did in the primitiue Church to his Apoſtles, and other.</p>
               <p>As touching the example of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared, what cauſe Chriſt reſpected in the chooſing of ſo poore Apoſtles, and leauing them in ſo baſe ſtate and condition of life: that is, that the worke of winning the whole world to the doctrine of ſaluation by ſo ſimple and poore inſtruments, as in the iudgement of men they ſeemed, might bee the greater glorie to God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing he did ſet them forth, and furniſh them vvith the heauenly riches of his holy ſpirite, that is to ſay, extraordinary knowledge, rare giftes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and povver to worke miracles.</p>
               <p>But vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this extraordinary dealing of God in the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of his church, to ground a general &amp; perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual rule, to bind the Miniſters of al places &amp; times, is ſuch maner vſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures, as muſt needs breed great inconueniences among the people of God.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this place applied. Remember the place: viewe the circumſtances: conſider what goeth before, and what commeth after, and you ſhall vnderſtand it to be true. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> there, ſpeaketh to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> that Chriſt doth <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. when he willeth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to bee carefull what to eate, what to drinke, or what to put on, but that they ſhould ſeeke the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and the righteouſneſſe thereof, and al other things ſhould by the prouidence of God bee caſt vnto them. So, I ſay, S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth men not to be in loue with the riches of this worlde, which they ſhal neuer cary away with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhould not practiſe wicked waies to gaine, but accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines their chiefe gaine &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, holding them-ſelues contented with thoſe things that the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of nature requireth, that is, foode, &amp; apparel: For whatſoeuer is aboue that, may ſeeme to be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. This wholeſome doctrine, the ſpirit of God in the ſcriptures doth often caſt vpon the conſciences of Chriſtians, as a neceſſary bridle, to ſtay the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked affection of couetouſnes &amp; greedy deſire of the world, wherto the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our nature is giuen. And yet he doeth not condemne riches, or a more plentifull life, as euill in it ſelfe. It is the heart, the minde, and the affection, that God would haue ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kept vnder in his obedience, and not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing of the externall creatures as before is at large declared. <hi>Iob</hi> in the middes of his greateſt wealth had as poore and as contented a heart, as he that had a ſmall liuing, and did no more exceede in gluttonie, or other riotous exceſſe, then hee did, which had not a peny more then to prouide meate,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19124:117"/>
drinke &amp; cloth. This doctrine, as it doeth generally pertaine to all Chriſtians: ſo I denie not, but it very nighly and chiefly ought to touch Preachers &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church. Wherfore I muſt &amp; do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that ſo much as our biſhops and Clergy want of the performance hereof, they want of that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that by the word of God they ſhould haue. But how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it be proued hereby, that they may not haue more ample or large alowance then ſhal ſuffice the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for neceſſarie foode &amp; apparell? In deed that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mind they ſhould haue, whenſoeuer God calleth them to that neceſſity, yea &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be in their wealthieſt ſtate that any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of a chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> common weale doth giue them, they ought not in thoſe things to exceed, but to keepe that moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that godlines requireth: &amp; whatſoeuer is aboue that, they are bound in conſcience to ſee godly and honeſtly beſtowed, or elſe they grieuouſly offende God, and giue euil example to other. This rule (as I haue ſaid) pertaineth in like maner to all chriſtians: and therfore it can no more follow vpon this, that the lands &amp; liuings of miniſters muſt be taken from them, becauſe it bringeth ſuperfluitie vnto them, and more then the neceſſitie of nature requireth, then you can conclude the ſame againſt all other Chriſtians that haue more ample lands and liuings then will ſuffice them to the like purpoſe. As I haue ſaid before, ſo ſay I now againe, If our biſhops &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clergy men, imploy the ouerplus of their large and plentifull liuings vnto euill and naughty vſes, neither I nor any other can therein defend them.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderſtanding of my aunſwere to theſe places, and of the imperfect manner of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19124:118"/>
vſed by the aduerſary: it behoueth to conſider, that God in his worde layeth downe a perfect mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his iuſtice, and an abſolute rule of that life that Chriſtians ſhoulde leade. As for example, when he ſaith in the Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with al thy heart, with all thy ſoule, with all thy mind, with all thy power, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe:</hi> This commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t requireth, that al the parts &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our ſoule inwardly, and our bodie &amp; goods outwardly, ſhoulde bee bent and giuen ouer to the ſetting foorth of the glory of God. Our <hi>heart</hi> is the roote of our affections: therefore we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to loue or hate nothing, to feare or hope for nothing, to deſire or ſhun nothing, not to be ſorie for any thing, nor reioyce in any thing, but onely in God &amp; his glory. By our <hi>ſoule,</hi> is meant al the courſe of our life: our infancie, our yong age, our middle age, &amp; our old age. Wherfore in this it is required, that the whole time of our life, from the beginning of our birth to the houre of our death, ſhoulde bee imployed to the ſeruice of God. Our <hi>mind</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth our reaſon and vnderſtanding: ſo that by that branch, we are taught that our vnderſtanding, our reaſon, &amp; all the cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our mind ſhould be occupied in nothing, but in the loue of God. Our <hi>power</hi> noteth al the ſtrength and ſences of our body, and the abilitie of worldly ſubſtance and outwarde gifts of God. So that there is nothing apperteining to vs, either inwardly, or outwardly, (as I haue ſaid) but God wholly requireth the ſame to his ſeruice: and if wee doe faile therein, we offende his iuſtice, and want of that perfect rule of life that is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto vs: Inſomuch, that if the mercie of God in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:19124:118"/>
Chriſt our Sauiour helpe not, wee deſerue for the ſame euerlaſting damnation. To the declaration of the latter part of this rule, <hi>that wee ſhoulde loue our neighbour as our ſelfe,</hi> appertaineth the doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 5. that wee ſhould not ſo much as once be mooued with anger toward our neighbour, that we ſhould not looke vpon a woman to luſt after her, that wee ſhoulde not onely loue our neighbour as our ſelfe, but that we ſhould loue our enemies, bleſſe them that curſe vs, doe good to them that hate vs, pray for them that perſecute vs, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for our money, lands, goods, and poſſeſſions, we ſhould haue our mindes ſo little giuen to them, and our hearts ſo ſmally ſet vpon them, that we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all ſhould care for them further, then that they may be vnto vs, either inſtruments of vertue, or neceſſary helps of our fraile life. Yea, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo nigh, nothing ſo deere vnto vs by Chriſtes rule, eyther eye, or hande, or foote, or whatſoeuer it bee, but we ſhoulde cut it off, and caſt it from vs, if it be a let or hinderance vnto vs to enter into the kingdom of God. Finally, our bodies being here in this vale of miſerie, our minds, and hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſations ſhould be in heauen: <hi>they that haue wiues,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>as though they had none: they that weepe, as though they wept not: they that reioyce, as though they reioyced not: they that buy, as though they poſseſſed not: they that vſe this world, as though they vſed it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this rule of chriſtian perfection, appertain all thoſe ſentences and exhortations of Chriſt &amp; of his apoſtles, which before you haue heard alledged, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all to this ende, to pull away the hearts of men from the loue of riches and care of this worlde, that they may ſet the ſame wholly vpon God. This rule
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19124:119"/>
is laid down not only for miniſters of the church, as though they only were the ſeruants of God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for al other faithful Chriſtians, whom it bindeth as ſtraitly as it doth the miniſters. For it is a marke, vnto which they both ſhould direct their whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours.</p>
               <p>They therfore that wil apply this rule to ſome one ſtate of men, and not to other, fall into like error as Monks &amp; Friers did, dreaming a more ſtraite order by God to be appointed to one, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to another. The Miniſter ſo much as he lacketh of this perfection, ſo much is he indebted and in danger vnto God: And if he flie not to the mercie of God purchaſed by the merite of Chriſt to waſh away that want &amp; imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, vndoubtedly there reſteth nothing, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation.</p>
               <p>Now, as I haue ſaide of the Miniſter, ſo muſt I ſay of al chriſtians beſide. Therfore out of this doctrine is no particular applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be made more to one ſtate then to another, but only this, that miniſters, becauſe of their calling, ſhould ſhew themſelues to come neerer to this marke, then other. Where the error in reſoning is, you may now by this perceiue, which conſiſteth in two points. Firſt, that the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the rule of chriſtian perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> generally giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all, are applied only to miniſters of the Church, as ſpeciall precepts to binde them: And ſecondly, that the perfourming of this rule is more imputed (as the monks &amp; friers did) to the outward refuſing of Gods creatures, then the brideling of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble contentation of the mind before God.</p>
               <p>By this corrupt maner of reaſoning in theſe days, are framed ſundry daungerous arguments againſt
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19124:119"/>
the ſtate of the Miniſtery here now with vs in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. As for example, Our Biſhops and Miniſters are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill men: they aunſwere not the perfect rule, that is preſcribed vnto them by the word of God: therefore they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, their ſtate altered, and their Lands and Liuings taken into the Princes hands, or be otherwiſe imployed as it ſhal be thought good.</p>
               <p>The daunger of this argument will be eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, if you apply the ſame to other ſtates, as thus: Princes, Magiſtrates and noble men are euil, they doe not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill that rule of right and perfect gouernment that the worde of God requireth: therefore pull them downe, ſet other in their places, or alter their ſtate cleane.</p>
               <p>This is a ſeditious and perillous argument, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when common and inferior ſubiects, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing authoritie, ſhall take vpon them to bee iudges in ſuch caſes, as nowe they doe againſt biſhops.</p>
               <p>With this manner of reaſoning (as I haue before noted) the Deuill filleth the heads and hearts of his troubleſome inſtrumentes, when hee intendeth to worke miſchiefe, either in the Church of God, or in the ſtate of any common weale.</p>
               <p>This maner of arguments they alwaies vſe, which for priuate reſpects, pretend generall reformations or alterations in the ſtate of a Church or countrey, wherein they liue. Let the Biſhops and Cleargie of England haue ſuch iudges and triall, as the word of God requireth, &amp; euer hath bin vſed in the Church of Chriſt: yea, or ſuch as other ſtates would thinke reaſonable and indifferent for themſelues in their calling: and then, on Gods name, let them abide the hazard of the ſentence eyther with them or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and the daunger of ſuch penaltie as in iuſtice and equitie may bee aſſigned. Another
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19124:120"/>
daungerous Argument is this: Biſhops &amp; Preachers by Chriſt are commaunded not to be careful for the world, not to hoord vp treaſures in earth, yea to renounce all they haue and follow Chriſt: therfore they ought not to haue any lands or Lordſhips, or great &amp; wealthie Liuings, but to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with meate, drinke &amp; cloth. &amp;c. The hardnes of this reaſon will be the better vnderſtanded, if the like be applied to ſome other perſons.</p>
               <p>Noble men and gentlemen, if they wil bee right and true Chriſtians, by Gods worde are commaunded not to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the worlde, not to hoord vp riches heere on the earth, yea to renounce all that they haue, and followe Chriſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may not haue ſo great and ample liuings more then other, but ſhall content themſelues vvith ſuch a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate portion, as may tollerably maynteine them, in ſeeing the adminiſtration of iuſtice in their countreys, and the refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due that nowe is ſpent in gaming and vnneceſſarie pompe, and vanitie of the worlde, to be imployed to the maintenance of a great nomber of the Princes ſubiects, and people of God, that are not able in meane eſtate to liue. For in ſuch caſe were the noble men and Gentlemen of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites called <hi>Principes familiarum,</hi> the Princes and chiefe of each tribe and familie among the people of God.</p>
               <p>A many of ſuch factious and ſeditious arguments may in like maner be framed, more meet for rebels, then for good ſubiects or faithful chriſtians, which I doe in this place for good conſiderations omitte. For if they ſhoulde bee ſo countenanced with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular allegations of the Scriptures, and furniſhed with ſuch learning and examples of hiſtories, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious heads are able to deuiſe: happily they would carrie as much credite, and drawe as a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of followers and mainteiners, as nowe the like
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19124:120"/>
dealing doeth againſt the Clergie. I will not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tarrie any longer in this point. I haue ſet forth vnto you an example or two nakedly and barely, to this ende onely, if it might be poſſible, to open the eyes of ſome, which ſeeme in part to be blinded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with affection againſt biſhops, or with a deſire to worke and bring to paſſe ſome ſpeciall drift and purpoſe that they haue deuiſed: for what cauſe, it may be more eaſily by wiſe men coniectured, then ſafely by me laid downe in writing.</p>
               <p>For the further examining of this matter, &amp; that it may be the better vnderſtanded, whether eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical men may with ſafe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences enioy the ſtate <note place="margin">How Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were mainteined from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</note> of their liuings by lands or no, Let vs briefly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condition of the Church, &amp; how Miniſters haue bin mainteined from the beginning, euen to this day. And here I muſt proteſt, that the Hiſtories and writers, eſpecially ſuch as bee of credite, are ſo imperfect in this point, as the trueth muſt bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by coniecture of certaine braunches, rather then by any diſcourſe in their writing.</p>
               <p>For the ſpace of the firſt three hundred yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, it is wel known to all ſuch as haue looked into the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, that it was almoſt in continuall perſecution vnder heathen tyrantes, which with all indeuour ſought meanes to oppreſſe Chriſtian Religion, and the true profeſſours therof. Wherefore in all that time it was not poſſible for the church to haue any ſetled ſtate, by Lands or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reuenevv to maintaine the Miniſters thereof: but they were ſuſtained onely by the liberal contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of godly perſons, collected at certaine times for that and other like Chriſtian vſes.</p>

it pleaſed God to giue peace vnto it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outward &amp; Heatheniſh enemies: and yet in the meane time had it other tempeſtes and bitter ſtormes of aduerſitie, that did more hinder deuotion and godlineſſe, then the bloody perſecutions of the Emperours did: as namely the troubles raiſed by the <hi>Aria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> heretikes, by the ſpace of many yeres, &amp; eſpecially in <hi>Aſia, Greece,</hi> and al the Eaſt parts of the world.

looke into things with partiall eies, &amp; ſeeke rather a ſecret furthering of priuat purpoſes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true cauſes of that, wherof they ſpeake. For they that will indifferently conſider the ſtates of times, &amp; with true iudgement weigh the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of them, may eaſily diſcerne, that it was not the vvealth of the Clergy, but other cauſes of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vveight and importance, that ſet vp Antichriſt aloft in his throne, and wrought him the dominion of the church, which I pray God may be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looked vnto amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs, then yet I perceiue that they haue bene: eſpecially if we meane ſo earneſtly to keepe away from vs the returne of his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as many now would ſeeme to do.</p>
               <p>The firſt cauſe that aduaunced Antichriſt, was <note place="margin">The true cauſes that ſet vp Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Schiſme and here ſie in the Church,</hi> for the ſpace of 200. yeres and more, together with the barbarous irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which before I ſpake of. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cauſe was, <hi>the generall decay of learning,</hi> &amp; eſpecially of <hi>the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures, and of the tongues.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>the vſurpation of Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline,</hi> practiſed againſt Emperours and Princes, by which hee conquered more then by all other meanes. The helping cauſes to theſe principall, were theſe two: firſt, the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the vnskilfulneſſe, the vnworthineſſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny emperors and gouernours, giuen ouer rather to wantonneſſe and voluptuous pleaſures, then to the care of their charge: and ſecondly, the ſuperſtitious deuotion of the people, maintained by corrupt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But the graund cauſe of al cauſes was, <hi>the iuſt iudgement of God,</hi> for the generall vnthankfulneſſe of the worlde, in receiuing the knowledge of his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which he ſent among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:19124:124"/>
And this cauſe was vniuerſall in all eſtates and kindes of perſons, as well eccleſiaſticall as other. The biſhoppes and Miniſters were giuen ouer to maintaine factions and hereticall doctrines: Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces looked more to their ſenſuall pleaſure, then to the godly gouernment of their ſubiects: the people were bent wholly to ſuperſtition and wickednes of life, ſo that (a ſmal number only excepted) none did ſtudy howe in life and godly conuerſation, to frame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the good &amp; wholeſome doctrine of the Goſpel, which at the hand of many godly men, they at the beginning had receiued. Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry of theſe or the like cauſes haue we now alſo growing &amp; encreaſing among vs: and therfore haue we great cauſe to feare the like iuſt iudgement of God, that eyther ſhal caſt vs againe vnder the tyrannie of Antichriſt, or bring vpon vs ſome plague no leſſe grieuous then that is.</p>
               <p>Our miniſters and Preachers breake out to Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall factions and curious doctrines. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in ſteed of ſuperſtitious deuotion, haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued an heatheniſh contempt of Religion, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull loathing of the miniſters thereof. Vice and wickedneſſe ouerwhelmeth all ſtates and conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of men. None almoſt, vnleſſe it bee ſome that God reſerueth to his ſecrete knowledge, ſtudie to ſhew themſelues thankfull to God, and in life to expreſſe that, which in doctrine they will ſeeme to approue. I pray God, that by abuſing this long ſuffering of the Lorde, we heape not vp wrath for our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of wrath. God hath dealt as merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with this land, as euer hee did with any. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him, that in time we may repent with <hi>Niniue,</hi> and turne to him in ſackcloth and aſhes, while hee
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:19124:124"/>
may bee founde, and while hee ſtretcheth vnto vs the hande of his gracious goodneſſe, leaſt when it is too late, and hee hath turned his face from vs, we crie vnto him with vaine gronings, and mourne with vnprofitable ſighings. Hee ſent the light of his trueth into this Realme, firſt in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and brake the power of Antichriſt among vs: but becauſe hee ſawe neyther thankefull receyuing of the Goſpell, nor any thing ſtudied for by men generally, but the benefite of Abbey lands, and poſſeſſions, to enrich them-ſelues: hee by and by cut off the comfortable ſweetneſſe of his worde, with the bitter ſauour of the ſixe articles, and ſharp perſecution of them that profeſſed true religion.</p>
               <p>His iuſtice in deede coulde no longer abide the full ripeneſſe of the ſuperſtition, idolatrie, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life of the Monkes and Friers, and ſuch other ſwarms of Antichriſtian impietie: but our vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes deſerued not to haue the ſame turned to our benefite, nor the freedome of his Goſpel to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued among vs to our further comfort.</p>
               <p>In the time of that gracious Prince king <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, hee gaue vs a larger taſte of his word and a greater freedome of all points of ſound &amp; true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine, to our vneſtimable benefite, if wee could haue receiued it accordingly. But euen then alſo, hee perceiued, that wee ſought not ſo much the increaſe of his glory, or to frame our liues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our profeſſion, as wee did ſtudie vnder countenance of religion, by al meanes we could, to worke againe our owne worldly benefit &amp; commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.

vs that heauie ſcourge of perſecution, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly followed, keeping vs vnder the rodde of his correction by the ſpace of certaine yeeres.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, as a mercifull Father, declaring that by his chaſtening he ſought not our confuſion but our amendment, euen for the glory of his names ſake onely, beyond all hope &amp; expectation, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vs againe the light of his countenance, and that more fauourably &amp; bountifully then euer he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, raiſing for vs as it were out of the duſt of death, a noble Queene, a gratious Prince, as a nurſe or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectreſſe of his church: Vnder the ſhadow of whoſe wings, although but a virgine, he keepeth vs in great ſafetie &amp; quietneſſe, againſt al the ancient enemies, both of his church, &amp; of our natural countrey.

               <p>By this that I haue written, as I doubt not but the godly may perceiue it was not riches and vvealth of the Cleargie that firſt ſet vp Antichriſt in the vſurped throne of his dominion ouer the Church, but that there vvere other more true and right cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

that bredde that miſchiefe: ſo likewiſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that feareth God, and vvithout affection looketh into the ſtate of this time among vs, and rightly weigheth and conſidereth thinges, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily iudge, that it is not the Lands and great liuings of biſhops &amp; Eccleſiaſticall perſons, but other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, more heynous &amp; more grieuous, that wil haſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wrath &amp; diſpleaſure of God againſt this realme, which indeed, it behoueth biſhops principally, and all other in their ſtates and conditions to haue care of, and in time, while wee may, by all godly meanes to preuent it.</p>
               <p>The affection of them, which at this day ſpeak ſo much againſt the Landes and liuinges of Biſhops, and other Cleargy men, is much like the dealing of thoſe perſons, that murmured againſt <hi>Marie</hi> of <hi>Bethania,</hi> which in the houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the leper, in teſtimonie of her thankfulneſſe, for the great mercies that ſhee had receiued of Chriſt, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon his head the precious oyntment of Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde. For euen in like manner our gracious Queene, vvhen God had deliuered her out of the iawes of the greedie Lyons, and cruell wolues that ſought her blood, and by his mighty hande had ſet her in the throne of this her Fathers kingdome: to teſtifie her thankefull minde, and to ſhewe her liberall and bountifull heart towarde the Church of GOD, ſhee powred vpon it this plentifull gift, towarde the maintenance of the Miniſters and Preachers of his woorde, that ſhee might declare to the worlde, that in imbracing the Goſpel, and reſtoring the ſame to this Realme, ſhee had not that minde and affection, which ſome other haue

ſhewed, that is, vnder colour thereof, to make the increaſe of her owne benefite, and the commoditie of her Crowne. But as then <hi>Iudas</hi> and ſome other Diſciples murmured at <hi>Marie,</hi> and vnder pretence of holineſſe and charitie towarde the poore, found great fault with that ſuperfluous exceſſe (as they thought it) euen ſo nowe, many Diſciples among vs, with like colour of religion and holineſſe, and of zeale towarde the perfection of the Church (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) murmure at the liberal benefit of our prince, which ſhe hath beſtowed vpon the Church, &amp; think the ſame a great ſuperfluitie, that might bee better imployed ſundry wayes, to the benefite of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale.
