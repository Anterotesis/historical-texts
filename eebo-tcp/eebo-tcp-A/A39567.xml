            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IT would grieve a Man to think how many's Curioſity will tempt them
to buy this Paper; how few's Conſideration will lead them to make uſeful
Application of it to themſelves; how many more will, through a vainly
cenſorious Wit, charge the Publiſhing this Letter, as a Trick to pick
Pockets; how few's Wiſdom will conduct them to fall in with the direct Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
it hath to enrich and ennoble their Minds; whilſt moſt, it's to be fear'd,
read ſuch things with no more concern, than Perſons in Health, read Quack-Doctors
Bills, and make no better uſe of them. <hi>Yet he that hath an Ear
to hear let him hear;</hi> this Letter ſpeaks by ſtrong Conſequence at leaſt, to the
higheſt concerns of Mankind in general, it lays open Mens greateſt Miſtakes
about, and miſconducts of them: Oh that they were wiſe, that there were in all that
ſhall read, an heart to conſider this. In this Letter is wrap'd up moſt ſuitable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions
to the Youth of theſe Kingdoms, to conſider thoroughly of, and engage
themſelves heartily in their Baptiſmal Covenant. It gives an awakening
Alarm to negligent Parents, to inſtruct their Children in, and conduct them
diligently into the Paths of Heavenly Wiſdom, leſt they deeply mourn at laſt,
(as this poor Woman did) their fatal Cruelty to their Childrens Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This Letter ſuggeſts a Warning to Adulterers and Adultereſſes, to repent of,
and forſake their Crimes, leſt God bring them to repent by open ſhame, as he did
this poor Creature, or ſuffer them to go on in a covert way to Hell. It's a Cry
after the Backſliders in heart, thoſe who have had ſtrong Convictions, taken
up good Reſolutions, and follow'd them for a while, with a courſe of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but are return'd with the Dog to his Vomit; that they return to God
from whom they have fallen, leſt he in Judgment give them up to commit
enormous Sins, to fali under diſmal Puniſhments, yea, the moſt diſmal of all,
final Impenitency. Here's a diſcharge to all their Hopes of the Favour of
God and everlaſting Life, who are but formal, hypocritical, heartleſs Pretenders
to Religion, till their Hearts are renew'd, as well as the Face of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
reform'd. And who amongſt the diſſolute, profane and profligate
part of Mankind, can ſay, but here's a moſt paſſionate Cry to them that break
and ſhake off the fatal Chains wherein the Devil is leading them down to the
Chambers of Eternal Death? In ſhort, there's that in this Letter, which
may lead all to the moſt intimately acquainting themſelves with their own
Mortality. There's that by which, all Perſons may determine, whether they
belong to the Kingdom of Light, or that of Darkneſs; the Letter of a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:52428:3"/>
Perſons Tryal of the Truth and Life of her Repentance, Faith, Love and
Obedience. Reader, will you not uſe what you have bought? do you know all
this Letter tells you already? Oh be perſuaded now to fall a doing it. Will
you cenſure it as being above theſe Children? Oh caſt it not away as if it
were below you; it was calculated as a Guide to them thro' their Lives. Will
you charge it as too wordy? Oh confute not your charge, by making it appear
there are not Words enow to perſuade you to become Pious. Well, when the
Teſtament of our Dying Jeſus, nay, his laſt charge in that Teſtament, <hi>Do
this in Remembrance of me,</hi> prevails ſo little with Chriſtians, what Effects
ſhall we hope for, from the words of a Dying Malefactor, recommending him
to the World ſhe has ſo lately left? Yet canst not thou Oh God, that cauſeſt
Gibbets to preach, make the moſt Refractory of Rebels hear? You that will not
hearken to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, will you not
hear, tho' one is here rais'd from the Dead, a living Witneſs to the great Truth
they taught? Was ſhe not dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins? Was ſhe not made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
to God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt think you, before ſhe dy'd to Nature? Hear
her then, Chriſt Jeſus by her, that your Souls may live. Open thou the Ears
Oh God, that are deaf to the Voice of Charms. Is not Judgment thy ſtrange
Work! Oh then Reform Multitudes by the Chaſtiſement of this one Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
who will otherwiſe by their Rebellions, run themſelves into great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
in this World, if not alſo into everlaſting Miſery in the next: Well,
whether any Perſon that reads this Letter, will give a practical regard to it or
no, this is certain, it will barden where it does not ſoften. They are a Degree
nearer Hell by refuſing, who don't advance towards Heaven by embracing
its Inſtructions. And if ever they repent, their ſlight of this Counſel, will
yield them a moſt bitter Reflection; or if they never repent, this reflex Advice
will add to the Smart of their Eternal Vexations in the World they're poſting
to, of Horrour and Deſpair.</p>
            <p>As to that man who had the firſt and principal hand in this Womans and
her Infants Tragedy, I would deſire ſome Neighbours (ſuppoſing he'll ſcarce
take pains to read this) to ask him ſeriouſly ſome ſuch Queſtions as theſe.
Whether he did not act the Devils part, when he tempted this Woman as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
our Saviour, to purchaſe a Supply for the cravings of her Nature, by a
Crime tending to the Ruin of her Soul? Whether he that ſerves the Devil in
his Life, and repents not, is not like to fall into his Condemnation and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
hands at Death? Whether he believes God has commanded <hi>Thou ſhalt
not commit Adutery?</hi> If he does not, whether he believes, or can prove the
Chriſtian World Fools, or Madmen, who alſo thus believe it? Whether God
has not own'd this Command, as often in Hiſtory, ſo now by avenging the
Breach of it, in this his fellow Criminals Death? This were eaſily argued,
tho' ſhe was Condemn'd at mans Barr for another Crime. But if he believes
God has forbidden Adultery, whether he thinks God will always bear with
him, in the violating the plain Letter of his Laws? Whether he that being
often reprov'd hardens his heart, ſhall not ſuddenly be deſtroy'd, and that
<pb facs="tcp:52428:3"/>
without Remedy? Whether he does not flatter himſelf with a ſecret Thought
of future Repentance? Whether it be not his beſt, and may not happen to be
his only time to repent now? or if he has no thought of Repentance, how he
can think to dwell with devouring Flames, or everlaſting Burnings?</p>
            <p>And as to the Neighbourhood of this poor Woman, if the Judgments of God
abroad in the World ſhould teach the Inhabitants of the Earth Righteouſneſs,
ſurely then this Judgment of God, fallen upon one amongſt you, whom you
knew, with whom you convers'd, is now clearly deſign'd by God to teach you
Righteouſneſs. Think it not a Warning to you againſt the particular Crimes
for which ſhe dy'd only: Tho I dare affirm it poſitively, you are not ſecure of
your ſelves, that you ſhall not commit the Crimes, or worſe than thoſe for
which ſhe dy'd; till you get your Hearts renew'd and chang'd, as ſhe has
ſhew'd you in the Tryal of her ſelf. No, nor are you then ſecure of avoiding
the commiſſion of ſuch enormous Crimes, but in your cloſe walking with God,
and thro' Faith on Jeſus, receiving continual Supplies of Grace and Strength
from him to reſiſt Temptations. Did not <hi>David</hi> commit Adultery and
Murder? Was not this Woman as Religious as moſt of you? Did not ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inly
out go many of you? Will you not be warn'd by her Fall then, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
your ſelves with a Form of Religion, without the Power of Godlineſs?
But I would chiefly apply my ſelf to you on the behalf of her poor deſtitute
Children. The Law of the Nation exacts from you the care of their Bodies,
does not the Law of God under ſeveral Penalties, require you to take care of
their Souls? Are not their Souls more valuable than their Bodies? Are not
you become as Parents to theſe poor Orphans? The caſe of Orphans and Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
is deplorable. Pariſhes indeed, take care to place them out where they
may learn a ſlaviſh way of living at the cheapeſt rates, but ſeldom conſider
whether they'll be carefully inſtructed in the Fear, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouſly conducted in the
ways of God where they have plac'd them; a Cruelty indeed (Oh monſtrous)
many religious Perſons are guilty of towards their Children. The beſt Trade
and moſt knowing worldly Maſter is all their enquiry. Will you be ſo cruel to
theſe Childrens Souls? know if you be, their Blood will God require at your hands.
But whilſt I ſpeak to all, I'm afraid leſt none will think themſelves concern'd.
Are there none amongſt you that have devoted your ſelves to Chriſt Jeſus in
an everlaſting Covenant, and Love him in Sincerity? I apply my ſelf to you
in Chriſts words, <hi>Feed theſe his Lambs.</hi> Of ſuch little children as thoſe of
this Womans, with you are the Kingdom of Heaven; are they not Chriſts
Members whilſt they are yet devoted to him in Vertue of their Mothers Faith?
Will not God reward your labour of Love towards them? Will they not be
Bleſſings to the Families, to the Town they ſhall live in, and an Honour too,
if you endeavour to bring them up to the Practice of their Mothers Precepts?
Take care her Children learn to read, learn the Catechiſm; read to them,
and preſs upon them this their Mothers Laſt Will concerning them. Don't
ſtick at a little charge or trouble to do them good. Will any thing pleaſe you
but the good you have done with what you had, when you come to dye? Will
<pb facs="tcp:52428:4"/>
any thing diſpleaſe you then but that you have done ſo little! And I beg leave
to mind you of an Obligation, which, however to you it may ſeem ſmall or
none at all, yet by God perhaps, is accounted no ſmall one upon you, to be kind
to thoſe poor Children. Who knows how far your Uncharitableneſs hiding
your ſelves from your own Fleſh, from this poor Womans Wants, contributed
to the ſtrength of that Temptation which brought her to that Sin and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which have left theſe Children Motherleſs. It was for want of Bread
ſhe ſaid: If her Modeſty did make her aſham'd to beg, did not her meagre Look,
her ſtarved Children, her meanly furniſh'd Houſe and Table beg from you,
ſhou'd you not have anſwered this ſilent Prayer by Charity? Tho you did not
do it then, ſhew your Repentance now in ſhewing a more bountiful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Kindneſs to her Children. This way God has left open for you. I
wiſh all Pariſhes might by theſe Conſiderations, be brought more narrowly to
inſpect the State of their poor Neighbours, and conſequently to adminiſter to
them. Some noiſie poor are maintain'd in their Idleneſs, whilſt other modeſt
poor are ſtarv'd in the midſt of their Labours.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, from this Womans Crime and Puniſhment, may we be brought
firmly to believe, <hi>Except we repent we ſhall all likewiſe periſh:</hi> May they
that think they ſtand, <hi>take heed leſt they fall:</hi> May all hear and fear, and do
no more wickedly.</p>

of Mary Goodenough, at the Aſſizes held in Oxon,
in February 1691-92.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MAry Goodenough</hi> Widow, aged about 40 years, liv'd at <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
in the County of <hi>Oxon.</hi> Being in great Poverty and
Straits, even to the want of Bread for her and hers; ſhe
was ſeduc'd by a neighbouring <hi>Baker,</hi> (reported Infamous
for like Practices with others,) thro' his Promiſes of ſome Allowance
towards her neceſſary Maintenance, to the commiſſion of Adultery
with him who was a marry'd Man: She becoming with Child by him,
concealed it to her time of Travel, which, when ſhe fell into, ſhe alſo
conceal'd under pretence of Sickneſs, till on the 3d. day, 2 or 3 Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
ſuſpecting the matter, came to her, and upon ſearch, preſently
diſcovered by her Breaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſhe had had a Child. Upon their
charging it, ſhe immediately own'd and directed them to the Infant,
which lay wrap'd up in a Blanket at her Feet in the Bed dead. She had
a Son about 7 years old, and a Daughter about 11, whom ſhe ſhut out
of the Room in the time of her Labour: The Daughter told the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
ſhe heard her Mother cry out. About Ten days after her Travel,
ſhe was brought to <hi>Oxon,</hi> committed Priſoner to the Caſtle, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the end of <hi>February,</hi> being about a Month after her Committ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſhe was brought forth and Try'd before Judge <hi>Ayres,</hi> at the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes
there: The Witneſses, (who were the Neighbours above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd)
depos'd the Matter of Fact, as above declar'd; and ſhe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
the Purport of it, and particularly that ſhe call'd not out for
Help, as alſo with relation to the Child afterwards, That it periſh'd for
want of ſuitable Help and due Attendance; ſo that upon the whole
Matter, ſhe was juſtly Convicted of Murder, and receiv'd Sentence of
Death. Together with which, when the Judge pronounced it, he told
her with a moſt becoming Concern and judicious Piety, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<hi>That ſhe had committed Murder, where even Nature, as well as the
Laws of God and of the Land, one would have thought, ſhould have bound up
her Hands, and ſo had drawn the deepeſt Charge of Blood upon her Soul; that
from Mans Law nor Gods, there was no eſcape for her natural Life; quoting
her that Paſſage,</hi> He that ſheds Mans Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be
ſhed; <hi>And the Statute Law of this Realm to her Caſe. Yet in Anſwer to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52428:5"/>
her vehement Cries for Mercy from him, he directed her to God, as being
gracious, merciful and ready to forgive the Guilt of that, and all her Sins
which would bind her over to a great Tribunal, and more diſmal Sentence;
and perſuaded her to apply her ſelf to the Blood of the Everlaſting Covenant,
which could waſh out the deepeſt Stains, and diſſolve the ſtrongeſt Guilt of
her Sins.</hi> Whilſt ſhe lay under Sentence of Death, ſhe was with Care
and Diligence, attended by the Ordinary, Mr. <hi>Blackbourn,</hi> (Miniſter of
<hi>Cairfax</hi> in <hi>Oxon</hi>) to her laſt hour; he inſtructed her in the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
frequently pray'd with her, and gave her the Sacrament on the
Sabbath-Day, which was the very day before ſhe dy'd; ſhe giving good
Evidences of her Repentance. She was alſo during this time, viſited
by the Nonconforming Miniſter in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who from the <hi>Wedneſday</hi>
before her Death, had daily Conferences with her. In his 3 firſt
Conferences, he moſt induſtriouſly apply'd himſelf to lead her into an
affecting Senſe of the <hi>Sinfulneſs of her Nature, the Sinfulneſs of every Sin,
to bring her to an humbling Reflection upon all the Sins of her paſt Life
before God, as alſo to ſhew her the fearful Conſequences of an unpardon'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renew'd
State; ſtill interweaving the comfortable Doctrins of the Goſpel.</hi>
One particular reſult of theſe Conferences, was her ſending for him on
the <hi>Fryday</hi> before ſhe dy'd, and acknowledging with great Remorſe,
that ſhe had been convinc'd of her Duty towards God, by the Famous
Mr. <hi>Birch,</hi> late of <hi>Burford;</hi> and had reſolv'd on thoſe Convictions, to
live more Piouſly, and accordingly endeavoured it. But in ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of time, had baffled them, and returned to her former Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in Religion, Forgetfulneſs of God and of her Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the two
laſt Conferences, the Miniſter proceeded to make more particular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to her, concerning her cloſing with the Offers of Pardon and
Salvation, on the Terms and Grounds of the Goſpel Covenant, which
ſhe profeſs'd her Readineſs to imbrace: But he admitted it not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the moſt trying Search he cou'd poſſibly make into the Nature and
Grounds of her profeſs'd Conſent, that ſhe might not be impos'd upon
as to her Eternal Eſtate: She aſwer'd the moſt trying Queſtions with
great Sincerity, and to the great Satisfaction of the Miniſter, who alſo
pray'd with her at theſe Conferences: Moſt of the Priſoners attended
uſually whilſt he diſcours'd her, and it was hop'd, ſome of them, to
good purpoſe. The Night before ſhe dy'd, ſhe was obſervably more
Chearful in her Countenance, more Free and at Liberty in her Speech,
and more Satisfy'd in her Condition, than ever ſhe had ſhewed before.
She ſaid ſhe had been under Clouds and Darkneſs, but God had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
her the Light of his Countenance. She Bleſſed God <hi>that had caus'd
her Iniquities to find her out, elſe, ſaid ſhe, I might have gone on in my Sin,
ſmother ſmother, till I had fallen into Hell.</hi> And this ſhe did with Signal
Demonſtration, that ſhe had a chearful and ſenſible Feeling of what ſhe
ſaid. When ſhe was ask'd what ſhe would have pray'd for for her, ſhe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52428:5"/>
anſwer'd greater Aſſurance of Gods Love, but Bleſſed God for good
Hopes thro' Grace. To the Pious Advice and Fervent Prayers in this
her Letter to, and for her Children, I am perſuaded none of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders,
can from their Hearts, witneſs any leſs, than that ſhe gave
her Heart as well as Hand, the Night before ſhe was Executed. This
was her own Project and Deſire, and ſhe did then moſt Sollicitouſly
beg of God that he would give her a Mouth of Courage, to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might be for his Glory, and the good of their Souls who
ſhould come to ſee her dye. And when ſhe was put upon writing to the
man who had drawn her into this Wickedneſs and Shame, ſhe was
more than willing, nay, ſeemingly, deſirous to have ſomething writ
to him; Tho' ſhe ſaid ſhe fear'd he was ſo hardened in that Sin, it
would not reclaim him: And tho' he neither came to ſee, nor ſent to
her, neither took any manner of Care of, or ſhew'd any Pity towards
her, after ſhe was in this Diſtreſs: But want of time prevented a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to him. When ſhe came to the Gallows in the <hi>Caſtle-Yard</hi> at <hi>Oxon,</hi>
at about 6 of the Clock on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, being the 7th. of <hi>March,</hi>
1691-92. ſhe ſaid, or did little there but dy'd; only beg'd of the People
to be warn'd againſt her Sins, by her ſhameful and untimely End. And
indeed, without a Miracle almoſt, it could not be expected ſhe ſhould
ſay much more; for ſhe muſt needs be in great Confuſion and Surprize,
who in leſs <hi>than Two Months time,</hi> was Committed, Try'd, Condemn'd
and Executed for her Crime. Beſides, ſhe ſeem'd never to have had
any great Faculty or Freedom of Speech; and farther, the Fatigue and
hard Fare of a Priſon, to one that kept the Two Thirds of her Lying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Month there, had mightily weakened her, and impaired her Spirits;
tho' ſhe declar'd to one that carried her ſome Victuals, ſhe eat them out
of Conſcience; Looking upon it, as a Duty required of her by God,
to ſupport her Nature for the ſhort ſpace of time ſhe had to live. In
ſhort, tho' ſhe dy'd without ſuch outward Demonſtrations of it as ſome
have done, yet there are few or none that ſaw the laſt Scenes of the laſt
day of her Life, but muſt own ſhe appeared to have a great Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Sin, a ſtrong Love to Holineſs upon her Heart, and a ſincere
Deſire to propagate them both in others. Her Character amongſt her
Neighbours, was a Quiet, Honeſt, Civil, Harmleſs, Poor Woman;
yea, Religious too, before this Fact: And thus you have ſeen what
was neceſſary to lead you clearly into this her following Letter of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to her Children, and to Recommend it to you, as being the Advice
of a Dying Penitent.</p>

                     <salute>My Dear and Loving Children,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IT is no ſmall addition to my Troubles, that I cannot ſee and ſpeak
to you before I go hence and be no more in the Land of the Living;
eſpecially conſidering how wanting I have been towards you: I
would moſt willingly have endeavoured to do that for you at my
Death, which I have hitherto neglected. I am now forced to take
this way of Writing, and to beg the help of another Hand, my own
Hand being as my Heart is, trembling; and my confuſed Head unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of expreſſing what I deſire to impart to, and impreſs upon you.
I leave nothing in this World with ſo much Grief and Trouble, as you
my poor Children, and it greatly aggravates my Sorrow, that my Sin
ſhortens my time with you in this World: As I have hainouſly ſin'd
againſt God and my own Soul, againſt him whoſe Body, and her whoſe
Bed, I joyn'd in defiling; and againſt the Life of that unhappy Infant,
which I took not care to preſerve; So have I alſo offended againſt you,
my Dear Children, whom, thro' my own Default, I am forced to
leave to the wide World, e're you are fit to live in it; and to leave
you under a Blot, to be reproached it may be, with that which is not
your Fault, but Unhappineſs: But as to this, I'm leſs concern'd, if you
ſhall but make a good uſe of it, endeavouring to humble your ſelves
under that mighty Hand of the Juſt God, which falls ſo heavy, even
upon you thro' me: Conſider this your Affliction is righteous with God,
ſince you alſo were born in Sin; and that it may by your due Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
be a means of greateſt good to your Souls. That which is my
greateſt Trouble with reference to you, is, that I have not only conceiv'd
and brought you forth in Sin, but have neglected the means I ſhould
have us'd, for the changing of you from Darkneſs to Light, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you from under the Power of Satan unto God: And tho' I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
brought you to Baptiſm, therein profeſſing to give you up to God
the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, to be his true and faithful Servants,
and to engage you by that Solemn Vow againſt the World, the Fleſh
and the Devil; Yet I have not inſtructed you about that Ingagement,
nor call'd upon you to perform it. Had I conſider'd how much I my ſelf
ſtood oblig'd to God in my Baptiſm, and by my farther Reſolutions
upon ſometime hearing of my Duty from Mr. <hi>Birch,</hi> I had never fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into thoſe Depths of Sin, which have brought me into the Depths
of Miſery that at preſent cover me, 'Tis now my laſt time to call,
and your laſt time of hearing me call in the Land of the Living; this
Call is accented to you with Groans and Sighs from the deepeſt Bowels
of a Dying Parent: 'Tis a Call to which God and all good Men wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to be your Duty, yea, to which your own Conſciences will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to be ſo. If you diligently liſten to them, and do not ſtifle and
harden them by ſinning againſt them, 'tis a Call to the performance of
what I have laid you under, the moſt Solemn Vow and Oath to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52428:6"/>
God to perform in your Baptiſm. 'Tis a Call of both of you, ſo
ſoon as ever you come to underſtand your ſelves, to ſign or take upon
you your parts of that Baptiſmal Covenant which you are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
according to the Direction given you in <hi>Page</hi> 155, of the Reverend
Mr. <hi>Allein</hi>'s <hi>Sure Guide to Heaven:</hi> Which I herewith ſend you, that
you may have all the Bleſſings of that Covenant for your Heritage in
this Life, and the alſufficient God for your everlaſting Portion. If you
take not upon you this Covenant ſo ſoon as you ripen in Underſtanding,
but ſhou'd go on to neglect it to your Lives end, I teſtify to you both,
that your Baptiſm will prove no other, than a ſtrong Band to tye you
faſter to everlaſting and aggravated Miſery. And take notice, this Call
to you to this your Duty, is from one who feels every Sin cut deeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Soul by its having been acted againſt ſuch a Vow, ſo early laid
upon me, ſo reaſonable, ſo beneficial a Vow: A Vow, which had I
kept, would have kept me from thoſe Sins which now as Spears, pierce
my Heart, and are the poyſoned Arrows that drink up my Spiritis. A
Vow, which if kept by you, will ſweeten the bittereſt Miſeries of
your Life; yea, the moſt harſh and terrifying Embraces, of the moſt
painful and linguering Death. A Vow, which ought to curb all your
ſinful Inclinations, and to conſtrain you to all vertuous and religious
Converſation in the World. A Vow, which greatens all the Sins that
the World count little, tho' they will not ſo account them I'm ſure, when
they come either to repent of, or ſuffer for them eternally. In ſhort,
it is the Vow upon you, in force of which, I conjure you both, deeply to
conſider, and diligently to obſerve this my Dying Charge, that you
may live eternally.</p>
                  <p>Let not the Devil cheat you of your Youthful days, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of a long Life to come, wherein you ſhall ſerve God and ſave
your Souls. Let him not cheat you with the fair out-ſide of Profit,
Pleaſure, Eaſe or Eſteem in Sin; no, nor with the hopes of Secreſie,
Impunity, or the hopes of an after and late Repentance. This laſt,
believe me, is moſt difficult to attain, moſt dangerous to truſt to. And
as to Secreſie and Impunity in Sin, both which were promis'd me by
the Father of Lyes, behold how I enjoy them, whoſe Crimes are
brought forth and puniſh'd in the ſight of the Sun; and then depend on
them if you can or dare: 'Tis a Mercy I bleſs the God of Grace for,
that I enjoy'd them not. Believe Gods Word, which tells you a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of Fools ſhall be deſtroy'd: Be you ſo wiſe for your ſelves, as to
be Companions of thoſe that fear the Lord, whilſt you ſhun all idle
Company, or looſe or profane, with more care, becauſe more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than Perſons infected with the Plague. The former will corrupt
your Souls, the latter do but threaten the corrupting of your Bodies.
I charge you as you will anſwer it at the Tribunal of the great God, that
you get and labour to underſtand the Catechiſms I herewith ſend you;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52428:7"/>
Two Queſtions at leaſt every Week out of them, that the Elder of
you teach it to the Younger, whilſt you are together. Hence ſhall
you learn what God would have you be, believe and do the Ten
Commandments, Lords Prayer and Creed, being there. Thus ſhall
you not be deſtroy'd for lack of Knowledge; which want highly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
my preſent Miſery. I farther charge you, that you read ſome part
of Gods Word daily, diligently and reverently in your Bibles, ſince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Word, you muſt finally be Judg'd. I charge you to
keep the Lords Day holy to the Lord, ſpending it in publickly hearing
Gods Word, where moſt ſoundly and affectionately Preached: And
in privately reading and meditating on that Word, and in Prayer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God has promis'd great Bleſſings to thoſe who keep that day from
polluting it. And becauſe your religious Converſation all the Week
depends much, that I ſay not altogether, upon this; I charge you
that you pray to God devoutly and fervently on the Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of every day at leaſt, confeſſing the Sins of your Natures, and the
Sins of your Thoughts, Words and Deeds; begging Gods Pardon and
his Renewing Grace, that you may amend, and grow fitter every day
you live, for Heaven when you dye: Beg alſo in your Prayers, Gods
Protection, Proviſion, Guidance and Bleſſing, as thoſe who are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that on him you depend for Life and Breath and all things. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
particularly in your Prayers, the Black Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s for which I dye;
and pray to God that he will not farther viſit them upon you; yea,
<hi>Watch and Pray, that you enter not into Temptation</hi> to them. Be content
with what Condition God ſhall aſſign you in this World. Beſure you
Love your Neighbours as your ſelves; do no body the leaſt Injury in
Thought, Word or Deed; yea, Love your Enemies, even thoſe I
charge you, who, you may think had the firſt hand in your poor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Death, whom with all the World, I do now heartily forgive.
Set a Watch before the Door of your Lips, againſt all Swearing, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Idle Talking, or Fooliſh Jeſting, Slandering or Cenſuring any, that
you offend not with your Tongues. See that you be diligent in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
Imployment God ſhall aſſign to you for the gaining a Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in this World; obey thoſe that ſhall have Rule over you, as
Maſters, Miſtreſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all things Lawful, for the Lords Sake:
And beg time from them, yea, Redeem time by your Diligence from
their Buſineſs, wherein you may ſerve God every day. Shun all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
ways of getting, tho' for the Supply of mere Neceſſity. In a word,
get Gods Commands into your Heads, and hide them in your Hearts,
that you may not ſin againſt him. Remembring always you are not
of your ſelves ſufficient, ſo much as to think any good thing as of
your ſelves; but believe it upon my ſad Experience (who fail'd, and
fell by truſting to my own ſtrength for performing the good Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I took up) Without Chriſt you can do nothing; That all your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52428:7"/>
Sufficiency is of God, whoſe Spirit and Grace you muſt therefore beg,
as you would do Bread when you are ready to ſtarve, of your Parents.
Since Chriſt hath told you, if Parents tho' evil, give good Gifts to their
Children, how much more will not your Heavenly Father give the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to them that ask it, and continue asking it? Oh Children, would
you live happily and dye ſo, take the Advice of your Dying Mother.
Would you not have it to ſay at laſt, How have we hated Inſtruction
and deſpiſed Reproof? Wou'd you not have God laugh at your Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and mock when your Fear cometh? Oh then, take my Advice
as here given you. Would you be Bleſſings to your Generation, the
Love of Good Men, the Delight and Care of Heaven, Read then, over
and over, Ponder and Practiſe my Advice: Bind theſe my Precepts, on
your Heads, Hands and Hearts; an Ornament of Grace they will be
unto you, even as Chains about your Neck, and Bracelets on your Arms.
Oh what a Peaceful, Happy and Joyful Life had I lead, if I had ever
choſen theſe ways of Wiſdom, theſe ways of Pleaſantneſs which I
mark you out! Oh what an Honourable Death ſhould I have dyed,
what a Sweet, Flouriſhing and Bleſſed Memory ſhould I have left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
me; whereas now, Woe is me, my Life is going out like the
Snuff of a Candle, cut off in the midſt of my Years, the Proud Waters
are come in unto my Soul. Oh what would I now give, Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Worlds ſurely if I had them, that I had lead my Life as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading
you, the Dear Fruit of my Womb, to lead yours! Oh had I
my paſt Life again, would I barter it away for Toyes, for Vanity or
ſinful Pleaſures? Should the World or the Devil again impoſe upon
me as I find they have done? No, ſurely No: Yet alas, had I kept
the Precepts I have recommended to you, from my Youth upward,
as exactly as I would beg of you to keep them, or as you would wiſh
you had kept them, did you ſtand in my preſent Circumſtances, yea,
allowing theſe Precepts to contain a perfect Rule of Life, yet would
there be one thing lacking and chargeable upon me, even a Satisfaction
for the Guilt of my Sin, in and from <hi>Adam.</hi> Nor can my preſent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Tears, Penitent Confeſſions, Promiſes of future Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
expiate that Guilt, much leſs attone for all the Violations of Gods Laws
thro' my paſt Life. Oh no, I muſt have the Righteouſneſs of the Lord
Jeſus to cover my naked Soul withal, before the Barr of God, in order
to my Acceptance and Salvation. Where's any room then, my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
for that vain Conceit, think you, that Perſons may be too diligent,
exact or abounding in the Way and Works of God? When you have
done all, muſt you not own your ſelves unprofitable Servants? But oh
how much ſhort of the whole will you fall, when you do all you can,
of whatever I have counſelled you! Believe me then, (for 'tis undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Truth) never any repented of too much Diligence in Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
whilſt they liv'd, much leſs when they came to dye. Oh that I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52428:8"/>
could draw forth the preſent earneſt Pantings of my Soul before you!
Sure they would put your Souls into the like or better motion. Hear
Children the Prayers of your Dying Parent for her own Soul, which
ſhe puts up with infinitely more Earneſtneſs if it were poſſible, than ſhe
could pray for her Releaſe from the preſent Chains ſhe wears, the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
ſhe lyes in, the Shame and approaching Death ſhe is to undergo:
Yea, hear the Prayers, and pray them whilſt you live, which your
Dying Mother makes for you; not for Riches, Preferment, Eſteem,
Eaſe or Plenty in this World: No, let the World enjoy the Gods they
dote on. May you my Children (who are born with Souls naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and ſo ought to be aſham'd) have the Cloathing of Chriſts
Righteouſneſs to cover your ſinful Nakedneſs: May you (who have
Souls expos'd to the Wrath of God, for the Sin of your Natures, and
the Sins of your (but as it were,) newly begun Lives, have Chriſts
Righteouſneſs as Armour againſt the ſecond Death, Armour of Proof
to keep off all furious Diſcharges of Gods Law upon you. May you
who have Souls miſerably poor by Nature, void of all ſaving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Grace, which are the true Riches, have your Souls made
Rich by Chriſt Jeſus, with his Gold try'd in the Fire, Rich in Faith,
Rich with all the Graces of his Holy Spirit dwelling richly in you,
Rich in the Love of God manifeſted to your Souls, and Rich thro'
Chriſts Purchaſe, in your being united to him, having a ſure Reverſion
of Eternal Glory. Theſe mighty Bleſſings may you ſeek after, may
God give you them early. Had I look'd after them, as I adviſe you now
to do, I might once more eaſily have attained and ſecured them, I
might have had the Uſe and Comforts of them thro' my Life; Oh that
I may not now fail of theſe Bleſſings at Death! Alas that I have dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it to this doubtful Point! God and Chriſt waited on me with
theſe Offers ever ſince, and are ready always to beſtow them upon you,
if you are but ready to receive them. Well, ſhall I ſhew you the way
wherein you are to ſeek theſe Bleſſings, wherein ſeeking ye ſhall find,
yea, wherein only ſeeking, I hope my ſelf to find them; why truly 'tis in
the way of Repentance and Faith on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: The
World think they can as eaſily Repent and Believe, almoſt, as I can
write the Words; but alas! they'l find themſelves deſperately mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
if they don't alter their Minds, miſtaken to their endleſs
Ruin.</p>
                  <p>Oh how hard is it for me to believe my Heart, which was but ſome
Weeks ago, in deep Love and League with Sin and with this World,
to be now abſolutely, unalterably, irreconcilably ſet againſt all Sin,
and ſet fixedly to mortify its Members to this World! My Heart
once flatter'd me, the Change was wrought, but alas! 'twas but a
Cheat: And do not I now want the iſſue of ſome time and
trying Temptations, to prove to me whether its preſent Pretenſions
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52428:8"/>
to a Change, be true or no? Oh my Children, don't think of delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to begin Repentance till the time comes of Sickneſs or of Death,
when moſt begin it indeed, but it's odds whether one in an Hundred
of them ever end it to a long Eternity. Every day you delay it; every
Sin you commit, renders it more difficult to attain. Every Delay
draws on the Curſe of God, provoking him to give you up to a Judicial
Hardneſs. Begin this great Work betimes, which you'll ſee occaſion
never to break off till your Lives end. Who would be ſo Mad as to
have the whole Volumes of their Accounts of Sins to call over, when
they ſhould have nothing to do but dye? Lament your leſſer Sins now,
that you may not have greater hereafter to lament. Lament your Bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
early Sins, 'tis the way wherein you are likely to prevent groſs and
more grown Sins; reſiſt the firſt ſpringings of every Motion of Sin in
your Thoughts, that's the way to prevent it's growing into ſinful
Thoughts, and yet more ſinful Actions. Oh that I had thus us'd my
ſelf to fight againſt my Luſts, ſurely thro' Almighty Grace, I could not have
been thus miſerably foil'd by them, ſurely I ſhould have been more
then Conqueror. When now alas! Behold what Shame covers me;
I am Contemn'd, the Scorn of Bad Men, and a Scandal to the Good;
and now whither ſhall I cauſe my Shame to go? Well for all this, I
once thought I had repented. Beware then, reſt not in Sorrow for
ſome ſingle Sin alone, reſt not in preſent Pangs of Grief for, or haſty
Reſolves againſt Sin in general. Pray, Strive, and wait upon the Grace
of God in Gods way, to have your Hearts deeply touch'd with Shame
and Sorrow for, with loathing of your natural Averſion from God and
what is good. Labour to ſee an evil in Sin, greater than all you can
ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake: Labour to feel it an intolerable Burden,
which therefore you are glad to throw off on any Terms, and by which
you are brought to admire Gods Terms of Pardon through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I needed a Saviour, Chriſt Jeſus, as ſoon as I was bron, and ſo did
you; yea, and every day you live, your need of him greatly Encreaſes.
Is it too ſoon to look after an Intereſt in him? or can you do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it? You have an Intereſt in Chriſt, if you unſeignedly conſent to
have him on the Terms in your Covenant of Baptiſm, (for which, ſee
Mr. <hi>Allein</hi>'s Book again, <hi>Page</hi> 135.) But Oh Fool that I was, whilſt I
was Well, at Eaſe, in Buſineſs, I ſaw no need I had of a Saviour; Or if
I thought I wanted him upon the ſight of ſome affrightful Sin, or in
ſome ſerions Fit, I took him for that time, and baniſhed him again when
I had done with him. I thought I could have him with a wet Finger
almoſt, A Lord have Mercy upon me! an outward Reformation,
ſome cold Prayers now and then, going to Church, repeating my Creed:
I thought I could have ſerv'd my turn of Chriſt, without any cordial
Affection or ſincere Conſent. I was for having him with the World
and my Sins, or when I could have theſe no longer: But theſe Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52428:9"/>
are fled away, now the Deceit lyes plain. Chriſt Jeſus is indeed
to be had without Mony and without Price; but I muſt give up my
ſelf to him, if I will have him; and that's no Price neither, for I am
my ſelf the Purchaſe of his Blood, tho' I have unjuſtly detain'd it from
him. Now I am convinc'd I muſt Love, Honour and Obey Chriſt
Jeſus, and ſo muſt all that will receive him to the ſaving of their Souls:
And oh Bleſſed Jeſus, how can I be ſure that I love thee now, who a
while ſince, lov'd not thy Ways, nor thy People, for the ſake of thine
Image on them, nor thy Laws the Image of thy ſelf, who was for the
moſt part of my Life, doing thoſe Works which thou cameſt to deſtroy?
How can I aſſuredly know that I Honour thee, who lately ſlighted and
trampled under Foot thy Blood, the Blood of the Covenant, contemn'd
the Methods of thy Government, deſpis'd in my Heart the Mean and
Garb of thy Subjects, even the chief Glories of thy Perſon, whilſt on
Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> thy Deep Humility, Extenſive Charity, Heavenly Mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
Readineſs to do thy Father's Will, Faithfulneſs to advance his
Glory? Thy Submiſſion and Pray'rfullneſs to him, thy Patience, thy
Purity of Heart and Life, thy ſtrong Faith even under ſtrong Hunger;
Theſe I deſpis'd, in that I endeavour'd not the Practice of them, nay,
practis'd contrary to them. How know I, in ſhort, that I Honour thee
now; who know to my Sorrow, a while ſince, I prefer'd Sin, my
Name, yea, the Devil in Diſguiſe, before thee? Oh my Lord, how
know I that I now have a fix'd and unalterable Diſpoſition to obey
thee, when before I came into this Priſon, yea, before I came into
theſe condemned Circumſtances, other Lords had Dominion over me,
my Practice was quite contrary to thy Commands? What, have I
learn'd the Chriſtian Exerciſe and Diſcipline ſo ſoon? learn'd habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to deny my ſelf, that always us'd to pleaſe my ſelf, even to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
of my ſelf to thee? Have I learn'd to Watch and Pray in good
earneſt, that I enter not into Temptation, whoſe Aim and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
was chiefly for Profit, Pleaſure or Eſteem in this World before?
What! have I learn'd to reſiſt the Devil, that never underſtood his
way of Fighting, his Baits and Snares before? Have I learn'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
all this World for Chriſt Jeſus, that could not a while ago, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a luſtful Thought, ſinful Word or Action for thee? How do I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
this World for thee, from which I'm forced by the Puniſhment of
my Sins againſt thee? Have I learn'd to believe all thou ſayeſt practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
that ſcarce a while ſince, could give any reaſon why I believed
any of it hiſtorically? Oh Good God! what a Change is this! who
amongſt my Neighbours will believe it's wrought in my Heart? Or
how can I believe, at leaſt, how can I be aſſured of it? Only the
Almighty Grace of God can effect, and the Spirit of God aſſure this
Change. Thus, thus it muſt be with me and every one before they
dye, if ever they be admitted into the Kingdom of Glory. Did the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52428:9"/>
World know and believe this, would they not be ſtartled at it? But
who hath believed this Report? Children, will you alſo be numbered
amongſt the Deceived, and at the next Remove, the Damned Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude?
Oh be Wiſe, be Inſtructed, Kiſs the Son of God, leſt he be
Angry and ye Periſh from the way, when his Wrath is kindled but a
little: Bleſſed are all they who place a rightly grounded Truſt in him.
Oh learn betimes to Love, Honour and Obey this Lord that has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
you with his Precious Blood ſhed upon the Croſs, his Meritorious
Righteouſneſs; learn to hear and know his Voice, he ſpeaks to you in
your Bibles, by Faithful Miniſters, by your own Conſciences, by his
Spirit, by Sound Chriſtians; if you ſeek to get into their Company,
their Houſes, yea, their Hearts, by enquiring of them concerning his
Will: Nay, ſure he calls you by your Dying Parent, now to come to
him that you may have Life, to prefer him before this World, before
childiſh Sports and Vanity. Oh my Aking Heart for you, my Yearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bowels towards you, what a World of Snares and Wickedneſs
have you to paſs thro'? What a Life probably of Labour, Contempt
and Poverty to undergo, and of Perſecution too, if you will live Godly
in Chriſt Jeſus? What a Subtle Devil to reſiſt, Cunning and Malicious
to cheat and deſtroy you? To whom ſhall I leave you, to whoſe Care
and Conduct? You have been ſometime without a Father on Earth,
ſhortly you'll be without a Mother too: Will you not ſeek a Father
in Heaven? Oh chuſe Chriſt Jeſus, he'll be a Friend, a Portion, a
Guard, a Guide, Honours, Pleaſures, all things; yea, more and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than all things to you, in him God will be your Father. Oh Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Trinity in Unity! wilt thou accept my (I hope now unfeigned)
Dedication of theſe my poor Children to thee? Oh Son of God wilt
thou be their Saviour from Sin and from Eternal Death? Oh Bleſſed Spirit,
wilt thou early Enlighten, ſtrongly Incline, and powerfully Enable
them, to chuſe God for their Portion, Jeſus for their Prince and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
thy Word for the Rule of their Life? Shall my Unworthy
Prayer be heard on the Account of my Saviour for theſe my Diſtreſſed
Children? Oh then I'll no longer call them forſaken, no, nor think
them ſo; the Lord is their Shepherd, they ſhall not want. Well, had
I my Life again my Tender Hearts, would I not again Travel in Birth
with you till Chriſt were formed on you? were you not Happy think
you, if you were in ſuch a caſe? will you not be happy, Children, if
your God be the Lord? Well then, as you love your Souls, Pray day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Early, Earneſtly, that you may be Renewed in the Spirit of your
Minds; Pray till you find a Return of your Prayers, Pray till you can
underſtandingly and truly ſay, you need no more Grace, no more Aids
againſt Corruption, no more Help in Religious Duties, no more Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Reſolution to conteſt againſt the Devil, who will be always
Tempting you; then I'm ſure you'll from this time to your lateſt Breath
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52428:10"/>
on Earth, and in all likelyhood, till you breath Praiſes in Heaven. If
you pray aright, pray earneſtly, believe thoſe Honeſt Chriſtians that
tell you there are Joys in Religion above the Joys of Harveſt; not to
the Formal, Sluggiſh, Inconſtant, Trifling Chriſtian, I believ, but to
the Diligent. Muſt you not work in this World to maintain you?
will you not work for Eternity much more? with what words ſhall I
Excite you? will not my Death, my Doubts, my Danger of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Death excite you? Oh I exceedingly Fear and Tremble, leſt
your hard Heart ſhould barr out, or deſpiſe my wholſome Councel;
how oft has Heaven Thundred in my Ears, and yet I dead in Treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Sins, aroſe not to call upon my God? I ſtarted indeed once in
my dead Sleep, but the World Fleſh and Devil, ſoon Lull'd me aſleep
again, faſter than I was before, on the Pillow of Careleſſneſs and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity:
Now by waking Pains I pay for that Lethargick Sleep.</p>
                  <p>Come, caſt a Look with me into Eternity; ſee if that will move you:
Oh that I could leave you the Eyes wherewith I now ſee; but uſe your
own, I mean the Eyes of your Mind, to look into Eternity. Such
Thoughts will Inſtruct and make you Wiſe; Thoughts of your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Death may ſtir you up to lay hold on Everlaſting Life: Keep Death
always in view of your Minds, ſo whenever it ſeizes, it ſhall not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
you.</p>
                  <p>If you ſhall fear at any time henceforward, when you are reading this
Paper, that I'm gone to the Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever, where God
is only known by the Vengeance which he Executeth, where the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
drink Eternally of Rivers of Flaming Brimſtone, and keep Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with Spiteful Fiends in endleſs Deſpair: Will you not be afraid
to follow, tho' it were a Mother, to that Eternal Priſon? Or how can
I bear the Thought that you ſhould come to ſhare, yet not alleviate,
but ſharpen Torments before Intolerable? To Curſe my former Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
towards you, and your own Neglects of my preſent Advice in
ſo doleful a Place, in ſuch dreadful Company for ever? Oh take Heed
better, Ten Thouſand times better a Millſtone were hang'd about
your Necks, and you caſt into the Depths of the Sea. But if you can
believe from this Copy of my Mind, that I'm gone to Heaven the
place of Everlaſting Joys, will you not take my foregoing Advice,
wherein I have mark'd you out the Strait and Narrow Way thither?
Oh if you do, who can tell the Joys ſhall attend our Meeting in thoſe
chearful Regions that never know a Storm, nor ſo much as fear a
Cloud? Bleſt with the moſt Healthful, Refreſhing Airs of Gods Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
Water'd with the Rivers of Pleaſures that flow at his Right
Hand: Oh how ſhall we there Rejoyce Eternally together!</p>
                  <p>Oh that I could prevail with you to Meditate ſome time every day
upon Eternity! Your Mother in a few Hours will be ſwallow'd up
therein, will not that draw your Thoughts a little thither? Oh that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52428:10"/>
you might be Haunted as it were, whereever you go with the Thoughts
of Death and Eternity. I ſee Death marching towards me every Hour
and Moment, and is it not thus marching towards you and all the
World, whether they Eat, Drink, Sleep or Play? I ſee my Judge ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on his Throne, will he not be yours likewiſe? having Eyes as a Flame
of Fire, which will pierce into all the Secrets, both of mine and your
Hearts and Actions. I ſee methinks, my own Conſcience unfolded and as
it were, compar'd with Gods Omniſcience, where all I have done in
the Body is Recorded; and is there not in Heaven a Regiſter kept of
your Actions too? I hear the Devil as it were, charging all my Sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me at Gods Barr, Aſſerting my Services to his Intereſt, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an High Challenge to me as his own. Will he not ſerve you ſo
think you, if you ſerve him? I would think I hear on the other ſide the
Blood of Jeſus pleading for my Ranſom from Eternal Death and Hell,
as being made a Penitent Believer: This is all the Life I have in Death.
Will you not want it at your Deaths? may you not have it in your
Lives? In ſhort, I ſee as it were, Hell naked before me, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
without a Covering: I ſee Heaven fill'd with Crowned
Martyrs, Triumphing Saints, and Shining Angels all ſwallow'd up in
the Light and Love of the Glorious Jehovah. And now what Hope
and Fear fills my Head and Heart? I can't certainly determine which
is my Place and what my Portion. I liv'd neglecting to determine this
great Point, 'tis juſt if Heaven ſuffer me to dye doubting of it. And
will you dare to do ſo? can you like to dye ſo? Oh now a World for
ſuch a Repentance as I could be aſſur'd I ſhould never repent of were I
to live in this World again; as that I ſhould hate Sin in my very Soul,
and burn it up with Jealouſie and Indignation. Oh for ſuch a Love to God
and Holineſs, as I could be aſſur'd, if I were to live on Earth again,
would carry me thro' the Force of contrary Examples, thro' the Fires
of raging Perſecution, thro' the deepeſt Waters of Affliction, thro' the
ſtrongeſt Contradictions of my own Corruption, to Love, Serve, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Fear, Obey, Truſt, Reverence, Deſire, Delight in the Living God.
Then would I welcome Death in its cloſeſt Attack and moſt diſmal
Shape; yea, I would leave this World with a more chearful Heart,
than ever I bore in it thro' my whole Life. My Dear Children, that
I have any Hopes now of Pardon of my Sin, Peace with God and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Life, is owing to the abundant Riches of the Glory of Gods
Grace: Oh take you heed of Sinning that Grace may abound; if you
do, you may come to rue it for ever. But go I muſt hence, whether
I hop'd or no; Time draws to a Cloſe, and calls me to bid you a long
Farewel. Farewel my Dear Children, May your Souls be bound up
in the Bundle of Life: I commend you to God and to the Word of
his Grace; May the very God of Peace Sanctify you wholly, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52428:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you Blameleſs in Body, Soul and Spirit to the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
