            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Narrative of the Robbery and Bloody Murther of Mr. <hi>John Talbot,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Uch is Almighty Gods moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full providence in the continued ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of his Creation, eſpecially in the preſervation of mankind, the Image of himſelf; that no Atheiſt hitherto could Juſtly accuſe his moſt righteous Diſpenſation, relating to his government of the Univerſe, or more particularly any wicked Men triumph in their deſperate attempts, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Man on Earth, his moſt noble Creature: Tis true, that iniquity (eſpecially in this age) hath ſo prevailed, that many Giants in ſin, have in both kinds dared as far as they either were permitted, or prevailed with by the Devils inſtruments, to aſſault the being of all beings, and others indeavouring to execute that in Effigie, which they cannot reach or accompliſh, in reſpect of his inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible eſſence; but whileſt the bold Atheiſt ſpends his quivers of arrows againſt Heaven, at length he experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences the fall of his own weapons, to his at once (I cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure not whether too late) apparent conviction, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable deſtruction; and whilſt the Murderer moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly enterpriſes to extirpate humane nature by his moſt deſperate practiſes, he frequently in killing another
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104644:3"/>
enlivens himſelf; ſo that guilt hereupon multiplies wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as well of his bloody actions, as perpetuates a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of divine exiſtence in Judgment ordering all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs here below.</p>
            <p>To paſſe by at preſent what relates to the encreaſe and condition of Atheiſts, howſoever, tis highly ſuſpitious that Murther is a branch ſprouting from this ſtock, nay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably groweth very near the root. Alſo, not upon this occaſion to rehearſe what others have wrote concerning this horrid impiety, and how that their puniſhment hath been miſtructive to the then preſent and after ages of Gods eſpecial regard to humane nature, in his unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wayes diſcovering ſuch offenders, bringing them to receive rewards ſutable to their inhumane deſignes and practices; as a further addition to what on this ſubject hath already been made publick, that all people may avoid both the occaſion and fate of Murderers, it is not unmeet that a true and faithfull Narrative be expoſed to view of the late execrable Murder of Mr. <hi>John Talbot</hi> late a Miniſter. This Gentleman as I am informed, was Chaplain to one of his Majeſties Regiments in <hi>Portugal,</hi> where he continued in the diſcharge of his Office, till the recalling of the ſaid Regiment; when he arrived at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> he preached 3. Months at St. <hi>Alphage</hi> in the Wall.</p>
            <p>But before this accident, he was Curate at a Town called <hi>Laindon</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi>; the occaſion of his coming to <hi>London</hi> (as he often wrote) was upon the account of a Law-ſute between him and ſome perſons of that Pariſh. The morning before this diſaſter, he applyed himſelf to his Lawyer, and had ſome intimation that his adverſaries deſigned to Arreſt him; hereupon he was ſhie whether he went and with whom he converſed, but ſoon after he took notice of ſix Men and one Woman that dogged him whither ſoever he went; after many ſhiftings from place
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104644:3"/>
to place in order to his avoidance of them; he betook himſelf to <hi>Grayes-Inne,</hi> whither ſome or all of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons followed him, ſo that he took full and accurate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them.</p>
            <p>Whence he ſent by the hands of two Gentlemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that <hi>Innes of Court,</hi> one or two Letters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting ſome of his acquaintance and friends to come to his aſſiſtance, all this while he only ſuſpected an Arreſt.</p>
            <p>They failing, he applied himſelf to a Gentlemans cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at <hi>Grayes-Inne,</hi> where ſtaying till he ſuppoſed all cauſe of danger was over; after a ſhort refreſhment, as he informed me, ſteered his courſe the back way through <hi>Old-ſtreet,</hi> over the fields towards <hi>Shoreditch</hi>; not long after he came into the fields he perceived the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which before dogged him to purſue him; whereupon in this ſtraight, it being late, near Eleven of the Clock, he ſought to make his eſcape, (breaking through a Reed hedge) to a Garden Houſe, before he could reach his deſigned ſhelter, one or more ſeiſed him, and firſt picked his pockets, where they found about 20 ſhillings, and his knife, with which one attempted to kill him; the cut in the Coller of the Doublet ſignifies, that they endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to cut his Throat before they ſtripped him; but the Wound ſeems to inform that they firſt pulled of his Coat and Doublet, and then executing their ſo long waited for intention on him.</p>
            <p>As to the manner and form of his Wound, whether it was becauſe the knife was broad pointed, (and ſo it was judged) that it might not by ſtabs do full execution, or that theſe pretended to an exquiſite skill in butchering Men, they firſt cut out a peece of his Throat about the breadth of a Crown peece, but miſſed the Winde-pipe; then in the dependant part of the Orifice they ſtabbed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104644:4"/>
him with the knife, the point whereof reached near unto the Lungs; but ſo providence did order their cruelty, that they miſſed the recurrent Nerves, by which he had been ſilenced, as alſo the Jugular Veins and Arteries, by the opening of which he had remedileſſe bled to death, and poſſibly no ſuch diſcovery had been made of the Murder.</p>
            <p>It muſt not be omitted that whilſt they ſtrove, and this Barbarous fact was committed, that the Dogs in the garden opened much; and by their fierce barking awakened ſome perſons, who in regard of the light, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeing it day break, came down to look after their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keting; whereupon the Murderers left their prey, and Mr. <hi>Talbot</hi> although Mortally wounded, crept after them through the ſame breach he had made at his entrance into the Garden; fearing leaſt he might not be found and periſh for want of help if he continued there, he went not far before he fell down in that place where he was found lying. Before I proceed, beſides the barking of the Dogs, he obſerved, that the Beaſts did very much bellow, as if God had cauſed this cruelty of the Dogs to be ſome kind of occaſion of Mercy to the wounded Man, and to reproach the more deſtructive fierceneſs of theſe Murderers, and had opened wide the mouths of the Beaſts of the field, to amaze and affright them from this ſlaughter of an Innocent; but becauſe the voyce of theſe Creatures ſeemed not loud enough to deter theſe aſſaylants from proſecuting their bloody attempt, ſoon after the Heavens ſpake terribly in Thunder, which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly did ſo aſtoniſh theſe wretches, that they eſcaped no farther from the place where they did this Horrid exploit. And as if theſe occurrences were not ſufficient to the end for which they were appointed, a great ſhowre of rain fell, which drew the Brick-makers out of their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104644:4"/>
Hutts and Lodgings, to ſave their Bricks from the Rain, by covering them with Straw. By ſome of theſe Mr. <hi>Talbot</hi> was eſpyed, lying in his ſhirt and drawers bloody: Notice hereupon was given to the reſt, and when they came to him he being raiſed up, and cheriſhed with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtrong water, immediatly pointed which way the Murderers went. The watch near <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> having notice of the Murder, ſome perſons of them went out, as well to take care of the Wounded Gentleman, as alſo to find out and apprehend the Offenders: One of theſe fearing alſo an Arreſt, kept in the ſearch aloof off and he firſt diſcovered a Man lying amongſt the Nettles, whom he ſuppoſed likewiſe to be killed; but calling his companions, this Perſon appeared by the bloody knife ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one ſide of him, and the Miniſters doublet on the other, to be guilty of the Murder, and accordingly he was ſeiſed; at firſt he feigned himſelf aſleep, but being well awakened, he attempted to make his eſcape; a pewter pot being found near him, the mark newly ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out, one of his guard brake his head with it, and ſo he became more quiet and tractable. In the mean time Mr. <hi>Talbot</hi> by the great care of the Officers and people watching that night, was conveyed to the Star Inn at <hi>Shoreditch</hi> Church, and put to bed, a Chyrurgeon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ſent for to dreſſe him. When this <hi>Eaton</hi> was brought before him, he ſtraightways knew him, and by writing declared, he was the perſon that cut his Throat, and that five more and a bloody Woman were his aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates. He being (upon his requeſt) a ſecond time brought before him, then continued his former accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him; whereupon he was carried before Juſtice <hi>Pitfield,</hi> and by him after examination committed to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>; it was not long before the Woman was found, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending her ſelf likewiſe to be aſleep, and when the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104644:5"/>
brought her before Mr. <hi>Talbot,</hi> he preſently knew her, and inquired of the Conſtable whether her name was not <hi>Sarah,</hi> for he had heard one of her Comrades ſay in <hi>Holborn,</hi> Shall we have a Coach <hi>Sarah?</hi> She being asked her name, and not ſuſpecting the reaſon, ſaid her name was <hi>Sarah</hi>: Shortly after another perſon was taken, whom likewiſe he knew, and a fourth, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Newgate,</hi> as the ſeveral following witneſſes both before the Juſtice, and at the Priſoners Trial declare; which evidence I ſhall now ſet down, only craving liberty to prefix a true Copy of a Letter, which the ſaid Mr. <hi>Talbot</hi> ſent to a perſon of quality on the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following.</p>

I was found and brought by the Officers of the Pariſh of <hi>Shore-ditch,</hi> where I am carefully provided for; an able Doctor, Dr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> and a Chyrurgeon, one Mr. <hi>Leichfeild,</hi> take care of me.

in the habit of a Miniſter, who ſeemed to be very much frighted, which induced me to ask him, Why he looked ſo ill? his anſwer was, <hi>That he had been dogg'd by ſeveral Perſons for three or four hours, but knew not why.</hi> Then I asked him, If he thought them not Bailiffs? ſays he, <hi>I am confident they cannot be ſuch, for I owe no man a penny</hi>; or to that effect.

brought him to me to take care and charge of him: but as they were bringing the ſaid Maſter <hi>Talbot</hi> to me, one of the Brick-makers eſpying a Bayliff in the fields and fearing an arreſt by him, withdrew himſelf from the reſt of the Company to go another way: and in his paſſing up a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall hill, he eſpied ſomething lying under the ſide of a Garden: to which he preſently approaching, found it to be the doublet of Mr. <hi>John Talbot,</hi> it being bloody about the Collar, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a maze, and looking about him, he eſpied a man, namely, one <hi>Stephen Eaton,</hi> lying in the Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles very near the doublet; whereupon he call'd again to the Company that were carrying away Maſter <hi>Talbot,</hi> bidding them come to him; ſaying, <hi>there was another man kill'd, and lay dead there by him:</hi> the ſaid <hi>Stephen Eaton</hi> hearing this ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, and would have gone away, which the Brick-makers likewiſe perceiving, ſeiſed on him, and ſtayed him on the place till the Officer and his Guard came up to them: who taking the ſaid <hi>Stephen Eaton</hi> into his cuſtody, and looking about the place, found a knife all bloody, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proved to be the knife of Maſter <hi>Talbot,</hi> with which his Throat was cut and ſtabbed: and farther looking thereabout, and ſearching him, found in a Ditch by him a Quart Pot, and in his Drawers four pieces of Tape, one whereof was broken, the reſt of them being whole pieces, and ſome of them bloudy; all which giving great ſuſpicion of him, they brought him to the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man; who preſently made ſignes for a Pen

and Ink, and wrote that, that man (namely <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Eaton</hi>) was his bloody Enemy, and that he with five men more and a bloudy woman, had dog'd and perſued him ſeven hours, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecuring him in the ſtocks, whileſt I went to provide a Lodging for the wounded man, and to get a Chyrurgion and other neceſſaries for him: I deſired my Partner, the Officer that had before brought Maſter <hi>Talbot</hi> out of the fields, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſaid <hi>Stephen Eaton,</hi> to go again and ſearch the Fields and Garden, near where this <hi>Eaton</hi> with the knife and doublet were taken: becauſe Mr. <hi>Talbot</hi> had wrote that there we might have ſome farther information: but this ſaid Officer, finding nothing neither in the Fields or Garden that could give any farther diſcovery; again coming forth of the Garden, eſpied over the High-way a ſhed door open'd, a woman coming forth with an old pair of bodies in her hand, whom he queſtioning, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be her Trade to gather Rags, let her paſs, demanding of her, if any other perſon were in the Shed? to which ſhe anſwered, there was a woman, upon which he going in, found her ſnorting, either being or pretending to be aſleep: which he with his Guard ſoon rouſed up, and finding her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſuſpitious, brought her to the wounded man whom I had gotten to bed, and was by this time very much revived with neceſſaries that I had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe procured for him: and therefore taking the woman into the room to him, I did by writing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of him, if that was the bloudy woman, that he had before in ſeveral papers wrote of to me? to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104644:11"/>
which he preſently wrote this Anſwer:</p>
               <p>Is not this woman called by the name of <hi>Sarah</hi> which yeſterday wanted a Coach, and pretended ſhe had a Baſtard lately: Whereupon I preſently before any information was given on either ſide, more than what paſſed between Mr. <hi>Talbut</hi> and my ſelf in Writing. I took her aſide and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her name, which ſhe told me was <hi>Sarah,</hi> but denyed that ſhe wanted a Coach, or any ways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſhe had a Baſtard the day before, which I likewiſe told Mr. <hi>Talbut</hi>; but he ſtill affirmed, That ſhe was the very Woman which with the ſix men ſo long dog'd and purſued him, and cryed to her Companions, <hi>Kill the Dog,</hi> when they firſt began to ſet upon him. Then I preſently cauſed her to be taken away and ſecured in the Watch-houſe neer the Stocks, wherein the ſaid <hi>Stephen Eaton</hi> was all this time ſecured: Whilſt I made proviſion for the conveying of them to a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, in the mean time queſtioning with Mr. <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but</hi> whether he were certain that the perſons I had then in cuſtody, namely <hi>Stephen Eaton</hi> and <hi>Sarah Swift</hi> were guilty of wounding and ſtripping of him? He ſtill aſſerted, That they were both of them guilty of his wound and blood. Then I preſently cauſed both of them to be pinioned, and in going to have them to a Magiſtrate, <hi>Stephen Eaton</hi> deſired of me that I would firſt permit him to ſee and ſpeak once more to Mr. <hi>Talbut,</hi> which accordingly I granted, and went my ſelf up with him, and coming into the room to Mr. <hi>Talbut,</hi> he fell upon his knees, lifting up his hands, and ſpake
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104644:11"/>
theſe words to Mr. <hi>Talbut,</hi> Sir, I deſire you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what you do in charging me with this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and bloody crime of wounding of you, which I am altogether clear and innocent of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray the Lord to make a ſpeedy diſcovery of the perſons that were the Actors of it: And you Sir, ſpeaking to Mr. <hi>Talbut,</hi> be pleaſed to clear me that am innocent. To which Mr. <hi>Talbut,</hi> ſo well as he could, cryed no, no, making ſigns that he was the man that wounded him, and that I ſhould take him away; ſo guarding him with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah Swift</hi> directly to a Juſtice, they were by ſeveral circumſtances beſides what Mr. <hi>Talbut</hi> had wrote about them, both of them ſuſpected guilty; yet they both denyed it, or that they ever ſaw Mr. <hi>Talbut</hi> till that morning that they were brought before him; but near the end of their examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the hearing of the evidences that came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them and firſt found them, when their <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus</hi> was about to be made by the Juſtice, there came in one Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> who dwells in the Garden near which theſe perſons were both taken, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that in his Garden there lay a Coat and Breeches which he ſuſpected to be the wounded mans, and therefore deſired that an Officer would go and take charge of them, which accordingly I did, leaving my Partner the other Officer that firſt took them, to receive the <hi>Mittimus</hi> from the Juſtice and convey them to <hi>Newgate:</hi> So when I came to the Garden, I found as Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> before had told me, the Coat and Breeches of Mr. <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but,</hi> with the ſheath of his knife lying by them,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104644:12"/>
which I took up before ſeveral perſons that being there went into the Garden with me; I ſearcht his pockets, finding therein a leather caſe with ſome papers and writings in them, and an Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack with a pair of Gloves and a pocket Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, and a leather purſe with a half Crown and a groat, and a braſs half penny in it; all which things I preſently carried to Mr. <hi>Talbot,</hi> who wrote that they were all his, and that he had loſt one pound ten pence, with two gold rings, beſides the money that I had found; and that one of the rings was a <hi>Portugal</hi> ring with a ſtone in it; and the other was a plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> ring with this Poſey in it, <hi>Love as I, or I die</hi>: Therefore by the way all perſons are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to make a diſcovery of ſuch perſons that ſhall at any time tender ſuch rings to their view or ſale.</p>
               <p>But to return to our buſineſs, I then began to queſtion Mr. <hi>Talbot</hi> how he thought his cloaths ſhould come into the Garden, and what occaſioned him to be about that place ſo late, he having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared that they ſet upon him about eleven a clock on <hi>Friday</hi> night; to which he gave this anſwer: That as he was on <hi>Friday</hi> ſeeking for one Mr. <hi>John Pell</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> a Shop-keeper, being a ſtranger to him, bid him look to himſelf, for he was dogged by many Knaves: whereupon he fearing an arreſt from ſome people of <hi>Laindon</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> he betook himſelf to <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> where by ſome Lawyers he was civilly entertained, declaring to them his condition, and withal ſent for ſome of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104644:12"/>
his acquaintance to come to him, but they not being at home, he waited there for their coming till it was very late, thinking thereby that thoſe perſons which before had followed him, and had there been ſeen to wait for him, would for that time have given over their hopes and expectations of taking him, and ſo have drawn off from wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer that night for him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he and the Gentlemen with whom he was thought it convenient for him to depart, they adviſed him to go the privateſt way he could to his Lodging, which was in <hi>Biſhopſgate-ſtreet,</hi> which accordingly he did; but withal ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he was ſtill dogged, though they made no attempt to aſſault or come upon him; and at laſt, as he thought he had quite loſt them, and had been quite eſcaped from them, he having for ſome time no perceivance of them, till as he was going along the High-way, leading from <hi>Oldſtreet</hi> to <hi>Shorditch,</hi> they made freſh ſuit after him, crying out to the bloody Woman with them, <hi>Sarah, Sarah,</hi> a Coach, a Coach; which as he apprehended was to carry him away, till ſuch time as he heard her as ſhe followed them, cry out to them, <hi>Kill the Dog</hi>; and thereupon he run out of the High-way into the fields, and from thence into the Garden, thinking thereby to have got to the houſe therein, and ſo have eſcaped their bloody deſign; but they being ſo reſolute and violent in the purſuit of him, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104644:13"/>
the Garden after him, and juſt within the hedge of it ſezied him, laying him on the ground, clapping ſome of their hands to his mouth, others kneeling on his breaſt whilſt one took him by the throat, and with his own knife that they had taken out of his pocket, cut away a great piece of his skin and fleſh cloſs to the wind-pipe, to the breadth of a ſix pence, ſtabbing him likewiſe in the ſame place; which done they ſtripped off his Coat, Doublet and Breeches, but by ſome ſtrange providence, as yet not certainly known to us; they were ſo prevented that they were conſtrained to leave both him and moſt of his cloaths in the Garden, ſave only his Knife and Doublet, with the two gold rings and one pound ten pence in money, as before mentioned. And this he ſeveral times aſſerted to me and ſeveral others, to be the only ground and cauſe of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a place and at ſuch a time of the night: Now if this be true, as we are charitably to judge it is, it being almoſt the laſt words and writing of a dying man, it may then ſerve to confute and reprehend the many falſe and various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and apprehenſions of many perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſaid Mr. <hi>Talbot,</hi> who ſo far as I can perceive have cauſleſsly aſperſed him with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converſant amongſt theſe people the day before, as if he had been naught with <hi>Sarah Swift</hi>; and ſo by that means was ſurprized with her, and fell into the hands of his barbarous

From Monday morning till the Sabboth following no ill Symptome appearing, either upon account of the wound or otherwiſe; for although he was taken up very wet, and lay in the open air ſome hours; yet through their experienced abilities he was ſecured from a Feavour: Several Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Viz.</hi> That antient Maſter in his Art Alderman <hi>Arris,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peirce,</hi> and others, did freely and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully afford their aſſiſtance, about noon on Sabboth day he was dreſſed, the wound well conditioned, a very laudable digeſtion appeared, and he ſeemed more chearful then formerly, but ſo it pleaſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, within two or three hours after, a violent fit of Coughing ſeizeing him, a branch of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular brake; if not the Jugular it ſelf, and in a ſhort ſpace, before any one could come in to his aſſiſtance, the effuſion of blood was ſo great, that he fainted, and his extream parts were cold; after the Flux was ſtopp'd upon caughing, he bled again, and the third time, till his condition became deplorable; about one or two that morning he ſent for Dr. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Shoreditch</hi> and whereas before he ſaid little elſe, then I, or No, being requeſted by his Phyſitians and Chyrurgions not to put thoſe parts

upon a great relation, but rather to write his mind; he ſpake freely to the Doctour, who deſired him to declare his judgment, in relation to juſtification; which he freely did, ſaying, that he hoped to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the merrits of Jeſus Chriſt onely; and the Doctor preſſing him to ſignifie whether he was fully ſatisfied to his accuſation of the perſons condemned; he readily anſwered that he was wel aſſured that he was not miſtaken in what he had done, relating to that buſineſs, being inquired of, whether he could freely forgive them; he replyed, that he prayed for the well-fare of their Souls; but deſired that the law might paſs on their bodies, in ſhort, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that diſpenſation of Providence towards him, and reſigned himſelf up when the Doctour prayed with him, and within two hours expired, during his languiſhment; He was very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and ſeemed devout; howſoever ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were pleaſed to cenſure him, and to prejudge his condition. Thus much muſt be ſaid, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpake concerning him, what they knew not: He ſeemed ſo charitable as not to concern himſelf with their aſperſions; 'Twere deſireable if men would be of a more Chriſtian and charitable temper, becauſe ſuch falſe Defamations wound more effectually then Murderous hands.</p>
