            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

found him, and all his men very unwilling we ſhould go any further; but we told them, that let the waies and paſſages be never ſo bad, we were reſolved to go through, and that we were not afraid of him nor his Nation, nor any other, for we intended no injury, and that we muſt go, for we were commanded by our King; theſe words cauſed <hi>Chounterounte</hi> to aſſimulate a feare in his countenance, and after delivery of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, at our going away next day, when we had moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our Horſes, <hi>Chounterounte</hi> came privately unto us, and in a moſt ſerious manner intimating unto us, that he loved us, and our Nation, and that he lively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended our danger, and that our ſafety concerned him, for if any accident hapned otherwiſe then good to us, he ſhould be ſuſpected to have a hand in it, and withall wiſhed us to go no further, for that he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew that the Nations we were to go through would make us away by treachery; we anſwered him, that we were not afraid to be killed, for that any one of us were able to deale with forty through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our great God, for we were commanded by our King.</p>

            <p>This day in the morning the <hi>Maharineck</hi> great men ſpake to heare ſome of our guns go off: Whereupon we ſhot two guns at a ſmall marke, both hitting it, and at ſo great a diſtance of a hundred paces, or more, that the Indians admired at it: And a little before night the old King of <hi>Maharineck</hi> came to us, and told us, that the people in the Towne were afraid when the guns went off, and ran all away into the Woods. This night alſo we had much Dancing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>August</hi> 31. Wee went away from <hi>Maharineck</hi> South Eaſt two miles to goe over <hi>Maharineck</hi> River, which hath a bottome betweene two high land ſides
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62446:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
through which you muſt paſſe to get over, which River is about two hundred paces broad, and hath a high water marke after a freſh of at leaſt twenty foot perpendicular by the trees in the breaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the River, and the high land of the old fields. This River is the Southerly laſt and maine branch of <hi>Chawan</hi> River, and was by us named <hi>Woodford</hi> River, and runs to the Eaſtward of the South. On both ſides of <hi>Woodford</hi> River is very much exceeding rich Land, but eſpecially on the further ſide towards <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comawananck.</hi> Imediately after the paſſage over this River, are old Indian fields of exceeding rich Land, that beare two Crops of Indian Corne a yeare, and hath timber trees above five foot over, whoſe truncks are a hundred foot in cleare timber, which will make twenty Cuts of Board timber a piece, and of theſe there is abundance.</p>
            <p>As alſo exceeding rich Land, full of great Reeds thrice as big as the largeſt Arrow Reeds we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Plantations; this good Land continues for ſome ſix miles together unto a great Swampp, and then begins a pyny barren Champion Land with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Branches and Pecoſans, yet very paſſeable, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning South and by Weſt, unto a deepe River ſome a hundred paces over, running South, and a little to the Eaſt, which River incloſes a ſmall Iſland which wee named <hi>Brewſters</hi> Iſland, ſome eighteene miles from <hi>Woodford</hi> River due South, and by Weſt, with very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich Land on both ſides of it for ſome ſixe miles together, and this River we alſo named <hi>Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> River, it being the firſt branch of <hi>Hocomawananck</hi> River: and a little lower downe as the River runs, is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62446:9"/>
ſuch another River as <hi>Chickahamine</hi> River (which is a mile broad.)</p>
            <p>After we had paſſed over this River we travelled ſome twenty miles further upon a pyny barren Champion Land to <hi>Hocomawananck</hi> River, South, and by Weſt: ſome twelve miles from <hi>Brewſters</hi> River we came unto a path running croſſe ſome twenty yards on each ſide unto two remarkeable Trees; at this path our Appamattuck Guide made a ſtop, and cleared the Weſterly end of the path with his foote, being demanded the meaning of it, he ſhewed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe to relate it, ſighing very much: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we made a ſtop untill <hi>Oyeocker</hi> our other Guide came up, and then our Appamattuck Guide journied on; but <hi>Oyeocker</hi> at his comming up cleared the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the path, and prepared himſelfe in a moſt ſerious manner to require our attentions, and told us that many yeares ſince their late great Emperour <hi>Appachancano</hi> came thither to make a War upon the <hi>Tuskarood,</hi> in revenge of three of his men killed, and one wounded, who eſcaped, and brought him word of the other three murthered by the <hi>Hocomawananck</hi> Indians for lucre of the <hi>Roanoake</hi> they brought with them to trade for Otter skins. There accompanyed <hi>Appachancano</hi> ſeverall petty Kings that were under him, amongſt which there was one King of a Towne called <hi>Pawhatan,</hi> which had long time harboured a grudge againſt the King of <hi>Chawan,</hi> about a yong wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that the King of <hi>Chawan</hi> had detayned of the King of <hi>Pawhatan:</hi> Now it hapned that the King of <hi>Chawan</hi> was invited by the King of <hi>Pawhatan</hi> to this place under pretence to preſent him with a Guift of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62446:9"/>
ſome great vallew, and there they met accordingly, and the King of <hi>Pawhatan</hi> went to ſalute and embrace the King of <hi>Chawan,</hi> and ſtroaking of him after their uſuall manner, he whipt a bow ſtring about the King of <hi>Chawans</hi> neck, and ſtrangled him; and how that in memoriall of this, the path is continued unto this day, and the friends of the <hi>Pawhatans</hi> when they paſſe that way, cleanſe the Weſterly end of the path, and the friends of the <hi>Chawans</hi> the other. And ſome two miles from this path we came unto an Indian Grave upon the Eaſt ſide of the path: Upon which Grave there lay a great heape of ſticks covered with greene boughs, we demanded the reaſon of it, <hi>Oyeoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> told us, that there lay a great man of the <hi>Chawans</hi> that dyed in the ſame quarrell, and in honour of his maemory they continue greene boughs over his Grave to this day, and ever when they goe forth to Warre they relate his, and others valorous, loyall Acts, to their yong men, to annimate them to doe the like when occaſion requires. Some foure miles from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comawananck</hi> is very rich Champian Land: It was night when we came to <hi>Hocomawananck</hi> River, and the Indian that came with us from <hi>Woodford</hi> River, and belonged to <hi>Hocomawananck,</hi> would have had us quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon the ſide of a great Swampp that had the advantage of ſeverall bottomes of the Swampp on both ſides of us, but we removed to take our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for ſafety, and retreate, in caſe any accident ſhould happen, which at that time promiſed nothing but danger, for our Guides began to be doubtfull, and told us, that the <hi>Hocomawananck</hi> Indians were very treacherous, and that they did not like their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62446:10"/>
and ſhape well; this place we named <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anchas</hi> Parke: about three houres after we had taken up our Quarters, ſome of the Inhabitants came, and brought us roaſting cares, and Sturgeon, and the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comawananck</hi> Indian that came with us from <hi>Woodford</hi> River, came not unto us untill next day, but his <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowance</hi> told us before wee came from <hi>Woodford,</hi> hee could not come untill that day at night. The next day morning after our comming to <hi>Hocomawananck</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants ſeemed to prepare us a houſe: But we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight of the clock ſet forward to goe view the place where they killed Sturgeon, which was ſome ſix miles from the place where we quartered by <hi>Pyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> Parke, where there is a River Running very deep South, exceeding deepe, and foure hundred paces broad. The high water marke of this River between both ſides of the River perpendicular, from the top of the Banck to the River, is forty five foot upon a freſh; this River was by us named <hi>Blandina</hi> River: from <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anchas</hi> Parke to the place where they kill Sturgeon is ſix miles up the River running Northerly, and all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich Land: Both upwards and downewards upon the River, at this place where they kill Sturge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo are the Falls, and at the foot of theſe Falls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo lies two Iſlands in a great Bay, the uppermoſt whereof Mr. <hi>Blande</hi> named <hi>Charles</hi> Iſland, and the lowermoſt Captaine <hi>Wood</hi> named <hi>Berkeley</hi> Iſland: on the further ſide of theſe Iſlands the Bay runs naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the two Iſlands ſides: <hi>Charles</hi> Iſland is three miles broad, and foure miles long, and <hi>Berkeley</hi> Iſland almoſt as big, both in a manner impregnable, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being fortified with high Clefts of Rocky Stone,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62446:10"/>
and hardly paſſeable, without a way cut through them, and conſiſts all of exceeding rich Land, and cleare fields, wherein growes Canes of a foot about, and of one yeares growth Canes that a reaſonable hand can hardly ſpan; and the Indians told us they were very ſweet, and that at ſome time of the yeare they did ſuck them, and eate them, and of thoſe we brought ſome away with us. The Land over againſt <hi>Charles</hi> Iſland we named <hi>Blands</hi> Diſcovery, and the Land over againſt <hi>Berkeley</hi> Iſland we named <hi>Woods</hi> journy, and at the lower end of <hi>Charles</hi> Iſland lies a Bay due South from the ſaid Iſland, ſo ſpatious that we could not ſee the other ſide of it: this bay we name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pennants</hi> Bay, and in the River between <hi>Charles</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, and the maine Land lies a Rocky Point in the River, which Point comes out of <hi>Charles</hi> Iſland, and runs into the middle of the River: this Point we name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Brewſters</hi> Point, and at this Point only, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any place paſſeable into <hi>Charles</hi> Iſland, and this <hi>Brewſters</hi> Point runs not quite from <hi>Charles</hi> Iſland to the maine Land, but when you come off the maine Land to the Rivers ſide, you muſt wade about fifty paces to come upon the Point, and if you miſſe the Point on either ſide, up or downe the River, you muſt ſwim, and the River runs very ſwift. Some three miles from the River ſide over againſt <hi>Charles</hi> Iſland is a place of ſeverall great heapes of bones, and heere the Indian belonging to <hi>Blandina</hi> River that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us to the Fals, ſat downe, and ſeemed to be much diſcontented, inſomuch that he ſhed teares; we demanded why thoſe bones were piled up ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly? <hi>Oyeocker</hi> told us, that at this place <hi>Appachan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62446:11"/>
one morning with 400. men treacherouſly ſlew 240. of the <hi>Blandina</hi> River Indians in revenge of three great men ſlaine by them, and the place we named <hi>Golgotha</hi>; as we were going to <hi>Blandina</hi> River we ſpake to <hi>Oyeocker</hi> our Guide to lead us the way, and he would not; but asked our Appamattuck Guide why we did not get us gone, for the Inhabitants were jealous of us, and angry with us, and that the Runner we ſent to the <hi>Tuskarood</hi> would not come at the day appointed, nor his King, but ran another way, and told the Indians that we came to out them off; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our Appamattuck Guide ſtepped forth, and frowning ſaid, come along, we will go ſee the Falls, and ſo led the way, and alſo told us that the <hi>Woodford</hi> Indians lied, and that Indian that came to us, which the <hi>Woodford</hi> Indian ſaid was the King of <hi>Blandina</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, was not the <hi>Werrowance</hi> of <hi>Blandina</hi> River; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we reſolved to return (having named the whole Continent <hi>New Brittaine)</hi> another way into our old path that led to <hi>Brewſters</hi> River, and ſhot off no guns becauſe of making a commotion, and adding to the Natives feares. At <hi>Blandina</hi> River we had ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with our Appamattuck Guide concerning that River, who told us that that Branch of <hi>Blandina</hi> River ran a great way up into the Country; and that about three dayes journy further to the South-Weſt, there was a far greater Branch ſo broad that a man could hardly ſee over it, and bended it ſelfe to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward above the head of <hi>James</hi> River, unto the foot of the great Mountaines, on which River there lived many people upwards, being the <hi>Occonacheans</hi> and the <hi>Neſſoneicks,</hi> and that where ſome of the <hi>Occonacheans</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62446:11"/>
lived, there is an Iſland within the River three dayes journy about, which is of a very rich and fertile ſoile, and that the upper end of the Iſland is fordable, not above knee deepe, of a ſtony bottome, running very ſwift, and the other ſide very deepe and navigable: Alſo we found many of the people of <hi>Blandina</hi> River to have beards, and both there, and at <hi>Woodford</hi> River we ſaw many very old men, and that the Climate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our opinions was far more temperate then ours of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the Inhabitants full of Children; they alſo told us that at the bottome of the River was great heapes of Salt; and we ſaw among them Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and were informed that they tip their pipes with ſilver, of which ſome have been brought into this Country, and 'tis very probable that there may be Gold, and other Mettals amongſt the hils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> 1. About noone from Woods Journey wee travelled ſome ſixe miles North Eaſt, unto the old Path that leads to <hi>Brewſters</hi> River: within night we quartered on the other ſide of it, and kept good watch: this Path runnes from Woods Journey north and by Eaſt, and due North.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> 2. In the morning about eight of the clocke, as every one was mounted, came to our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Occonnoſquay,</hi> ſonne to the Tuskarood King, and another Indian whom he told was a <hi>Werrowance,</hi> and his Kinſeman, with the Runner which wee had ſent to the Tuskarood King, who was to meet us at <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina</hi> River that night; the Kings ſonne told us that the Engliſh man would be at his houſe that night, a great way off; and would have had us gone backe with him, but we would not, and appointed him to meete
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62446:12"/>
us at <hi>Woodford</hi> River where hee came not, wee having ſome ſuſpition that hee came from <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> River that night, and that our Runner had not beene where we had ſent him, through ſome information of our Nottaway guide, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proved true, by the Relation of the <hi>Werrowance</hi> of <hi>Blandina</hi> River, whom about fowre howres after wee had parted with the Kings ſon, wee met on the way comming from <hi>Woodford</hi> River with a company of men, thinking he ſhould have found us at <hi>Blandina</hi> River that night, according to his order and promiſe; with whom falling into diſcourſe, he told us that the King of the <hi>Tuskaroods</hi> ſon, and our Runner were the night before at <hi>Woodford</hi> River; but the Kings ſon told us he came from <hi>Blandina</hi> River, and beyond, and hearing we were gone before he came, he had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled all night from <hi>Blandina</hi> River to overtake us. This day about Noone we came to <hi>Woodford</hi> River Towne, and tarried there that night, we found the old <hi>Werrowance,</hi> and all his great men gone, yet had courteous quarter; but not without great grounds of ſuſpition, and ſignes that they were angry at us: at our coming back to <hi>Woodford</hi> River we had informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſome Spies of <hi>Wainoake</hi> had been there a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before we came, and that the King of <hi>Wainoake</hi> and <hi>Chounterounte</hi> had ſent Runners to all the Nations thereabouts, informing them that the Engliſh were come to cut them off, which we ſuppoſed to be ſome greater Polititians then Indian Conſultations, who had ſome private ends to themſelves, and minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe then a publick good; for we found that the Runner whom we imployed to carry our meſſage to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62446:12"/>
the <hi>Tuskarood</hi> King, ran to the <hi>Waynoakes,</hi> and he whom the <hi>Woodford</hi> Indians told us was the <hi>Werrowance</hi> of <hi>Blandina</hi> River, was a <hi>Woodford</hi> Indian, and no <hi>Werrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> but done of purpoſe to get ſomething out of us, and we had information that at that time there were other Engliſh amongſt the Indians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> 3. By breake of day we journied from <hi>Woodford</hi> River to a path ſome eight miles above <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> Mount running North, and by Eaſt and North, North, Eaſt, which was done by the advice of our Appamattuck Guide, who told us that he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that ſome plots might be acted againſt us, if we returned the way that we came, for we told <hi>Chounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounte</hi> we would returne the ſame way againe: And this information our Guide told us he had from a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was his Sweet-heart belonging to <hi>Woodford</hi> River. This day we paſſed over very much rich, red, fat, marle Land, betweene <hi>Woodford</hi> River Towne, and the head of <hi>Pennants</hi> Mount, with divers Indian fields; the head of which River abounds much with great Rocks of Stone, and is two hundred paces over, and hath a ſmall Iſland in it named <hi>Sackfords</hi> Iſland. Betweene <hi>Pennants</hi> Mount River head, and the head of <hi>Farmers</hi> Chaſe River is very much exceeding rich, red, fat, marle Land, and <hi>Nottaway</hi> and <hi>Schockoores</hi> old fields, for a matter of ſixe miles together all the trees are blowne up or dead: Heere it began to raine, and ſome ſix miles further we tooke up our quarters, and it proved a very wet night. At the firſt other <hi>Notta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> old fields, we found the Inhabitants much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed about a gun that went off to the Weſtward of them, the night before wee came thither, which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62446:13"/>
our Appamattuck Guide conceived were the Wainoake Spies, ſet out there to prevent our journyings, and we found ſeverall Agers about the place where the Indians told us the gun went off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Septemb.</hi> 4. About 8 of the Clock we travelled North, North-Eaſt ſome ſix miles, unto the head of Farmers Chaſe River, where we were forced to ſwimm our horſes over, by reaſon of the great rain that fell that night, which otherwiſe with a little labour may be made very paſſable. At this place is very great Rocky ſtones, fit to make Mill-ſtones with very rich tracks of Land, and in ſome places between the head of Farmers Chaſe River and Black water Lake, is ground that gives very probable proofe of an Iron, or ſome other rich Mi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
