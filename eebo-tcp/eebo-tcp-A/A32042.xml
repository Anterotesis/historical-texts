            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS by Our gratious Proclamation of the twenty fifth of <hi>November</hi> laſt paſt, We took notice of the great miſery and ruine falling, and likely to fall upon Our good Subjects (if not timely prevented) by the Plundring, Spoyling and Robbing of their Houſes, and taking from them their Mony, Plate, Houſholdſtuffe, Horſes, Cattell, and other goods, in deteſtation of which barbarous, and unlawfull proceedings, and in tender commiſeration of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Our People, We did then declare, That if any either Officer or Souldier of Our Army of Horſe or Foot ſhould from henceforth, Plunder, Spoyle, or Robbe, any of Our People, or take from them any of their Mony, Plate, Houſholdſtuffe, Horſes, or other Cattell, as likewiſe any Victuall, or Commodities going to, or from Our Markets, upon complaint made thereof, the Commander, or Officer in Chiefe of ſuch Quarter where the fact was committed, was required to proceed againſt any ſuch Offendor, by the Law Martiall, without favour or connivance, and to cauſe him or them, ſo offending, to be executed without mercy (as in and by the ſame Proclamation more at large appeareth,) Notwithſtanding which, to the great and heavy grievance and oppreſſion of Our People, We find that Our Commands therein have not been (as We expected) ſtreightly obſerved. And having lately received Information that the greateſt part of theſe Plunderings and Robberies committed on Our people, eſpecially by the taking away of Horſes and other Cattell in the ſeverall Marches and expeditions of Our Forces, are committed and done by Perſons no way liſted, or imployed in Our ſervice, or under any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and by Voluntiers out of other Troopes, not commanded upon preſent ſervice, following Our Army for Spoyle and Pillage; We doe therefore charge and Command all perſons whatſoever, but ſuch as are or ſhall be licenſed by the ſuperior Officers of Our Army, or ſuch of Our good Subjects as ſhall offer their ſervice for Our aſſiſtance, and be received into Our Army upon their March, or as ſhall be of ſuch Forces, as ſhall be ſent upon any expedition, that they forbeare to follow, or attend Our Army or forces, or to take away any Mony, Plate, Goods, Horſes or Cattell from any of Our Subjects whatſoever. And if any ſhall offend, Spoyle, Robbe, Pillage, or Plunder, in the leaſt kind, contrary to this Our Proclamation, or take any Horſe, Mony, Plate, or other goods, from any of Our Subjects without eſpeciall warrant of their ſuperior Officer then commanding Our ſaid Army, We doe require and Command all the Officers and Souldiers of Our Army, and all other Our Officers and loving Subjects, to apprehend him or them ſo offending againſt this Our Proclamation, and to bring them before the Commander in chiefe of ſuch Army or Forces, whom We require and authorize forthwith to cauſe him or them, ſo offending, to be hanged without mercy, and to ſee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution be made to ſuch perſon, or perſons, as received ſuch loſſe by the taking away any of their goods or Cattell, in the beſt manner Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chiefe, or ſuch Officer ſhall be able to performe; This We require and Command to be fully and in every part obeyed, that thereby Out good ſubjects may be freed from miſery and ruine, or the leaſt apprehenſion thereof, and may without any interruption proceed in following their ſeverall callings and profeſſions, to the welfare and happineſſe of Our Kingdom and Our Army, and that the officers thereof may have the reputation of doing Iuſtice, and giving help and aſſiſtance to Our people. And Our further will and pleaſure is, That this Our Proclamation be publiquely read in all Churches and Chappells of this Our Kingdom, and in the heads of all Our Regiments of Horſe, Foot, and Dragooners. And as We have publiſhed this Our Proclamation for the protection of the Goods and Eſtates of all Our loving Subjects, ſo we expect that all ſuch Counties, Hundreds, Townes, and Villages in, or neere which any part of Our Army ſhall happen to be Quartered upon their March, ſhall upon warrants from the ſuperior Officer, or from the Commiſſaries of Our Army, furniſh and ſupply Our forces, ſo paſſing through or neere them, with all neceſſary proviſions of victualls and other accommodation both for Horſe and Foot, (for which they are to give tickets or receipts, which We ſhall carefully pay when God ſhall enable Us,) that ſo the Souldier for want of neceſſary proviſions may not have any pretence to offer any injury to any of Our good Subjects, whoſe eaſe and ſecurity ſhall alwaies be Our principal care,</p>
