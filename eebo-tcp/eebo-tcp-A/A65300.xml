            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of Bread and
<pb facs="tcp:56018:6"/>Wine are in themselves common, but under these Symbolical Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lie hid Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies. Behold here the best of dainties<note n="*" place="margin">Dapes sa'iares: <hi>Hor.</hi>

               </gap> Christ's precious <hi>Spikenard</hi> of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and grace, sends forth its smell. The Sacrament is both an healing, and a sealing Ordinance.

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Author</hi> of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Jesus Christ. <hi>[Jesus took</hi> 
               <note place="margin">(1.)</note> 
               <hi>bread]</hi> To Institute Sacraments, belongs of right to Christ, and is a Flower of his Crown. He only who can give Grace, can appoint the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which are the Seals of Grace. Christ being the Founder of the Sacrament, gives a Glory, and a Luster to it. A King making a feast, adds the more state and magnificence to it. <hi>Jesus took bread:</hi> he, whose <hi>Name is above every Name<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 2. 9.</note>;</hi> God  blessed for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Time</hi> when Christ did institute the Sacrament; wherein we <note place="margin">(2.)</note>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56018:11"/>may take notice of two Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 1. It was when he had sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 20. [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>After Supper.]</hi> Which had this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery in it, To shew that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is chiefly intended as a spiritual Banquet; it is not to indulge the Senses, but to feast the Graces. It was, <hi>after Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The other Circumstance of Time, is, That Christ did appoint the Sacrament a little before his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. <hi>The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, took bread.</hi> He knew troubles were now coming upon his Disciples; it would be no small perplexing to them, to see their Lord and Master crucisied; and shortly after they must pledg him in a bitter Cup; therefore, to arm them against such a time, and to animate their spirits, that very night in which he was betrayed, he gives them his Body and Blood, in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56018:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>This may give us a good Hint, That in all trouble of mind, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approaches of danger, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to have recourse to the Lords Supper.

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What is meant by this  Phrase, <hi>He took bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ's taking and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the bread from common uses, did hold forth a double Mystery.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56018:12"/>1. It signified that God in his Eternal Decree, set Christ apart for the work of our Redemption. He was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Separate from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Heb. 7. 26.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Christ's setting the Elements apart from common Bread and Wine, shewed, That he is not for common Persons to feed on. They are to be divinely, purified who touch these holy things of God; they must be outwardly separated from the World, and inwardly sanctified by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Why did Christ take Bread, rather than any other Element?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because it did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure Him. Christ was typified by the Shew bread, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 48. By the Bread which <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 14. 18. And by the Cake which the Angel brought to <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 4. Therefore he took Bread, to answer the Type.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56018:13"/>2. Christ took bread because of the Analogy; Bread did neerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him, <hi>John</hi> 6. 48. <hi>I am that bread of life.</hi> There is a threefold resemblance. 1. Bread is useful. Other comforts are more for delight than use. Musick delights the ear, colour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the eye, but Bread is the staff of Life. So is Christ useful. There is no subsisting without him, <hi>John</hi> 6. 57. <hi>He that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Bread is satisfying. If a man be hungry, bring him Flowrs or Pictures, they do not satisfie, but bread doth satiate. So Jesus Christ the bread of the soul, satisfies; he satisfies the eye with beauty, the heart with sweetness, the conscience with peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Bread is strengthening. <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 15. <hi>Bread which strengthens mans heart.</hi> So Christ, the bread of the soul, transmits strength. He strengthens us against temptations,
<pb facs="tcp:56018:13"/>he gives strength for doing and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Work. He is like the Cake, the Angel brought to the Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 8. <hi>He arose and did eat, and went in the strength of that meat forty dayes, and forty nights, unto Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb the Mount of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The second thing in the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, <note place="margin">2.</note> is, Christs blessing of the bread. <hi>He blessed it <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </gap>usest</hi> Gualt.</note>.</hi> This was  the Consecration of the Elements. Christ by his <hi>Blessing,</hi> sanctifyed them and made them Symbols of his Body and Blood <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Christ's consecrating of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, points out three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Christ in blessing the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, opened the nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the Apostles. He did unriddle this Mystery. Christ did advertise them, That as sure as they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56018:14"/>did receive the Elements corporeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so sure they did receive him into their hearts spiritually.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Christ's blessing the Elements, signified his prayer for a Blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ordinance. He prayed that these Symbols of Bread and Wine, might through the Blessing and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Ghost, sanctifie the Elect, and seal up all spiritual mercies, and priviledges to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Christ's blessing the Elements, was his giving thanks<note n="*" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Christ gave thanks, that God the Father had in the infinite riches of his Grace given his Son to expiate the Sins of the World. And if Christ gave thanks, how may we give thanks? If he gave thanks who was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56018:14"/>to shed his blood, how may we give thanks who are to drink it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Christ gave thanks, that God had given these Elements of Bread and Wine, not only to be signs, but seals of our Redemption. As the Seal serves to make over a convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Land; so the Sacrament, as a spiritual Seal, serves to make over Christ and Heaven, to such as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily receive it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing in the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, <note place="margin">3.</note> is, the Breaking of the Bread. <hi>He brake it<note n="*" place="margin">

So when Christ was bruised on the Cross, he did send out a most fragant smell. Christ's body cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, was the breaking open a Box of precious oyntment, which did fill Heaven and Earth with its perfume.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56018:15"/>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But why was Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy broken? What was the cause of his suffering?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Surely not for any desert of his own. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 26. <hi>The Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiah shall be cut off, but not for himself.</hi> In the Original it is, He shall be cut off, <hi>and there is nothing in him <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note>.</hi> There is no cause in him, why he  should suffer. The high Priest when he went into the Tabernacle, offered first, <hi>for himself,</hi> Heb. 9. 7. Though he had his Mitre or golden Plate, and did wear holy Garments; yet he was not pure and innocent; he must offer sacrifice for himself, as well as for the people. But Jesus Christ that great High Priest, though he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a bloody Sacrifice, yet not for himself.</p>
            <p>Why then was his blessed body  broken? <hi>Answ.</hi> It was for our sins<note n="*" place="margin">

Our pride made Christ wear a Crown of Thorns; as <hi>Zip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porah</hi> said to <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 4. 25. <hi>A bloody husband art thou to me:</hi> so may Christ say to his Church, A bloody Spouse thou hast been to me; thou hast cost me my heart-blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But how could Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, being God? the Godhead is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passible?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resp.</hi> Christ suffered only in the Humane nature, not the Divine. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascen</hi> expresseth it by this Simile; If
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56018:16"/>one pour water on Iron that is red hot, the fire suffers by the water, and is extinguished, but the Iron doth not suffer. So the Humane Nature of Christ might suffer Death, but the Divine Nature is not capable of any passion. VVhen Christ was in the Humane Nature suffering, he was in the Divine Nature triumphing. As we wonder at the rising of the Sun of Righteousness in his Incarnation, so we may wonder at the going down of this Sun in his Passion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But if Christ suffered only in his Humane Nature, how could his suffering satisfie for sin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By reason of the Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Union, the Humane Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united to the Divine; the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature did suffer, the Divine did satisfie. Christs Godhead did give both <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> to his sufferings. Christ was Sacrifice, Priest, and Altar. He was <hi>Sacrisice,</hi> as he was Man; <hi>Priest,</hi> as he was God and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56018:16"/>Man; <hi>Altar,</hi> as he was God. It is the Property of the <hi>Altar</hi> to sanctifie the thing offered on it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 19. So the <hi>Altar</hi> of Christs Divine Nature sanctified the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of his Death, and made it Meritorious.</p>
            <p>Now concerning Christ's suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Cross, observe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Bitterness</hi> of it to him, <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>He was broken.</hi> The very thoughts of his Suffering put him into an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 44. <hi>Being in an ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was as great drops of blood fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the ground.</hi> He was as full of sorrow as his heart could hold. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 38. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Absurd;</hi> For it is contrary, 1. To <hi>Scripture:</hi> The Scripture asserts that Christs Body is locally, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically in Heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Whom the Heavens must receive, until</hi>

            <p n="2">2. It is contrary to <hi>reason:</hi> How is it imaginable that a thing should be changed into another Species, yet continue the same?

            <p n="2">2. This Opinion of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation <note place="margin">2.</note> is <hi>impious;</hi> as appears in two things: 1. It is a Profaning Christ's body; for if the Bread in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p n="2">2. It runs men inevitably upon sin; for through this mistake, that the bread is Christs very body, there follows the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Therefore I conclude with <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> That this Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation is to be abhorred and exploded, being minted only in mens phancies, but not sprung up in the field of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, confutes such as look upon the <note place="margin">Bran.</note> Lords Supper only as an empty Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure

It was infinite goodness in Christ, to broach that blessed Vessel of his body, and let his sacred Blood stream out; and for us wilfully to omit such an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, wherein the Trophie of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is so richly displayed, and our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation so nearly concerned, well may Christ take this as an undervaluing of him, and interpret it no better than a bidding him keep his feast to himself. He that observed not the Passeover, <hi>that soul was to be cut off, Numb.</hi> 9. 13. How angry was Christ with those that stayed away from the Supper! They thought to put it off with a Complement; but Christ knew how to construe their excuse for a refusal:

               <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 24. <hi>None of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my Supper.</hi> The Rejecting Gospel-mercy is a <hi>sin</hi> of so deep a die, that God can do no less than punish it for a Contempt.

            <p>Perhaps, Some will say, They are above the Sacrament: It were strange to hear a man say he were above his Food!

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56018:27"/>is the Peace-breaker; it is like an Incendiary in the Family, that sets Husband and Wife at variance; it makes God fall out with us. Sin is the Womb of our Sorrows, and the Grave of our Comforts. But that which may most of all disfigure the Face of Sin, and make it appear Ghastly, is this, <hi>It crucified our Lord:</hi> It made Christ Vail his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and lose his Blood. If a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did see that Sword which killed her Husband, how hateful would the sight of it be to her? Do we count that Sin <hi>Light,</hi> which made Christ's Soul <hi>Heavy unto Death? Mark</hi> 14. 34. Can that be our joy, which made the Lord Jesus <hi>a man of sorrows? Isa.</hi> 53. 3.

Let our Hearts be enraged against Sin. When the Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> shewed the people <hi>Caesar's</hi> bloody Robe, they were incensed against those that slew him. Sin hath rent the White Robe of Christs Flesh, and dyed it of a Crimson Colour: let us then seek to be avenged of our Sins.

Desires are the Sails of the Soul, which are spread to receive the gale of an Heavenly Blessing. For the exciting holy desires and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, consider:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:56018:36"/>1. The magnificence and royalty of this Supper: It is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, an Heavenly Banquet. <hi>Isa.</hi> 25. 6. <hi>In this Mountain shall the Lord of Hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wine on the</hi>

Under these Elements of Bread and Wine, Christ and all his benefits are exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us. The Sacrament is, <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um aromatum</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a repository and storehouse of Coelestial Blessings. Behold here life and peace, and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion set before us! All the <hi>Dulcia fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula,</hi> the sweet delicacies of Heaven, are served in at this Feast.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To provoke Appetite, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what need we have of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual repast. The Angel perswaded <hi>Elias</hi> to take a little of the Cake, and Cruse of water, that he might not faint in his Journey, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>Arise and eat, because the Journey</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:56018:37"/>
               <hi>is too great for thee.</hi> So truly we have a great Journey from Earth to Heaven, therefore had need recruit our selves by the way: How many sins have we to subdue? how many duties to perform? how many wants to supply? how many graces to strengthen? how many adversaries to conflict with? so that we need a bait by the way; by feeding upon the body and blood of the Lord, <hi>We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our strength as the Eagle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Consider Christ's readiness to dispense Divine blessings in this Ordinance. Jesus Christ is not <hi>a sealing Fountain,</hi> but <hi>a flowing Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> 'Tis but crying, and he gives the Breast. 'Tis but thirsting, and he opens the Conduit. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>Let him that is athirst, come; and whosoever will, let him take the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life freely.</hi> As the clouds have a natural propenseness to drop down their moisture upon the Earth: So hath Christ to give forth of his

            <p n="4">4. There is no danger of excess at this Supper. Other Feasts do often cause Surfeit, it is not so here. The more we take of the bread of life, the more healthful we are, and the more we come to our spiritual complexion. Fulness here, doth not encrease <hi>humours,</hi> but <hi>comforts;</hi> in spiritual things there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream. Though a drop of Christ's blood be sweet, yet the more the better; the deeper the sweeter, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Drink abundantly O beloved.</hi> In the Original it is, Be ye <hi>inebriated<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p n="5">5. We know not how long this Feast may last: While the Manna is to be had, let us bring our Omer: God will not always be spreading the Cloth. If people lose their stomacks, he will call to the Enemy to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:56018:38"/>6. Feeding upon Christ Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, will be a good preparative to Sufferings. The bread of life will help us to feed upon the bread of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. The <hi>Cup of Blessing,</hi> will enable us to drink of the Cup of persecution. Christ's blood is a wine that hath a flavour in it, and is full of Spirits. Therefore <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us, When the Primitive Christians were to appear before the cruel Tyrants, they were wont to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then they arose up from the Lords Table, as Lyons breathing forth the fire of heavenly courage <note n="*" place="margin">Tanquam Leones ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes.</note>.  Let these considerations be as sawce to sharpen our appetite to the Lords Table. God loves to see us feed hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grily upon the bread of life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If we would come prepared 
 to this Ordinance, we must come with penitent hearts<note n="*" place="margin">5. <hi>Cur, O anima, te non trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figit gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us doloris.</hi> Austin.</note>. The Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was to be eaten with <hi>bitter herbs.</hi> We must bring our <hi>Myrrhe</hi> of Repentance; which, though it be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56018:38"/>bitter to us, it is sweet to Christ: <hi>Zac.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and mourn over him.</hi> A broken Christ is to be received into a broken heart. We that have sinned with <hi>Peter,</hi> should weep with <hi>Peter.</hi> Our eyes should be broached with tears, and our hearts steeped in the brinish wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Repentance. Say, Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, though I cannot bring sweet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and perfume thy body as <hi>Mary</hi> did, yet I will wash thy feet with my tears. The more bitterness we taste in sin, the more sweetness we shall taste in Christ.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We must come with sincere hearts. The Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> being straitned in time, wanted some legal Purifications; yet because their hearts vvere sincere, and they came vvith desire to meet vvith God in the Passeover, therefore the Lord healed the people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 19. Bad aims vvill spoil good actions. An

In the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vvhole Christ is dished-out to us, the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> nature; all kind of vertue comes from Him: Mortifying, mollifying, comforting. Oh then feed on him. This grace of Faith, is the great grace to be set on vvork at the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But doth the vertue lie simply in Faith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Not in faith considered purely as a grace, but as it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Object. The vertue is not in faith, but in Christ. A Ring vvhich hath a precious stone in it vvhich vvill staunch blood; vve say, the Ring stauncheth blood, but the vertue doth not lie barely in the Ring, but in the stone in the Ring. So, Faith is the Ring, Christ is the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stone; all that faith doth, is to bring home Christs merits to the soul, and so it justifies; the vertue is not in faith, but in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:56018:41"/>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But, Why should faith carry away more from Christ in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than any other grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because, Faith is the most receptive grace; it is the receiving of gold enricheth: So faith receiving of Christ's merits, and silling the Soul with <hi>all the fulness of God,</hi> it must needs be an enriching grace. In the Body, there are <hi>Veins</hi> that suck the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment which comes into the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and turn it into blood and spirits. Faith is such a sucking vein, that draws vertue from Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called <hi>a precious faith,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Faith hath more of Christ's benefits annexed to it, because it is the most humble grace. If Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance should fetch Justification from Christ, a man would be ready to say, This was for my tears; but Faith is humble, it is an <hi>empty hand,</hi> and What merit can be in that? Doth a poor man reaching out his hand,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56018:42"/>merit an Alms? So that, because faith is humble, and gives all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Christ and Free-grace, hence it is God hath put so much honour upon it; This shall be the grace to which Christ and all his merits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
            <p>Therefore above all graces, set faith a work in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. An Hypocritical faith is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come by. It is like the seed in the Parable, which sprung up <hi>suddenly<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. An Hypocritical faith is afraid to come to tryal. The Hypocrite had rather have his faith <hi>commended,</hi> than <hi>examined.</hi> He can no more
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56018:43"/>endure a Scripture-trial, than coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Metal can endure the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. He is like a man that hath stollen-Goods in his House, and is very unwilling to have his House searched: So the Hypocrite hath gotten some stollen-Goods which the Devil hath helped him to, and he is loth to have his heart searched; whereas true faith is willing to come to a trial, <hi>Psal.</hi> 26. 2. <hi>Examine me, O Lord, and prove me, try my reins and heart. David</hi> was not afraid to be tried by a Jury; No, though God himself were one of the Jury. Good Wares are never afraid of the light.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An Hypocritical faith hath a slight esteem of true Faith. The Hypocrite hears others speak in the commendation of faith, but he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders where the vertue of it lies; he looks upon faith as a Drugg, or some base Commodity that will not off; he will part with all the faith he hath,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56018:43"/>for <hi>a piece</hi> of silver; and perhaps it might be dear enough of the price: But that man who hath true faith, he sets an high value upon it; he reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this grace among his Jewels<note n="*" place="margin">

What puts him into a state of Sonship, but faith? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. Oh <hi>precious faith!</hi> A Believer would not exchange his <hi>shield of faith,</hi> for a Crown of gold.</p>

It would take Christ by way of surety, but not give up it self to him by way of surrender; whereas true faith is impartial, it takes Christ as a Saviour, and submits to him as a Prince.

               <hi>Abraham</hi> in the case of sacrificing his Son, did not call Reason to the Councel-board: When God said, <hi>Offer up thy son Isaac,</hi> it was enough to pose not only fleshly wisdom, but even Faith too; for here, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God did seem to interfere. In one command, the Lord said, <hi>Thou shalt not murder;</hi> and behold here a quite contrary command, <hi>Offer up thy son.</hi> So that <hi>Abraham</hi> in obeying one command, seemed to disobey another.</p>
            <p>Besides <hi>Isaac</hi> was a son of the Promise; the Messiah was to come of <hi>Isaac</hi>'s line<note n="*" place="margin">Hebr. 11. 18.</note>; and if he be cut

            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> believed that when God called for it, it was not <hi>Murther,</hi> but <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and that the Lord having made a promise of Christ's springing out of <hi>Isaac</hi>'s loyns, rather than the promise should fall to the ground, God could raise up seed out of <hi>Isaac</hi>'s ashes. Here was a Gyant-faith, which God himself did set a Trophy of honour upon. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>By myself have Isworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not with-held thy Son</hi>

Perhaps the mercy is not yet ripe, or perhaps I am not ripe for the mercy. Lord, do as it seems good in thine eyes.

                     </gap>.</note>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Christ was lifted up upon the Cross: The <hi>Pole</hi> was undoubtedly a Type of the Cross, and the lifting up of the Serpent on the Pole was a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56018:77"/>Type of Christ's being lift up upon the Cross. This was a blessed lifting up. Christ's lifting up is our lifting up. <hi>Joh,</hi> 12. 32. <hi>And I if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me:</hi> That is, all that belong to the Election. For mercy runs only in the channel of Election. O how happy was it for us, that this spiritual brazen serpent was erected. Christ's being lifted up upon the Cross, is the cause of our being lifted up to Heaven. And in the Sacrament is a solemn Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of Christ's Crucifixion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Christ is lifted up in our hearts, by our contemplating, admiring, loving him. It is not the lifting up of Christ on the Cross will save us, unless he be lifted up in our hearts. When we prize Christ, and set him highest in our thoughts and esteem, this is to lift him up in our souls. There are two chief things a Christian hath to do, to depress self, and exalt Christ.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56018:77"/>4. The brazen serpent resembled Christ in the <hi>design</hi> of its being lifted up, and that was <hi>intuition;</hi> when <hi>Israel</hi> were stung, they must look upon the Brazen serpent; which looking imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a secret hope they had of cure. So Christ was therefore lifted up on the Cross, that he may be looked upon by an eye of Faith. The people of <hi>Israel</hi> needed not to have taken down the Serpent from the <hi>Pole,</hi> and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their sores with it; they were only to look on it, and they were healed. So we need not go to fetch Christ down from Heaven (as the Papists do who make him to be corporally in the Bread); no, if we do but look upon him fiducially, we shall be cured of our sting.</p>
               <p>Observe four Things about the Brazen Serpent. There were four ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in which the Brazen Serpent would have done the people of <hi>Israel</hi> no good, though it were lifted up.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:56018:78"/>1. In case the Brazen Serpent had been set up, yet if they had not fixed their eye upon it, it would not have cured them. So though Jesus Christ be lifted up as a Saviour to the world; yet if this Brazen Serpent be not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon believingly he will not save, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already.</hi> The <hi>Arminians</hi> dream of <hi>Universal Redemption,</hi> Christ dying intentionally for all. The Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent was made a Type of Christ; now the Brazen Serpent cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not all persons, only them that looked upon it. So those who either through ignorance, or stubbornness, look not on Christ by Faith have no benefit by him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In case the people of <hi>Israel</hi> had not looked upon this Serpent <hi>Alone,</hi> if they had set up another Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent by this, and looked upon both, they had not received a cure. So after God hath set up Christ to be a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, if any shall presume to set up
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56018:78"/>another Saviour by him (as the Papists who look partly to Christ, and partly to their Merits) they can receive no sanative vertue from him. For us of the Protestant perswasion, to look upon our duties equally with Christ, our prayers and tears, as expecting they should merit salvation, this is to make two Brazen Serpents, to set up two Christs, and then we cannot be cured. We are to use duties, but to look beyond them to Christ. They are good duties, but bad Christ's. If we trust to our duties for salvation, they will be Fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents to sting us, not Brazen Serpents to heal us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In case the Brazen Serpent was set up upon a Pole, if <hi>Israel</hi> had loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked only upon their sting, and not upon the Serpent, they had not been cured. So if we look only upon our Sins, and through despair look not up to Christ, vve have no healing from
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56018:79"/>him. To keep avvay from Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of our sins, is a disparagement to Christ, as if there were more malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and poyson in sin then vertue in this Brazen Serpent. Indeed vve must look with one eye upon sin, but vvith another eye upon Christ. Look on sin vvith a penitent eye, and on Christ vvith a believing eye<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Bran.</hi> See in this Mystery the Cabinet of Free-grace opened, and God's love sparkling forth! Three ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God hath provided Christ this Brazen Serpent as a remedy for stung lapsed sinners.

               <p n="2">2. See Gods Free-grace, that some should be healed of their sting and not others. There are but a fevv healed.

He is able surely to keep it, for he is strengthen'd with the God-head: and he is not willing to loose it, for why then would he have shed his blood for it? So that no Branch shall be ever separated from the Coelestial Vine. You may sooner pluck a Star out of the Sky, than a true Believer from Christ. Indeed Hypocrites who

Wine will

Wine in a dead mans mouth loseth its vertue; but Christ's blood hath such a flavour in it; it doth so sparkle, and is so full of spirits, that it will fetch life in them that are dead. If they are <hi>dead in sin,</hi> the blood of Christ makes them revive. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 54. <hi>He that drinks my blood, hath eternal life.</hi> 4. The Wine that comes from the Grape doth but chear mans heart, but that Wine which is distilled from Christ the Heavenly Vine chears God's heart.

When <hi>Basil</hi> was threatned with banishment, he comforted himself with this, <hi>Either I shall be under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or in Heaven<note n="*" place="margin">Aut sub Coelo aut in Coelo.</note>.</hi> Oh how may  all the Branches of the true Vine flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with joy! Let death come, they may triumph: death shall destroy Sin, and perfect Grace.</p>
               <p>In particular, there is comfort to all the real Branches of Christ, in these four Cases.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:56018:96"/>1. It is comfort under fear of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual barrenness; I am afraid, saith the Saint, I shall grow dead at last, and be like that barren Figtree in the Gospel which was cursed. But for thy comfort know, that the Branches of this Spiritual Vine never cease yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit. Indeed ordinary Vine-Trees though they are for a time fruitful, yet when they grow old, they grow barren; but the Branches of the true Vine are never so old as to be past bearing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 14. <hi>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age.</hi> Believers the longer they live, the more full they are of Faith<note n="*" place="margin">2 Thes. 1. 3.</note>; the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed  with Love. The Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> the older she grew the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she grew. Her last works were <hi>more than her first,</hi> Rev. 2. 19. What a deal of fruit did <hi>Paul</hi> bring forth not long before his death! This light shined brighter before his setting, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>I laboured more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly than they all.</hi> So long as there
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56018:97"/>is a fulness in Christ, Believers shall not want. This Holy Vine being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with sap, the Branches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose but be fertil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Because I live, ye shall live also.</hi> Because the Root lives, therefore the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches shall flourish with fruit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is comfort in case of wrongs and injuries, especially when endured for Christ's sake. The Lord Jesus is sensible, and will one day vindicate his people. The Vine is sensible of all the injury done to the Branches, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>I have seen, I have seen the afflictions of my people.</hi> Not only have I seen them with an eye of <hi>inspection,</hi> but <hi>affection.</hi> Christ bleeds in the Saints wounds. He who knows their Sufferings feelingly, will avenge them speedily.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is comfort under fear of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, I am afraid, saith a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, I shall tyre before I get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Either I shall be blown down by Satan's Temptation, or faint under
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56018:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>sufferings, Oh remember thou art a Branch in Christ, and thou canst not be broken off; thou hast Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to support thee. <hi>Adam</hi> when he grew upon his own root of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency withered, but thou growest upon Christ's root, therefore thy Grace shall flourish into Persever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Though thou wert but as a bough that hangs half on the Tree, thou shouldst never drop off, because Christ holds thee: It is not thy hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Christ, but Christ's holding thee preserves thee; He repells the force of Temptation, over-pours the rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of corruption, encreaseth the spark of Grace; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Kept by the power of God.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Kept as in a Garrison.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is comfort in case of the World's hatred. <hi>Hieroni</hi> blessed God that he was counted worthy to be one whom the World hated. What though thou art maligned and hated?
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56018:98"/>God loves all the Branches of the True Vine; nay, he loveth them as he loves the Root, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 23. <hi>That the World may know, that thou hast loved Them as thou hast loved Me.</hi> It is the same love for <hi>kind,</hi> though not <hi>degree.</hi> 1. God the Father loved Christ <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> from eternity, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 34. <hi>Thou lovedst me before the Foundation of the World.</hi> And so he loves Believers, <hi>Eyhes</hi> 1. 4. <hi>He hath chosen us in him, before the foundation of the world.</hi> Our love to God began but late <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Serò nimis te amavi domine.</hi> Aug<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>. We may remember the time when we had no love in our  hearts sparkling towards the Deity; but God's love to us bears date from Eternity. 2. God's love to Christ is a love of immutability; and so it is to Believers. The Sun of electing love having risen upon them never sets. Death may take away their life, but not God's love; <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 10. <hi>The Hills shall be removed, but my</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:56018:98"/>
                  <hi>kindness shall not depart from thee.</hi> The Lord may change his love into a frown, but he will never change his love into hatred. God can no more hate a Believer then he can Christ; for a Believer is part of Christ, he is Christ-mystical. What a comfort is this, God loves the Branches as he loves the root, and the fruit of God's love to the Elect-branches appears in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>pruning</hi> of them. He prunes them by <hi>affliction.</hi> We are apt to think, when God afflicts us he doth not love us, an Husbandman loves his Vine never a whit the less, because he prunes it. Affliction is God's Pruning-Hook, he prunes us to make us bring forth <hi>the peaceable fruits af Righteousness,</hi> Hebr. 12. 11. God had rather have the Branches bleed, then be barren. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Every branch in me that</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:56018:99"/>
                  <hi>beareth fruit, he purgetb it that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi> All this is Love. It is God's love that he will rather lopp and prune the Branches, then let them grow wild.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>Transplanting</hi> them into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The Branches of Christ will thrive best when they are transplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and good reason, because then they will grow in a better soil. Christ desires to have all his Branches which are scattered up and down in the World to be with him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father I will that those which thou hast given me be with me <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <q>Ejusdem mecum gloriae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sortes.</q> 
                        <bibl>Brugens.</bibl>
                     </note>.</hi> The Elect will never be happy till they  are transplanted, Then they will grow quietly. In Heaven there will be no Bramble to tear the Vine-Branches, none of the <hi>Red Dragon</hi>'s Race. Then all the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches will be sweetly united in love. Then they shall grow in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56018:99"/>God's Countenance will be ever shining upon them. In this life they partake of Christ's Grace, and hereafter they shall partake of his Glory.</p>
