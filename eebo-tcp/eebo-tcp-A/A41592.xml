            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Introduction.</head>
            <p>IF public Applauſe, and popular Acclamations of your own Party, are to be believed, your <hi>Diſcourſe againſt Tranſubſtantiation</hi> has ſufficiently ſhewed, that the Scriptures cannot clearly demonſtrate this miraculous Change; nor the perpetual belief thereof in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, illuſtrate it; and that there are all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the World againſt it. Yet if a ſerious conſideration, and weighing of your Arguments in the Scale of Juſtice, be the Deciders of the preſent Debate, we ſhall find neither Scripture, nor belief of the Primitive Church, nor any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World, againſt Tranſubſtantiation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Chriſtian Duty, I think my ſelf obliged, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor, after my poor manner, a diſcovery of your winning Artifices, and a removal of your plauſible Appearances; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding this following Anſwer into two Parts. In my firſt, I'll examin, whether there be any tolerable ground for Tranſubſtantiation. And my ſecond, is deſigned to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe (as you think) your Invincible Objections.</p>

            <head>PART I.</head>
            <p>I Sub-divide my Firſt Part into five Sections, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the five pretended grounds, one or more of which, you ſuppoſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> builds this Doctrin on. Firſt, The Authority of Scripture. Or Secondly, the perpetual belief of this Doctrin in the Chriſtian Church. Or Thirdly, the Authority of the Church to make, or declare an Article of Faith. Or Fourthly, the abſolute Neceſſity of ſuch a Change, for the benefit of thoſe who receive this Sacrament. Or Fifthly, to magnify the Power of the Prieſt.</p>

               <p>BEfore I begin to diſcuſs whether Scripture authoriſe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation: I think it convenient to premiſe two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, upon two conſiderable Circumſtances, delivered in your Introduction.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the very firſt entrance of your Diſcourſe, you complain <hi>it is a hard word;</hi> and afterwards increaſe your complaint with this unparallel'd exaggeration. <hi>It was almoſt</hi> 300 <hi>years before this miſhapen Monſter of Tranſubſtantiation could be lick'd into that Form</hi>

                  <hi>in which it is now ſetled and eſtabliſhed in the Church of Rome.</hi> Bold Aſſertions ought to be ſupported with great Proofs: And Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Vilifications of the Divine Goodneſs expiated with more than ordinary Repentance. Heaven forbid, that our Bleſſed Saviour ſhould ever prove a miſhapen Monſter, even to thoſe who moſt oppoſe revealed Truth expreſſed in Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A hard word,</hi> and who can endure it; <hi>a new word,</hi> and who will admit it? St. <hi>Hilary</hi> anſwers you in this Reply to the <hi>Arian</hi>

               <p>The ſentiment of theſe two great Ornaments of the Church, is the common Practice of whole Sacred Antiquity; according to the Golden Sentence of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis, The Church ordinarily appropriates ſome new term</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Second Reflection upon the Evidence of Senſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you bring in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who long ſince hath pronounced, <hi>There ought to be no diſpute of the matter of Senſe.</hi> I beg Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don if I am not at leiſure, to digreſs with you towards Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm. Neither can I think you ſerious, when you quote the Philoſopher's determination, for the Myſtery of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who never profeſſed a revealed Religion, and died many Hundred years before Chriſtianity was Promulgated and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. Nor do I apprehend the leaſt danger to be overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd, with the heavy matter of Senſe, when my way leads to the Sublime matter of Revelation.</p>
               <p>You cannot deny, Senſe, Reaſon, and Faith, are three va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Perfections; ſo likewiſe are their Objects diſtinguiſhed. The <note n="*" place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> Stagyrite never pretended Senſe ſhould reach farther than to the Accidents and Appearance of things. And Reaſons employ was the contemplation of Eſſence, Nature, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47309:4"/>
How could <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> pronounce, the matter of Senſe was never to be diſputed, when 'twas always to be pry'd into, and regulated by Reaſon?</p>
               <p>Yet we do not diſpute with you, the Prerogative of Senſe in the Myſtery of the Sacrament. For we ſee the outward ſhape and appearance of Bread and Wine; nor is Taſt wanting. All this is granted. Unleſs then you perplex and embroil the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Senſe repoſes, without violation, quiet and contented in its own Objects.</p>
               <p>Nor ought you to believe, that Reaſon can ſecurely, without Error, always determin in Natural Sciences, according to the received impreſſion, from the viſible Sign, or Object of Senſe. This Maxim is given to Novices entring the liſt of Dialecticks, and admitted by the Sect of Peripateticks. So Reaſon enlarges the greatneſs of the Sun, and aſſures us, it far exceeds in bigneſs the Terreſtrial Orb, tho' Senſe incloſe it in the ſmall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of a Ball.</p>
               <p>Senſe indeed and Reaſon combining together, and following the preſcript of Logick, are the proper deciders of Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal conteſtations. Senſe pleads for no more, and if the Reaſon of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſurviv'd, it would be abundantly ſatisfi'd with this voluntary conceſſion.</p>
               <p>If for all this you reſolve to ſeat Reaſon in the Chair of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, even where Revelation intervenes, Divine Authority will eaſily reſcue Chriſtian Religion from the information of Senſe. Reaſon following the Dictamen of outward exiſtence, told <hi>Abraham,</hi> what appeared were Men; Revelation corrected the <note place="margin">Gen. 8. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</note> miſtake, and aſſured him they were Angels. Reaſon affirmed what deſcended in the ſhape of a Dove, was that Innocent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <note place="margin">Luke 3. 22.</note> Revelation reformed the Judgment, and intimated it was the Holy Ghoſt. Reaſon regards the Species of Bread as inherent to the proper Subſtance: Revelation changes that Subſtance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body of Chriſt. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw the figure and ſhape of Men, and yet the Subſtance of Man was wanting. The Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in appearance exhibited a Dove; the real Subſtance was ſupply'd with the preſence of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Again, it was a Maxim of Philoſophy, <hi>what is, was from ſomething.</hi> And this Evidence vaniſhes at the ſight of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Ex nihilo nil fit.</note> which teaches the whole Univerſe was Created of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 'Twas a Principle, There's no return <hi>from Privation, to</hi>

                  <hi>the Habit,</hi> from Death to Life; and this perſwaſion ceaſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging our Saviours Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Reaſons reluctancy proceeding from Senſes information, muſt yield to the Power of Revelation, or we muſt ceaſe to be Chriſtians. Thus <hi>Julian</hi> Apoſtatiſed, and derided Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that they were ſo ſtupid, to blindfold Reaſon with the bare word of a <hi>Crede, you muſt Believe.</hi> This in St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> is recorded.

Secondly, Faith is <hi>a pious Aſſent</hi> to Divine Teſtimony; and you boldly contradict our Saviours own words.

               <p>Our Saviour gives two Promiſes, both of the ſame thing, his own Subſtance; both contained in the 51 verſe of St. <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Bread that I will give, is my Fleſh;</hi> behold the Promiſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <note place="margin">John 6. <hi>from the Greek.</hi>

What is then this Bread which Chriſt promiſed to give in the Sacrament? Chriſt anſwers it <hi>is my Fleſh,</hi> and that Fleſh <hi>which he will give for the life of the World.</hi> Was this a piece of Bread, or the true ſubſtantial Body of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>This is peculiarly ſeconded from our Saviours appeaſing the murmur of the <hi>Capharnait's,</hi> and raiſing their Incredulity to the Myſtery of his Fleſh, by preſaging the reſuſcitation of his own dead Body, <hi>What if ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſcend up where he was before?</hi>

                     <p>I Know not upon what account you ſay, that if our Saviours words, can be taken in the Senſe of the Roman Catholic Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, this muſt be; either becauſe, <hi>there are no Figures in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;</hi> or becauſe, a <hi>Sacrament admits of no Figure.</hi> Had any of our Authors made uſe of ſuch Reaſons, or inclined the leaſt this way, you would not have omitted ſuch Authority.

                        <head>FIRST MOTIVE.</head>
                        <p>The Written Law ſhadowed future Truth, and this Truth was Chriſt. So we read <hi>Moſes</hi> ſprinkled with Blood, the Book, and People, ſaying, <hi>This is the Blood of the Teſtament which God</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Exod. 24. Heb. 9. <hi>v.</hi> 20.</note> 
                           <hi>hath enjoyned unto you.</hi> The Blood of the Ancient Covenant was the Figure of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament. This appears from the words of our Saviour in the Inſtitution; <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>This Miraculous concord of the Old and New Covenant: This repetition of the very ſame Phraſe, is an Evidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond denyal, that the former was a Symbol of the latter. And ſince you cannot underſtand the latter of Chriſts Blood ſpilt on the Croſs; Becauſe you pretend St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, his <hi>Blood was then ſhed, which is ſhed for many,</hi> which preceded the Crucificti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It follows neceſſarily to be underſtood, of the true Blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament.

                        <head>SECOND MOTIVE.</head>
                        <p>As it is true that Jeſus took Bread, ſo are we taught, that he bleſſed it. And what he brake, and what he gave to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, was without doubt, what he had bleſſed or conſecrated. The Queſtion is, what this was? None of the Evangeliſts ſay, that he gave Bread; they ſay Jeſus took Bread, and Jeſus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, what was bleſſed, broken, and given, was his Body, ſaying, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> If it was then Bread, as the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts note, <hi>Jeſus took Bread;</hi> and after the Divine Benediction or Conſecration became his Body, as Jeſus affirms, <hi>this is my Body:</hi> Then without extorting or racking of Scripture, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding figurative Gloſſes, (and wicked is the Man who ſuperads to Scripture) the facile ſenſe of Scripture readily leads to the plain Article of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>

                        <p>The Circumſtances of our Saviour urge for the Literal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of <hi>This is my Body.</hi> For Jeſus ſpoke to his Apoſtles; to his deareſt Friends; preparing to bid his laſt Adieu; and then, if ever, Sincerity diſcloſes it ſelf, without difficulty, and after a facile and intelligible Method.

                        <p>Is the conformity of Scriptures. For if Chriſt had ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to ſignifie, that the Euchariſtical Bread was only the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of his Body, it would ſurprize us what inclin'd him to make uſe of this Speech, <hi>this is my Body;</hi> and after ſuch a choice, to leave it barely without explanation, when he ſo carefully taught his Diſciples the true meaning of many eaſier Parables: 'Twould aſtoniſh us, finding the three Evangeliſts with St. <hi>Paul</hi> (who teſtifies he received the ſame Doctrin from revelation) <note place="margin">

all the ſame words, without the Leaſt alteration. And we read in Latin, Greek, Syriac, Arabic, all Verſions and Languages, nothing but the ſame expreſſion, and equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>

                        <head>FIFTH MOTIVE.</head>
                        <p>The very ſame Interpretation of other Scriptural Paſſages, wherein are grounded the chief Articles of Chriſtian Belief, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces the ſequel of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>For, I believe, adhering to Scripture as the Rule of Faith, that this Paſſage, <hi>the word was made Fleſh,</hi> imports a Subſtantial <note place="margin">Joan. in Evang. c. 1.</note> Union. I believe the <hi>conſubſtantiality</hi> of the Son with the Father, <note place="margin">Joan. 10. v. 30. Ep. 1. Joan. cap. 5.</note> included in theſe words, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> I believe one Divine Eſſence of three diſtinct Perſons revealed, in <hi>Theſe three are one.</hi> Upon theſe Teſtimonies of Holy Writ <hi>Subſtantially</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, I quietly repoſe my belief of the Incarnation of our Saviour; the Son's Divinity; and of the ſole and undivided nature of the Bleſſed Trinity.</p>
                        <p>This Method is further ſecur'd by the conſent of all thoſe who are, and pretend to be true Members of Chriſt's Religion.</p>
                        <p>Now if I follow this Determination, ſo authorized, and ſo certain; if I follow this motive of my own Conviction in other like Articles, extending the ſame uncontrol'd Interpretation, to <hi>this is my Body,</hi> I muſt neceſſarily grant this Inference, <hi>this is my Subſtantial Body.</hi> Thus my Faith ſeeks to be one; as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is one, and God one Truth.</p>
                        <p>As this literal Reflection is ſincere and pious; the figurative Explanation of our Saviour's Words wants no Fallacy nor Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. For, if I may preſume to give this ſenſe to our Saviour's Words, this is <hi>not</hi> my Subſtantial Body, this Preſumption ought to be ſtrongly grounded, as allowable, juſt, and in Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be follow'd. And if ſo, then I may lawfully give the ſame expoſition to the three alledg'd Articles. For the Scripture ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not more out of this Paſſage, <hi>The word was made Fleſh,</hi> the ſubſtantial connexion of the Second Perſon with Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or out of theſe words, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Son with the Father; or out of, <hi>theſe Three are one,</hi> the unity of Nature in three Divine Perſons; than out of <hi>this is my Body,</hi> the Subſtantial Body of Chriſt.</p>

If therefore I might lawfully underſtand our Saviour's words in an empty figurative expoſition, ſaying, <hi>this is</hi> not <hi>my</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial <hi>Body,</hi> I might rightly deduce (following the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation) then <hi>the word was</hi> not ſubſtantially <hi>made Fleſh,</hi> and ſo deny the Myſtery of the Incarnation; <hi>I and my Father are</hi> not ſubſtantially <hi>one,</hi> and ſo proſeſs Arianiſm; <hi>Theſe three are</hi> not ſubſtantially <hi>one;</hi> and ſo dividing the Divine Nature, conſtitute many Gods. Can ſuch a figurative Explanation be thought a ſincere part of the True Religion, which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, and utterly deſtroys the whole Fabrick of Chriſtianity? And ought not my own Motive in the moſt conſiderable My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſtianity, contained in Scripture, be to me the ſame in the determination of the true Senſe of <hi>This is my Body?</hi>

                        <p>And You know, that as our Saviour commanded his Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel, ſo did he oblige the People to receive the promulgated Word, and be obedient to their Paſtors. The obligation of this obedience, will laſt to the end of the world: and conſequently in the mean time will be ſtill due, to the true Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, with whom Chriſt had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to remain till the conſummation of the World. You cannot deny but the Romiſh Church has true ſucceſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and we are ſure you have left this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of true Succeſſors.</p>
                        <p>Obedience therefore to the true Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, who have defined this Catholic verity, obliges me, in the laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to believe, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> can import no leſs than the ſenſe of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>I think a ſlight conſideration of the foregoing motives, eaſily ſhews Catholics pretend not, as you would have them, that if

Tranſubſtantiation can be, <hi>it muſt be, either becauſe there are no Figures in Scripture,</hi> or <hi>becauſe a Sacrament admits of no Figures.</hi> You ſeem to be perſwaded of this, your ſelf, turning theſe imaginarie Reaſons againſt the Roman Catholic Aſſertion. But alaſs! they are no more againſt, than they were for Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. For our Saviour's words may be literally true, and yet many Figures admitted in Scripture. There may be given many Spiritual interpretations of the ſacred Text, and yet this paſſage, <hi>the Word was made Fleſt,</hi> litterally ſignifie that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon of the Bleſſed Trinity was ſubſtantially Man. There are queſtionleſs in the old and new Teſtament many Figures, and neither lookt upon as a meer Figure.

                        <p>Nor is your ſecond reaſon more efficacious than the former.

Which muſt be true, if it be falſe, that Senſe and Reaſon without the ſupport of ſome father aſſiſtance, could be deceived in ſo facile and uſual an expreſſion, of a <hi>Cup</hi> or Glaſs, put for <hi>Wine.</hi> If then the Holy Ghoſt had uſed in Scripture the Cup for Wine; I know not who could have refuſed ſuch a Figure.

                        <hi>Scotus,</hi> who tacitly intimated the cogent neceſſity of Scriptures Authority, for the real change of the ſubſtance of Bread into the Body of Chriſt, inſtancing it was determined by the Church for Tranſubſtantiation.</p>

                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was of Opinion, that according to the two literal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>this is my Body</hi> read in the acute School-man, the ſole evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Scripture, could not in <hi>Scotus</hi>'s mind, abſtracting from the declaration and univerſal practice of the Church, evidently compel the admittance of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was ſevere enough upon <hi>Scotus.</hi> Yet he diminiſhed much this ſeverity, ſaying, <note place="margin">Bellarminus, l. 3. c. 23. <hi>Tertio addit (ſcil.</hi> Scotus) <hi>quia Eccleſia Catholica in generali concilio Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam declaravit, ex Scriptura ſic declarata, manifeſte probari Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiationem.</hi>

                        <hi>the acute Schoolman added, (becauſe the Catholic Church has declared in a general Council, the true meaning of Scripture) Tranſubſtantiation may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly be proved from Scripture ſo declared.</hi> But of what mind <hi>Scotus</hi> was, the foregoing Page will ſufficiently remind the unprejudic'd Reader.</p>
                     <p>Nor can you conclude <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, granted evidence of Scripture was wanting for the Roman Cauſe, becauſe he ſaid <hi>Scotus</hi>'s aſſertion <hi>was not altogether improbable.</hi> In like manner you may argue, againſt the ſtrongeſt Demonſtration in nature.

                     <p>But we ought to reflect, theſe words of <hi>Bellarmin, not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Improbable,</hi> are grounded upon a meer ſuppoſal of two lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senſes, which touches not our Controverſie.

This Calviniſtical Senſe he had already, declared as improbable, ſaying, <hi>we will gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally demonſtrate that 'tis not probable our Saviour</hi>

                        <hi>would figuratively ſpeak.</hi> And for the Lutherans Error holding both ſubſtance of Bread and the Body together in the Sacrament, he ſays it <note place="margin">L. 3. c. 19. <hi>Nullo modo Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum Sententiam admittunt.</hi>

                        <hi>ſhares not in the ſenſe of our Saviour's words.</hi> Thus the true change of Bread into the Body of Chriſt naturally follows according to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> from the plain and evident Text of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Durandus</hi> divides the ſubſtance of Bread into Matter and Form. <note place="margin">Duran. 4 d. 11. q. 3.</note> Then adds, the Bread is converted by conſeration into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord; and the Form periſhing, the Matter is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with the Soul of Chriſt. A ſtrange manner of Explication. But what doth this avail your cauſe? For if the Form of Bread periſhes in <hi>Durandus</hi>'s explication, and the Matter be animated with the Soul of Chriſt, the remaining Accidents can neither claim Matter nor Form of Bread, and ſo the whole Subſtance of Bread is wanting.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Durandus</hi> calls your Sentiment, holding Bread remains <note place="margin">De Corp. &amp; Sang. Domini. <hi>Profanae novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis dogma.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer: We conſider ſome things as Signs, and others as Subſtances. The Sign is reaſonably called the Thing, and yet it is not, what it repreſents; ſo the Portrait of a King, is ſaid to be the King, that is, only repreſents his Majeſty. But if we conſider a thing as a Subſtance, we cannot in common Language affirm, it to be, what it is not. So Prudence will not give us leave to ſay, a Pen is Paper, becauſe a Pen is not reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong repreſentative Signs. <hi>Joſepth</hi> reaſonably affirm'd <hi>the ſeven Kine are ſeven Years,</hi> and ſo <hi>Pharao</hi> underſtood him that they were ſeven in Repreſentation, becauſe they both knew the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe was of Signs, as the Scripture teſtifies, ver. 13. <hi>And Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh ſaid unto Joſeph, in my Dream, behold I ſtood upon the bank of the River, and behold there came up out of the River ſeven Kine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our Saviour's Expreſſion, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> is as far diſtant from this Example, as the real inſtitution of the Sacrament, from the Narrative of a Dream; and therefore ought not to be underſtood as the like Expreſſion. But what connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Pharao</hi>'s Dream, and the change of Bread in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? As much as betwixt the ſame Dream and our Saviour's being Subſtantially Man. If I ſhould then argue thus, as you do, <hi>Joſeph called the ſeven Kine, ſeven Years (which Language is uſual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Hebrews)</hi> that is, ſignified ſeven Years, <hi>and ſo would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man of ſenſe underſtand the like expreſſion:</hi> Therefore when St. <hi>John</hi> ſays <hi>the Word was made Fleſh,</hi> that is, was a Figure oſ a Man or Phantaſm, is ſuch a Deduction, that no Language but Hebrew can be able to make it out.</p>

                        <p>THIS Similitude is very pleaſant, as if we ſhould go to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, to know what is our own Religion. However <hi>you believe, that he that never heard of Tranſubſtantiation, would never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any ſuch thing to be meant by our Saviour's words.</hi> And I believe a great Number of theſe who ſaw our Saviour himſelf, deny'd he was God. You believe the Bread only ſignifies Chriſt's Body, becauſe you will bilieve ſo; I diſtinguiſh what Chriſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; and becauſe he ſaid, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> I believe it was his Body; and becauſe he commanded us to do this hereafter, for a memorial of his Death and Paſſion, we obey him. Is not this to follow Scripture?</p>
                        <p>You are ſure it would never have entred into any Man's mind, to have thought, <hi>that our Saviour did literally hold himſelf in his hands, and give away himſelf from himſelf with his own hand.</hi> And I am ſure, what cannot enter into Man's thought, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power and Omnipotency can, and has operated.</p>

                        <hi>Vine:</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> interprets, and his Interpretation is true, the fruit of the Vine before Conſecration, at the Supper of the Paſſover. <hi>With deſire, ſays our Saviour, I have deſired to eat this Paſſover with you before I ſuffer. For I ſay unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God. And he took the Cup, and gave thanks, and ſaid, take this and divide among your ſelves, for I ſay unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the Vine, untill the Kingdom of God ſhall come.</hi> Is not this a plain repetition of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s words? And here ended the Paſſover or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Supper. The Inſtitution of the Sacrament immediately followed while they ſate at Table, and therefore St. <hi>Luke</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues; <hi>And he took Bread—likewiſe alſo the Cup after Supper, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament, in my Blood, which is ſhed for you.</hi> Here is the Euchariſtic Cup, which had nothing to do with the fruit of the Vine that was uſed before Conſecration at the Paſchal Supper.</p>

Neither can the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as well argue from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verſe 17. <hi>For we being many are one Bread, and one Body;</hi> that all Chriſtians are ſubſtantially chang'd, <hi>firſt into Bread, and then into the Natural Body of Chriſt,</hi> as you will have it; Becauſe we ſee no Reaſon in the World for this. And the Divine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle inſtructs us otherwiſe, declaring the preciſe and only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Unity; <hi>For we are all Partakers</hi> of the ſame Body. 'Tis Participation, not any Subſtantial Change in our ſelves makes us one in Chriſt. Nor is a preſſing Example wanting in the Apoſtle, to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>are not they</hi> (the Pagans) <hi>which eat of the Sacrifices, Partakers of the Altar?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You inſtance, the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Conſecration of the Elements, ſtill calls them <hi>the Bread, and the Cup,</hi> in three Verſes together.</p>
                     <p>This is Acute and Subtile. But each Witty Contrivance is not true. It is not true, St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Conſecrated Elements, <hi>the Bread and the Wine.</hi> We read indeed in three Verſes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the bare word of <hi>Bread</hi> attributed to the Euchariſt, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>as you eat this Bread;</hi> and this is all we read; which may be ſaid without any prejudice to the Subſtantial Change. And this for two Reaſons, both dictated by the Holy Ghoſt. Firſt, By reaſon of the outward appearance of Bread. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it formerly was Bread.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt Reaſon St. <hi>Luke</hi> authoriſes in the <hi>Acts. Behold two</hi>

                        <hi>Men ſtood by them in white apparel.</hi> Here the bare Name of Man is attributed to Angels, and Angels are only Men in appearance.</p>
                     <p>The Second Reaſon is deduced from two Subſtantial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions. We read in <hi>Exodus, They caſt down every Man his Rod,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 7. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>and they became Serpents, but Aaron's Rod ſwallowed up the Rods of the Magicians.</hi> And in St. <hi>John,</hi> when <hi>the Ruler of the Feaſt had taſted the Water that was Wine.</hi> He taſted Water, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was Wine; The Serpent is called a Rod, and was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: becauſe the Serpent, and the Wine, were formerly a Rod and Water.</p>
                     <p>It is then true, that the bare Name of bread may be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Euchariſt without any prejudice of the Subſtantial Change of Bread into the true Body of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And if it be not true that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, the Conſecrated Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Bread and Wine; it is true that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Conſecrated Bread Chriſt's Body. <hi>Jeſus took Bread, and when he</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, how can you contradict our Saviour, who ſays, <hi>this is my Body which is broken?</hi> And if it be Chriſt's Body, 'tis his real Body: for he had no Phantaſm or imaginary Body. Nor did I ever hear that Chriſt had two real Bodies. But the ſame Body may have two different exiſtences, a Natural, and Supernatural Exiſtence. For if God can give a Natural Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence to what is not, can what is, hinder God from adding a Supernatural Exiſtence?</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Words, <hi>which is broken,</hi> cannot be underſtood of the Natural Exiſtence of our Saviour's Body hanging on the Croſs, for there his Body was unbroken; whence that of St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtom, we may ſee this in the Euchariſt,</hi> and the contrary on the <note place="margin">Ibidem. <hi>Os e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus non conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is it hard to conceive, how the Body of Chriſt may be ſaid to be broken in the Sacrament. For as a Subſtance is ſaid to be viſible, by reaſon of the viſible accidents which environ it; Thus we commonly ſay, I ſaw a Man, and yet nor Soul, nor Subſtance of the Body, but only the ſhape and outward appearance of the Subſtance, was the object of the Eye. So likewiſe Chriſt's Body in the Sacrament, takes the denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>broken</hi> from the Species of Bread, which is truly divided.</p>

                     <head>Article V. The Silence of the Apoſtles at the Inſtitution.</head>
                     <p>YOU ought not to be ſurpriſed if the Diſciples (frequently full of Queſtions and Objections) ſhould make no difficulty of this matter, when our Saviour inſtituted the Sacrament: <hi>not ſo much as ask our Saviour, How can theſe things be? or tell him, We ſee this to be Bread and Wine, and thy Body diſtinct from both.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My reaſon is, becauſe when the <hi>Jews</hi> and the Diſciples were blamed for theſe inquiries, at the promiſe of our Saviour;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47309:19"/>
the Apoſtles (aſſiſted with Divine Grace) gave credit to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Words. And if they believed the Promiſe, why ſhould they be diſquieted at the Inſtitution?</p>
                     <p>We read after theſe words in St. <hi>John,</hi> (where the Promiſe of Chriſt in the Sacrament is given, <hi>The Bread which I will give is my Fleſh:)</hi> This Paſſage, <hi>the Jews therefore ſtrove amongſt themſelves, ſaying, how can this man give us his Fleſh to eat?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Jewiſh Oppoſition was ſeconded with the murmur of Chriſt's Diſciples, <hi>many therefore of his Diſciples when they had heard this, ſaid, This is an hard ſaying, who can hear it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This murmur after all our Saviour's Arguments to ſettle the Jews in the belief of what was promiſed, ended in a plain deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or leaving of Jeſus, <hi>from that time many of his Diſciples went and walked no more with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is the reluctancy you ſought for, and the Objections you demanded in the Apoſtles. But do you think this Reſiſtance was laudable in the Jews? Do you believe this Oppoſition was commendable in the Diſciples? Or rather, to be diſturbed at our Saviour's Ordination and Aſſertion, Is it not the beginning of Incredulity? And yet for all this, you raiſe Senſe, and erect it as an Idol to the Peoples Devotions.

                     <p>NOR are you more fortunate in St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who ſpeaking <note place="margin">L. 4. c. 37.</note> of the Sacrament, ſays. <hi>The Bread which is from the Earth receiving the Divine Invocation, is now no longer common Bread, but the Euchariſt, conſiſting of two things, the one earthly, the other heavenly.</hi> For, what is earthly, may not unfitly be called the ſpecies of Bread; and what is heavenly, Chriſt himſelf. Or what if I ſhould attribute this earthly thing to Chriſt's Humanity, and the heavenly thing to Chriſt's Divinity, the Sacrament would be rightly ſaid, <hi>conſiſting of two things, the one earthly, the other heavenly?</hi> I am ſure the Proper Subſtance of Bread, is nothing but Common Bread; And yet St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirms, this ceaſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conſecration; <hi>receiving the Divine Invocation, 'tis no longer Common Bread,</hi> it is not what it was before.</p>
                     <p>You inſtance, and elſewhere he hath this Paſſage; <hi>when</hi>

                        <hi>therefore the Cup that is mixt, and the Bread that is broken, receives the Word of God, it becomes the Euchariſt of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, of which the ſubſtance of our Fleſh is increaſed, and ſubſiſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> diſcourſes not here of a natural, but of ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual increaſe of Fleſh and Blood. For he ſays, <hi>our Fleſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with the Bread,</hi> as it becomes the Body and Blood of Chriſt, in which ſenſe preciſely, 'tis only ſupernatural Food.</p>
                     <p>Bread, as it is ſupernatural Food, or the true Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, increaſes the Soul with Grace; and Fleſh and Blood with a Legitimacy of Immortality. Theſe two great Benefits are neatly delivered, as the proper effects of Chriſt's ſubſtantial preſence in the Sacrament, <note place="margin">Catech 37. <hi>Oportet autem ſicut exitiale, ita etiam ſalutare medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentum admitti intra viſcera ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, ut per illa diſtribuatur in univerſum Corpus, virtus ejus quod fert opem.

                        </note> in theſe words of the <hi>Nyſſene</hi> Doctor; <hi>As the dire conſequence of Poyſon is by Counterpoyſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; ſo the wholſome remedy, which operates our Salvation, entring the Bowels of Man, thence every-where diffuſes its force and vivification.

                        <hi>which was the beginning of Life.</hi> What can more evince Chriſt's ſubſtantial Preſence, to be the productive Cauſe of Sacramental Grace, than to teſtifie, this Adorable Body, which died for us, is in ours, as a wholſome remedy, there communicating Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and diſpenſing heavenly Treaſures?</p>
                     <p>So is the ſame true Body of Chriſt preſent in the Sacrament, the cauſe effective of our future Incorruption in Glory; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes in this ſenſe the ſubſtance of Fleſh and Blood, with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Immortality; as appears from the following Lines of the ſame Father. <hi>Jeſus,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eâ de cautâ per ſuae Gratiae diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſationem, ſe per Carnem inſerit, omnibus credentibus, commiſſus &amp; contemperatus corporibus creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, quibus ſubſtantia eſt ex pane &amp; vino, ut unione cum eo quod eſt immortale, ſit etiam homo particeps incorruptionis.</note> 
                        <hi>according to the diſpenſation of Grace, enters by Fleſh into thoſe who believe, mixing himſelf with the Body of the Faithful, that Man may become Partaker of Incorruption, by the union with this Immortal Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſecond benefit in St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s mind increaſes the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Fleſh and Blood, giving a beginning of reſurrection to the Body: Or, to uſe this Saint's Example; <hi>As a grain of Wheat diſſolved in earth, riſes by the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>This agrees well with St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s deſign, demonſtrating in the place objected, that our Bodies are capable of Reſurrection, becauſe we receive in the Sacrament the true Body of Chriſt, that Body which conſiſts of Fleſh, Blood and Bones. <hi>How can they deny,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Fleſh to be capable of the Gift of God? For we are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones. This is not ſpoken of a Spiritual or Metaphorical Man, for a Spirit has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bone nor Fleſh, but it is delivered according to the diſpoſition of Man, which conſiſts of Fleſh, of</hi>

                        <hi>Greeks had taken ſome Servants of the Chriſtian Catecumeni</hi> (that is,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47309:21"/>
ſuch as were diſpoſed, but not yet baptized) <hi>and afterwards ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them by violence, to tell them ſome of the ſecrets of the Chriſtians. Theſe Servants having nothing to ſay, that might gratifie thoſe who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered violence to them, except only that they had heard from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that the Divine Communion was the Blood and Body of Chriſt; they thinking, that it was really Blood and Fleſh, declared as much to thoſe who queſtion'd them. The Greeks taking this as it really were done by the Chriſtians, diſcovered it to others of the Greeks, who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon put</hi> Sanctus <hi>and</hi> Blandina <hi>to the torture, to make them confeſs it. To whom</hi> Blandina <hi>boldly anſwered, how would they endure to do this, who by way of exerciſe (or abſtinence) do not eat that Fleſh which may lawfully be eaten?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if we conſider <hi>Blandina</hi>'s Anſwer, we ſhall find therein contained, a pious denyal of what was objected, and a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an reſerve of what was received in the Sacrament. A pious denial of eating the Fleſh and Blood of a Child, as the Greeks (and all Pagans) conceived, after a carnal manner, which ſhall be more amply diſcourſed hereafter. And this cauſed <hi>Blandina</hi> to ſay, <hi>How could they be guilty of ſuch a heinous eating? who abſtain, upon faſting days from Fleſh which may lawfully be eaten?</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian reſerve, not diſcovering the Myſtery to Pagans, which was eſteemed a betraying of Religion.</p>

                     <p>This Father's deſign here, is to confute the Marcionites, who defended that the God of the Old Teſtament, was oppoſite to God the Father of Chriſt, Author of the New Law.

                        <hi>your own Goſpel, calling Bread his Body, making known by this, that Chriſt, whoſe Body the Prophet repreſented in Bread, long before he fulfilled this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, gave from this very time</hi> (of the Prophecy) <hi>Bread to be the Figure of his Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Words, <hi>Chriſt gave the Bread,</hi> even from the time of <hi>Jeremy, to be the Figure of his Body,</hi> repreſent Chriſt as Maſter; and theſe others, <hi>Jeremy repreſented in Bread the Body of Chriſt,</hi> exhibit the Prophet as Miniſter.

to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> proves the concord of Chriſt with the ancient Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s peculiar Task.</p>

Theſe following Words are another Confirmation, <hi>But it would not have been a Figure of his Body, if there was not a true Body.</hi> He does not ſay, <hi>it was not a Figure,</hi> he ſays, <hi>it would not have been a Figure in the Old Law.</hi> 3. <hi>Marcion</hi> argues for you, <hi>but why did he call Bread his Body,</hi> and not ſomething elſe? <hi>Tertullian</hi> anſwers, that he argued thus, <hi>not knowing Bread was an ancient Figure of the Body of Chriſt, as we learn</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 40. <hi>Non intelligens ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terem fuiſſe iſtam Figuram Corporis Chriſti dicentis per</hi> Jeremiam.—</note>

                        <hi>Old Figure of Blood in Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It follows alſo from hence, that our Saviour's Body, was not a Phantaſm or an Appearance, which was another of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionits Errors, but a real Body; not that the Sacrament, as you would have it, but that Bread in the Old Law, as I have demonſtrated, was a Figure and Image of his Body in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; which muſt be a true Body; otherwiſe there is a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Figure, which your own party will not allow of <hi>Nor could it,</hi> adds <hi>Tertullian, have been a Figure of his Body, if there had not been a true and real Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If for all this you will pretend, that as Bread in the Prophet was a Figure, ſo likewiſe is Bread ſtill in the Euchariſt a Figure of Chriſt's Body; I may without prejudice to the Catholic Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, humour you ſo far, as to grant the Sacramental Bread is a Figure, but a Figure joyned to the Reality. For if you will ſay, what you find not in <hi>Tertullian, that the Bread in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Figure of Chriſt's Body,</hi> you cannot deny but you read in this Father, that Chriſt <hi>made the Bread his Body,</hi> as we read in St. <hi>John, he made Water Wine.</hi> The Sacrament may then be a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and the true Body.</p>
                     <p>Thus he proves the ſame thing to be called a Figure, and yet to be the ſame ſubſtance, inſtancing, <hi>the Word is God, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">L. 5. contra Marc. <hi>Deus eſt &amp; Effigies.</hi>

                        <hi>an Image too.</hi> The Catholic Church only diſallows thoſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which exclude the true Subſtance of Chriſt's Body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Sacrament.</p>

You urge a ſecond Teſtimony from the ſame Author, uſing this Argument againſt the Sceptics, who rejected the certainty <note place="margin">L. de cap. 17.</note> of Senſe, <hi>He might be deceived in the voice from Heaven, in the ſmell of the Oyntment, with which he was anointed againſt his burial, and in the taſte of the Wine, which he conſecrated in the remembrance of his Blood.</hi> Theſe laſt Words are ſomewhat changed; <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays, <hi>he taſted not another</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Non alium poſtea Vini ſaporem quod conſecravit in Sanguinis ſui memoriam.</note> 
                        <hi>Savour of Wine which he conſecrated in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This learned Father eſtabliſhed two Principles. 1. That Chriſt was truly Man. And 2. That his Operations were real like other Mens.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt Verity, was not here <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Theme. This he vindicated againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> where he proved that Chriſt was not a Phantaſm, or Appearance.</p>
                     <p>The Second Verity <hi>Tertullian</hi> here made good, againſt the Sceptics. For if the ſound of the Voice from Heaven was not imaginary, if the Smell of the Perfume was not Odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and if there was not another Taſt of the Wine, which was conſecrated in remembrance of Chriſt's Blood; then theſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of our Saviour were not diſtinct from vulgar Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like thoſe Impreſſions other Men naturally receive, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, real, and without deluſion. All Catholics grant as much, and none will deny the ſame Taſt of Wine after Conſecration. But the Taſt is not the Subſtance of Wine.</p>
                     <p>The Subſtance of Wine is not here ſpoken of. And the knowledge of Subſtance is the proper endeavour of Reaſon. Senſes care is to ſearch into the certainty of Colour, Taſt, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Appearances, which was <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Province againſt the Sceptics.</p>
                     <p>The whole Controverſie then between us is left by this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction entire and untouched.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Critical Cenſures take all aſſurance from your Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, rendring it either dubious, or depraved, or heretical.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, if <hi>Origen</hi> in this Paſſage, ſhould downright pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Catholic Belief of the change of Bread into the Body of Chriſt, this ought not to diſquiet any ſober Inquirer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his chief Error was the excluſion of the literal Senſe in Scripture. Whereupon <hi>Lirinenſis</hi> calls <hi>Origen</hi> the Interpreter <note place="margin">Lirin. in Comm. <hi>St.</hi> Epiph. Haer. 64. Theoph. l. Paſch. 1. Con. Gen. 5.

St. <hi>Epiphanious</hi> complains he turned all into Allegories. <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſays, <hi>he ſupplants by Shades and Images the Truths of Scripture.</hi> And the Church in the Fifth Oecumenical Council, peculiarly anathematiſed his Works.</p>
                     <p>Finally, If I ſhould anſwer, by <hi>what is material</hi> is underſtood only the material Accidents of Bread and Wine which go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Belly, and are caſt into the Draught, what inconvenience would follow, from your Objection? No more, than what follows from what the ſame Father adds by way of explication, <hi>It is not the matter of the Bread, but the Word which is ſpoken over it, which profiteth him who worthily eateth the Lord; and this</hi> (he ſays) <hi>he had ſpoken, concerning the Typical and Symbolical Body.</hi> So that the Matter of Bread receives the Word of God ſpoken over it, and this Word, as it changes the Subſtance of Bread, ſo doth it profit the worthy Receiver; and this Word <hi>Origen</hi> calls the Typical and Symbolical Body of Chriſt, becauſe the Word is Spiritual Food. Thus the fame Father, in his Homilies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Leviticus</hi> proves Chriſt's Fleſh to be true Meat, becauſe <hi>all</hi>

                     <p>At leaſt, if this will not do, you reſolve to do the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs by drawing out of the ſame Homily, <hi>a killing Letter</hi> of the New Teſtament. <hi>For if,</hi> ſays <hi>Origen, we take according to the Letter, that which is ſaid, except ye eat my Fleſh, and drink my Blood, this Letter kills.</hi>

                     <p>This Letter <hi>except ye eat my Fleſh,</hi> (underſtood of the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial preſence of Chriſt's Body after a Sacramental manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible to Senſe, under the ſpecies of Bread,) is what gives life in the Catholic Church, according to that of St. <hi>John, who ſhall eat my Fleſh, ſhall live for ever.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>If Roman Catholics be out of danger, the blow muſt fall elſe where. It falls upon the Capharnaits, who following the naked Letter, carnally thought our Saviour would give his Fleſh to be ſerved in as common Meat, and cut in Pieces. It falls upon thoſe who literally adhering to what they ſee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they receive, what it ſeems to be, Bread. Upon both theſe it falls.</p>
                     <p>

I ſhall not be ſtrictly put to it, for an Anſwer, after I have <note place="margin">Jeſus oſtendens gentium Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ſuccedere in locum quem Judaei perdide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant de aqua vinum fecit.</note> thus propoſed St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s mind. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> compares here the Jews to Wine, the Gentiles to Water, at the Marriage of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan. The want of Wine marked out the Jews, who refuſed to embrace the Law of Chriſt; The plentifulneſs of Water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Gentiles converted to Chriſtianity. Hence Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comes in the Sacrament to deſign the Elected People, Wine the Blood of Chriſt, and both mixt in the Chalice, the union of the People with Chriſt. Now to your Argument. And that I may the better convince you, give me leave to make uſe of your Logic.</p>
                     <p>Water is the People as Wine is Chriſt; then as we receive Chriſt by Faith in the Sacrament, ſo do we the People: And conſequently the People ſanctify the Soul as Chriſt doth in the Euchariſt. Are you not aſhamed of your Sophiſm? Or rather, how durſt you equalize the People with Chriſt, Sinners with their Saviour, Man with God?</p>
                     <p>Again, Wine ſignified the Jews, according to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and Water the Gentiles; now deduce from hence, the Water was not changed into Wine at the Marriage of Canaan, as you have done from the like inſtance, that the mixed Chalice is not changed into Chriſt's Body and Blood.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>This is as much as to ſay, be not ſcandalized, that I told you, ye ſhall eat my Fleſh, and drink my Blood, ye ſhall not eat it as ye imagine, in the ſhape you ſee it, bruzing, cutting, dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting my Fleſh.

                        <p>This I ſhall endeavour to manifeſt in examining the ſenſe of theſe two Propoſitions, which contain the force of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 1. Ye muſt <hi>underſtand ſpiritually what I have ſaid.</hi> 2. <hi>Ye are not to eat the Body which ye ſee.</hi>

                        <p>The Word <hi>Spiritually,</hi> excluding the Carnal ſenſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharnaits, eſtabliſhes a miraculous or a ſupernatural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. So when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Iſaac was born according to the</hi>

the barrenneſs of his Mother. In like manner, when St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> names this Word <hi>Spiritually,</hi> or Word of Spirit, he does not deny that the Bread is Fleſh, but intimates that the power of God is required to quicken Bread into the Body of Chriſt.

                        <p>If I ſhould deny, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks here of receiving the Sacrament, you would be puzled to find out a warrant for your famous Aſſertion. For many Learned Writers judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly remark, that theſe words, <hi>except ye eat of my Fleſh,</hi> in Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Senſe may be thus explicated, except ye eat it by Faith, by Piety, by Good Works, which is a Spiritual Communion (out of the Sacrament) of the Paſſion of our Lord. And if this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47309:28"/>
be true, as it is more than probably ſo, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays here what all Catholics profeſs; For we all ſay we may communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſpiritually of the Paſſion of Chriſt by Faith believing in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, when we receive not the Sacrament; and yet we believe in the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>But if you will ſtill keep this Holy Father, whoſe Learning has always been the Admiration of Mankind, <hi>out of his wits,</hi> to uſe your Phraſe; a ſlight reflection, ſuppoſing he ſpeaks here of Sacramental Communion, will help him to return to himſelf, and reconcile him to the Catholic Affirmation.</p>
                        <p>I think one of a mean Capacity can diſtinguiſh the manner of eating, and the thing eaten.

For although the true Body be taken in the ſhape of Bread, into the Mouth, and let down into the Stomack, yet it is not ground with the Teeth, or ſeparated in pieces. We are taught after a Spiritual manner to eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man. Liſſen to the Voice of God, and you'l hear the Goſpel mention eating a Man, <hi>take, eat, this is my Body.</hi> The manner is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, <note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> for the Body is given in the ſhape of Bread; and in this Senſe St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls theſe words, <hi>except ye eat my Fleſh,</hi> a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Speech.

Fruit of the Vine, is Wine; and from the ſide of our Saviour ran Fountains of Blood, on the reſt of his Body: The Prophet rightly foretold that <hi>He waſhed his Robe in Wine, and his Cloths in the Blood of the Grape.</hi> Again ſpeaking to <hi>Eraniſtes,</hi> he purſues with another Simile, Jeſus called his Body Bread, and his Fleſh Wheat; But in the inſtitution of the Sacrament he called Bread his Body, and Wine his Blood; Though naturally the Body is called the Body, and Blood is called Blood; but our Saviour changing the Names, gave to his Body the Name of Symbol, and to the Symbol or Sign, the Name of his Body. <hi>Eraniſtes</hi> urges to know the cauſe of this change of Names. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxus</hi> anſwers, Nothing more eaſie to the Faithful. <hi>For he would have thoſe who partake of the Divine Myſteries, not to attend to the nature of things, which are ſeen, but by the change of Names, to believe the change which is made by Grace; for he who called that, which by nature is a Body, Wheat and Bread, and again called himſelf the Vine, he honoured the Symbol with the name of his Body and Blood, not changing nature, but adding Grace to nature.</hi> This is a full view of the matter in debate.</p>
                        <p>We ought to reflect, that as <hi>Theodoretus</hi> compares here Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural paſſages, wherein they reſemble one another, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently acknowledges the Similitude of the already mention'd Expreſſions. So alſo was he not ignorant of their differences. And therefore he ſaid, <hi>Jeſus</hi>

                           <hi>changed the Names, that by their change the Faithful might believe, that alteration which Grace effected.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The change of names is acknowledged to proceed from a change made in the Sacrament. For he obliges the Faithful to believe a change which is made, <hi>not in the nature of things which are ſeen,</hi> for the natural Signs or outward appearances remain; it muſt be then in ſome inward thing, not ſeen, or Subſtance of the Symbol effected by Grace, or the Word of God. This in another place he profeſſes in theſe Words, <hi>Chriſt gave his preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body not only to the Eleven Apoſtles, but alſo to the Traytor Judas.</hi> This cannot be properly <hi>Grace added to Nature,</hi> for <hi>Judas</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his own condemnation. It muſt be then the Body of Chriſt <note place="margin">Comm in Epla. ad Cor.</note> made by Grace of the Subſtance of Bread, and added to the Nature or remaining appearance of the Signs which was given to the Traytor.</p>

How do you call theſe Symbols after conſecration? <hi>Orthod.</hi> The Body and Blood of Chriſt. <hi>Eraniſt.</hi> Do you believe you receive the Body and Blood of Chriſt? <hi>Orthod.</hi> I do believe. <hi>Eraniſt.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Symbols of our Lord's Body and Blood, are one thing before the invocation of the Prieſt, <hi>but after the invocation are changed and become another thing, ſo the Body of our Lord after his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, is changed into the Divine Subſtance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> had not believed that the Symbols were truly changed in Subſtance after conſecration, how could <hi>Eraniſtes</hi> have deduced the change of the Human Nature into the Divine Subſtance? He could not argue this out of his own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. For admitting no Body of Chriſt in Heaven, how could he pretend a real Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament? whence the Proteſtant Centuriators ſay, <hi>Theodoretus dangerouſly</hi>

                           <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> anſwers, <hi>you are caught in your own net, becauſe the Myſtical Symbols after Conſecration do not paſs out of their own Nature, for they remain in their former Subſtance, Figure and Appearance, and may be ſeen and handled even as before.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As Bread is properly ſaid to have Subſtance and Nature, which are neither ſeen, nor handled; ſo likewiſe the Accidents of Bread may be ſaid, though not ſo commonly, to have their own Nature and Subſtance, which may be ſeen and handled. <note place="margin">

                           </note> Whence that of St. <hi>Auſtin, What is not a Subſtance is nothing at all.</hi> 'Tis in this ſenſe <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> holds, the ſubſtance of the Symbols remains. And leſt we ſhould doubt what this ſubſtance is, he tells us 'tis <hi>Figure and Appearance.</hi> Nor is this a conſtrained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47309:30"/>
For what more uſual, when we have uttered ſome word, either harſh in expreſſion, or difficult to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, than forthwith to add another, ſofter in Language, and more obvious to the Hearer. Thus <hi>Theodoretus</hi> ſaying, <hi>They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their former ſubſtance,</hi> adds, that is, <hi>they remain in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Figure and appearance, and may be ſeen and handled, even as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> Nor are theſe latter Expreſſions referable to Subſtance, ſtrictly taken for the inward thing, becauſe this properly, is neither ſeen nor handled.</p>
                        <p>Now if you ask what theſe Symbols are interiorly, <hi>Theodoretus</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Intelliguntur ea eſſe quae fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta ſunt, &amp; adorantur &amp; creduntur.</note> confeſſes, <hi>they are, what they were made, Chriſt's Body.</hi> And they <hi>are believed and adored as being thoſe very things which they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi> Which Words, if the Bread be not ſubſtantially chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into Chriſt's Body, teach plain Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>Nor could <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> ſay the interiour Subſtance of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, was not changed, in his own Opinion; for this he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted, in theſe Words, <hi>They are changed and become after conſecration another thing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> pretends indeed that he caught his Adverſary in his own Net. But this was not becauſe <hi>Eraniſtes</hi> believed the Subſtance of the Symbols was not changed into Chriſt's Body; for he thought Chriſt's Body was no where extant. How then was he caught in his own Net? He was caught in his own Net, becauſe theſe Myſtical Symbols, were not changed in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>(for after conſecration they may be ſeen and handled)</hi> and they <hi>were Symbols ſtill of Chriſt's true Body,</hi> which <hi>Eraniſtes</hi> had formerly granted; and therefore there was a true Body of Chriſt; and ſo the Body of Chriſt was not changed into the Divinity, as <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> had argued. Thus <hi>Eraniſtes</hi> was caught in his own Net.</p>
                        <p>Nor ought <hi>Theodoretus</hi> to be cenſured for Singularity, in giving the Name of Nature and Subſtance, to accidental Beings. For St. <hi>Hilary</hi> gives the ſame to Proprieties; Saying, <hi>That the Flames</hi>

                     <p>THESE Words of <hi>Gelaſius, The Subſtance of Bread and Wine, doth not ceaſe to be,</hi> are already ſatisfied by what I have ſaid to <hi>Theodoretus,</hi> that is, the outward ſhape of Bread remains. And if theſe Words immediately following what you objected, had been cited, the difficulty would have been removed. <hi>They</hi> (the inward Subſtance of Bread and Wine) <hi>paſs by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt into a Divine Nature, yet remaining in the propriety of their Nature.</hi> It is only the Proprieties of the Nature of the Bread and Wine, the Colour, and the Taſt, that remain. The Subſtance is changed; For how could the inward Subſtance of Bread and Wine paſs by Divine operation into Chriſt's Body, and not ceaſe to be? how can a Proteſtant paſs into the Roman Catholic Church, and become a pious Member thereof, and not truly ceaſe to be a Proteſtant?</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Gelaſius</hi> is not the learned Pope <hi>Gelaſius;</hi> and I need not <note place="margin">Gelaſ. de duab. Nat. Bib. Pſal. Tom. 4.</note> labour to prove this.

This Author ranks the Works of <hi>Euſebius Caeſarienſis</hi> among thoſe of the Orthodox Fathers, which cannot be ſaid of the pious and learned Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> who numbers the ſame <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his own Authentic Works, with Apocryphal Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. There is then not one of our Popes againſt Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation: And if you cannot alledg one Pope from the beginning of Chriſtianity, who teaches contrary to what is now profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Roman Church, concerning this conteſted Article of Faith, is it not a great Argument that it was alwaies taught in the Church of God?</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The intern Grace of the Holy Ghoſt received in Baptiſm, properly conſtitutes us the true Sons adoptive of God, which could not be conferr'd on our Saviour; for he was enriched with the plenitude of perfection, and was the natural Son of God. Yet Chriſt may be ſaid, <hi>Facundus</hi> urges, to receive the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sons, becauſe he vouchſafed to receive Baptiſm, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Adoption. Then ſeeking an Example to verify that Baptiſm may be called Adoption, though it was not, but only contain'd the Grace of Adoption, was forced inſtancing the Bleſſed Sacrament, barely to conſider the Sacrament in the outward Species of Bread in the Euchariſt, which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Body and Blood of Chriſt; becauſe it contains the Body and Blood of Chriſt. What is contain'd in Baptiſm, is it not the proper Grace of Adoption? and what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Conſecrated Species, is the true Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>

A third Eſſay muſt be acknowledged in the Simonits, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandrians, Gnoſtics, and Marcioniſts, who placing in Chriſt only a Phantaſm, indirectly rejected the verity of Chriſt's true Body and Blood in the Sacrament.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Berengarius</hi> was born at <hi>Tours</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> After he had finiſhed the ordinary courſes of Studies, he taught Grammar and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.

About the Year 1149, he went for <hi>Angers,</hi> where he was kindly entertained, and conſtituted by <hi>Bruno</hi> the Arch Biſhop, his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon. Here he began to ſow ſeveral Errors; <hi>Viz.</hi> That Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were not to be baptized; that Marriage might be diſſolved; that our Saviour could not enter in where his Diſciples were, <hi>The Door's ſhut;</hi> as we learn from <hi>Guitmundus, Theoduinus,</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Examen of your Solution given to Mr.</hi> Arnauld<hi>'s Demonſtration.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> a learned man in <hi>France,</hi> pretended very rightly, that it was impoſſible, that our Doctrin, if it had been new, ſhould ever have come in, in any Age, and been received in the Church, and conſequently it muſt of neceſſity have been the perpetual Belief of the Church in all Ages. For if it had not been always the Doctrin of the Church, when ever it had attempted firſt to come in, there would have been a great ſtir and buſsle about it, and the whole Chriſtian World would have roſe up in oppoſition to it. But you have ſhewn no ſuch time, when firſt it came in, and when any ſuch oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was made to it, and therefore it was always the Doctrin of the Church.</p>
                  <p>It is true, you would fain have me believe, that <hi>Rabanus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and <hi>Heribaldus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> and <hi>Bertram</hi> oppoſed this Doctrin with all their might. But what you have alledg'd from their Writings, do not convince me. <hi>Bertram</hi> indeed ſays, the Writers of that Age talked according to their ſeveral Opinions, <hi>differently about the Myſtery of Chriſt's Body and Blood, and were divided by no ſmall Schiſm.</hi> But what was this Schiſm? This Schiſm or difference according to <hi>Bertram,</hi> preciſely conſiſted in two Queſtions. Firſt, Whether there was a Figure in the Myſtery. Secondly, Whether the Bread that was chang'd into Chriſt's Body, was the Natural Body of Chriſt, which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bertram</hi> in the firſt part of his Treatiſe undertook to ſhew, that there was a Figure in the Myſtery, as the concluſion of his Diſcourſe in the end evidences in theſe Terms; <hi>From what I have heitherto ſpoken, 'tis clear, that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                           <hi>Ex his omnibus quae hactenus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta ſunt, monſtratum eſt, Corpus &amp; Sanguis Chriſti, quae fidelium ore in Eccleſia percipiuntur, Figurae ſunt, ſecurdum Speciem viſibilem.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>the Body of Chriſt, which the Faithful receive into their Mouths, is a Figure, if we regard the viſible Species.</hi> And leſt any one ſhould impeach him of Error in the Sacrament, he ſtraight added, <hi>But if we conſider the inviſible Subſtance the Body and Blood truly there exiſt,</hi> Grounding himſelf upon this Principle, <hi>that the Subſtance of Bread</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:47309:35"/>
                     <hi>was changed, and the outward appearance only remained,</hi> he could not conceive how his Adverſaries (who, <hi>though they faithfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi> with <hi>Bertram</hi> and the Church, <hi>that the Bread was changed into the true Body of Chriſt,</hi> yet they deny'd there was any Figure in the Sacrament) could recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile <note place="margin">Quo credunt deſtruere compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur, Corpus etenim, Sanguiném<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que fideliter confitentur, &amp; cum hoc faciunt, non hoc jam eſſe quod prius fuere procul dubio poteſtantur, &amp; ſi aliud ſunt quàm fuere mutationem accêpere.</note> Faith with their Opinion. And this was his Reaſon; <hi>For if the Bread and Wine were another thing than they were before Conſecration, they were changed.</hi> And if the Subſtance was changed, the viſible ſpecies which remained muſt be a Figure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rabanus</hi> ſpeaking of the Second Propoſition, <hi>viz. Whether the Bread, which was changed into the Body of Chriſt, was the Natural Body of Chriſt,</hi> declares, that it was not the Body of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in its natural exiſtence, but that it was the true Body which he received from the Virgin after a Supernatural and Sacramental Permanency.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Opinion which he rejects, he charges with Novelty, <note place="margin">Ep. ad Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald. c. 33.</note> in the paſſage you cite, Saying, <hi>Some of late not having a right Opinion, concerning the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Lord, have ſaid; that this is the Body and Blood of our Lord which was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and in which our Lord ſuffered upon the Croſs, and roſe from the Dead: which Error we have oppoſed with all our might.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other, which was the belief of the Church, he thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers: <hi>God effected whatever he would in Heaven and on Earth.</hi> From hence he deduces, that Bread is chang'd into the Body of Chriſt; and therefore adds, <hi>it is no other Fleſh, no other truly than what was born of the Virgin</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <note place="margin">De Sanguine Domini, cap. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſuffered upon the Croſs, and roſe from the</hi>

                     <hi>Sepulcher. And who does not believe this, if he had ſeen Chriſt upon the Croſs in the likeneſs of a Servant, how would he have underſtood he was God, unleſs</hi>

From hence it is plain, that what is now the very Doctrin of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the Sacrament, the two Learned Authors you have alledged, <hi>Bertram</hi> and <hi>Rabanus,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver oppos'd.</p>
                  <p>But you tell us, though for a more clear and ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the pretended Demonſtration of Mr. <hi>Arnauld, you have conſented to untie the knot, yet you could without all theſe pains have cut it.</hi> If you ſtrive to cut it with no more skill than you have endeavor'd to untie it, the work muſt be the labor of ſome Nobler Champion. 'Tis true, you make uſe of (in hopes to do the buſineſs) <hi>Diogenes</hi> plain ſtroke of experience o'recoming <hi>Zeno</hi>'s denial of Motion, by walking before his Eyes. Is then the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation not the belief of the Primitive Church, <hi>becauſe</hi> Diogenes <hi>walked before</hi> Zeno<hi>'s Eyes?</hi> A wilder Proceeding I never heard of from any Chriſtian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; and the bare relation of this matter of Fact, is a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation thereof.</p>
                  <p>From the Pagan Philoſophers, you run for aſſiſtance to the Servants in the Parable, who could not give any punctual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count when the Tares were ſown, or by whom: Yet it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt they were mingled with the good Wheat. From hence you haſten to the Civil Wars of our Nation, where at length our King his Gracious Majeſty, <hi>Charles the Second</hi> of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> was happily reſtored to his Crown, without a great deal of fighting and Bloodſhed. From this place you take your journy into <hi>Turky,</hi> and bring down the Grand Viſier (inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chriſtendom, and beſiegeing <hi>Vienna)</hi> who was not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Moſt Chriſtian King, who had the greateſt Army in Chriſtendom in a readineſs.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I ruminate theſe Similitudes, I cannot eaſily conceive, how you can joyn our Great Monarch's happy Reſtauration, in a Simily with Tares, where Wheat was ſown, and with the Grand Seigneur invading Chriſtendom, and not give occaſion to the Reader to think you either wanted circumſpection in the choice of your Arguments, or imprudently left a ſuſpicion of your Loyalty.</p>
                  <p>And I wonder how a man of your great Wit and Judgment, could prevail with himſelf to conclude the Nullity of Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld</hi>'s ſolid reaſoning from Experiences or matters of Fact, that have nothing at all to do with the Sacrament? Why muſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47309:36"/>
Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi>'s Demonſtration be weak and inſufficient, becauſe the Chriſtian King, not long ſince repoſed in peace, with his great Army; or ſome time ago our Gracious Monarch of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py memory, was reſtored to his Crown; or becauſe St. <hi>Mathew</hi> wrote the Parable of the Tares? All the Reaſon in the World is too weak to make good any ſuch way of proceeding.

               <head>SECT. IV. Of the Neceſſity of ſuch a Change for the benefit of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</head>
               <p>THE Spiritual Efficacy of the Sacrament depends upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the thing, which our Lord inſtituted, and a right preparation and diſpoſition of mind, which makes it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to thoſe Spiritual Ends, for which it was appointed.</p>
               <p>As God might without any Baptiſmal Water, without any viſible Elements, have waſhed away the Stains of Original Sin, and given Spiritual Regeneration: So could he have made the worthy Receivers true Partakers of the Spiritual Comfort and Benefit deſign'd to us in the Lord's Supper, without any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial change made in the nature of Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>But as we cannot ſay, the Water in Baptiſm, and Symbols are unprofitable, as things are inſtituted by God, and uſeleſs for the cleanſing of Original Sin: ſo likewiſe ought we not to pretend, that the Fleſh of Chriſt is uſeleſs, and profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the worthy Receiver of the Sacrament, becauſe Chriſt without this may give us the benefit or fruit of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:47309:37"/>
God might have pardon'd the World, if his only begotten Son had not undergon ſo many griefs and anguiſhes, ſo much pain, and that ignominious death of the Croſs. Yet who dare ſay this Fleſh was not true Fleſh, or profited nothing, which redeemed all the World? If it profited on the Croſs, why does it not profit in the Sacrament? And if it profit not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith, how can it profit thoſe who believe not?</p>
               <p>The very thought of our Saviour's Subſtantial Preſence in the Sacrament, ſtrikes much a deeper impreſſion of Devotion in my Soul, than if I reflected on bare Symbols or Signs weakly exciting Faith in me.</p>
               <p>And even when a Terrene Prince viſits Priſons, or in a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Pomp enters the Capital City, his Corporal Preſence cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomarily frees many Criminals from Chains, Fetters, and Impriſonments, which the Law would otherwiſe not have granted, nor the King conſented too: And yet one word of command is ſufficient to do greater execution.</p>

                     <hi>Averröes</hi> the Arabian Philoſopher, acknowledging in his time this Doctrin, to be the Profeſſion of <hi>all Chriſtians,</hi> ought to <note place="margin">Dionyſ.

                  </p>
                  <p>It was great ſtupidity in the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to ſay, <hi>Come let us make us Gods;</hi> but it was civilly ſaid of them, <hi>Let us make us Gods that may go before us,</hi> in compariſon of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who calumniouſly make the Catholics ſay, <hi>let us make a God,</hi> that we <hi>may cat him;</hi> when we only ſay, God has power to change <hi>Bread into his Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the greateſt Stupidity of all is, that in all Probability you think thoſe common <hi>Jugling Words of Hocus Pocus are nothing elſe but a corruption, of Hoc eſt Corpus, by way of a ridiculous Imitation of the Priest of the Church of</hi> Rome. I grant this Imitation is very ridiculous. And you are the firſt <hi>Juggler</hi> with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Myſtery, and with our Saviour's own Words, that ever I read of in my life.

                  <p>Nay, if <hi>Averröes, Cicero,</hi> and a whole Progenie of Heathen Philoſophers, were as great Jugglers as your ſelf, and altogether deſign'd to put a Trick upon me, you ſhould never juggle me, by the Grace of God, out of my Faith in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, If I ſhould ask counſil of the Philoſophers (as you do in the concern of the Sacrament) to know the true cauſe of this Univerſe, <hi>Heraclitus</hi> would tell me Atoms produced it; <hi>Pythagoras</hi> would ſend me to the Marriage in Numbers; The <hi>Valentinians</hi> would bring me to the four Principles, which made the Treatiſe of Peace between Verity and Silence, Light and Profoundneſs.

                  <head>Article IV. Of the Danger of Idolatry.</head>
                  <p>IF we ſhould be miſtaken, as you ſuppoſe, about this Change through the croſneſs of the Prieſt (which God forbid it ſhould happen) not pronouncing the words of Bleſſing or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, we ſhould not at all be guilty of Idolatry For believing only one true God, we profeſs there is infinite Diſtance between him and all Creatures: and therefore we cannot ſo honour any Creature, as we do the true God. Nor is our Intention ever
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47309:40"/>
determined by the Will to adore any thing which is not God; So that if the Hoaſt were not, through miſtake, conſecrated by the Prieſt, the Peoples Adoration would be terminated in Chriſt, where e're he is, becauſe it is directed to God, and not to a Creature. The Pagans, 'tis true, or Perſians cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from Idolatry, in worſhiping the Sun, becauſe erring from the knowledge of the true God, they direct their Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to what is not God, but a Creature.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Thorndyke,</hi> one of the great Lights of your Church, was <note place="margin">Thorndyk<hi>'s Preſent State of Religion,</hi> c. 1. p. 7.</note> ſo convinced in this point, that he profeſſes, <hi>ſhould this Church (of</hi> England) <hi>declare that the Change, which we call Reformation, is grounded upon this Suppoſition (of Idolatry in the Church of</hi> Rome,) <hi>I muſt then acknowledge that we</hi> (Proteſtants) <hi>are the Schiſmatics.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Monſtrous Abſurdity of this Doctrin.</head>
               <p>TO ſhew the Abſurdity of this Doctrin, you are contented to ask theſe few Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Queſtion 1. <hi>Whether ever any Man have, or ever had greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of any Divine Revelation, than every Man hath of the Falſehood of Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer. If we had no ſurer Evidence of Revealed Truth, than every Man hath of the Falſehood of Tranſubſtantiation, we ſhould have no true Evidence for Chriſtian Religion; And thus by your Firſt Queſtion Chriſtianity would immediatly be diſpatched out of the World.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. Suppoſing the Doctrin had been delivered in Scripture in the ſame words, which we read in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> You ask, <hi>by what ſtronger Argument could any Man prove to me, that ſuch words were in the Bible, than I can prove to him, that Bread and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> Conſecration are Bread and Wine ſtill?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer. The Senſe of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and that of the Scriptures are one and the ſame. If therefore I can but appeal to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Eyes to prove ſuch words to be in the Bible, as you do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your Senſes to prove that Bread and Wine remain after Conſecration; what the Scripture ſays, is evidently true accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Teſtimony of Senſe; and your Teſtimony from Senſe of the ſubſtance of Bread remaining, is evidently falſe. I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47309:40"/>
have great aſſurance of this. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids me to believe an Angel, if he ſhould come down from Heaven, and teach me contrary to what is writ in Scripture. As <hi>this is</hi> the ſubſtance of Bread, and not <hi>my Body,</hi> is contradictory to, <hi>this is my Body.</hi> And what Prerogative enjoy you beyond that of an Angel? And if you draw one way with your Evidence of Senſe, and Scriptural Evidence from Senſe draw another way, is it not evident that your evidence is good for nothing?</p>
               <p>Queſt. 3. Whether it be reaſonable to imagin, that God ſhould make that a part of Chriſtian Religion, <hi>which ſhakes the main external Evidence and Confirmation of the whole?</hi> You mean the Miracles which were wrought by our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>the Aſſurance whereof did at firſt depend upon the certainty of Senſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer. With great Reaſon and Juſtice you appeal to the Senſes of thoſe, who ſay, they ſaw the Miracles which were wrought by our Saviour, and his Apoſtles; becauſe their Eyes were the proper Witneſſes of Miracles: So with the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice I appeal to my Senſes to prove, that the words which teach the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation are in Scripture, becauſe Paper, Ink, Syllables, and words, are the proper Objects of Seeing, feeling, and hearing. How then does the Catholic Tenet ſhake the main External Evidence of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when this external proof of Senſe evidences, from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Tranſubſtantiation?</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Whether our Saviour's Argument were concluſive or not,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to his Diſciples after his Reſurrection, that his Body was riſen, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 29. <hi>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf, for a Spirit hath not Fleſh and Bones, as you ſee me have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if ſeeing and handling be an unqueſtionable Evidence that things are what they appear to our Senſes, then the Bread in the Sacrament is not chang'd into the Body of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer. Senſe, in its own Objects, is frequently certain; and here we may rely on it. According to this Principle, the Argument which our Saviour uſed, did certainly prove to the Diſciples, that what they ſaw and handled, was his true Body. For affirmation of Fleſh and Bones rightly follows from feeling and ſeeing. Theſe Actions belong properly to the experience of Senſe. Beſides, we have all this recorded in Scripture. And our Saviour made uſe of all other Arguments imaginable to confirm the Myſtery of his Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:47309:41"/>
In ſome Circumſtances the Senſes may deceive us, and then we ought not to rely on them. Thus the Jews, deſigning to precipitate our Saviour from the top of a Mountain; <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as <note place="margin">Luke 4.</note> we read in Scripture, <hi>paſſed through the crowd, and departed,</hi> and the whole Multitude, truſting to that Information which Senſe gave them, believ'd he was a Ghoſt, or Apparition. In like manner, the ſame true Body of Chriſt is ſubſtantially preſent in the Sacrament after a Spiritual Exiſtence; and therefore it is not the proper Object of Senſe; and ſo we cannot here rely on our Senſes. We muſt then truſt to ſomething elſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Scripture, which is the Rule of Faith, to know ſurely what Subſtance or Body lies under the Species, or appearance of Bread.</p>
               <p>Now the Scripture teaches us, that the Bread in the Euchariſt is the Body of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and, <hi>the Bread which I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 26. John 6.</note> 
                  <hi>will give is my Fleſh.</hi> If it be the Fleſh of Chriſt, as we learn from Scripture, then the Subſtance of Bread remains not; for the remaining Subſtance, at the ſame time, cannot be the Subſtance of Bread, and the Subſtance of the Body of Chriſt. Moreover, our Saviour left many other Teſtimonies in confirmation of this Verity. Our Belief is grounded on our Saviour's Words; and what more ſecure than to build on this Immovable Rock of Truth.</p>
               <p>Now what ſhall I ſay, but that your whole Diſcourſe has been levell'd at our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and his Teſtimonies, againſt which the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail.</p>
               <p>And I finiſh with theſe words of St. <hi>Auſtin. When the Opinion of Error has prepoſſeſſed Man's</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>St.</hi> Aug. l. 3. de Doct. Chriſt. c. 13. <hi>Si animum praeoccupaverit alicujus erroris opinio, quidquid aliter aſſeruerit Scriptura figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum homines arbitrantur.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Mind, whatever Scripture ſhall ſay in oppoſition to his Senſes, he ſuppoſes a Figurative Interpretation.</hi> Oh that this Figurative receiving Chriſt in the Sacrament, preſage not a Figurative embracing of the ſame in the next World! and ſo you clipping the Shadow for the true Body, loſe for ever Eternal Happineſs.</p>
