            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>CHymiatry,</hi> for ſo with the light change of one Letter it is more truly named than <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> is a very Antient Art, and came, as other Learning, from the Eaſt by <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting <hi>Africk,</hi> as Philoſophy and Phyſick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did, it found kind Entertainment, and ſome Improvement in thoſe Countries, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the times of ſome more Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Princes; Of which Progreſs in thoſe parts the <hi>Arabick</hi> Articles prefixed to ſeveral <hi>Greek</hi> Terms of this Art, as <hi>Alambick, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy,</hi> are a ſufficient Teſtimony. And it at all times, and in all places friendly ſerved, and no-where oppoſed the received Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Phyſick and Philoſophy. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed belongs it any more to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Chymiſt, than of an Apothecary, to diſpute or take cognizance of thoſe to them ſuperiour, and more comprehenſive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But the Study of it hath been much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45982:5"/>
more cultivated in later times, by reaſon of the oppoſition that <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and ſome of his followers of like Fanatick ſtrain, made unto the eſtabliſh'd Practice of Phyſick, by colour of his pretended Chymical Principles. Followers, I ſay, of a Fanatick ſtrain; for in their Conteſt againſt their Adverſaries, they were not aſhamed to practiſe their Maſter's Maxim, <hi>Si Dei deficit auxilium, Diaboli ſucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat</hi>: and ſought to build themſelves a name by raiſing a Babel of confuſed words, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a reformed Art of Phyſick, on the ruines of all true Chriſtian Divinity, as well as Phyſick and Philoſophy. Indignation as it ſhould ſeem againſt this Innovator, who partly concealed his Tenets in the Smoak, as I may ſay, and partly endeavoured to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate them by the Fire of this noble Art, provoked many to follow him through both, and to attack him there whence his chiefeſt Strength and Confidence ſeemed to ariſe. So it came to paſs, that whereas formerly the Generality of Phyſicians hardly knew what a Retort or Alambick did mean, There are few at this day who are altogether ſtrangers unto the more uſeful Operations of this Art. And our Age ſeemed prone to receive with leſs oppoſition his Maxim, who was ſo bold as long ſince to ſay, <hi>Medicum non poſſe eſſe magnum, cui Chymia non ſit magna.</hi> And not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45982:5"/>
only in <hi>Germany,</hi> where this Conteſt firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, but with us <hi>Chymiatry</hi> hath of late got ſome Reputation, notwithſtanding the fierce oppoſitions of its obſtinate Enemies, and is in far greater Eſteem, and flouriſhes more than formerly, ſo that now its Contemners are forced, by reaſon of its fame, to pretend to know and underſtand ſomething of it; and very many of its common Inventions, and Preparations heretofore accounted dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and cried down for Poyſons, are now every-where frequent in the Shops of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, as well as Cloſets of Phyſicians. That excellent Purging Extract which is in truth the <hi>Catholicon Purgans Paracelſi,</hi> now univerſally uſed and commended, durſt not appear in <hi>Italy</hi> under its Author's name, and keeps ſtill the diſguiſed Title of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractum Rudii,</hi> from the firſt Publiſher of it in thoſe parts. What more ſuſpected than <hi>Antimony,</hi> what more frequently uſed at this day? If Vomiting, Purging, and Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could cure all Diſeaſes of more frequent incurſion, it would bid as fair as any yet produced, to merit the name of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Medicine. For Purging, perhaps not many, beſides that already named, excel the <hi>Pulvis Comitis,</hi> wherein it is a principal Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: And there is extant a Preparation of it, that purges in an almoſt unpercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45982:6"/>
doſe, ſweetly and very effectually. <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> may perhaps vye with all other commonly known Vomits for uſe and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; yet are not our Chymical Cloſets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ſafe, gentle and effectual. There is another Vomit known unto us no leſs powerful and effectual, though not yet in common uſe, which being more ſafe and familiar, may be adminiſtred both to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Ancient People, without danger or forcible ſtraining. The <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> of Antimony needs not my Commendations, having commended it ſelf to all men. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick hath advanced very little or nothing till its worthy Profeſſors were either awakened or aſſiſted by this Art; and conſidering, the great change it hath made in Medicine ſince <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s time, we can hardly hope it will make any further or more conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in our days, or attain its perfection to the cure of thoſe formerly held incurable Diſeaſes, <hi>Gout, Stone, &amp;c.</hi> at any time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of ſome choice Chymical-Preparations. If the Works of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and his Followers (all of which may perhaps not unjuſtly deſerve the name of <hi>Vexations,</hi> which he gave to one of his Treatiſes) have, according to the true Proverb, <hi>Vexatio dat intellectum,</hi> made ſo great Innovations in the Art and Practice of Phyſick it ſelf, as well as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45982:6"/>
in the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> and produced ſome flaſhes of Light, like thoſe that reſult from the Colliſion of Flint and Steel, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt betwixt <hi>Galeniſts</hi> and <hi>Paracelſians</hi> (as they lov'd to miſ-call them, I mean our <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi>) what might not be hoped from a true <hi>Chymiatry,</hi> a friendly Aſſociation of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> in their true ſubſerviency to Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>This Book, though it brings news of a very great Increment to the <hi>Chymical Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory,</hi> and hopes to furniſh the <hi>Chymiater</hi> with another Pillar of his Practice, nothing inferior to <hi>Antimony</hi> it ſelf, is contented for the preſent only briefly to declare the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and encouragements that have been given to its publication at this time, and to point at its force and uſe, reſerving the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery of its Nature, till publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of its worth may embolden it to put off its diſguiſe, and like that excellent Purgative Extract forementioned, own its true Name and Author. In the interim it is hoped, that the Ingenuous and Candid will neither impute it to Inſolence nor Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Publiſhers, that they have appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to his Majeſties Candor and Experience, and ſought Protection againſt the Obloquy and Detraction of the Ignorant and Envious from his Soveraign Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>And this is another Glory juſtly to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45982:7"/>
to <hi>Chymiatry,</hi> and here ſeaſonably to be remembred to the Honour of its Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: That whereas Phyſicians of later times have withdrawn themſelves from the happy and laudable practice of the Ancients, in Preparing and Adminiſtring their own Medicines; and laid not only the Charge and Trouble, but which is worſe, the Care and Truſt, wholly upon their Servants, or Apothecaries, as a Work below and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their Profeſſion: Kings and Princes have not been aſhamed to inſpect, but have alſo ſometimes for their recreation put their hands to the Preparation of the more neat, noble, and precious Chymical Medicines, and not diſdained to give them their names; and have thereby for the Honours done this Art in their own Times, and Dominions, propagated and perpetuated their Renown throughout the whole World, and to all ſucceeding Ages. <hi>Hermes,</hi> ſuppoſed the firſt Author of this Art, whence it hath been ſtiled the <hi>Hermetick,</hi> was not only a King, but, by conſent of all Ages, hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for, and advanced to the Title of <hi>Triſmegiſtus:</hi> which needs the favour of a candid interpretation to keep its ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion below the pride of Blaſphemy, and hath left no higher for the peculiar ſtile of God, then <hi>Optimus Maximus.</hi> And now I have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45982:7"/>
inſtanced in him, I will not deſcend to any inferiour Names, having more than ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe to glory, and congratulate with this ancient, noble, and excellent Art, and its Favourers and worthy Profeſſors, that his Majeſty hath ſo far owned them and it; who, as he hath been very bountiful to all Ingenious Artiſts, hath no-where appeared more munificent, than in the reward he hath given to thoſe who have preſented him with any worthy Chymiatrical Preparations; and in the ſplendid Proviſion he hath made for the Entertainment of worthy Operators in this Art.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not therefore need much Apology for my boldneſs in taking Sanctuary under the ſacred Name of his Majeſty, and entitling him to our <hi>Sudorifick,</hi> according to his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Conceſſions made in the behalf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>And I am aſſured that unto all loyal and ingenuous Spirits, his Majeſties Pleaſure in this particular to them declared, which we have therefore cauſed to be printed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed unto this Paper, will be abundant Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction, as well as ſufficient Authority for this our Practice. And if it would not ſeem a derogation from His, to ſeek Ornament or Protection from other names, We might alleadge the Care of the wiſe <hi>Venetian,</hi> not

leſs weighty grounds introduced into other Corporations, to make none free of their Body, but who have ſerved ſeven years Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſhip to ſome learned Phyſician, and who have been well vers'd in <hi>Botanicks,</hi> Drugs, and all Medicinal Materials, and Chirurgical and Chymical Operations. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it ſhould not be remembred without bluſhing by ſome, with what Confidence the young Druggiſt, arm'd and provided with no other Ammunition than of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, frequently uſed and preſcribed Drugs, which he drew out of his Hawking-Bag, encountred them in the face of a Parliament, preſuming more on their Ignorance than his own Skill: <hi>Nocumenta Documenta.</hi> Sure I am the operating <hi>Chymiater</hi> hath much more advantage by his commendable Induſtry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the unpractiſed Preſcriber, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he thereby neceſſarily acquires of the natures of Herbs, Drugs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> anatomized by the Fire, and of his Medicines extracted out of them, or compounded of them, and thence of Diſeaſes, and their Cures. The Inſtance lately given by <hi>Tachenius</hi> of common Water, commended by a great Phyſician for a Cordial, will for ever ſilence what can be pretended to the contrary. For want of this Skill it was that the excellent <hi>Heurnius</hi> durſt not uſe Oyl of Aniſeed in the Colick, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45982:9"/>
he cured with its Decoction. He that will take the pains to read <hi>Tachenius</hi> his <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates Chymicus,</hi> ſhall thence learn the reaſon, with many other forcible Arguments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the neceſſity of Practick Chymiatry. I am perſwaded that at this day after ſo long Practice and Experience, I ſhall not need to make any long defence of our Chymical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines againſt thoſe obſolete and antiquated objections, or ſcandals rather, with which the ignorant Vulgar are deterred from their uſe, to the great damage of their own health, and of Phyſick it ſelf, as well as the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Phyſician. The Ingenious and Learned, who are well vers'd in both Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, will, I am confident, not only allow willingly that ſome Ornament and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may accrew unto the noble Profeſſion of Phyſick by the Chymiſt, but readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to his Impartial Judgment, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faithfully examined, and judiciouſly weighed what could be ſaid on both ſides, concluded that the right Practice of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miatry was the higheſt Perfection of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and the nobleſt way of practiſing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick was by Chymical Medicines.</p>
            <p>And whereas the vertues of many Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Medicines lie not in their whole forms, or ſubſtances, but in many are divers in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts, and thoſe not ſeparable by other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45982:10"/>
than Chymical Inſtruments and Operations, as their Spagyrick Anatomy doth manifeſt: The care of the skilful Chymiſt is to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate what is contrary, and retain only what is proper to effect his curative intentions without danger, and with the leaſt offence to his Patients. And to make uſe of the Words, and therein of the Teſtimony of an Impartial Author; He ſeparates the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, improper, groſs, and terreſtrial, that he may make his Medicines efficacious, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and durable. It is meer Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or Malice, which is worſe, and both wilfully affected, if any at this day pretend that Chymical Medicines are violent or dangerous. For firſt, as to the intent of the Chymiſt, it is plain, his purpoſe, endeavour, and labour is not to prepare violent and dangerous Medicines, but to render thoſe crude and violent ones, which are admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by others, leſs hurtful, dangerous, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and offenſive. And there is no reaſon to imagine that he who ſtudies and attains to make the malignant, hurtful, dangerous, violent Medicines, uſed by others, benign, profitable, ſafe, acceptable, and prides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much therein, ſhould adminiſter them of contrary qualities. Neither in thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherein the urgency or obſtinacy of the Diſeaſe requires ſtrong Medicines, are the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45982:10"/>
Chymical prepared, more dangerous than crude and unprepared, which are preſcribed by others of neceſſity, who have no better, unleſs borrowed from the Chymiſts.</p>
            <p>In the next place, As there's no ground either from the intention or operation of the Chymiſt, to aſperſe his Medicines with the odious Epithete of <hi>dangerous</hi> or <hi>violent,</hi> but thence it is manifeſt that they deſerve ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the quite contrary commendations: ſo neither can this be attributed to them from the conſideration of the matter of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: for crude Hellibore, <hi>Colloquintida,</hi> Scamony, <hi>Euphorbium, &amp;c.</hi> uſed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, were rather more dangerous and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and not more effectual than their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and other Preparations now in uſe with our Chymiaters. Witneſs the Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives above commended, wherein the moſt forcible Medicines are daily uſed, without any bad accidents, but what may more juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be imputed to the Phyſician, or Phyſick it ſelf, than to the Chymical Preparation, Medicine, or Operator.</p>
            <p>If we proceed further, and examine the Principles according to which the Chymia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters compoſe and diſpenſe their Medicines, we may appeal to that deciſive Judgment, long ſince made by one, who was through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experienced in both ways, and who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45982:11"/>
not be juſtly excepted againſt by either, in theſe words; <hi>Principia Chymica Galenicis, qui elementa tantum cognoſcunt incognita, magis ad Medicinam attinent quam elementaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hither I might tranſcribe many things to this purpoſe, diſcuſſed by that Renowned Chymiater <hi>Otto Tachenius</hi> in his late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts with <hi>Zwelfer</hi> and others, Correctors of the <hi>Auguſtan Diſpenſatory,</hi> wherein it doth manifeſtly appear, how neceſſary the right knowledg of thoſe two Chymical Principles of <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alchaly</hi> is unto the right Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Diſpenſation of Medicines; which cannot be attained without Chymical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and Operations. For want of which Skill, Learned Men, not altogether ignorant neither of Chymiſtry, may run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to very great miſtakes. But I refer my ſelf in this particular to that worthily above-commended Chymiater, whoſe Works now (the Jewels of private Cabinets) will I hope ſhortly be as common and familiar in the Learned Chymiatrick World, and as uſeful to the cure of ſome yet formidable Diſeaſes, by the skilful application of thoſe Principles to their Remedies, as the Fire and Water, whereunto he well reſembles them. But I cannot diſmiſs this Learned Witneſs of the uſefulneſs of Chymical Principles and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, without producing his Teſtimony gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45982:11"/>
to the Antiquity of them, which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts to have been the ſame with the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> for his skill in Phyſick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a God amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> derived into publick notice by the Works of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> who for his profound Learning hath obtained the Title of <hi>the Divine.</hi> And to the Apoſtacy made by the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> from his Principles, to the more narrow and groſs of the Elements, we may juſtly aſcribe the non-proficiency of Phyſick and Philoſophy it ſelf from thoſe times until ours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome Learned Men as it were againſt the preſcription of the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> have again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to introduce his <hi>Acid, Alchaly,</hi> bitter, ſowre, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And here give me leave by the way, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Reader, to aſſure thee, that not only Sir <hi>Walter Rawleighs Diaphoretick</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Treaſure of ſome private Cloſets, but other Preparations of that Metalline Spirit, may be made without any addition of Salts or other Corroſives (for he is benign, and good with the good, as bad with the bad) which will powerfully ſweeten the Blood, and caſt off the impurities of the Body by Sweat, and other Operations. And of the truth of this, if need were, we might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce irrefragable Teſtimony; and leave it to thy own judgment to eſtimate what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Effects may be hoped from ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful a Medicine. I need not tell thee what <hi>Paracelſus</hi> boaſted of his <hi>Aquila,</hi> nor what others have ſought and hoped to effect by it, in moſt deſperate malignant Diſeaſes. The frequent uſe, and too frequent abuſes of the known and common Preparations of it, ſhew how uſeful and grateful a Medicine it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45982:12"/>
would be when made truly benign by the Preparation of a happy Operator, who knows to bind this hitherto incorrigible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable Fugitive to the Laws of true Medicinal Operation. If what we now bring thee be accepted, we will not long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thee from a fuller diſcovery of this, and ſome other choice Jewels of our <hi>Chymiatrical Diſpenſatory,</hi> which we have long ſought, and now hope, if we meet with favourable acceptation in theſe our firſt Fruits, to have occaſion and encouragement to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, for the common good and honour of Phyſick and Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>But here the candid Reader will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to obſerve with me, that <hi>Chymiatry</hi> hath introduced many gentle and familiar Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, by a right uſe whereof, thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes have been and may be cured, which have been vainly attempted with the more forcible Remedies. And it is ignorance of the ancient <hi>Hippocratick</hi> Phyſick and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miatry is the cauſe, that unto this day in ſome Diſeaſes, as the <hi>Pox, &amp;c.</hi> not only vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but dangerous, yea horrid Remedies, are yet in uſe, and poor Patients have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in Corners unto ſuch Practitioners, whoſe Medicines torment them more than their Diſeaſes, and yet delude their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of perfect Cures with deceitful Pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45982:13"/>
To the <hi>Hippocratick</hi> (and not <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenick</hi> Elementary Principles of Hot, Cold, Dry, Moiſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) we are beholden for the Advancements our Age hath made in Cure of ſome Diſeaſes, to which the moſt violent and deſtructive Remedies have been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied; becauſe how deſperate ſoever, they were then the only known Means ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be effectual. He that deſires an Infiance of this needs only call to mind what Diſeaſe it was for which crude <hi>Mercury</hi> hath been preſcribed to be taken in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity by the Mouth, and compare that deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate one, and other violent Medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in printed Books in that, and ſuch miſerable caſes, with the late familiar, eaſy, and almoſt contemptible Remedies of our ſtudious and ingenious Countryman. Thô Envy hath depriv'd the World of many of theſe, and is the cauſe that noble above-commended <hi>Chymiater</hi> hath not yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his Viperine Antidote, appropriated by him to the cure of Venerial, and the like Diſeaſes, in the moſt choice and tender Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yet are there Inſtances enough of ſuch powerful, and yet benign Remedies, as are ſufficient Teſtimonies to vindicate <hi>Chymia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> from being guilty of the uſe of violent Remedies to deſperate Diſeaſes. And we hope this <hi>Royal Sudorifick</hi> we now commend
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45982:13"/>
unto thee, will, when gotten into know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and eſteem, tend very much to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of this Art, quite take away the uſe of dangerous Mercurial Preparations, and equalize the beſt Antimonial, the choice Treaſures of ſome <hi>Chymiatrical Cloſets</hi>; for which hope I have, beſides Experience, good Reaſon and Authority of the moſt Learned <hi>Chymiaters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe deſperate Remedies in many caſes, as of <hi>Gravel in the Reins</hi> in ancient Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Mineral Waters may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, but none can with any great cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty preſcribe them, who are not able to judge of the Diſeaſes and Waters appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to them by true <hi>Chymiatrical</hi> Principles, and ſuch know ſo well to prepare Mineral Waters at home, that they ſhall not need to go ſo far, or pay ſo dear for them, who may properly expect relief from them; of this we have many witneſſes, for whom we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years ſince prepared ſuch as were not inferiour to the <hi>German</hi> Spaw. And we are aſſured there are amongſt our Worthy <hi>Chymiaters</hi> at Home, who know to prepare and accomodate ſuch Remedies to the Age, Temperature and Diſtempers of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, that their Charge, and Travel, and other hazards of Life and Health, weak and diſeaſed Perſons muſt needs incur in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45982:14"/>
ſuch Journeys, being conſidered, I hope I ſhall be excuſed for this reflection upon them as dangerous, and in ſome ſenſe deſperate Remedies, to which Patients are oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for want of knowledge in <hi>Chymia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conclude this Diſcourſe with that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which I find in a Learned and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Phyſitian, treating of the Subject we have now in hand, who caſting the Errours (made on both ſides) off from the Noble and Excellent Art, on to the baſe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Intruders on both Parties, as he juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adorneth the learned Practiſers with that glorious <hi>Eulogie,</hi> given them by the Ancients <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, ſo he excludes not the <hi>Chymiſt</hi> from the honour of being ſome finger in that hand of God, but ingenuouſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and almoſt unto ſenſe demonſtrates the neceſſity of <hi>Chymical Preparations,</hi> ſaying, the <hi>Chymiſt</hi> is that to <hi>Phyſick,</hi> which the Cook is to food. Neither would I be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to reflect on the Learned <hi>Galeniſt</hi> or <hi>Chymiſt</hi>; but hope it will be no blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſay of thoſe, who truſt to thoſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſers, ignorant in <hi>Chymiatry,</hi> they had need to take heed that when God ſends them <hi>Phyſick,</hi> the Devil ſend them not an ignorant, as well as unlicenſed Phyſitian: But for the ſake of ſuch to condemn and endeavour to

            <p>Thus far, <hi>Courteous Reader,</hi> I have thought fit and neceſſary to adviſe thee concerning the nature of <hi>Chymical Medicines</hi> in general, and to prevent as much as I can, all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Opinions, that might deter thee from the uſe of our <hi>Royal Sudorifick</hi> on that accompt.</p>
            <p>Now, give me leave to inform thee of the Virtues and uſe of it in <hi>Phyſick</hi>; and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its Application and Operation.

               <p>NExt after that bleſſed Glory and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, which is the prerogative of the Inhabitants of Heaven, there is nothing ſo much to be valued and laboured after, as the felicity of a long and healthful life in this World. I have therefore greatly lamented with my ſelf, whilſt I have obſerved on the one hand, many Diſeaſes to radicate and fix themſelves deep and cloſe in the bodies of Men and Women, and their dear Children and Relations, before they are diſcovered by the Perſons affected or concerned, or the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian to whom they repair for advice; and on the other hand ſo many errours commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſad inconveniencies thereby brought upon multitudes of People of all ſorts, by ſudden and raſh Attempts of intentional Cures, upon ſuppoſed curative Indications.</p>
               <p>Theſe oftentimes are the cauſes, whereby many Diſtempers become incurable, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably vexatious during life, which, thereby of the greateſt bleſſing, becomes the heavieſt curſe, and was in ſuch caſe, as truly, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly compared to the ſpan of a Gouty hand, the longer it is extended, the more painful and tormenting: ſo that Death it ſelf hath by ſome been preferred, before ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed

Life, and its continued Agonies. The reaſons of this, beſides thoſe abovementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, delay and length of time running on to a confirmation of Diſeaſes, before their true Natures and Cauſes are diſcovered, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and raſh Judgments made in thoſe caſes, are the adminiſtration of improper Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which do not only give the Diſeaſe time to grow on, and fix it ſelf on the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents body, and weaken it, but many times conſpire with, and advance or confirm the Diſeaſe, and ſuddenly draw on Death it ſelf. And laſtly, the pernicious effects, and cruel accidents, inſeparable Conſequents of poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crude and untruly prepared Medicines.</p>
               <p>For the Remedy hereunto, and thereby as much as poſſible to take away the ſhame and reproach which lyes on the Art, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements which oftentimes fall on the ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous learned and ingenious Phyſitian: It ſeems to me that it would be very expedient to publiſh, promote, and bring into light and uſe ſome more noble, ſafe, gentle, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and certain Remedies, which might by their excellency and power, diſcountenance and exclude the dangerous, uncertain and ineffectual Medicines now in frequent uſe, and ſometimes neceſſarily retained in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice by able Phyſicians, as being the only known Remedies for ſome Diſtempers.</p>

               <head>DIRECTIONS.</head>
               <p>Generally this <hi>Sudorifick</hi> may be taken in Conſerve of Roſes, or Juice of Liquoris: for <hi>Stone, French-Pox,</hi> and <hi>Scurvy,</hi> in Juice of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoris; for <hi>Rhumatiſm</hi> in Marmolet of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Conſerve of red Roſes; for the <hi>Gout</hi> in Syrup of Elder-Berries, or Decoction of Pelitory of the Wall ſweetned. Common Doſe: for a Child of one year, one grain, and ſo encreaſing to ſeven for one of ſeven years; For a Man, 15 grains, in extraordinary caſes, riſing to 20, or half a dram, in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a Hazel-Nut of Conſerve, or half a ſpoonful or more of Syrup, or like matter.</p>
               <p>For thoſe that are ſubject or inclinable to have the <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Gravel,</hi> let them take this Medicine every night, with three or four ſpoonfuls of warm white Wine after it, and the next Morning drink, after they have made water, a draught of Wine and Water, <hi>viz.</hi> two ſpoonfuls of white Wine to four of Water, and ſo proportionably for a draught, ſweeten, or otherwiſe as they like it, and it will prevent the gathering and Coagulation of the <hi>Stone,</hi> by bringing away the <hi>Gravel.</hi> Now for thoſe that have already the <hi>Stone,</hi> it may be taken likewiſe every night with a little warm white Wine after it, and the next morning drink a draught of white Wine and Ale proportionably, as aboveſaid, of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45982:19"/>
Wine and Water, wherein hath been boyl'd Parſly and Mercury-roots, of each ½ a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Grumel-ſeeds a quarter of an ounce; and in either of theſe Directions to keep a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate dyet, both as to food and drink, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining any thing of Milk, ſharp, ſour or ſalt things; but if extreamly afflicted in this caſe let them repair to us, for a farther and more particular Order and Rule, by which, and the Bleſſing of God, if Nature be not too far ſpent, and the Parts too deeply ulcerated, they may find certain relief as ſeveral have done.</p>
               <p>For thoſe that are troubled with <hi>Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms or Deſtructions,</hi> let them take it a week together, every night and morning, and go about their occaſions, avoiding ſharp, ſalt, or ſour things, as aforeſaid; but ſuch as <hi>French</hi>-Wine will agree with, in this caſe may drink ſometimes a glaſs or two, but not to exceed.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> thoſe that have newly got it, and would again in a little time be quit of it: Let them take a Doſe of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine every Night going to bed, drinking only a little Mace-Ale, and be covered in a gentle breathing Sweat for 3 or 4 Hours, and the next Morning eat a Meſs of thin Broth or Water grewel without Salt, keeping moderate Dyet and Drinking, and to repair once or twice in a Week to ſome able Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian for a gentle and proper Purge in that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45982:19"/>
Caſe: But thoſe that are much troubled with this Diſtemper, and have been already under <hi>Flux, Salivation,</hi> purging with <hi>Mercurial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines</hi> prepared with <hi>Corroſives, Dyet-drinks,</hi> &amp;c. the common long and tedious ways of curing, and ſeldom perfectly cured; Such, I ſay, that neither are cured, nor ever like to be cured by that way, let them take a Doſe of this Medicine every Night going to bed, with a little Mace-Ale after it, and keep in a gentle Sweat or indifferent warm, and the next Morning take another Doſe with a Meſs of thin Broth or Water-grewel after it, walking about your occaſions, and obſerving the ſame rule and a Moderate dyet as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, for a Month, now and then taking a proper and gentle Purge, and by this order you may free your ſelf from this ſad Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and its dangerous Effects: If this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine be laid upon <hi>Shanker, Buboes, Puſtules,</hi> or any <hi>Venereal</hi> or other <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> that is not too deep, it cleanſes them from their Poyſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends them from their Humours coming to them, and takes away all putrified Fleſh that is in them; Wherefore it is deſervedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to all <hi>Chyrurgeons</hi> as one of the moſt Effectual Medicines to lay a foundation for the cure of the aforeſaid ſores, or any other if curable, whoſe Symptoms are various.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> much treated of in this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45982:20"/>
our age, and many Medicines preſcribed for it, yet too often are other Diſtempers taken for it, by reaſon of the ſimiliarineſs of their Symptoms, though the Cauſes are quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by which both Phyſician and Patient are deceived, the one in Judgment, and the other for want of Cure: Now for thoſe that have the real and true <hi>Scurvy,</hi> this Medicine moſt certainly helps, if duely taken every Night for a time, with a draught of warm drink and an Orange ſqueezed in it, going to Bed, and lying in a breathing Sweat for two or three Hours, and for thoſe that find only ſome ſmall Symptoms of this Diſtemper, and ſuppoſe it to be growing upon them; Let them likewiſe take this Medicine every Night as aforeſaid for a time, and it will prevent the <hi>Scurvy</hi> for ever coming to its ſtrength and vigour, as ſufficiently hath been proved.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Gout,</hi> thoſe that would be preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it, let them take this Medicine two or three times a Week at Nights, with any warm thing after it, and they ſhall never be troubled with it; but thoſe that are already much afflicted with it, may pleaſe to repair to us for further Directions and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Order in this Medicine, and they may find certain Cure as many have done; though it be a Cure difficult, and in this Nation not fully known.</p>
