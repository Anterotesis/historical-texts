            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For seeing that <hi>Prophecie</hi> proceedeth from the holy Spirit, It is necessary that by the same also it should be expounded. Next, Apious and diligent reading of Prophecies, and conferring them one with another, much avayleth hereunto. Lastly, The fulfilling of any Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and an experience in a manner thereof, is as it were the Key, with which it is unlockt, and opened. Wherefore that saying of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> is true:<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>4</hi> cap. <hi>43 Omnis Prophetia priusquaro impleatur aenigm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Every Prophecy before it is fulfill'd is a Riddle. But when it is fulfill'd, it hath a plain exposition, and understanding of it self.</hi> These three things, as in all holy Prophecies, so in the Divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> may be joyned together, and namely in this piece thereof, which now according to my Ability I am about to Illustrate, and at this day too, Wherein to the light of the Gospel there is added a great <hi>Catastrophe,</hi> or <hi>Issue,</hi> of many things foretold by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; except indeed any one happily chance to be bewitched with a prejudicate opinion.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55491:9"/>
or <hi>Externall,</hi> and temporall. The State of the Church <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> and perpetuall, consists in the Union and Communion with <hi>Christ,</hi> as also in the enlightning, and guidance of the <hi>Spirit, Isa.</hi> 54.5. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.15, 19, 20. <hi>Iob.</hi> 6.56. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> after their most grievous fall, were raised up again by the most sweet promise of the Gospel; and after they had begot <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> and their Sisters, they were comforted with this Infancy, as it were, and first foundation of the Church. But no small grief followed hard upon this joy, when as <hi>Cain</hi> slew his brother <hi>Abel.</hi> However this breach was made up again in <hi>Seth,</hi> whose posterity propagated the Church, although not without grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous persecution by the race of <hi>Cain,</hi> which had an end put unto it by the del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The explications of which places, look for in the following questions, and almost every where in the author cited in the <hi>Margine.</hi> And to them adde these <hi>two reasons</hi>; 1; The <hi>Iews</hi> wander to and fro through the whole world dispersed, scattered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and banished from their own ayr and soil. God therefore without doubt reserveth them for some great, and admirable work. 2. <hi>Christ</hi> being born of the <hi>Iews,</hi> he is promised unto them with very many and most glorious promises. Therefore it is not to be beleeved, that they should not at some time or other acknowledge him as the <hi>Messias.</hi> Neither can you object that the <hi>Iews</hi> were converted in the time of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles.</hi> For they were but the first fruits of the <hi>Iews.</hi> And that <hi>Conversion</hi> was but in part onely. See concerning this Argument <hi>Iustus Heurnius,</hi> in his Book before cited, who handles it most accurately, and is of opinion, that this order shall happen in the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of the <hi>Iews.</hi> That in the first place those <hi>ten Tribes</hi>; which were carried away by the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> shall be converted, to whom afterwards the Tribes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> shall joyn themselves. In the same place also he conjectureth very probably, That the convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed remainder of the <hi>Iews,</hi> united with the converted Church of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> shall resist the attempts of the adversaries of GOD, and beat down <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Yet I should rather suppose that the <hi>Iews</hi> should entertain the ruine of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> as an occasion of their Conversion. But this nothing to the main matter and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the question.</p>
               <p>It remains now that I make it plain that this Church, gathered together of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, shall be freed from the persecutions of their enemies.</hi> This is proved out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.40, 41, 42, 43. <hi>Psal.</hi> 96. <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.5, 6, 7. <hi>Isai.</hi> 11.1, 2.3.4. <hi>chap.</hi> 24.23, <hi>chap.</hi> 25. <hi>chap.</hi> 26.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c. chap.</hi> 33.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>chap.</hi> 34. from the 1, to the 18 <hi>verse. chap.</hi> 49.24, 25, 26. <hi>chap.</hi> 54.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>chap.</hi> 59.16,

            <head>The first Classis of Arguments.</head>
            <p>From the <hi>Context</hi> of the Chapter we draw these Arguments:</p>
            <p>THe first Argument is taken from the connexion of this Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the former, which is described, <hi>chap.</hi> 19. <hi>verse</hi> 19, 20, 21. For <hi>Iohn</hi> saith in the first verse of this Chapter, <hi>And I saw,</hi> that is, <hi>Afterwards</hi>; to wit, After I had seen the Beast, and the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55491:24"/>

Now lest any one should think that this <hi>casting</hi> of them in shall be in the end of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> doth presently adde; <hi>and the rest were slain with the sword of him that sate on the horse, and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.</hi> From which words it is manifest, That it is spoken here concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the destruction of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and his followers, which shall not happen in the last and Universall Judgement, but shall be a particular Judgement by it self: which is thus demonstrated: The <hi>coming of Christ</hi> to the last Judgement shall at length happen after the Warre of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>; which is a distinct War from that which is described, <hi>chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 19.

            </p>
            <p>The second <hi>Argument</hi> is from the <hi>Connexion</hi> of this Vision with the following, which is set down in the 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Chapter.</hi> For, saith <hi>Iohn</hi> in the first <hi>verse</hi> thereof. <hi>After that I saw a new Heaven, and a new Earth</hi>; that is, The thousand yeers being finished, the Warre of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> being ended, and the execution of the last Judgement, of which in the 20<hi rend="sup">••</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:55491:24"/>The <hi>third Argument</hi> is from the often <hi>repetition</hi> of those words, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, [<hi>a thousand years</hi>] and withall the addition of the Article <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>babler,</hi> or a vain repeater of the same words needlesly again and again.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth Argument</hi> is from the <hi>comparing</hi> of this Vision with the <hi>History</hi> of what hath hitherto happened. For it cannot be proved out of any <hi>History,</hi> That those things which were treated of in this <hi>Prophesie,</hi> have yet come to passe. For as yet the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vill was never so bound for <hi>a thousand years,</hi> as that he was cast into a bottomlesse pit, and there shut up, and withall a Seal set upon him, that he might not seduce the Nations any more, till the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years should be fulfilled; which being expired, he should be let loose for a little season.</p>
            <p>I require then that some age of the <hi>New Testament</hi> may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, wherein the <hi>Epocha,</hi> or <hi>beginning</hi> of these years may be said to have been.</p>
            <p>Again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Resurrection of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> is proved from the <hi>Antithesis,</hi> or <hi>opposition</hi> expressed in the 4. and 5. <hi>Verses</hi>; where it is expresly said, That <hi>the rest of the dead lived not again untill the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years were expired.</hi> Therefore, when as it is said that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs lived, they are to be understood to have lived again. Now let it be made appear when this living again happened.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The warre of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> hath not been yet, as many would have it: For after those thousand years shall be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, in all which time no Nations shall be seduced by <hi>Satan</hi>; then, I say, shall this new seduction begin over the whole face of the earth, and from the four corners of the world an innumerable army shall be gathered, which shall bring great trouble to the <hi>Saints,</hi> and shall be consumed with fire sent down from <hi>God.</hi> Seeing therefore these three things, which I have mentioned, are not already fulfilled, it is most certain that they are yet to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55491:25"/>The <hi>fifth Argument</hi> is from the <hi>absurdity</hi> that will follow: For except we keep close to the letter, and apply it to the happinesse of the Church which shall be hereafter on earth, both the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and application of this whole Prophesie will prove very empty, unsavory, and wrested. Let us take one of many. Some say that these thousand years here mentioned began with the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the <hi>Temple,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This is cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led <hi>recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or sententia,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux. in Orat.</hi> 3.</note> and <hi>Iewish</hi> Worship; because then the <hi>Iews,</hi> who hitherto never ceased to trouble the Nations, and to turn them aside from the <hi>Gospel,</hi> being now scattered and cast off, the Nations now by whole troops were brought in in their stead to the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that then Satan being bound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was made apparant that he ceased from seducing the Nations. Now let us see what a fine exposition this is. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was overthrown by <hi>Titus</hi> in the 69. year of <hi>Christ:</hi> Here then let us begin the <hi>Epocha</hi> of these thousand years, so that they may end in the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 1069. Now let there be conferred with this whole course of time the <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Nations,</hi> the sinck of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,</hi> the defection and seduction of <hi>Mabomet,</hi> the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> and lastly the <hi>persecution</hi> of the <hi>Godly</hi>; and then let it be shewn how <hi>Satan</hi> reigning all this while so powerfully, was bound for a thousand years, and seduced not the <hi>Nations.</hi> Let it be shewn also how any <hi>Martyr</hi> ever reigned with <hi>Christ</hi> from the year of the Lord 69 to the year 1069. Certainly none have yet reigned with Christ, because none have yet risen from the dead. Now the reign of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> must follow their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. So that if these thousand-years were expired in the year of Christ 1069. It follows, That these 573 years, which have passed from that time to this present year 1643. is a <hi>little season</hi> in respect of a thousand years: because it is said, That after those thousand years the Divell shall be let loose <hi>for a little season, that he may again seduce the Nations, Vers.</hi> 3, 7, 8. But 573 years cannot be said to be a <hi>little season</hi> in regard of 1000 years, seeing they contain a great deal more then half thereof. Neither doth that make voide the truth hereof, which they bring out of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. that <hi>a thousand years with</hi> God <hi>are but as one day:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 90.4.</note> For there it is spoken concerning God's estimate, or account; who as he esteems a thousand years but as one day, so again he esteems one

day as a thousand years, as it is plain out of the place now cited. But here it is spoken concerning man's estimate, who makes not the like account of a short, as he doth of a long time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>sixth Argument</hi> is <hi>ab implicito,</hi> as they use to speak; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and necessarily deduced from another truth. <hi>Iohn</hi> writes, that for the space of those thousand years the Nations should not be seduced, <hi>Vers.</hi> 3. where not onely the <hi>Heathens,</hi> but also the <hi>Iews</hi> are to be understood. For <hi>Satan</hi> is so bound, and committed to Hell, that he cannot at all seduce any one. Therefore neither the Jews. Now it plainly appears to every one, that the Jews ever since the <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ, even to this very age of ours, have been most miserably seduced. Therefore these thousand years are yet to come. Again, It is very probable, That the <hi>Persecution</hi> of the Church hath been a great occasion, among other things, to hinder the <hi>Iews</hi> gathering of themselves to the <hi>Church.</hi> Therefore if the Jews should but see the wonderfull overthrow of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> without doubt it would afford them a great occasion of their Conversion. Upon this ground, the overthrow of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ shall immediately go before, not the <hi>last judgement,</hi> but the <hi>happinesse of the Church</hi> which shall happen in this life.</p>

Where God thus speaks unto <hi>Abraham: As for me, behold I make my Covenant with thee, and thou shalt be a father of</hi> many Nations. <hi>Neither shall thy name any more be called</hi> Abram, <hi>but thy name shall be</hi> Abraham: <hi>for a father of</hi> many Nations <hi>have I made thee. And I will multiply thee abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and I will make Nations of thee, and Kings shall come out of thee.</hi> In these words is promised unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he shall be a father, not onely of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but also of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For it is plain, That divers people had their originall and descent from <hi>Abraham.</hi> For besides that <hi>Isaac</hi> was born of him, <hi>Ismael</hi> also grew into a great people, and the <hi>Edomites</hi> also descended from him were scattered farre and wide. Of other sonnes also, which he had by <hi>Keturah,</hi> very large families were spread abroad. But what? <hi>Moses</hi> had a farther respect in these words, namely, that the <hi>Nations</hi> by faith were to be inserted into the kindred of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> though they were not begotten of him according to the flesh, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> witnesseth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 11. The <hi>Iews</hi> of all kindes, and <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall be the sonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> in Christ. But this is not yet brought to passe; Because the <hi>tenne</hi> Tribes carried away by <hi>Salmanassor</hi> have heard nothing concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>two</hi> Tribes, <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> have hitherto wandred in their own wayes, as also the <hi>Indians,</hi> and the like unto them.

concerning Christ. <hi>I see him, but not now: I behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a starre out of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and a scepter shall arise out of</hi> Israel, <hi>and shall smite all the corners of</hi> Moab, <hi>and destroy all the children of</hi> Seth. Here by the children of <hi>Seth</hi> are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood all the children of this world: because we are all sprung out of <hi>Seth,</hi> who succeeded into the place of <hi>Abel,</hi> who was slain.

Wherefore the sonnes of <hi>Seth,</hi> are as much as the sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi>; that is, all mankinde.

For neither were the <hi>tenne Tribes</hi> then brought back.

            <p>The 22 place is <hi>Isai.</hi> 34. from the 1 to the 18 <hi>verse.</hi> Where you may collect that a Prophesie is here contained of the overthrow of the enemies of the New Testament, by comparing the 4 <hi>verse</hi> with <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.14. and the tenth <hi>verse</hi> with <hi>Revel.</hi> 19 3. and the 11 <hi>verse</hi> with <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.2. Now by the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the false bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of true <hi>Christians</hi> are set forth; and by <hi>Bozrah,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Edom, Rome,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is figured out, whose ruine is most feelingly described in the 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 <hi>verses.</hi>

I will bring thy seed from the East, and gather thee from the West.

            <p>The 25 is <hi>Isai.</hi> 49.24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25, 26. Which words agree with the foregoing Prophesie of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> from the 18 <hi>ver.</hi> and therefore are to be interpreted of the Church under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, which complains of the power of her persecutors, <hi>ver</hi> 24. and is strengthned again by Christ with promise of deliverance, <hi>verse</hi> 25. and with threats of the ruine of those which persecuted her, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. Compare <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.6.</p>
            <p>The 26 <hi>place</hi> is <hi>Isai.</hi> 54.14, 15, 16, 17. That this Prophesie doth speak of the Church of the New Testament, is from hence made plain, by reason that in this chapter a Prophesie is contained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those benefits which God would bestow upon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full under the Gospel, whereto it makes also, That Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.45, alleadgeth the first part of the 13 <hi>verse.</hi> Now in this place of the <hi>Prophet</hi> cited by us is contained a Prediction of the defence of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church against enemies, which is not yet fulfilled.</p>
            <p>The 27 place is <hi>Isai.</hi> 59.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, That here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is contained a Prophesie of the Church under the Gospel, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by comparing the 16 <hi>verse</hi> with <hi>chap.</hi> 63.5. as also the 20 verse with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. Now there are three members of this Prophesie: One of the destruction of the enemies of the Church, which shall happen before the conversion of the <hi>Iews, vers.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19. Another of the Majesty or glory which shall accrew to the Church by the ruine of her adversaries, <hi>vers.</hi> 19. <hi>When the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a Standard against him.</hi> The third is of the conversion of the <hi>Iews, vers.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
            <p>The 28 place is <hi>Isai.</hi> 60. Which whole chapter treats of the happinesse which is yet to accrew to the Church of the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as will appear to them that consider of it.</p>

            <p>The 50 place is <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.10. and the following.

            <p>The 51 place is <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.1. to the end. It may hence be perceived that the prophesie in this Chapter doth speak of the Church of the

               </note> the City was not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, as is here promised; but contrarywise overthrown by the <hi>Romans.</hi> Whence it plainly appears that by <hi>Hierusalem</hi> here is mystically understood the Church of the New Testament.

Now of the Church of the N<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> T. partly the victory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which it shall gain over Antichrist is declared; partly the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Jews.

            </p>
            <p>The 52 place is <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.6. and following. It may be from this manifestly understood that this prophesie is of the Church of the N. T. in that our experience contradicts the sense of the letter concerning the plague wherewith God <hi>would smite all the people that fought against</hi> Hierusalem, <hi>vers.</hi> 12, 13, 14. when as from the time of this prophesie the enemies of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> were never strucken with such a plague; nay, on the contrary, it self was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the <hi>Romans.</hi> It remains therefore that by <hi>Hierusalem</hi> we understand the Church of the N. T. whose enemies shall be punished with no single plague, but many, as is here severally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. Here then the destruction of the enemies of the Church of the <hi>New T.</hi> is prophesied of: and moreover the illumination, and enlargement thereof; of which in the 6.7. and following <hi>verses.</hi>

            <p>The 53 place is <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. according to others, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.1, 2 3. That this prophesie speaks of the Church of the New Testament is clear out of these words; <hi>The Sun of righteousnesse shall arise.</hi> Now two things are promised here to the Church of the N. T, which are not yet fulfilled; namely, the destruction of her enemies, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and her own deliverance from persecution.</p>
            <p>The 54. place is <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.4, 5. Where the coming of <hi>Elias</hi> is spoken of, <hi>Before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.</hi> Which prophesie indeed hath a double fulfilling: one, in <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>; another, in some other great person, who is yet to come. This
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55491:34"/>
appears thus: Christ teacheth us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11 &amp; 17 Chapters, that this Prophesie was fulfilled in <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> to wit, in regard of his zeal and fervency. But what else is spoken concerning <hi>Elias,</hi> both in <hi>Malachy</hi> and <hi>Matthew,</hi> doth not suit with <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist.</hi> For <hi>Malachy</hi> saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.11.

                  <q>This one thing perchance will offend the ears of some, because I seem to promise a more plentifull peace to the Church, then that likenesse of the Crosse will allow of, to which in this world it must be made conformable to Christ it's head. But let them bethink themselves, I entreat them; that this is not so contrary to the Scripture, that it should be objected against me, or laid to my charge, as fit to be reckoned in the number of those, which are termed either impious, or absurd: Especially, when as I cannot perceive, by what means that happinesse, which <hi>Iohn</hi> writes the Church shall enjoy, <hi>Satan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound, can be made good, except we acknowledge some rest of the Church, her enemies being overthrown. Which I think indeed ever happened, as often as the enemies of God's people have been removed out of the way. Now because the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us shall be taken away, is more dangerous then all that ever yet infested God's people, it ought not to seem strange to any one, if, he being once overcome, the Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a more plentifull peace then usually.</q>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Satan</hi> began to be tyed in bonds, when the restored Truth of the Scriptures began to take place on earth, the witnesses being raised, and the dark miste of lyes being dispelled. Then shall <hi>Satan</hi> be bound for a <hi>thousand</hi> years, which must be expired, before he scatter new errours through the world, and by them seduce the Nations.

<q>But when began Satan to be bound? In the year 1517. when the <hi>witnesses</hi> were raised. From that time ALL people generally have not drunk any new poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of heresie, which might weaken, or overturn their faith.</q>

               <p>In this Exposition of <hi>Cotterius,</hi> the <hi>thousand</hi> years are rightly urged according to the letter.

Hence we may easily collect, where we are to fetch the <hi>Epocha,</hi> or the beginning of this account of 1000 years. <hi>Answ.</hi> The Text doth not onely speak of seducing to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, but also, and especially concerning the seducing, wherewith Satan formerly enticed, and shall about the end of the world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the Nations to make War against the Church. Again, it is false that Satan from the year of Christ 70. was bound for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years; because from that time innumerable and horrible he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, fallings away, and scandalls, &amp;c. have been. Indeed Satan was bound at that time, but not in that manner, and measure, as he shall be bound for the thousand years. Again, by <hi>Nations,</hi> in the place quoted, we must understand not the <hi>Gentiles</hi> onely, but also the <hi>Iews</hi>; who truely are yet seduced; as also the <hi>Indians, Turks,</hi> and others.</p>

            <p>See, the devill himself confesseth, That he is bound from this time. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. As in the former Visions good Angels were the executioners of Gods Judgements, so it is likely that a created Angel was used also in this Vision. 2. Christ in the 3 of <hi>Iohn</hi> is said to have come down from Heaven, that is, To have assumed the humane Nature. But the <hi>Angel</hi> in this place, who hath the key of the bottomlesse pit, came down from Heaven by a locall motion, that he might binde the Devill for a thousand years, after the downfall of Antichrist. 3. It is true, the devill was bound at the time of the Nativity of Christ; but not after that manner, as is here declared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Look before in the <hi>Analysis.</hi> For there are many measures and degrees, whereby the devill is bound.</p>
            <p n="12">XII <hi>Object.</hi> Is this. This Interpretation, concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> seems to oppose the Article of our Faith, <hi>I beleeve the Resurrection of the flesh.</hi> For so a double Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressiion of the flesh is maintained, contrary to the Apostolique Faith. <hi>Answ.</hi> That <hi>Article</hi> speaketh of the finall and universall Resurrection, which shall be in the last day, and in which all the dead shall rise again. Now this Resurrection is not contradicted or denyed by the Resurrection of the Martyrs, which is to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, no more then by the Resurrection of the Saints, who rose again, when Christ breathed forth his Spirit hanging upon the Crosse, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.50, 51, 52.</p>

Where all, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they, are proclaimed blessed, and freed from the second death, who have their part in the first Resurrection: Whence it follows, That either there shall be no Resurrection after the first, or that none in the second Resurrection shall be blessed; both which are
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55491:41"/>
absurd. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Nay the latter is onely absurd, being granted from the <hi>antecedent,</hi> or foregoing. 2. The antecedent is false, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it in the Text. For it is not said there, They <hi>onely</hi> are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Now that they are in particulars said to be blessed, that is in respect of their Prerogative, in that they are blessed above others of the faithfull, as being to reigne 1000 years with Christ before the last day. And this is intended by the word <hi>Holy</hi> being added, whereby is signified that they should be separated from the other faithfull believers, and set aside for this happinesse, in that they are to rise again to reign with Christ before them. 3. Thirdly, this blessednesse consists of three parts; the first of which being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered apart, suits also with the other believers. But as it is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the other two parts, it cannot be expressed but of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> only, as it will appear to any one that will examine the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the 6 <hi>verse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Object.</hi> Is taken out of <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.6. Whence it is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, That the first Resurrection hath opposed to it the first death. Therefore by the first Resurrection, the second Life, or living again of the soul from the death of sin, by Faith, and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or, in a word, Regeneration, is to be understood. Certainly all and onely the truely regenerate, are delivered from the second, or eternall death, and certainly obtain heavenly happinesse: Whence it may be sufficiently proved, That the first Resurrection is not particular, or bodily. <hi>Answ.</hi> The first Resurrection, as it is spoken of in this place, is not opposed to the first death, of which there is here no mention; but it is opposed to the second Resurrection, as appears out of these words; <hi>But the rest of the dead lived not again, untill the thousand yeers were finished. This is the first Resurrection,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">XV <hi>Object.</hi> Is this. The first Resurrection is not a bodily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; because if it be bodily, it is not the first: For the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of others, namely, of those Saints who rose again while Christ hung on the Crosse, went before it. <hi>Answ.</hi> That Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Martyrs is called the first by way of Excellence, by reason also of the multitude of them, in respect of which that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Saints comes not within reckoning of, by reason of the fewnesse. For although many bodies of the Saints are said
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55491:41"/>
then to have risen, yet in regard of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> they were but few; as which came forth of the Graves onely, which were neer unto <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">XVI <hi>Object.</hi> It is a usuall Axiome in the School of <hi>Divines,</hi> That the <hi>first Resurrection</hi> is the living again of the Souls from the death of sin, by faith and repentance, which otherwise is called <hi>Regeneration</hi>; and it is opposed to the <hi>first death,</hi> which is a defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a casting a way of the soul from God. But the <hi>second Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> shall be the raising of the bodies, to be united to the souls to eternall life; to which the second death is opposed, which shall be the casting a way of the damned to eternall torments. <hi>Ans. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> is tearmed to be the First, ambiguously. For either it is opposed to the first death, and so it is spirituall, and is proper to all believers; or it is opposed to the second Resurrection, and so it is corporeall, and of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> onely.</p>

For although the holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confessors,</hi> who poured out their lives, and lost their fortunes, under Tyrants, and Antichrist, for Christ's sake, were judged by the world as misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and wretched men; yet the Spirit of God declares otherwise of them, That they shall live and reign in happinesse with Christ in Heaven. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 This Resurrection is granted to the souls of the Martyrs <hi>Synochdochically,</hi> or <hi>totally</hi>; because their souls shall so farre rise, or be restored, that they shall again be united to their bodies.

because all the visions are terminated in the end of the world, that the godly being injured may expect the day of their deliverance, and occasion of security may quite be taken away from the moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. Wherefore it makes nothing which they say, that <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.21.

For in the <hi>second Vision,</hi> which ends with the 6. <hi>chapter,</hi> a description of the last judgement is not set down, but some particular judgement to be executed about that time, which figures out the last judgement. 2.

            <p n="24">XXIV <hi>Object.</hi> The 20 Chapter of the <hi>Revelation</hi> containeth a Vision<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the summe of all the foregoing visions, and a succinct and brief iteration of the whole prophesie so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; which is divided into three parts. In the <hi>first</hi> is the blessed state of the Church for a good space of time after the first coming of Christ; which is expressed in the first <hi>Seal.</hi> In the <hi>second</hi> are described the painfull labours, and calamities. wherewith the Church shall afterwards wrestle; Of which in the third and fourth <hi>Seals</hi>; and in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth <hi>Trumpets.</hi> In the <hi>third</hi> is set down the joyfull deliverance thereof, and the destruction of her adversaries, with the end and Consummation of all; as before, in the sixth <hi>Seal,</hi> and the seventh <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and seventh <hi>Viall.</hi> But especially in this Vision the punishment of the Devill himself is expressed; when as in the former the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Ministers onely, and his followers was set forth.

The <hi>Triumph</hi> of the Church is either in part, or totall; particular, or universall; begun or consummate.

Now if they rise again to this mortall life, they must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the enterchange or vicissitude of times, as of day, and night, Sommer, and Winter, and must be made subject to the necessity of eating, drinking, and the like. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>Lazarus</hi> and those <hi>Saints</hi> who rose again at the time of <hi>Christ's</hi> Passion, were brought again after long absence here, from life eternall, into this mortall life, notwithstanding they lost not their happinesse hereby. 2. The state of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> shall consist of a happy Kingdom in this life, which shall not any way be discommodated by those things which formerly are objected, as we see the like things no way hindered <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of his innocency, from the full enjoying of perfect happinesse.</p>

            <p n="35">XXXV. <hi>Object.</hi> The Church is sufficiently reformed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no other reformation ought to be expected. The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent may be proved from hence, because the Doctrine of the Fundamentalls of our Salvation is proposed so, that it cannot be done more cleerly, or with greater light. <hi>Answ.</hi> The great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which we declare shall come to passe, shall concerne matter of <hi>Life,</hi> as well as <hi>Doctrine.</hi> As for matter of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the foundation thereof shall remain. But as for those infinite contentions, whereby the Body of Christ is torn in pieces, an end shall be put unto them. Again, many places of Scripture, whose expositions have hitherto troubled the most learned men, shall more cleerly and better be understood. As for matter of <hi>life,</hi> what should I say? The matter it selfe speaks loud enough, that in the whole course of our lives, as good, and as great as we are, we have little or no <hi>Divinity</hi> at all.

Neither is this opinion any way prejudiced, because in the former discourse I have sometimes made mention of glory and Majesty, as part of the happinesse of this <hi>Millenary.</hi> For this <hi>glory</hi> is only <hi>inchoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> or in it's beginning, and shall be broken off by the War of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> But the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Life Eternall</hi> is perfect, and never at all to be interrupted.</p>

            <head>Doctor <hi>Twisse</hi> in his Preface to Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> Book intituled, The Apostasie of the latter times.</head>
            <p>THe beginning of my acquaintance with Master <hi>Mede</hi> was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by a rumour spread of his opinion, concerning the glorious kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> here on earth, which many hundred yeares agoe was cried downe, as the errour of the <hi>Millenaries</hi>: and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> seemed wondrous strange to us, that such an opinion should after so many hundred yeares bee revived; and that in so strange a manner as now we finde, both amongst us, and amongst out-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish <hi>Divines.</hi> Neverthelesse my selfe being firmely set upon studies of another nature, I had no great edge so much as to hearken to it, much lesse to take it into consideration. But a friend in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try sometimes urged mee to write to an acquaintance in <hi>London</hi>; and to enquire of Master <hi>Mede,</hi> whether he were of the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>Piscator</hi> and <hi>Alstedius</hi> concerning the first resurrection, and the glorious kingdome of <hi>Christ.</hi> And hereupon shortly after word was sent me, that hee did agree with <hi>Piscator</hi> in this, that some shall rise a thousand yeares before others, but he differed from him in this, that <hi>Piscator</hi> thought this reigne o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Christ</hi> should bee in heaven; but I (said Master <hi>Mede</hi>) agree rather with <hi>Alstedius</hi> and conceive, that the <hi>thousand yeares</hi> reigne of <hi>Christ</hi> shall bee on earth, yet herein he differed from <hi>Alstedius</hi>; that whereas <hi>Alstedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was of opinion that the <hi>thousand yeares</hi> reigne of <hi>Christ</hi> should be after the day of judgement, Master <hi>Medes</hi> opinion was that it should be <hi>in et durante die judicij,</hi> in and during the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which day of judgement should continue a <hi>thousand yeares,</hi> beginning with the ruine of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and ending with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>When I heard this, my spirit was stirred up in mee to lay aside
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55491:52"/>
for a while my ordinarie studies, and to take this into considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I prayed Master <hi>Mede</hi> to give me leave to propose my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against this opinion of his. And the truth is, the improbability of it seemed very pregnant unto naturall reason, and divers argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that way offered themselvs, which seemed to be of very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cult (if at all possible) solution, and over and above it seemed very contradictious to divers plaine passages of holy Scripture. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> very readily entertained the motion, and prescribed me a time after which he should bee at leisure for me, and in a letter after this, in his familiar manner asked me saying; when come your <hi>Quaerios?</hi> I accepted his courteous answer, and sent up unto him, first and last, twelve arguments against that opinion of his; and at the first I sent him with an answer devised by my selfe to nine of them, for so I had promised him, namely, that I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke my wits of what possibly might bee said in the solution of them, according to the straight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esse of my invention, leaving it to him to approve, or correct, or adde, as he thought good. And whereas I could devise nothing at all in answer to my tenth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he sent me a large answer thereunto in three sides of a sheet of paper, whereby I well perceived,. that my best arguments had been known to him and examined before I devised them.</p>
            <p>After this, I came acquainted with ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y discourses upon the same argument, one printed at <hi>Hanow</hi> in <hi>Germani, de die novissimo,</hi> of the last day; a few onely were printed, two copies (and no more) were brought into <hi>England,</hi> Master <hi>Med,</hi> bought them both, and sent me one of them to copy it out, which we did. After this, no lesse then seven manu-scripts were sent me from one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, treating of this and other mysteries. Now here I cannot but confesse my corruption, for I received them by way of a bribe, and indeed I was to doe him a favour, and I dealt plainely with him, and told him I would not sell my favours <hi>Gratis,</hi> I would be well payed for them. And therefore whereas <hi>I</hi> heard hee had strange n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The good man sent me word, that such bribs should never make me rich:

                           <hi>Hierome,</hi> (all which were stars of the first magnitude in the firmament of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi>) most willingly have afforded their <hi>places</hi> and suffrages to this comfortable Doctrine, I meane for the maine of it. <hi>After a good pause the same Author proceeds thus.</hi> Lastly, In what yeare this new world shall begin, wherein holy men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men shall rejoyce and live together in a most blessed and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, is one of the great secrets of Heaven, all which are unknowne to us mortals (Alas! our dimme eyes, the <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> fellow spies in this Isle of man, cannot pierce those ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Orbes of Heaven.)</p>
                        <p>Indeed so many men so many mindes: One Author assignes this yeare, another that, a third differs in his account from both. But it is agreed on all hands that this thrice happy and golden age is now at hand. <hi>Alstedius</hi> the Champion of the late <hi>Millenarians, and a maine prop of this new revised Doctrine,</hi> names and confidently determines the yeare of <hi>Christ</hi> 1694. (being 52 yeares hence) for the first yeare of this triumphant Reigne of the Saints here on earth. Others judge the time uncertaine, and certainly their judgment (in my judgement) is most certaine. I will turne my private opinion into a prayer, O that the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> would hasten, I againe and againe I wish it, this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kingdome, that so it may come in our times before we be lodged in the silent grave, and moulder into our principles, dust and ashes.
