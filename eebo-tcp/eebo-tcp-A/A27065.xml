         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

what uſage we muſt ordinarily

When we read in the Goſpel, that

and no man is excepted or ſhut

that there are but <hi>few</hi> that find the

that the <hi>flock is little</hi> that ſhall

conclude that ſome powerful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

as to be drawn (in deſpight of all

                  <p>When <hi>Satan</hi> and the <hi>World</hi>
have wounded us by <hi>their Deceits,
Religion</hi> is it that helpeth us to a

<hi>common</hi> a caſe, that where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
is Preached, it ſeems to be
Satans principal game, and the
high-way to hell. There is no

Mediator, between ſinful man,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48274:13"/>
and the offended Majeſty: and yet
what is there in all the world, that
is more abuſed to the deceiving of
mens ſouls, then the <hi>Name</hi> &amp; <hi>Grace</hi>
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Men that might be

cheated and deſtroyed by <hi>falſe

of God, while they are labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be miſerable, by the refuſing
and reſiſting the mercy that would

the Goſpel</hi> do ſupport true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
but are abuſed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of the preſumptuous
world. And ſo the Apoſtle telleth
us that many do by their <hi>Religion:</hi>
They will have a <hi>Religion</hi> to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>

It is the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> that is the
<hi>ſubject</hi> in my text, who is deſcribed
by this double property. 1. That

his <hi>obedience</hi> anſwereth not this
<hi>ſeeming</hi> or profeſſion: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is given in the <hi>bridling of his
tongue,</hi> becauſe that was the point
that the Apoſtle had ſome ſpecial
reaſon to inſiſt on, with thoſe to
whom he immediately directed his
Epiſtle. Though its plain in <hi>ver.
22, 23, &amp;c.</hi> that it is the <hi>whole
work of obedience</hi> that he implyeth,
where he inſtanceth in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
The ſin of the tongue which
he ſpecially intendeth to reprove,
was the bitter reproaching of their
brethren, upon the account of
their differences in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the vilifying of others,
and uncharitable paſſionate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings

The <hi>Predicate</hi> is double: one
by way of <hi>ſuppoſition;</hi> viz. that

<hi>Thracian,</hi> as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and many
others imagine, is of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to our underſtanding of the
text, it being evident that it is the
<hi>worſhipping of God,</hi> that is here
meant by <hi>[Religion];</hi> and it is men
addicted to his worſhip, that are
called <hi>Religious.</hi> The <hi>ſeeming</hi> here
ſpoken of, refers both to <hi>himſelf</hi>
and <hi>others:</hi> he that <hi>ſeemeth</hi> to
<hi>himſelf</hi> to be Religious, or is
judged ſo by <hi>other</hi> men. By
<hi>bridling the tongue,</hi> is meant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
it from evil ſpeech. By
<hi>deceiving himſelf,</hi> is meant, the
miſtake of his judgement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and <hi>acceptableneſs,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48274:15"/>
and <hi>reward</hi> of his Religion, and
the fruſtrating of his own expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
hereupon. His Religion is
ſaid to be [in Vain] in that it ſhall
not attain the ends of an unfeigned
true Religion, of which more anon.
The ſence of the Text then, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in theſe two Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>1. There is a ſeeming Religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which is but ſelf-deceiving,
and will prove in Vain.</p>
                  <p>2. Where ſincere obedience doth not
accompany the profeſſion of Religion,
and in particular, when ſuch men
bridle not their tongues, their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is but Vain and ſelf-deceiving.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two being contained in
the text, the former comprized in
the latter, I ſhall handle them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and ſhew you, 1. <hi>What
this ſeeming Religion is,</hi> and how it
differeth from true Religion.
2. <hi>Wherein</hi> this <hi>ſelf-deceiving</hi> by a
ſeeming Religion doth conſiſt.
3. <hi>Whence it is</hi> that men are ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48274:15"/>
                     <hi>prone</hi> to this <hi>ſelf-deceit. 4. In

truths by a due <hi>application.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Concerning the firſt, I muſt
ſhew you, 1. <hi>What this ſeeming
Religion is made up of.</hi> 2. And
<hi>what it wants,</hi> which maketh it

                  <p>In general, This <hi>Vain Religion,</hi>

of the fooliſh, a teacher of
babes, which hath the form of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and of the truth in the Law,]</hi>
Rom. 2. 18, 19, 20. He may know
<hi>as much materially</hi> as the upright
may, and be able to convince gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers,
and be a notable Champion
for the defending of the truth,
againſt the many adverſaries that
oppoſe it: and ſo may be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48274:16"/>
uſefull in his generation.</p>
                  <p>2. He that is but <hi>Religious in
Vain,</hi> may be frequent in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
of God; and may <hi>ſeek
him daily, and delight to know his
wayes, and to approach him,</hi> and
<hi>ask of him the Ordinances of juſtice,</hi>
as if he were one of the people
that <hi>did righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>forſook
not the Ordinances of their God,</hi>
Iſa. 58. 1, 2. He may be oft in
<hi>faſting,</hi> and punctual in keeping
holy dayes and ceremonies, as
verſe 3. <hi>Iſa. 1. 12, 13, 14, 15.

and neglecting of the body not
in any honour to the ſatisfying of the
fleſh,]</hi> Col. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23. Though
he be ſlow paced in the right way,
he is ſwift in his miſtaken paths.
Though he liketh not preciſeneſs,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48274:17"/>
zeal, and forwardneſs, in the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
works that <hi>God</hi> preſcribeth;
yet when it comes to his <hi>own,</hi> or
other mens <hi>inventions,</hi> he will be
religious and <hi>righteous overmuch,</hi>
Eccleſ. 7. 16. and forward to <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the ſacrifice of a fool,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth
not that he is but <hi>doing
evil,</hi> while he thinks to pleaſe God
with the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of his ſervices,
though he <hi>turn away his ear from</hi>
an obedient <hi>hearing</hi> the word that
ſhould direct him, <hi>Eccleſ. 5. 1, 2.
Prov.</hi> 28. 9.</p>
                  <p>3. He that is but <hi>Religious in
Vain,</hi> may <hi>ſee the evil of diſcord
and diviſions,</hi> and <hi>inveigh</hi> much
againſt <hi>ſchiſmaticks,</hi> and ſee the
<hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>peace;</hi> and
therefore may joyn himſelf with
the <hi>viſible Catholick Church,</hi> and
with the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
that are <hi>moſt</hi> for <hi>unity.</hi> There
have alwayes been <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in
the moſt orderly peaceable ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48274:17"/>
of believers, and ſtill will be.</p>
                  <p>4. The ſelf-deceiving Hypocrite,
is oft-times very <hi>ſenſible of the evil
of vertiginous mutability in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
and therefore he may be
much reſolved to continue what
he is, and may caſt many a jeer
at the weather-cocks of the times,
and the unconſtancy and levity of
ignorant, or temporizing men: and
may ſtand to his party, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
againſt much oppoſition,
as glorying in his conſtancy, and
being aſhamed to be thought a
changling, or ſuch a turn-coat
as others whom he merrily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rideth.</p>
                  <p>5. An Hypocrite that hath no
other <hi>Religion</hi> but deluſory and
<hi>vain,</hi> may <hi>obſerve</hi> the <hi>weakneſſes</hi>
of perſons that are of <hi>lower educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>parts,</hi> and may <hi>loath their
indiſcretion</hi> in conference and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
and their <hi>unhanſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi>
in <hi>prayer</hi> and other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48274:18"/>
and ſhake the head at them,
as ſilly, contemptible, ſelf-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fellows; and his heart may
riſe againſt their diſorder, tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
and affectations: And its
like enough, that hereupon he will
jeaſt at <hi>conceived prayer,</hi> or <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate</hi>
(as they call it;) and bleſs
himſelf as ſafe in his Parrot-like
devotions, becauſe the <hi>ſame ſpirit</hi>
teacheth not <hi>fine words,</hi> and
rhetorical language, to all that it
teacheth to <hi>pray with unutterable
ſighs and groans,</hi> Rom. 8. 26, 27.
though the <hi>ſearcher of hearts</hi> (who
is not delighted with complements
and ſet ſpeeches) doth well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the <hi>meaning of the ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. The ſelf-deceiving Hypocrite
doth frequently pretend to be a
<hi>man of moderation in matters of
Religion,</hi> as diſtaſting the <hi>hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braind
zealots,</hi> as he counteth them,
that cannot be content to have their
<hi>faith and Religion to themſelves</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48274:18"/>
God, and to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>talk as
others do,</hi> but muſt be <hi>ſingular,</hi> and
make a <hi>ſtir</hi> with their Religion,
and turn the world upſide down.
The <hi>true zeal</hi> of the <hi>godly</hi> is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>diſtaſtefull</hi> to him; and the
<hi>corrupt zeal</hi> of <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
doth cauſe him to bleſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his lukewarmneſs, and to
take his moſt odious indifferency,
and want of fervent love to God
and his holy ways to be his vertue.</p>
                  <p>6. This ſelf-deceiving Hypocrite
doth frequently pretend to an
<hi>exceeding great Reverence in the
managing of the outward part of
worſhip;</hi> and to an extraordinary
zeal about the Circumſtantials of
Religion. He accounts them all
<hi>ſchiſmatical and prophane,</hi> that
place not as much of their Religion
as he doth, in geſtures and forms,
and other accidents of worſhip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
us that the Phariſaical
temper in religion is natural, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48274:19"/>
will ſtill continue in the world.</p>
                  <p>7. If the temptation of the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite</hi>
lie on the <hi>other ſide,</hi> he can
withdraw himſelf into ſome <hi>ſmall</hi>
or <hi>ſeparating ſociety,</hi> and place
his Religion in the ſingularity of
his <hi>opinions,</hi> or in the ſtrictneſs of
the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>party</hi> that he <hi>owneth;</hi>
and in his <hi>conceited ability</hi> in his
conceived or ready expreſſions in
prayer; and can cry out as much
upon the <hi>Formaliſt,</hi> as the <hi>Formal
Hypocrite</hi> upon <hi>him:</hi> and glory in
his <hi>zeal,</hi> as the other in his <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</hi>
It is in the <hi>Heart</hi> that
Hypocriſie hath its throne; from
whence it can command the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
acts into <hi>any</hi> ſhapes that are
agreeable to its ends: and can uſe
materials of divers natures, as the
fewell and nutriment of its malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
And what ever party ſuch are
joined to, and what ever way they
have been trained up to, whether
Formality, or ſchiſm, or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48274:19"/>
ſober, equal wayes, in all of
them their <hi>Religion</hi> is but <hi>Vain,</hi> and
they do but <hi>deceive themſelvs</hi> by all.</p>
                  <p>8. The <hi>Religion</hi> that is but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſory
and <hi>Vain,</hi> may be <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with much Alms,</hi> and <hi>works
of ſeeming Juſtice, and Charity,</hi>
Mat. 6. 1, 2. Luke 18. 11, 12.
He may have many vertues cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
moral; and be a man of much
eſteem with others, even with the
beſt and wiſeſt, for his ſeeming
Wiſdom, and piety, and juſtice.
He may be <hi>no extortioner, unjuſt,
adulterer,</hi> but as to groſs ſins ſeem
blameleſs, <hi>Luke 18. 11, 12. Phil.</hi>
3. 6. and be much in reproaching
the ſcandalous lives of others, and
thank God that he is none ſuch,
<hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11.</p>
                  <p>9. He that hath but a <hi>vain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
may in his judgement ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of ſaving grace, and like the
more zealous, upright, ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
heavenly lives of others: and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48274:20"/>
wiſh that he might but die their
death; and wiſh himſelf as happy
as they, ſo it might be had on his
own terms: And he may have
ſome counterſeit of every grace;
and think that it is true. <hi>Numb.
23. 10. Jam.</hi> 2. 14, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor. 13.
1, 2, 3. Mark</hi> 6. 20.</p>
                  <p>10. None will be more forward
to call <hi>another Hypocrite,</hi> then the
<hi>Hypocrite:</hi> nor to extoll ſincerity
and uprightneſs of heart and life.
And thus you ſee what this Vain
Religion is made up with.</p>
                  <p>2. IF you marvell what the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite</hi>
yet <hi>wants,</hi> that makes
his <hi>Religion</hi> deluſory and <hi>Vain,</hi> I
ſhall now tell you I hope to your
conviction and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>1. For all his forementioned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
he wants the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi>
to dwell as his <hi>ſanctifier</hi> within
him; And <hi>[if any man have not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48274:20"/>
the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none
of his]</hi> Rom. 8. 9. But becauſe
this is known by the effects, I add,</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>He wants that</hi> ſpiritual new
birth, <hi>by which he ſhould be made</hi>
ſpiritual, <hi>as his</hi> firſt birth <hi>made
him carnal,</hi> John 3. 5, 6. Rom. 8.
6, 7, 8. <hi>He is</hi> born of the will of the
fleſh, <hi>and</hi> of man, <hi>but not</hi> of God,
John 1. 13. <hi>Form the</hi> firſt man
Adam <hi>he is</hi> become a living ſoul;
<hi>but by the</hi> ſecond man, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the
Lord from heaven, <hi>he is not yet</hi>
quickned <hi>in the</hi> Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor. 15.
45, 46. He is not</hi> born again of
the incorruptible ſeed, the word of
God, that liveth and abideth for
ever, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 23. He is not yet</hi>
ſaved by the waſhing of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(<hi>ſave only as to the outward
baptiſm) and by</hi> renewing of the
Holy Ghoſt, which is ſhed by Chriſt
<hi>on all his members, that</hi> being
juſtified by his grace, they ſhould be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48274:21"/>
made heirs according to the hope of
eternal life, <hi>Tit. 3. 5, 6. They are
not</hi> new creatures, old things <hi>being
not</hi> paſt away, <hi>and</hi> all things, <hi>with
them</hi> become new: <hi>and therefore
it is certain that they are not in</hi>
Chriſt, 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>They have
not</hi> put off the old man with his
deceitfull luſts, <hi>and deeds, nor have</hi>
put on the new man, which after
God is created in righteouſneſs and
true holineſs, <hi>Eph. 3. 22, 23, 24.
Col. 3. 9, 10. They have but patcht
up the old unſanctified hearts, and
ſmooth'd over their carnal conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
with civility and plauſible
deportment, and ſo much Religion
as may cheat themſelves as well as
blind the eyes of others. But
they are</hi> ſtrangers to the life of God,
<hi>Epheſ. 4. 18. and never were
made</hi> partakers of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>which all the children of God
partake of,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>nor of that</hi>
Holineſs, without which none ſhall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48274:21"/>
ſee the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Though he make a ſlight and
cuſtomary confeſſion of his ſins, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs
and miſery, yet</hi> is he not
kindly humbled at the heart, <hi>nor
made truly</hi> vile in his own eyes, <hi>nor</hi>
contrite <hi>and</hi> broken-hearted; <hi>nor</hi>
emptyed of himſelf, <hi>as ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
undone by his own iniquities;
crying out</hi> Unclean, <hi>and</hi> loathing
himſelf for all his abominations;
weary <hi>of his ſin, and</hi> heavy-laden,
<hi>as all muſt be that are fit for Chriſt.
Read</hi> Iſa. 57. 15. &amp; 66. 2. Pſal.
51. 17. &amp; 34. 18. Lev. 13. 44, 45.
Ezek. 36. 31. &amp; 20. 43. &amp; 6. 9.
Matth. 11. 28. Rom. 7. 24.</p>
                  <p>4. This mans Religion muſt
needs be <hi>Vain;</hi> for he wanteth the
<hi>life of faith it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>heartily
believeth not in Chriſt.</hi> He hath
but an <hi>opinion</hi> of the truth of
Chriſtianity, through the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of his education and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and thereupon doth <hi>call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48274:22"/>
a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and <hi>heartleſly talk</hi>
of the myſterie of Redemption
as a <hi>common thing.</hi> But he doth
not with an humbled broken heart,
betake himſelf to Chriſt as his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuge from the wrath of God
and everlaſting miſery, as he
would lay hold on the hand of his
friend, if he were drowning: The
ſenſe of the odiouſneſs of ſin, and
of the damnation threatned by
the righteous God, hath not yet
taught him to value Chriſt, as he
muſt be valued by ſuch as will be
ſaved by him. Theſe hypocrites
do but <hi>talk</hi> of Chriſt, and turn
<hi>his name,</hi> as they do <hi>their prayers,</hi>
into the matter of a <hi>dry and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
form.</hi> They flie not to him
as the only Phyſician of their ſouls,
in the feeling of their feſtring
wounds: they cry not to him as
the Diſciples in the tempeſt, <hi>Save
Maſter, we periſh.</hi> They value him
not practically (though notionally
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48274:22"/>
they do) as the <hi>pearl</hi> for which
they muſt <hi>ſell all,</hi> Matth. 13. 44,
45, 46. Chriſt doth not <hi>dwell in
his heart by faith:</hi> nor doth he
long <hi>with all the Saints to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
what is the breadth, and length,
and depth, and height, and to know
the love of Chriſt which paſſeth
knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3. 17, 18, 19. He
counteth not <hi>all things loſs for
Chriſt, and the excellency of his
knowledge,</hi> nor doth he <hi>count them
as dung,</hi> that he may <hi>win Chriſt,
and be found in him, not having his
own righteouſneſs, but that which is
through the faith of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.
8, 9, 10. nor can he truly ſay,
that he <hi>deſireth to know nothing but
a crucified Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. and
that <hi>the life that he now liveth in
the fleſh, he liveth by the faith of the
Son of God that loved him, and
gave himſelf for him,]</hi> Gal. 2. 20.
He is not taken up with that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the love of God in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48274:23"/>
Chriſt, as beſeems a ſoul that is
ſaved by him from the flames of
hell, and that is reconciled to God,
and made an heir of life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He hath not underſtandingly,
deliberately, ſeriouſly, and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
given up himſelf and all
that he hath to Chriſt: and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
accepted Chriſt and life, as
given on the Goſpel terms to him.
This <hi>living effectual faith</hi> is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Hypocrite, whoſe <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
is <hi>Vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. This <hi>Vain Religion</hi> doth <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
practically ſhew the ſoul the
amiableneſs and attractive goodneſs
of God, ſo far as to win the heart to
a practical eſtimation of him, and
adhering to him above all;</hi> nor ſo
far as to advance him <hi>above all the
creatures</hi> in the <hi>practical judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
will and converſation:</hi> nor
doth it cauſe the ſoul to take him
for its portion, and prefer his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
before all the world, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48274:23"/>
it ſelf and all unto his intereſt
and will, and give him the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
and ſoveraign honour, both
in heart and life: <hi>Pſal</hi> 63. 3. and
30. 5. and 4. 6, 7. and 16. 5. and
17. 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37.</p>
                  <p>6. This <hi>Vain Religion</hi> is alwayes
without that <hi>ſerious belief of the life
to come,</hi> which cauſeth the ſoul to
take it for its <hi>happineſs and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi>
and there to ſet its <hi>deſires</hi> and
its <hi>hopes,</hi> and to make it his <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
care and buſineſs to attain it;</hi>
and to make all the pleaſures, and
profits, and honours of the world
to ſtoop to it, as preferring it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 20, 21.
and <hi>ver. 33. Luk.</hi> 18. 22, 23. and
14, 33. <hi>Col. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Phil.</hi>
3. 18, 19, 20. The Hypocrite tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>heaven</hi> but for a <hi>reſerve,</hi> and as
a <hi>leſſer evil then hell,</hi> and ſeeks it
but in the <hi>ſecond place,</hi> while his
fleſhly pleaſures and intereſt have
the preheminence, and God hath
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48274:24"/>
no more but the <hi>leavings of the
world;</hi> and he ſerveth him but
with ſo much as his <hi>fleſh can
ſpare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. This <hi>Vain Religion</hi> conſiſteth
principally in <hi>external obſervances:</hi>
If he be a <hi>Formaliſt</hi> that hath it,
his Religion lyeth in his beads and
prayer books; in going ſo oft to
Church, and keeping holy dayes
and faſting dayes, and ſaying over
ſuch and ſuch words, and uſing
ſuch and ſuch geſtures and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and ſubmitting to Church
orders, and crying down <hi>Sectaries</hi>
and preciſeneſs, and jearing at the
ſimplicity of plain hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
that never learnt the art of
diſſimulation. Their Religion is
but a pack of Complements, a
flattering of God, as if they would
mock him with cap an knee, (who
will not be mocked,) <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7.
while they <hi>draw near him with
their lips, their hearts are far from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48274:24"/>
him,</hi> Mat. 15. 7, 8, 9. They <hi>waſh
the outſide,</hi> and pay <hi>tithe of all;</hi> and
give ſome <hi>almes,</hi> and forbear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful
ſins, which would make
them be eſteemed ungodly among
men, <hi>Mat. 15. 2, 3. Mar. 7. 4,
8. Matth.</hi> 23. 25, 26, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi>
6. 1, 4, 6. &amp;c <hi>Iſa. 1. 11, 12, 13,
14. Iſa.</hi> 58. 1, 2. But theſe ſelf-deceivers
are ſtrangers to the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
ſpiritual work of holineſs:
Their <hi>hearts</hi> are not buſie in the
worſhip of God, by fervent <hi>deſire,</hi>
and exerciſe of other graces, while
their <hi>tongues</hi> are put into an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
pace, and they are acting the
part of men that <hi>ſeem</hi> to be <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they be caſt into the <hi>Sectarian</hi>
mold, they place their Religion in
the ſtrictneſs of their <hi>Principles</hi>
and <hi>Parties,</hi> and in <hi>contending</hi> for
<hi>them,</hi> and in their <hi>affected fervour,</hi>
and ability to <hi>ſpeak</hi> and pray <hi>ex
tempore.</hi> But the <hi>humble, holy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48274:25"/>
workings of the ſoul toward
God,</hi> and its <hi>breathings after him,</hi>
and the watch that it ſets over the
heart, this hypocrite is much a
ſtranger to.</p>
                  <p>If he be brought up among
the <hi>Orthodox</hi> in well ordered
Churches, he placeth his Religion
in the <hi>holding of the truth,</hi> and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>right ſide,</hi> and ſubmitting
to <hi>right order,</hi> and uſing Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances:
but the moſt of an <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi>
mans employment is at <hi>home,
within him;</hi> to order his <hi>ſoul,</hi> and
exerciſe <hi>grace,</hi> and keep down ſin,
and keep out the world, and keep
under the fleſh, and carnal ſelf,
and do the <hi>inward</hi> part of duty:
And he is as truly ſolicitous about
<hi>this,</hi> as about the <hi>outward</hi> works:
and contenteth not himſelf to have
<hi>ſaid</hi> his prayers, unleſs indeed his
<hi>heart</hi> have prayed; nor to have
<hi>heard,</hi> unleſs he have <hi>profited,</hi> or
heard with obediential attention:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48274:25"/>
And he makes conſcience of <hi>ſecret</hi>
duties, as well as of thoſe that are
done in the ſight of men: But this
the hypocrite comes not up to,
to <hi>trade</hi> in the <hi>internal ſpiritual</hi>
part.</p>
                  <p>8. The <hi>Religion</hi> that is <hi>Vain,</hi> is
<hi>without an univerſal hatred of
known ſin,</hi> and an actual conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, ſo far as to live out of
<hi>groſs</hi> ſin, (which ſome call mortal)
and to be weary of infirmities, and
to be truly deſirous to be rid of
all; and to be willing to uſe Gods
means againſt it. Thus it is with
the <hi>ſincerely</hi> Religious; but not
with theſe hypocrites that <hi>deceive
themſelves,</hi> Joh. 3. 19, 20. Rom.
7. 24. Luk. 13. 3, 5. Rom. 8. 1.
to the 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8. The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
hath not only ſome <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
ſin, which all his Religion
makes him not willing to ſee to be a
ſin, or to forſake; but his very <hi>ſtate</hi>
is ſinful in the <hi>main,</hi> by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48274:26"/>
of a ſelfiſh carnal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
and principle: And he is not
willing of cloſe plain dealing, much
leſs of the diligent uſe of means
himſelf to overcome that ſin: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he loveth it.</p>
                  <p>9. This <hi>Vain Religion</hi> is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with <hi>an unſeigned Love
to a life of holineſs,</hi> which every
true believer hath, delighting to
meditate in the Law of God, with
a <hi>practical</hi> intention to obey it;
and delighting in the <hi>inward</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of grace, and outward ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
as advantages <hi>hereunto;</hi>
deſiring ſtill more of the grace
which he hath taſted, and grieving
that he knoweth, and truſteth, and
loveth, and feareth, and obeyeth
God ſo little, and longing to reach
higher, to know, and love, and
fear him more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2. and

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48274:26"/>
hath a <hi>ſecret diſlike</hi> of this <hi>ſerious
diligence</hi> for ſalvation, and loving
God with all the ſoul, and might,
(becauſe he is conſcious that he
reacheth it not himſelf,) or at
leaſt he will not be brought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
any more then will ſtand
with his carnal ends.</p>
                  <p>10. A <hi>Vain Religion</hi> doth not
ſo far reveal the excellency of
<hi>Chriſts image in his ſervants,</hi> as to
cauſe <hi>an entire Love to them as
ſuch;</hi> and to <hi>delight</hi> in them above
the moſt ſplendid and accompliſht
perſons that are ſtrangers to the
life of grace; and ſo far to love
them, as when Chriſt requireth it,
to part with our ſubſtance, and
hazard our ſelves for their relief.
Thus do the truly Religious, <hi>Pſal.</hi>

Matth. 10. 40. 11. 42. and</hi> 25.
34, 35, 40, 42, 45, 46. But the

the people that are ſuch, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſeem to condemn him
by overgoing him, and differing
from him) or at leaſt he only <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially
approveth</hi> of them; but
will forſake both Chriſt and them
in tryal, rather then forſake his
earthen God. I have now ſhewed
you what the ſelf-deceiver wants,
in which you may ſee ſufficient
reaſon why his Religion is but
Vain.</p>
                  <p>II. WE are next to ſhew you,
<hi>How theſe Hypocrites do
deceive themſelves,</hi> and wherein
their ſelf-deceit conſiſteth. It may
ſeem ſtrange that a man of reaſon
ſhould do ſuch a thing as this,
when we conſider that truth is
naturally the object of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and that all men <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi>
love themſelves, and therefore
love what they know to be ſimply
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48274:27"/>
good for them: How then can
any man, that hath the uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
be <hi>willing</hi> to be <hi>deceived,</hi> yea
and be his <hi>own deceiver,</hi> and that in
matters of unſpeakable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence!
But it is not <hi>as falſhood,</hi>
nor <hi>as deceit</hi> that they deſire it:
but as it appeareth neceſſary to
the carnal eaſe and pleaſure which
they deſire.</p>
                  <p>The way by which they deceive
their own hearts, conſiſteth in
theſe following degrees.</p>
                  <p>1. The hypocrite <hi>reſiſteth the
Spirit of grace,</hi> and rejecteth the
mercies offered in the Goſpel, and
ſo by his refuſal, is deprived of a
part in Chriſt, and of the life of
grace, and the hopes of glory,
which were tendered to him.</p>
                  <p>2. But withal, he is <hi>willing of ſo
much</hi> of this mercy as <hi>conſiſteth
with his ſinful diſpoſition, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
intereſt:</hi> He is willing enough
to be <hi>happy in general,</hi> and to be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48274:28"/>
                     <hi>ſaved from hell fire,</hi> and to be <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,</hi>
and to have <hi>ſuch a heaven</hi> as
he hath framed a pleaſing imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of.</p>
                  <p>3. And therefore he maketh
him up a <hi>Religion of ſo much of
Chriſtianity as will ſtand with his
Pleaſures, profits and reputation</hi> in
the world, that ſo he may not be
<hi>left in deſpair</hi> of being ſaved, when
he muſt leave the world that he
<hi>muſt</hi> loved. The <hi>cheap</hi> and the
<hi>eaſie</hi> parts of Chriſtianity, and
thoſe that are <hi>moſt in credit</hi> in the
world, and that <hi>fleſh and blood have
leaſt againſt,</hi> theſe he will cull out
from among the reſt, and make
him a Religion of, paſſing by the
dearer, and more difficult, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
parts.</p>
                  <p>4. Having gone thus far, he
perſwadeth his own heart, that
<hi>this kind of Religion</hi> which he hath
patcht up and framed to himſelf,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Religion,</hi> the Faith, the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48274:28"/>
Hope, the Charity, the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
the Obedience, to which
Salvation is promiſed. And that
he is a <hi>true Chriſtian,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his defects; and that his
ſpots are but ſuch as are conſiſtent
with grace, and that his ſins are
but <hi>pardoned infirmities:</hi> and that
he hath part in Chriſt, and the
promiſes of life, and ſhall be ſaved,
though he be not of the preciſer
ſtrain. When he committeth any
ſin, he confidently imagineth, that
his <hi>confeſſion</hi> and his <hi>wiſhing it were
undone again</hi> (when he hath had
all the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eaſure that ſin can give
him) <hi>is true repentance:</hi> and that
<hi>as a penitent</hi> he ſhall be forgiven.
And thus while he thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<hi>ſomething,</hi> when he is <hi>nothing,</hi>
he <hi>deceiveth himſelf,</hi> Gal. 6. 3. He
hath a <hi>counterfeit</hi> of every grace of
God. A counterfeit Faith, and
Hope, and Love, and Repentance,
and Zeal, and Humility, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48274:29"/>
and Perſeverance: and
theſe he will needs take to be the
very life and image of Chriſt, and
the graces themſelves that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>5. Having got this <hi>Carkaſs of
Religion</hi> without the <hi>ſoul,</hi> he
makes uſe of all thoſe things to
<hi>confirm him</hi> in his deceit, which
are appointed to <hi>confirm true
Chriſtians</hi> in their Faith and Hope.
When he reads or thinks of the
<hi>infinite Goodneſs, Love and Mercy
of God,</hi> he thinks God could not be
<hi>ſo good</hi> and <hi>merciful,</hi> if he ſhould
refuſe to ſave all ſuch as he. When
he readeth of the <hi>undertaking</hi> and
<hi>ſacrifice of Chriſt,</hi> and how he is a
<hi>propitiation for the ſins of the whole
world,</hi> he confidently hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth,
that a Saviour ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that hath done and ſuffered ſo
much for ſinners, cannot condemn
<hi>all ſuch as he.</hi> When he readeth
of the <hi>extent and freeneſs of Grace,</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48274:29"/>
in the <hi>promiſes</hi> of the Goſpel, he
concludeth that <hi>theſe promiſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to <hi>him,</hi> and that <hi>Grace</hi> could
not be ſo <hi>free</hi> and ſo extenſive, if
it did ſhut out all ſuch as he. When
he obſerveth the <hi>Mercies of God
upon his body,</hi> in his friends, and
health, and credit, and proſperity,
he concludeth, that ſurely God
<hi>loveth him as a child,</hi> in that he
dealeth ſo <hi>Fatherly</hi> with him. If
he <hi>ſuffer adverſity,</hi> he thinks that
it is the <hi>Fatherly chaſtiſement</hi> of
God, and therefore proveth him
to be <hi>his ſon,</hi> and that he ſhall have
his <hi>good things</hi> in the world to
come, becauſe he had his <hi>evils
here.</hi> If he ſuffer any thing for a
good cauſe, (or a cauſe that he tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be good) he taketh himſelf
to be a <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> and marked out
for life eternal. If he give any
conſiderable <hi>alms,</hi> he applyeth all
the promiſes to himſelf that are
made to thoſe that are <hi>truly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:48274:30"/>
though he giveth but the
<hi>leavings of the fleſh,</hi> and giveth but
<hi>on common compaſſions,</hi> or <hi>for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,</hi>
or for ſome <hi>common end,</hi>
and not <hi>as to Chriſt</hi> whom he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth
in his members, as one
that hath reſigned all unto him. If
he <hi>pray,</hi> from the lips only, or only
for pardon and ſuch other mercies
as fleſh it ſelf would be glad to
have, without the unexpreſſable
groans of the ſpirit, for ſpiritual
mercies (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26) he preſently
applyeth all the promiſes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that are made to the <hi>upright
that call upon God.</hi> And thus
<hi>Love, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi>
are abuſed by him to this damning
work of <hi>ſelf-deceit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Moreover, he makes uſe of
<hi>all the ordinances of God,</hi> to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi>
of <hi>his own heart.</hi> The <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
part of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> perſwades
him that he is <hi>inwardly regenerate.</hi>
He receiveth the <hi>Lords ſupper,</hi> that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48274:30"/>
he may confirm his <hi>preſumption,</hi>
and increaſe his <hi>ſelf-deceit,</hi> as the
godly receive it to confirm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their <hi>ſaving faith.</hi> He joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with the <hi>Church</hi> in thoſe <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and praiſes</hi> that are <hi>fitted to the
true believers ſtate,</hi> that he may
thence more confidently <hi>deceive
his own heart,</hi> with the conceit that
<hi>he is a true believer.</hi> And thus he
turneth the bread of life, and all
the helps and means of grace, to
the ſtrengthening of his ſin, and
the furthering of his perdition.</p>
                  <p>7. Moreover, this miſerable
<hi>ſelf-deceiver,</hi> doth uſually get into
ſuch <hi>company</hi> as may further his
<hi>ſelf-deceit,</hi> and maketh uſe of them
to that end. If he get into any
<hi>holy well-ordered Church</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
it is that by his <hi>outward
communion</hi> with the Saints, he may
ſeem to himſelf to have <hi>inward
communion</hi> with them. If he get
among <hi>able godly</hi> Miniſters and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48274:31"/>
other judicious Chriſtians, and
finds that he is <hi>well eſteemed</hi> of by
them, he is confirmed hereby in his
<hi>preſumption and ſelf-deceit:</hi> when
alas, we muſt in <hi>charity</hi> judge of
men as they <hi>profeſs and ſeem,</hi> and
leave the <hi>infallible judgement</hi> of
the <hi>heart</hi> to God. <hi>Vſually</hi> this
ſelf-deceiving hypocrite doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate
with ſome <hi>carnal</hi> or <hi>facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
men, with whom he makes
himſelf a <hi>party:</hi> and ſuch will
ſmooth him up, and make a Saint
of him, either becauſe <hi>they</hi> are <hi>as
bad</hi> themſelves, and dare not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him, leſt they condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
or becauſe they <hi>are flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers</hi>
and <hi>dawbers,</hi> or men that
were never themſelves acquainted
with thoſe ſaving operations of the
Spirit which he wants, or becauſe
they are <hi>partial</hi> to one of their
<hi>own faction.</hi> And thus a <hi>formal
hypocrite</hi> may be ſtroaked by <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſts,</hi>
and a <hi>Schiſmatical Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:48274:31"/>
may be ſoothed up by thoſe
of his own <hi>Sect</hi> (as lamentable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
telleth us that ſuch do)
to the increaſe of their pernicious
ſelf-deceit.</p>
                  <p>Yea more then ſo; if theſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
fall in company with the
<hi>notoriouſly prophane,</hi> from them
they will fetch ſome confirmation
of their <hi>ſelf-deceit:</hi> when they
hear them ſwear, and curſe, and
rant, and ſee them drunk, they
ſecretly with the Phariſee rejoyce,
and ſay, <hi>I thank thee Lord that I
am not as this Publican.</hi> And this
is one reaſon why <hi>ſuch hypoorites</hi>
are well content to have <hi>ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
in their <hi>families,</hi> or ſome
<hi>neighbours</hi> or <hi>company</hi> about them
that are <hi>notoriouſly prophane,</hi> that
their deluded conſciences, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that they are <hi>more civil and
religious</hi> themſelves, may hence ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comfort, that they are the
ſervants of God, and in a ſtate of
grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48274:32"/>
Hence alſo it is, that thoſe of
them that go on the <hi>Schiſmatical
ſide,</hi> do purpoſely go into <hi>ſeparated
ſocieties,</hi> that by withdrawing from
ſo many, and (as they ſpeak) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out from among them,</hi> they may
ſeem to themſelves to be <hi>fellow-Citizens
with the Saints,</hi> and to be
of the <hi>little flock</hi> that ſhall have
the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> This is the uſe that
ſelf-deceivers make of their <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Moreover, the Hypocrite
confirmeth his ſelf-deceit, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the <hi>great numbers</hi> of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
perſons worſe then he,</hi> that are
in the world: This makes him
think that God ſhould be <hi>unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
and heaven be empty, if all
ſuch as he ſhould be ſhut out: <hi>the
damnation of ſo many</hi> ſeemeth ſo
<hi>incredible</hi> to him, that it much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
his confidence and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceit.</p>
                  <p>9. And he deceiveth himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48274:32"/>
by a <hi>miſobſerving and miſapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the falls and infirmities of the
ſervants of the Lord,</hi> and the <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
lives</hi> of <hi>many Hypocrites</hi> like
himſelf. When he readeth of <hi>Noahs</hi>
drunkenneſs, and <hi>Lots</hi> drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and inceſt, and <hi>Davids</hi> adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
and murder, and <hi>Peters</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal
of his Maſter with curſing
and ſwearing, he conſidereth not
how much theſe <hi>ſingular actions</hi>
were <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>ſcope</hi> of <hi>their
lives,</hi> nor by what <hi>ſerious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
they did <hi>riſe,</hi> and do ſo no
more; but he hence concludeth
that ſure he is in a ſtate of grace,
that hath <hi>no ſuch</hi> heinous ſins as
theſe: though indeed he hath <hi>more
heinous</hi> continually within him,
(even a love of the world and
pleaſure above God, a ſecret root
of unbelief, a ſervitude to the fleſh,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) when he ſeeth any about him
that profeſs the fear of God, prove
Hypocrites or Apoſtates, or fall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48274:33"/>
into any ſcandalous ſin, he ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth
his preſumption by it, and
concludeth that this profeſſion of
<hi>greater holineſs</hi> then he himſelf
hath, is but <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> and that
he is as good as thoſe that ſeem
more <hi>devout,</hi> though he make not
ſo much ado with his religion: or
at leaſt that ſuch as <hi>he</hi> ſhall be
ſaved, when thoſe are ſo bad that
are accounted better: If there be
but a <hi>Cham</hi> in the Ark and Family
of <hi>Noah,</hi> an <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi>
houſe, an <hi>Eſau</hi> in <hi>Jacobs,</hi> an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom</hi>
in <hi>Davids,</hi> a <hi>Judas</hi> among
the Diſciples of Chriſt, theſe ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceivers
will thence fetch matter
for their own deluſion and perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if the reſt were all as bad,
or ſanctification were not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>10. The ſelf-deceiver alſo is
confirmed in his preſumption, <hi>by
taking to himſelf the comforts that
Miniſters hold forth, for truly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48274:33"/>
humbled upright ſouls,</hi> that are apt
to be too much diſquieted and caſt
down. Our Congregations are
mixt of <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>ungodly,</hi> and
<hi>broken-hearted</hi> and <hi>hard-hearted,
dejected</hi> and <hi>ſelf-confident</hi> ſinners
(beſides all thoſe that are well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in their ſpiritual peace.) And as
we cannot tell how to tell the
wicked of their miſery, nor open
the Hypocrites ſelf-deceit, but the
ſelf-ſuſpecting humbled ſouls will
miſapply it to themſelves, and be
more dejected by it, and ſay, <hi>It is
thus with me;</hi> ſo we cannot tell
how to <hi>comfort</hi> the <hi>diſtreſſed,</hi> and
clear up the evidences of a droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſoul, but the <hi>preſumptuous Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite</hi>
will lay hold upon it, and
think that it belongs to <hi>him.</hi> Every
comfortable Book or Scripture
that he readeth, and every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Sermon or diſcourſe
which he heareth, is abuſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
his ſelf-deceit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48274:34"/>
11. It increaſeth the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
ſelf-deceit, <hi>when he findeth
ſome partial reformation in himſelf,</hi>
and that he hath mended many
things that were amiſs: This he
takes for a <hi>true converſion,</hi> and
thinks that the civilizing and
ſmoothing of his life, the change of
his opinion, and the taking up a
form of godlineſs, are <hi>true Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi>
and that he is not the
man that once he was; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is in a ſafe condition: Though
alas he hath never yet known by
experience, the new <hi>heart,</hi> the new
<hi>ends,</hi> the new <hi>reſolutions, affections,</hi>
and <hi>converſation</hi> of a Saint.</p>
                  <p>12. Laſtly, he deceiveth himſelf
by <hi>miſunderſtanding the nature of
hypocriſie.</hi> Becauſe he perceiveth
not that he is a <hi>groſs diſſembler,</hi> but
meaneth as he ſpeaks, ſo far as he
goes, therefore he thinks he is no
Hypocrite: Whereas beſides the
<hi>groſs</hi> Hypocrite that knoweth he

They are <hi>carnal</hi> from the
birth: (for that which is born of
the fleſh only, is but fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi>
3. 6.) and cuſtom in ſinning fixeth
and increaſeth their ſinful diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
Their hearts are engaged
to their worldly accommodations,
and to their vain-glory, and the
things that pleaſe the fleſh: They

And therefore they
cannot admit of that Religion
which would deprive them of that
which they moſt dearly love.
Chriſt ſpeaks too late to them.
They tell him they are promiſed

loves, and to lay that at our feet
that before was as our treaſure,
and to tame that body, and bring it
into ſubjection, which before was
in the throne. The <hi>motions</hi> of ſuch
a change will not be acceptable, till
they are made ſo effectual as to
<hi>cauſe</hi> that change: The command
will be unpleaſant, till the <hi>heart</hi> be
ſuited to the <hi>nature</hi> of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
He that ſeeth what care
and labour there is to gather a
worldly treaſure, and what a ſtir
is made in the world about it, can
never expect that all this ſhould
be vilified and deſpiſed at a word,
and that any doctrine (how true
and heavenly ſoever,) can be well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to theſe worldly men, that
would debaſe their glory, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter
their delights, and make
their Idol ſeem but dung. The
doctrine of Chriſt would take the
<hi>old heart</hi> out of their bodies: and
they will not eaſily leave their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48274:36"/>
hearts. It doth not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the drunkard to live ſoberly,
and the glutton temperately, and
the laſcivious filthy ſinner chaſtly,
and the proud perſon humbly, and
the covetous to live contentedly
and liberally; but it commandeth
the <hi>hearty forſaking of all, for the
ſake of Chriſt, Luke</hi> 14. 33. and
the <hi>accounting them but as loſs and
dung that we may win him,</hi> Phil.
3. 7, 8, 9. and <hi>mortifying of that
fleſh</hi> which before we daily ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to pleaſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4, 5. and the
<hi>crucifying of its affections and luſts,</hi>
Gal. 5. 24. and the <hi>denyal</hi> even of
<hi>our ſelves,</hi> Luk. 9. 23, 24. And
for a <hi>carnal mind</hi> to love and yield
to <hi>ſuch</hi> commands, were no other
then to <hi>ceaſe to be a carnal mind.</hi>
All this is largely expreſſed by the
Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, &amp;c. <hi>They
that are in Chriſt Jeſus, walk not
after the fleſh, but after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
—For they that are after the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48274:36"/>
fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh:
but they that are after the Spirit,
the things of the Spirit: For to be
carnally-minded is death, but to be
Spiritually minded is life and peace.
Becauſe the carnal mind is enmity
againſt God: for it is not ſubject to
the Law of God, neither indeed can
be. So then they that are in the fleſh,
cannot pleaſe God.—For if ye live
after the fleſh, ye ſhall die: but if
through the Spirit ye mortifie the
deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee here why it is that the
ſelf-deceiver will not entertain the
power of godlineſs, nor be <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſeriouſly</hi> according to the true
intent of the Goſpel, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Chriſtianity, even becauſe
he is <hi>engaged</hi> to a <hi>contrary object,</hi>
and hath another game in chaſe,
which he will not leave, and which
true Religion requireth him to
leave, and will not give him leave
to follow. And therefore he part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48274:37"/>
with the Religion which
would have parted him from that
which he will not part with.</p>
                  <p>2. But withall, he is all this
while under the threatenings of
the Law of God, and conſcience is
ready to bear witneſs againſt him;
and betwixt <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi>
the poor wretch is as the corn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Milſtones; he would be
ground to powder, and tortured
with terrors before his time, if he
had not ſome opiate or intoxicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
medicine, to <hi>eaſe</hi> him by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi>
him, and to abate his fears,
and quiet his conſcience as long as
a palliate cure will ſerve turn. So
that here are two things for which
the <hi>ſelf-deceiving Hypocrite</hi> is fain
to fall into his <hi>Vain Religion:</hi> The
one is, that it may be a <hi>cloak</hi> to the
<hi>ſin</hi> which he will <hi>needs keep:</hi> The
other is, that it may ſave him from
the <hi>terrors</hi> and <hi>diſquietments,</hi> that
<hi>for this ſin</hi> his conſcience would
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48274:37"/>
elſe afflict him with. A belief that
<hi>he may be ſaved, for all his ſin,</hi> is the
relief that he hath againſt the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the Law of God. He
therefore chooſeth out ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of Religion as may ſerve him
for <hi>this uſe,</hi> and yet will not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
him from the ſin that he
delighteth in. The power of
godlineſs will not conſiſt with his
cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ous, proud or fleſhly life:
but the form and outſide will. And
therefore this regeneration, and
mortification, and ſelf-denyal, and
ſubjection to the whole will of
God, and this heavenly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and watching the heart, and
walking with God, and living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the trifles of this world, and
making it the chief buſineſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for another; <hi>this</hi> kind of
<hi>Religion,</hi> which is <hi>Religion indeed,</hi>
he <hi>cannot</hi> (becauſe he <hi>will not</hi>) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain.
<hi>This</hi> is the <hi>ſtrait gate,</hi>
and <hi>narrow way,</hi> that <hi>few men find.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48274:38"/>
Here</hi> he muſt be <hi>excuſed.</hi> God is
no <hi>God for him,</hi> upon theſe terms,
(And he cannot and will not be his
God on any other terms.) Chriſt
is no Chriſt for him, unleſs he will
excuſe him from this trouble, and
bear with him in his carnal courſe;
that is, unleſs he will be indeed no
Chriſt to him. Heaven is no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for him, unleſs he may paſs
to it through proſperity, and ſin;
and unleſs he may have it without
the trouble of a holy life; that is,
unleſs God will be unjuſt or falſe,
and heaven ceaſe to be heaven, and
God ceaſe to be God.</p>
                  <p>But yet theſe men are convinced
that God is their rightful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and that indeed they ſhould
love him and ſerve him with all
their heart and might, and that
without true Religion and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
there is no ſalvation. To be
<hi>irreligious</hi> and <hi>prophane</hi> they know
is a ſtate that can <hi>afford no comfort,</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:48274:38"/>
or ſhelter from the wrath of God;
and therefore <hi>ſome Religion</hi> they
muſt have: They are not able to
endure the thoughts of lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the curſe of God. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
themſelves to be utterly
graceleſs, and the children of the
Devil, and in a ſtate of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is ſo terrible, that they are
not able to endure it: Then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sermon they hear would tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
them, and every Chapter
they read would torment them;
and their pleaſures would all be
imbittered to them, and nothing
that they enjoy in all the world,
would quiet and content them.
(No, nor ſhall do long) And
therefore they muſt needs take up
ſome Religion, to quiet them for
a little while, and to make them
hope, that for all their ſins, they
are not ſo bad, nor in ſo dangerous
a caſe as Preachers tell them; <hi>ſome
Religion</hi> they muſt <hi>needs</hi> have for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48274:39"/>
fear of being <hi>damned: A ſound and
ſerious</hi> Religion they <hi>will not</hi> have,
becauſe they <hi>love the world and ſin,</hi>
which it would deprive them of:
And therefore they patch up a
<hi>Vain Religion,</hi> compoſed of ſo
much <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> as will ſtand
with their proſperity and beloved
pleaſures: which will not ſave
them, but ſufficeth to deceive
them.</p>
                  <p>Two parts make up this ſelf.
deceiving frame, as conſiſtent with
their ſins: The one is the <hi>formal,
outward, eaſie, cheap</hi> part of duty
to God and man, in their <hi>practiſe;</hi>
leaving out the ſpiritual, inward,
difficult, dear, ſelf-denying part.
The other is, the <hi>ſtricteſt</hi> parts of
Religion in <hi>bare opinion</hi> and <hi>notion;</hi>
while they ſhut it out of their
<hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>lives.</hi> For both theſe
may ſtand with a ſenſual, worldly,
ſelfiſh life. He may read or ſay his
prayers, and be a worldling ſtill:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48274:39"/>
He may come to Church, and with
the greateſt ceremony and ſeeming
reverence receive the Sacrament,
and bow before the Lord his
Maker, and yet be <hi>ſenſual</hi> or a
<hi>worldling</hi> ſtill. And he may be of
the <hi>ſtricteſt party or opinion,</hi> and
<hi>notionally</hi> condemn all ſin, and
juſtifie the moſt holy life, and yet
be ſenſual and worldly ſtill. And
therefore this much he may be
perſwaded to take up, to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from the laſhes of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And ſo the uſe of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
Religion is to be a <hi>skreen</hi>
betwixt him and the flames of
wrath, that would ſcorch him too
ſoon, if he were of <hi>no Religion:</hi> and
to be to him as a <hi>tent</hi> or <hi>pentiſe,</hi> to
keep off the ſtorms that would fall
upon him, while he is trading for
the world, and working for the
fleſh. His Religion is but the
<hi>ſheath</hi> of his guilty conſcience, to
keep it from wounding him, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48274:40"/>
cutting his fingers, while they are
buſie in the brutiſh ſervice of
his luſts. It is but as a <hi>glove,</hi> to
ſave his skin, when he hath to do
with the nettles and thorns of the
threatenings of God, and the
thoughts of vengeance, that elſe
would rack his guilty ſoul. It is
but as his <hi>upper garment,</hi> to ſave
him from a <hi>storm,</hi> and then to be
laid by as an unneceſſary burden,
when he is at home. The Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
Religion is but as his <hi>ſhooe:</hi>
he can tread it in the dirt, ſo it
will but ſave his foot from galling.
As a man that hath an <hi>unquiet
ſcolding wife,</hi> is fain to ſpeak her
fair by flatteries, leſt he ſhould
have no reſt at home; or as a <hi>thief</hi>
is fain to caſt a cruſt to the <hi>dog</hi> that
barketh at him, to ſtop his mouth;
ſo is an ungodly ſenſual perſon,
fain to <hi>flatter</hi> his conſcience with
<hi>ſome kind</hi> of <hi>Religiouſneſs,</hi> and to
ſtop its mouth with ſome kind of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48274:40"/>
devotion and ſeeming righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that may deceive him into a
belief that he is the child of God.
Religion is the <hi>Soveraign</hi> in a <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
ſoul, and the <hi>Maſter</hi> in an
<hi>upright</hi> conſcience, and ruleth
above all worldly intereſts. But
with the unregenerate, it is but an
<hi>underling</hi> and <hi>ſervant,</hi> that muſt do
no more then the fleſh and the
world will give conſent to; and is
regarded no further then for <hi>meer
neceſſity;</hi> and when it hath done
the work which the Hypocrite ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
it, it is diſmiſſed and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of doors. God is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
and loved by the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite;
but not <hi>as God.</hi> Chriſt is
believed in and accepted; but not
<hi>as Chriſt;</hi> but as an underling to
the world; and a journy-man to
do ſome job of work for a diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
wrangling conſcience; or as
an unwelcome Phyſician to give
them a Vomit when they have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48274:41"/>
taken ſome extraordinary ſurfeit
of ſenſual delights. When they
have faln into great affliction, or
into any foul diſgraceful ſin, then
perhaps they take up their prayer
books, or call upon Chriſt, and
ſeem devout and very penitent.
But their piety is blown over with
the ſtorm. The effect ceaſeth with
the cauſe. It was not the <hi>Love of
God,</hi> or of his <hi>holy wayes</hi> and
<hi>ſervice,</hi> that ſet them upon their
devotions; but ſome tempeſt of
adverſity, or ſhipwrack of their
eſtates, or friends, or conſciences:
and when the winds are laid and
the waves are ſtill, their devotion
ceaſeth with their danger.</p>
                  <p>3. Add hereunto, (to ſhew you
the reaſon of the Hypocrites ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceit)
that he is one <hi>that never
practically ſaw the amiableneſs of
holineſs in it ſelf;</hi> and never had a
<hi>heart</hi> that was <hi>touched</hi> with the <hi>love
of it</hi> by the Spirit of holineſs: and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48274:41"/>
therefore he taketh it but for
<hi>meer neceſſity:</hi> and therefore he
taketh up <hi>no more</hi> then he thinks is
of <hi>neceſſity</hi> to ſave him from dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
when he can live in the
pleaſures of the world no longer.
God never had his <hi>heart.</hi> He had
<hi>rather</hi> be about his ſports or
worldly buſineſs, if he <hi>durſt,</hi> and
thought he could be ſo excuſed.
He <hi>loveth</hi> a pair of Cards, or Dice,
or a Harlot, or his ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
and honours, better then he
<hi>loveth</hi> the holy Scriptures, and the
heavenly diſcourſe or contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the life to come. And
therefore he will have <hi>no more</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
then <hi>needs he muſt,</hi> becauſe
he taketh it not for <hi>love</hi> but <hi>need.</hi>
The matters of the world and the
fleſh are his <hi>dyet,</hi> and his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſucceſſes and proſperity are
his <hi>feaſt:</hi> and therefore he will
take as much of <hi>them</hi> as he <hi>can</hi> and
<hi>dare:</hi> But <hi>Religion</hi> is but his <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick:</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:48274:42"/>
and therefore he will take it
as <hi>little</hi> and <hi>ſeldom</hi> as he dare. Had
he but ſeen the face of God by
faith, and had he but the heart of
a true believer, that is ſuited by
holyneſs to the holy works that
God commandeth, as the heart of
a true friend is ſuited to the will
of him whom he loveth, he would
then be no longer <hi>Religious againſt
his will,</hi> and conſequently <hi>in Vain;</hi>
but he would think the moſt pure
and heavenly mind, and life, and
the higheſt degree of love and
holineſs, to be the <hi>beſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable</hi>
ſtate for his ſoul, as every
true believer doth. Had this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
any <hi>true love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> as he
deceitfully pretends to have, he
would <hi>love</hi> his <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Word,</hi> and
<hi>wayes;</hi> and then he would love
beſt that <hi>kernel</hi> and <hi>marrow</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> of worſhip
and obedience, which now he <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth</hi>
not, but <hi>ſhifteth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thing.</p>
                  <p>The nature and uſe of theſe
<hi>Hypocrites Religion,</hi> is to <hi>ſave them
from Religion:</hi> They carry an
<hi>empty guilded ſcabberd,</hi> accuſing
the <hi>ſword</hi> of a <hi>dangerous keenneſs,</hi>
as a thing more <hi>perillous,</hi> then <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
to their uſe. When they
ſeem moſt zealous, they are but
<hi>ſerving God that they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
from ſerving him;</hi> and they
<hi>worſhip</hi> him, of purpoſe to <hi>ſhift off
his worſhip.</hi> They offer him the
<hi>lips,</hi> that the <hi>heart</hi> may be <hi>excuſed:</hi>
and complement him with <hi>cap and
knee,</hi> that they may excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from <hi>real holineſs:</hi> They
offer him the <hi>empty purſe,</hi> for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and tender him a <hi>ſacrifice</hi>
of <hi>husks</hi> and <hi>ſhells,</hi> and <hi>lifeleſs
carkaſſes:</hi> They will <hi>abound</hi> in the
<hi>ſhadow</hi> and <hi>ceremony,</hi> that they
may be excuſed from the <hi>ſpiritual
life and ſubſtance.</hi> Alas, <hi>that dead
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48274:43"/>
hearted</hi> hypocrite that <hi>ſits there</hi>
and heareth all this, is ſo great a
ſtranger to the <hi>opening of the heart,</hi>
and the <hi>deep entertainment</hi> of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
truth, and to the <hi>ſavoury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
of the ſearching, healing,
quickening paſſages of holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and to the <hi>thankfull well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming</hi>
of an offered Chriſt, and to
the <hi>lookings</hi> and <hi>longings</hi> of the ſoul
after God, and to the <hi>ſerious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,</hi>
and <hi>hopes,</hi> and <hi>labours</hi> of a
gracious ſoul for life eternal, that
he is <hi>idle, aſleep,</hi> and <hi>dead,</hi> as to all
this <hi>ſpiritual work;</hi> and if he had
not ſome <hi>cuſtomary ſervice</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and ſome <hi>ceremonies</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
task to do, and ſome <hi>bodily
worſhip</hi> to be employed in, he
would find little or nothing to do
in the Aſſemblies, but might ſit
here as a bruit, or as one of a
ſtrange language, that comes but
to ſee and to be ſeen. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if there be not ſomewhat
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48274:43"/>
more <hi>ſuitable</hi> to him then <hi>power</hi>
and <hi>ſpirituality,</hi> it ſeemeth as <hi>no
worſhip</hi> to the formal hypocrite:
It is the pretty jingles and knacks
of wit, and the merry jears at the
preciſer ſort, or ſome ſcraps of
Greek and Latin Authors, or
ſhreds of Fathers or Philoſophy,
or at beſt an accurate well ſet
ſpeech, that makes the Sermon
good and acceptable to this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
ears. It is not <hi>ſpirit and life
within him,</hi> that brought him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
nor is it <hi>ſpirit and life</hi> that
he <hi>ſavoureth</hi> and that <hi>he came</hi> for.
And therefore it is that this ſort of
hypocrites, are uſually moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of a <hi>miſplaced word,</hi> or of
a worſhip performed in the <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſimplicity.</hi> If a man <hi>deliver</hi>
the Lords Supper but as <hi>Chriſt did,</hi>
and <hi>receive</hi> it but as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
did, or ſerve God but as the

not <hi>this.</hi> All ſober Chriſtians are
friends to <hi>outward decency</hi> and
<hi>order:</hi> But its the empty ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
that is moſt for the unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
<hi>inventions</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> and
ſticketh in the bark of Gods own
Ordinances: that taketh the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the man, and uſeth the
worſhip of God but as a Maſque
or Poppet play, where there's
<hi>great doings,</hi> with <hi>little life,</hi> and to
<hi>little purpoſe.</hi> The <hi>chaſteſt</hi> woman
will <hi>waſh</hi> her face; but its the
<hi>harlot,</hi> or <hi>wanton,</hi> or <hi>deformed</hi> that
will <hi>paint</hi> it. The <hi>ſobereſt</hi> and the
<hi>comelyeſt</hi> will avoid a <hi>naſty</hi> or <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi>
habit, which may make
them <hi>ſeem</hi> uncomely, when they
<hi>are not:</hi> But a <hi>curious dreſs,</hi> and
<hi>exceſſive care,</hi> doth ſignifie a <hi>crooked</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:48274:44"/>
or <hi>deformed body,</hi> or a filthy skin,
or which is worſe, <hi>an empty ſoul,</hi>
that hath <hi>need</hi> of ſuch a covering.
Conſciouſneſs of ſuch <hi>greater
want,</hi> doth cauſe them to ſeek
theſe poor ſupplies. The <hi>gawdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of mens Religion, is not the
beſt ſign that it is <hi>ſincere. Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi>
is the ordinary attendant of
<hi>ſincerity.</hi> It hath long been a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.
<hi>[The more ceremony, the leſs
ſubſtance; and the more complement,
the more craft.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet if it were only <hi>for want</hi>
of inward true Religion, that the
hypocrite ſetteth up his ſhews, it
were (bad enough, but) not <hi>ſo
bad,</hi> as with moſt of them, or all,
it is. For it is an <hi>enmity to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
that accompanyeth <hi>their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
As in lapſed man, the <hi>body</hi>
that was before the ſouls <hi>obedient
attendant,</hi> is become its <hi>Maſter,</hi>
and the <hi>enemy</hi> of its perfection and
felicity: ſo in the <hi>carnal Religion</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:48274:45"/>
of the Hypocrite, the <hi>outſide,</hi>
which ſhould be the <hi>ornament</hi> and
<hi>attendant</hi> of the <hi>inward ſpiritual</hi>
part, hath got the <hi>Maſtery,</hi> and
is uſed in an <hi>enmity</hi> againſt the
more <hi>noble</hi> part which it ſhould
<hi>ſerve:</hi> and much more are his
<hi>humane inventions</hi> and <hi>mixtures</hi>
thus deſtructively imployed. His
bellows do but <hi>blow out</hi> the <hi>candle,</hi>
under pretence of <hi>kindling the fire.</hi>
He ſets the <hi>body</hi> againſt the <hi>ſoul,</hi>
and ſometime the <hi>cloathing</hi> againſt
both. He uſeth <hi>forms</hi> to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and
quenching of all <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> and
fervour of affection. By <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
he deſtroyeth <hi>Preaching;</hi> and
<hi>prayeth</hi> till <hi>prayer</hi> is become no
<hi>prayer,</hi> but the <hi>image</hi> or <hi>carkaſs</hi> of
prayer at the beſt: And uſeth his
<hi>words</hi> to the deſtruction of the due
<hi>Principle, ſenſe and ends.</hi> Having
ſtill his <hi>carnal ſelf</hi> for his <hi>end,</hi> he
preacheth, and prayeth, and ſerveth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48274:45"/>
God, in a manner that ſeems moſt
ſuitable to his <hi>end,</hi> ſo that it is not
<hi>Gods means</hi> that he uſeth, when he
uſeth them, but <hi>his own:</hi> Nor doth
he indeed worſhip <hi>God,</hi> while he
<hi>ſeems</hi> to worſhip him; nor <hi>is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Religious,</hi> but <hi>ſeems Religious.</hi>
It is materially (perhaps) Gods
work that he doth, and his <hi>means</hi>
that he uſeth, but <hi>Formally</hi> they
are his own, and not Gods at all;
when we meet with abundance of
our people that are moſt nimble in
their accuſtomed forms, that
know not what Religion, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
is, nor who Chriſt is, nor
almoſt any of the ſubſtance of the
Goſpel, it aſſures us that its eaſie
to be Infidels with Chriſtian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
in their mouths; and
that its eaſier to teach a Parret to
ſpeak, then to <hi>be a man.</hi> As their
bodies are but the priſons, or dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
of their ſouls, ſo their form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
words and ceremonies are uſed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48274:46"/>
to be the priſon, and dungeon, or
rather the grave of true devotion.
Their Religion is <hi>exceſſively laced;</hi>
but ſo ſcant of <hi>cloth,</hi> that it cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not their nakedneſs, nor keeps
them warm. Its <hi>alwaies winter</hi>
with the hypocrite in his formal
lifeleſs ſervices; and yet ſometime
his <hi>leaf</hi> doth never fall. He is like
the Box-tree that knows <hi>no fruit,</hi>
and yet its <hi>leaves</hi> are alwayes
green. Whereever his <hi>heart</hi> is,
the Formaliſts <hi>prayers</hi> are always
ready: For his <hi>prayer-book</hi> or <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi>
is ſtill the ſame: He can <hi>ſay</hi>
them between ſleeping and waking
in his bed; and as he is dreſſing or
waſhing him; and the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a friend or ſome interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
word or buſineſs, is ſo ſmall
a rub, that it ſeldom puts him out
of his way. Though he cannot
make <hi>Spiritual</hi> his <hi>common</hi> buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
he can make his <hi>Spiritual</hi>
buſineſs <hi>common.</hi> Though he have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48274:46"/>
not the art, the heart, to manage
his trade or worldly buſineſs, with
a holy and a heavenly mind; yet he
can manage his <hi>holyeſt</hi> buſineſſes,
with ſuch a mind as he doth his
<hi>trade.</hi> If you would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be praying or playing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Preaching or prating, ſerving God,
or himſelf and the fleſh, you muſt
not <hi>ſearch deep</hi> for an <hi>internal</hi>
difference, but muſt diſcern it by
the <hi>ſhew</hi> and <hi>ſound of words.</hi> He is
not one of them that are <hi>above
ordinances,</hi> as turning <hi>every day</hi>
into a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>every thought</hi>
into a <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>every morſel</hi> into
a <hi>Sacrament:</hi> But he can turn
every <hi>Sabbath</hi> into a <hi>common day,</hi>
and <hi>every prayer</hi> into <hi>common
thoughts,</hi> and every <hi>Sacrament</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>common food:</hi> and therefore
that which is <hi>holy</hi> to others, is to
him <hi>unclean. Hypocriſie</hi> is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<hi>Popery:</hi> It filleth the places
of <hi>worſhip</hi> with <hi>Images.</hi> Inſtead
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48274:47"/>
of <hi>prayer,</hi> there's the <hi>Image of
prayer:</hi> and inſtead of preaching,
hearing, praiſing God, and other
parts of worſhip, there is the
<hi>Image</hi> of worſhip: and inſtead of
<hi>Chriſtians, Believers, Saints</hi> (and
I was going to ſay, <hi>of men</hi>) there
are ſo many <hi>Images</hi> of theſe.
<hi>Church-images</hi> are uſually hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly
<hi>adorned,</hi> and placed in a
<hi>poſture</hi> of <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>devotion;</hi>
and ſo are <hi>they.</hi> But <hi>life</hi> they
have <hi>none,</hi> but meerly <hi>natural.</hi>
They are <hi>ſeeing, hearing, ſpeaking
Images:</hi> but <hi>Images</hi> they are.
They have <hi>eyes,</hi> but <hi>ſee not; ears,</hi>
but <hi>hear not; hearts,</hi> but <hi>underſtand
not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And they are <hi>enemies</hi> to the life
and power of Religion, in <hi>others</hi> as
well as in <hi>themſelves.</hi> The Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
were not ſo bitter perſecutors
of Chriſt, as the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
were. He can <hi>hate</hi> and
<hi>reproach</hi> the faithful by the <hi>ſpirit,</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48274:47"/>
though he cannot or will not <hi>pray</hi>
by the <hi>Spirit:</hi> For he hath the
<hi>spirit of malignity,</hi> though not the
<hi>Spirit of ſupplication.</hi> He can
<hi>rail without book,</hi> though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>pray without book.</hi> Were it as
natural and eaſie to <hi>be a Saint</hi> as
to <hi>ſcorn a Saint,</hi> and to <hi>worſhip God
in Spirit</hi> and in truth, as to <hi>hate</hi>
ſuch worſhip, the man might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Saint yet before he dyes.
But his <hi>Vain Religion changeth</hi> not
his <hi>nature,</hi> and therefore <hi>deſtroyeth</hi>
not his <hi>ſerpentine enmity,</hi> againſt
the holy nature and practice of
Believers: (though perhaps the
<hi>times</hi> may <hi>ſtop</hi> his <hi>hiſſing,</hi> or hinder
him from putting forth his ſting.)
Theſe <hi>Spiritual worſhippers,</hi> and
<hi>heavenly diligent</hi> ſort of Chriſtians,
that make it the <hi>main buſineſs</hi> of
their lives, to honour God and
ſave their ſouls, are uſually the
greateſt eye-ſore of the Formaliſt.
Many a diſdainful thought he hath
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48274:48"/>
of them; and many a bitter gird the
gives them: (forgetting that their
Redeemer heareth all; who is
<hi>coming with ten thouſands of his
Saints, to execute judgement upon
all, and to convince all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
among them, of all their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
deeds which they have ungodly
committed, and of all their hard
ſpeeches which ungodly ſinners have
ſpoken againſt him,</hi> Jud. 14. 15.)
The humble, Spiritual, Heavenly
Believers, are they that condemn
the Hypocrite by their <hi>lives:</hi> were
it not for <hi>them,</hi> he could eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he is a <hi>Saint himſelf,</hi> and
ſhall undoubtedly be ſaved. He
looketh on the <hi>openly ungodly,</hi> but
as the <hi>beauty-ſpots</hi> of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
that ſerve to ſet out the
piety of ſuch as <hi>he.</hi> If he ſaw <hi>no
better</hi> then <hi>himſelf,</hi> he could eaſily
take himſelf for <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>beſt.</hi>
Every doted poſt and glow-worm,
would be more reſplendent and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48274:48"/>
obſervable, in the abſence of all
greater lights. They hate the ſun
for making their candle to be but
a ſcarce-diſcerned fume. The <hi>life</hi>
of a holy heavenly perſon, doth as
much gall the conſcience of the
Hypocrite, and proclaim his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and bear a terrible witneſs
againſt him, as a ſearching power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Sermon doth. And therefore
as it is a vexation to him to live
under ſuch a <hi>ſearching Miniſter,</hi>
as is alwayes rubbing on the galled
place, and cauſing conſcience to
torment him before his time; ſo is
it a trouble to him to live among
theſe <hi>heavenly believers,</hi> and to be
dayly condemned by their <hi>lives,</hi>
and galled by their <hi>reproving pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this time you may ſee the
<hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of the Hypocrites
Religion: The <hi>ſelf-denying</hi> part
of Religion he cannot abide: The
<hi>life and power</hi> of it is above him
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48274:49"/>
and ſeems againſt him: The fears
of hell and gripes of conſcience he
cannot abide: <hi>ſome hopes</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>he muſt</hi> have a while to keep
him from deſpair: And therefore
he <hi>muſt</hi> have <hi>ſome Religion</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his heart, and maintain his
hopes. And therefore he fitteth
his Religion to theſe uſes, and
takes up with ſo much as will not
much trouble him, or undo him in
the world, or abſolutely forbid his
ſinful pleaſures. And though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
he be <hi>afraid</hi> leſt the <hi>power</hi> and
<hi>life of godlineſs</hi> will prove <hi>neceſſary</hi>
to his ſalvation; yet he revives his
<hi>fainting</hi> hopes, by running for
comfort to his <hi>lifeleſs form.</hi> The
reſt he hath no mind to; and
therefore <hi>will hope</hi> to be ſaved
without it, till his deceit have
brought him to the place of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
where there is <hi>no hope.</hi> As
the <hi>Merchant</hi> in a ſtorm is loth
to caſt his goods into the ſea, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48274:49"/>
therefore <hi>hopes</hi> he may ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and them, till he and they are
drowned together; or as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
that abhors his Phyſick, or
loves ſome forbidden thing too
well, is <hi>hoping</hi> ſtill that he may
ſcape though he uſe the thing he
loves, and forbear the medicine
which he loathes, till he be paſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
and he conſents too late;
ſo is it often with the ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Hypocrite: he loves not
this ſtrict, and holy, and heavenly,
and ſelf denying life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he <hi>will hope</hi> that God will ſave
him without it, as long as he is
Religious in a way that he accounts
more wiſe, and ſafe, and moderate,
and comely, and ſuited to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and infirmity of man; Theſe
are <hi>his hopes,</hi> and to <hi>deceive</hi> his
<hi>heart,</hi> by <hi>maintaining theſe,</hi> it is
that he is <hi>Religious:</hi> till either
<hi>Grace convert,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice apprehend</hi>
him, and his <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>he</hi> are <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48274:50"/>
up, by convincing flames
and utter deſperation.</p>
                  <p>IV. VVE are next to ſhew
you, in <hi>what reſpect</hi>
it is that <hi>this Religion</hi> is called <hi>Vain.</hi>
And firſt <hi>Negatively,</hi> it is not <hi>Vain</hi>
to his own carnal ends, but to the
true ends of Religion.</p>
                  <p>1. He intendeth by it the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his own accuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
and the keeping up his
hopes of ſalvation, and keeping off
the terrors of the Lord, and ſo
conſequentially the deceiving of
his own heart; and to <hi>theſe ends</hi> its
not in <hi>Vain.</hi> Here he ſitteth as
quietly as if all were well between
God and him; and heareth the
threatenings as ſecurely as if they
concerned not him at all; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
the promiſes as boldly as if
he were one of the heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:
you would little think that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48274:50"/>
                     <hi>this man</hi> muſt ſhortly be <hi>caſt into
utter darkneſs, from the preſence of
the Lord,</hi> and have his <hi>portion with
Hypocrites,</hi> Matth. 24. 51. His
everlaſting horrours <hi>appear not
now,</hi> to <hi>himſelf</hi> upon his <hi>heart,</hi> nor
to <hi>others</hi> in his <hi>face:</hi> what <hi>ſign</hi> can
you ſee of the <hi>curſe of the Law,</hi> or
the <hi>wrath of God</hi> in that mans
countenance? what ſign of his
ſpiritual captivity and ſlavery, and
of the load of ſin that lyeth upon
his ſoul, unleſs it be that <hi>he feels
it not?</hi> what <hi>ſign</hi> of a man in ſo
great danger, of eternal torment,
unleſs it be that he little feareth it?
Doth he ſit there like a man that is
within a ſtep of hell, and ſhall
ſhortly be there with the Devil
and his Angels, as ſure as he is here,
unleſs he be ſaved by that grace
and holineſs which he now reſiſts?
No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is as confident to be ſaved
as the preciſeſt of you all: he is as
little troubled with the fears of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48274:51"/>
hell, or the wrath of God, as thoſe
that are diſcharged from it by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification;
and perhaps much leſs.
For all this he is beholden to his
<hi>Vain Religion,</hi> that in the point of
ſelf-deceiving is not <hi>Vain.</hi> As ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
evidences promote the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orts
of true believers; ſo this
ſuperficial kind of Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteth
the preſent peace of the
preſumptuous.</p>
                  <p>2. This <hi>Religion</hi> is not <hi>Vain</hi> as
to the fruſtrating of all the means
of grace, and hindering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
and Salvation of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.
This is his armour of
defence againſt the <hi>ſword of the
Spirit,</hi> that would pierce his heart,
and let out his cloſe corruption,
and ſeparate him from his beloved
ſin. What tell you him of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
and <hi>Converſion?</hi> He thinks
he needeth no <hi>Converſion,</hi> or is
converted long ago! what! is he
<hi>not a Chriſtian,</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:48274:51"/>
man? Tell ſwearers, and
curſers, and drunkards, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners,
and cruel Land-lords,
and fornicators, of <hi>Converſion:</hi>
tell <hi>theſe</hi> that they are <hi>ſlaves of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
and <hi>under the wrath and curſe
of God,</hi> that are <hi>indeed</hi> ſo, paſt all
controverſie: but tell not <hi>him</hi> of
it, that makes no doubt but he is a
member of Chriſt, a Child of God,
and an heir of heaven. He loveth
to hear a Miniſter rouze up the
prophane and groſſely ſenſual
offendors, and ſeems in pitty to
wiſh for their converſion, and
perhaps will exhort them to turn
and mend their lives himſelf. But
he little thinks that <hi>he</hi> is <hi>faſter</hi> in
the priſon of Satan then <hi>they,</hi> and
that he is himſelf in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                  <p>Do you go about to tell him of
the neceſſity of the fear of God,
and of loving him above all, and
of truſting him, and ſerving him as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48274:52"/>
our only Lord? Why, all this he
will confeſs, and perhaps is as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to ſay as you, and verily
thinks that he is one that doth it:
you may aſſoon make him believe,
that he is not an <hi>Engliſh man,</hi> as
that he is not a <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> and
that he loveth not <hi>himſelf,</hi> as that
he loveth not <hi>God:</hi> even while he
liveth not to think of him, to ſpeak
of him, to call upon him, to obey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
him; while he loveth not his
word, his waies or ſervants; or
while he loveth the world and the
pleaſures of ſin more heartily, and
ſeeketh them more eagerly, and
cleaveth to them more tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly;
yet if you would perſwade
him that he hath not a heart as
true to God as any of you all, you
will loſe your labour. Do you
tell <hi>him</hi> of <hi>hypocriſie?</hi> he will tell
you that its the thing he <hi>hateth:
who</hi> ſpeaks againſt it more then <hi>he?</hi>
And becauſe the world ſhall <hi>ſee</hi> he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48274:52"/>
is no Hypocrite, he will call them
all <hi>Hypocrites</hi> that are faithful to
God and to their ſouls, and will
not ſit down in his truely-hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<hi>Vain</hi> Religion, but will be
more holy and diligent then he.
What can you ſay to ſuch a man in
order to his converſion, which his
<hi>ſelf-deceiving Religion</hi> will not fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate?
Do you tell him of <hi>hell fire,</hi>
and of the wrath of God againſt
the <hi>ungodly?</hi> All this he can hear
as calmly as another man; for he
thinks that he is none of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi>
he hath ſcapt the danger;
let them be afraid of it whom it
doth concern. If you tell him of
his <hi>ſins,</hi> he can tell you that <hi>all men
are ſinners; we are here imperfect;</hi>
and you ſhall never perſwade him
that his raigning deadly ſins, are
any other then ſuch <hi>humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
and <hi>infirmities</hi> as may ſtand
with grace. Do you put him upon
the inward practice of Religion,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48274:53"/>
and the fuller devoting of his ſoul
to God, and the life of faith, and
a heavenly mind? Hee'l tell you
that in his meaſure, he doth all this
already; though none of us are
ſo good as we ſhould be: And his
heart being unſeen to you, he
thinks you <hi>muſt believe</hi> him. Do
you blame him for his <hi>ſlightneſs</hi>
and <hi>Formality</hi> in Religion, and put
him upon a more <hi>ſerious diligent</hi>
courſe, and to live as one that ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
heaven with all his heart, and
ſoul, and might? why he thinks
you do but perſwade him to ſome
ſelf-conceited over-zealous party,
and draw him from his modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be righteous overmuch;
and to make too much ado with
his Religion. Unleſs he be an
Hypocrite that falleth into the
<hi>Schiſmatical</hi> ſtrain: and then he
will make a greater buſle with his
<hi>opinions</hi> and his <hi>outſide ſervices,</hi>
then you can deſire. So that <hi>one</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:48274:53"/>
with his meer book-prayers, forms
and ceremonies; and the <hi>other</hi>
with his meer extemporate words,
and affected outſide ſeeming fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
and both of them by a meer
<hi>Opinionative</hi> lifeleſs carnal kind of
Religion, ſubjected to their fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ends and intereſts, do ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
cheat their ſouls, that they are
armed againſt all that you can ſay
or do, and you know not how to
get within them, or faſten any
ſaving truth upon their hearts.</p>
                  <p>3. This <hi>Vain Religion</hi> is not
<hi>Vain</hi> as to the <hi>preſerving of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
in the world.</hi> It ſaveth
him from being numbered with the
filthy rabble, and from being
pointed at as notoriouſly vicious,
or branded with the diſgraceful
characters of the ſcandalous. Men
ſay not of him, There goeth a
drunkard, a ſwearer, a curſer, a
fornicator, or a prophane ungodly
wretch. He may be eſteemed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48274:54"/>
civil, ingenuous, diſcreet, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Religious, and be much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by wiſe religious men:
Though moſt commonly his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
or opinionative, heartleſs
kind of Religion, is diſcerned or
much ſuſpected by experienced
judicious Chriſtians, by his ſapleſs,
unexperienced, common and carn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
kind of diſcourſe and duty,
ſticking moſt in opinions, parties,
or ſome outſide things, and by his
temporizing, and reſerved, and
uneven kind of converſation; yet
it is not <hi>alwaies</hi> ſo; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
he is as far unſuſpected as the
beſt: perhaps he may be eſteemed
a Reverend Preacher, or a diſcreet
Religious, well accompliſht Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and may be ſet in the head
of Church or Commonwealth, as a
leader of the Saints on earth, that
ſhall be thruſt into the place of
Hypocrites, and not come neer the
meaneſt of the Saints in heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:48274:54"/>
4. Laſtly, (but better then all
this) his Religion is not <hi>Vain</hi> as to
the good of others. He may by the
perfume and odour of his gifts, be
kept from ſtinking to the annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of others, while he is dead in
ſin. He may be very ſerviceable in
the Church of God: a judicious,
earneſt expounder of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and Preacher and defender
of the truth: In his place as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
or Maſter of a family, he
may be a ſevere corrector of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs,
and promoter of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;
it being much eaſier to
drive others from their ſin, then to
forſake their own, and to drive on
others to a godly life then to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
it themſelves: And by their
owning godlineſs, and diſowning
ſin, they perſwade themſelves the
more effectually, that they are
truely godly. The Church cannot
well ſpare the gifts and ſervices of
Hypocrites, and many ungodly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48274:55"/>
men. As, bad or ſick Phyſicians
may be Gods inſtruments to cure
our bodies, and a wicked Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may make a good houſe; ſo a
wicked Miniſter may well expound
and apply the Scriptures; and he
that <hi>refuſeth</hi> the grace of Chriſt,
may prevail with others to <hi>accept</hi>
it: The ſign poſt that ſtands out
of dore it ſelf, may invite others
into the houſe: and the hand upon
a poſt that goes not one ſtep of the
way, may point it out to others.
There's more <hi>ſelf-denyal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> required
to the forſaking of their <hi>own</hi> ſins,
then to perſwade <hi>others</hi> to forſake
<hi>theirs:</hi> A covetous man cares not
how liberal others be; nor a glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
drunkard, or fornicator, how
temperate and chaſte his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
be. And hence it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of theſe, that refuſe a holy life
themſelves, are willing their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
or ſervants ſhould embrace it.
The end of the ballance that goeth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48274:55"/>
down it ſelf, doth cauſe the other
to go up. Other mens ſouls are
more beholden to Hypocrites then
their own. They are like the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Mariners, that enrich the
Merchant by fetching home his
treaſure, when they have nothing
but a poor maintenance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
Or like Taylors that make
garments for others which they
never wear themſelves: Or like
Carpenters that build fair houſes
which they never dwell in. Or
like the Cook that dreſſeth meat
which he eateth not. God giveth
Hypocrites their uſeful gifts, for
the ſervice of the Church more
then for themſelves. He ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
maketh thoſe to be nurſing
Fathers to his Church, that are
butchers of their own ſouls: and
makes thoſe his inſtruments to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
others, that deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
And thus far their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not <hi>Vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:48274:56"/>
But 1. It is <hi>Vain</hi> as to <hi>Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
acceptation.</hi> True Religion
pleaſeth God: but the ſelf-decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Religion he abhorreth. <hi>He
hath no pleaſure in fools,</hi> Eccleſ.
5. 4. He asketh ſuch, <hi>To what
purpoſe is the multitude of their
ſacrifices?</hi> Iſa. 11. 11. and ſaith,
he is <hi>full of their burnt-offerings,
and delights not in them?</hi> when
they come to appear before him, he
asketh them, <hi>Who required this at
their hands, to tread in his Courts?</hi>
and bids them <hi>bring no more vain
oblations; incenſe is an abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to him: the calling of their
aſſemblies he cannot away with, and
their ſolemn meetings are iniquity,</hi>
ver. 12, 13. <hi>Their appointed feaſts
his ſoul hateth; they are a trouble
to him; he is weary to bear them.
When they ſpread forth their hands,
he will hide his eyes; when they make
many prayers, he will not hear;</hi>
becauſe they do not forſake their
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48274:56"/>
ſins, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. Becauſe <hi>they turn
away their ear from he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ring his
law, their prayer is abhomination to
him,</hi> Prov. 28. 9. and 15. 8. and
21, 27. When they have <hi>ſinned,</hi>
inſtead of repenting and forſaking
it, they think to pleaſe God by
their <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſtop the mouth
of Juſtice with their <hi>ſervices;</hi>
when as they do but provoke him
more, by adding <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> to <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
Were they truly willing to
let go their ſins, and to pleaſe God
by univerſal obedience, he would
willingly accept them, and be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their ſervices. But when
mens Religion, their prayers and
other duties, are not uſed againſt
their ſins, but for them, nor to kill
them, but to cover them, nor to
overcome them, but as it were to
bribe God to give them leave to
ſin, becauſe they are not willing to
forſake it, this is the ſelf-deceiving
Religion of Hypocrites, that is in
<hi>Vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48274:57"/>
2. And <hi>this Religion</hi> is in <hi>Vain,</hi>
as to any promoting of a work, of
Sanctification upon his ſoul. It
weaneth him not from the world:
It crucifieth not the fleſh, with its
affections and luſts: It doth not
further his ſelf-denyal; nor driveth
him to Chriſt, by a faith unfaigned:
It never raiſeth him to a heavenly
life; nor kindleth the love of God
within him: It is dead and uneffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
and cannot produce theſe
high effects. Yea on the contrary,
it hardeneth him in ſin and ſelf-deceit:
it hindereth his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
it emboldeneth him in his
fleſhly worldly life: and quieteth
him in the neglect of Chriſt and
heaven.</p>
                  <p>3. Moreover this kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is in <hi>Vain</hi> as to any ſolid
peace of conſcience. It affordeth
him none of the well-grounded,
dureable comforts of the Saints:
But on the contrary keeps out ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48274:57"/>
comfort, by feeding him with
aery deluſory conceits; and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him to be but his <hi>own</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,
upon fancies and confidence
of his own, when the Spirit of
Chriſt is not his comforter, nor
doth the Word of God ſpeak any
peace at all unto him.</p>
                  <p>4. Laſtly, his Religion is in <hi>Vain</hi>
as to his Salvation. As he had but
an image of true Religion, ſo he
ſhall have but an image of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Some dreams and ſelf-created
hopes of happineſs, may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
him to the door of eternity:
but there they will leave him to
everlaſting horrour.</p>
                  <p>V. <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. FRom what hath been
ſaid, you may ſee the
reaſon why an outſide formal
ſeeming Religiouſneſs, is a thing ſo
common in the world, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of the life and power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48274:58"/>
It is an eaſier thing to
bring men to the ſtricteſt opinion,
then to bring them to the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
and deep reception and
practice of the truth. A ſtrict opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
may be held without any
great coſt and trouble to the fleſh.
It is the <hi>practice</hi> that bereaveth a
ſinner of the pleaſure of his ſin.
It is the common trick by which
moſt Hypocrites cheat their ſouls,
to turn to the ſide and <hi>opinion,</hi> and
<hi>aſſemblies</hi> and <hi>company</hi> which they
think to be the beſt; that ſo they
may perſwade themſelves the
more eaſily, that they are as good
as thoſe opinions and that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doth import, and that they are
truely ſuch as thoſe they joyn
with. As men are taken by others
for ſuch, as thoſe they correſpond
with; ſo hypocrites take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for ſuch. As if it would
prove that a man is ſound, becauſe
he dwelleth with them that are ſo?
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48274:58"/>
Or as if it would prove a man rich
or honourable, that he converſeth
with ſuch? As God will not ſave
any Nations on earth, becauſe they
are ſuch Nations; nor will he ſave
men becauſe they are of ſuch or
ſuch a trade, or becauſe they are
skilled in this or that art or ſcience;
no more will he ſave men for being
of this or that party or Sect, in
matters of Religion. One thinks,
when he hath lived a fleſhly life,
that he ſhall be ſaved for hearing
or ſaying the Common-prayer, or
becauſe he is for Prelacy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:
another thinks he ſhall
be ſaved, becauſe he can pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a book, or form of words, or
becauſe he frequenteth the private
meetings, of thoſe that more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
redeem their time, for
ſpiritual advantages then others
do: another thinks he ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
becauſe he is mocked as a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan
or as too ſtrict, as others are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48274:59"/>
that are ſerious believers, and
diligent in the things of God: and
another thinks that he ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
becauſe he is rebaptized; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he joyneth with ſome ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
Congregation, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
to be more ſtrict then
others. But none ſhall be ſaved,
on any ſuch account as theſe. <hi>Cain</hi>
could not be ſaved, for being the
firſt born in the family of <hi>Adam:
Cham</hi> could not be ſaved for being
in the Ark and family of <hi>Noah:</hi>
Nor <hi>Eſau</hi> for being in the houſe
of <hi>Iſaac:</hi> Nor <hi>Abſalom</hi> for being
the ſon of <hi>David:</hi> Nor <hi>Judas</hi> for
being a Diſciple in the family of
Chriſt. Even <hi>Mary</hi> that brought
him forth, could not have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by him, if ſhe had not had a
better title; and had not bore him
in her heart, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. 34, 35.
when they talk to him of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and his brethren, Chriſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon thoſe that ſate about him,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48274:59"/>
and told them that Whoſoever
ſhall do the will of God, the ſame
is his Brother, his Siſter, and his
Mother. It is no outward badge
and livery, but a heart-title, that
muſt prove you the heirs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
You may be ſnatcht out of
the pureſt Church on earth, and
from the pureſt ordinances, and
out of the arms of the moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Chriſtians, and caſt into hell,
if you have no better evidences
then ſuch, to ſhew for your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
If ever you be ſaved, it
muſt not be becauſe you are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
or Proteſtants, Lutherans,
or Calviniſts, Arminians, Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,
Anabaptiſts, Independents,
Presbyterian, or Prelatical; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
and meerly as ſuch: But
becauſe you are true Chriſtians,
that have the Spirit of Chriſt,
(<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9.) and are conformed
to him, in his ſufferings, death and
reſurrection, and live in ſincere
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48274:60"/>
obedience to his will. But Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
that want the inward life
and power of Religion, and are
conſcious of their willfull ſins,
would fain borrow ſomething from
the parties which they joyn with,
or the opinions which they take
up, or the formal outward worſhip
which they perform, or the alms
which they give, to make up the
want, and cheat their ſouls with a
ſelf-created confidence, that they
ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>But more ſpecially you may
hence obſerve, the reaſon that
Popery hath ſo many followers,
and that it is ſo eaſie a thing to
make an Infidel, or whoremonger,
or drunkard, to turn a Papiſt,
when yet it is not eaſie to bring
them to faith, and chaſtity, and
temperance, much leſs to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
love of God, and to a holy
heavenly life. Though I doubt
not but there are many ſincere-hearted
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48274:60"/>
Chriſtians among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
yet Popery it ſelf is of an
hypocritical ſtrain, and is notably
ſuited to the Hypocrites diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
It is revived Phariſaiſme:
I marvel that they tremble not
when they read themſelves ſo
lively characterized by Chriſt,
with the addition of ſo many ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
woes, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. and
other places frequently they are:
[Woe to you Scribes, Phariſees,
Hypocrites.] They bind heavy
burdens of external obſervances,
to lay upon the conſciences of
their Proſelytes: They make broad
their Phylacteries; and in variety
of holy veſtures, they make oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of ſuch a Religion, as a
Peacock may have when he
ſpreads his tail. They contend
for ſuperiority and titles, to be
called Rabbi, Pope, Cardinal,
Patriarck, Primate, Metropolitane,
Archbiſhop, Dioceſane, Abbot,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48274:61"/>
Prior, Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the great
diſturbance of all the Nations of
the Chriſtian world. They muſt
needs be the Fathers and Maſters
of our faith: They ſhut up the
Kingdom of heaven againſt the
people, forbidding all to read the
Scriptures in their vulgar tongue,
without a ſpecial licenſe from their
Ordinary: and commanding them
to worſhip God in a ſtrange
tongue which they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand:
By the numbers of their
Maſſes and prayers for the dead,
they delude the ſouls, and devour
the Patrimony of the living. In
Temples, and Altars, and Images,
and Ornaments conſiſteth no ſmall
part of their Religion: They make
more of tything mint, aniſe and
cummin, then of judgement, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and faith, the weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Law. The outſide they
make clean, and appear as beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to men, as ceremonies and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48274:61"/>
outward pompe can make them.
They make it a part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to murder the living Saints,
and keep holy dayes for the
dead: They build the Tombs of
the Prophets, and garniſh the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres
of the righteous, and ſay,
If we had lived in the dayes of our
Fathers, we would not have been
partakers with them in the blood
of the Prophets. Thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.
is their deſcription. They have
their Touch not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſte not, handle
not, after the commandements
and doctrines of men, their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
humility, and worſhipping of
Angels, and other rudiments of
the world, and things that have a
ſhew of wiſdom in will-worſhip
and humility, and neglecting of the
body, not in any honour to the
ſatisfying of the fleſh, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19,
20, 21, 22, 23. How eaſie a thing
is it to bring an ungodly man to
be of a Religion that conſiſteth in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48274:62"/>
ſuch things as theſe? in eating fiſh
on certain dayes in ſtead of fleſh;
in ſaying over ſo many Pater
Noſters, and Ave Maries, and
naming ſo oft the name of Jeſu:
in worſhipping a piece of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
bread with divine worſhip;
in bowing and praying before an
Image: in praying to the ſouls of
ſuch as the Pope tells them are
Saints in heaven: in croſſing
themſelves, and being ſprinkled
with holy water, and uſing <hi>agnus
dei's,</hi> and conſecrated grains and
amulets: in dropping of beads:
in ſaying ſuch words as a prayer at
ſuch a canonical hour, and ſuch
words at the next canonical hour:
in hearing a Maſſe in Latine; and
ſaying a Latine prayer: in being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
with hallowed oyl; &amp; burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hallowed candles on the Altars
by day-light: in going ſo many
miles to the Chappel of a Saint in
Pilgrimage: in carrying about them
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48274:62"/>
a bone, or ſome other ſuppoſed
relict of a ſuppoſed Saint. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
their ſins ſo often to a
Prieſt, and doing penance, if he
impoſe it on them. And ſo while
they live in whoredom, or drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,
or ſwearing, or lying, or
all theſe, and many other ſuch, it is
but confeſſing and doing penance,
and to it again; on which account
(whatever ſome of them ſay for
the neceſſity of contrition) it is
uſual with them, to venture upon
the ſins of whoredom, drunkenneſs
and the reſt, becauſe they have ſo
eaſie and cheap a remedy at hand.
And therefore I wonder not that
among Infidels (who after Baptiſm,
Apoſtatize to deny the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and the immortality of the
ſoul, and the life to come,) and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
common ſwearers, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
and whoremongers, and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
the Papiſts find their labours
moſt ſucceſſeful, and that no fiſh
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48274:63"/>
will ſo eaſily take their bait: Nor
do I wonder that it is a point of
the Popiſh faith, that none but the
Children of the Devil, that are
void of the love of God, and are
unjuſtified, can poſſibly turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.
(For they tell us that all are
ſuch till they are Papiſts: ſaving
that they are many of them for
the ſalvation of heathens.) A poor
wretch that is captivated to his
odious luſts, and goes under a
galled accuſing conſcience, will be
content to take a Popiſh cure, and
quiet his ſoul with a few comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and formalities. But to
bring one of theſe men to a
through converſion, to a true
humiliation, to a deep hatred of all
ſin, and a love of holineſs, to cloſe
with Chriſt as his only refuge from
the wrath of God, and to give up
himſelf without any reſervation,
and all that he hath, to the will and
ſervice of the Lord: to love God
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48274:63"/>
as his portion, and the infinite
tranſcendent good; to take all
the honour and riches of the
world as loſs and dung, and uſe all
in due ſubſerviency to everlaſting
happineſs; to crucifie the fleſh, and
mortifie all his earthly inclinations,
and live a life of ſelf-denyal, and
to walk with God, and ſerve him
as a Spirit in ſpirit and in truth,
and to keep a watch over
thoughts, affections, words and
deeds; to live by faith upon a
world and happineſs that is to us
unſeen; and to live in preparation
for their death, and wait in hope
to live with Chriſt; this is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
and true Religion; and
this is it that they will not ſo eaſily
be brought to. Its eaſier to make
an hundred Papiſts, then one true
regenerate Chriſtian. Children
can make them a baby of clouts:
And the ſtatuary can make a man
of Alabaſter or ſtone: But none
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48274:64"/>
can give life, which is eſſential to a
man indeed, but God. There
needeth the Spirit of the living
God, by a ſupernatural operation,
and a kind of new creation, to
make a man a real holy Chriſtian.
But to bring a man to make ſuch a
congee, or wear ſuch a veſture, or
ſay ſuch and ſuch words, and make
to himſelf a mimical Religion, this
may be done without any ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
work. O therefore
take heed of cheating your ſouls
by hypocritical formalities, inſtead
of the life and power of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. ANd now, O that the
Lord of life, would
help me ſo to apply this truth, and
help you ſo to apply it to your
ſelves, that it might be as a light
ſet up in the Aſſembly and in all
your conſciences, to undeceive the
miſerable ſelf-deceivers, and to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48274:64"/>
bring poor Hypocrites into ſome

                  <p>And now I am to ſearch and

of the Hypocrite; as a fearful child
that's innocent, will cry, when he
ſees another whipt that's faulty.
But if <hi>thou wilt</hi> ſtay and hear the
Hypocrites examination, I charge
thee, poor humbled drooping ſoul,
that thou do not <hi>miſunderſtand</hi>
me, nor think that I am ſpeaking
thoſe things to <hi>thee,</hi> that are meant
to the <hi>falſhearted enemies of the
Lord!</hi> and do not imagine that
<hi>thou art condemned in his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi>
nor put not thy ſelf under
the ſtroaks that are given <hi>him:</hi> but
rejoyce that thou art ſaved from
this ſtate of <hi>ſelf-deceit</hi> and miſery.
And that thou mayſt have ſome
ſhelter for thy conſcience againſt
the ſtorm that muſt fall on others,
look back on the foregoing deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the Hypocrite, and thou
mayſt find that thou haſt the ſaving
graces, which I there diſcovered
him to want. Let theſe at preſent
be before thine eyes, and tell thee,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48274:65"/>
Thou art not the perſon that I
mean.</p>
                  <p>1. Thou art humbled to a <hi>loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thy ſelf</hi> for thy tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p>2. Thou art willing to give up
thy ſelf to Chriſt, without reſerve,
that as thy Saviour, he may cure
thy miſerable ſoul, upon his own
terms.</p>
                  <p>3. The favour of God is dearer
to thee then the favour of the
world, or the pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of ſinners: and thou long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
more to love him better, and to
feel his love, then for any of the
honours or advancements that
fleſh and blood deſire.</p>
                  <p>4. It is the life to come that
thou takeſt for thy portion, and
prefereſt before the matters of this
tranſitory life.</p>
                  <p>5. Thy Religion employeth thee
about thy <hi>heart,</hi> as much as about
the <hi>out ſide</hi> and <hi>appearing</hi> part: It
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48274:66"/>
is <hi>heart-ſins</hi> that thou obſerveſt
and lamenteſt, and a <hi>better heart</hi>
that thou daily longeſt, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and laboureſt for.</p>
                  <p>6. Thou liveſt not in any <hi>groſs
and deadly ſin;</hi> and thou haſt <hi>no
infirmity</hi> but what thou longeſt
and laboureſt to be rid of; and
goeſt on in the uſe of Chriſts holy
means and remedies for a cure.</p>
                  <p>7. Thou diſlikeſt not the <hi>higheſt
degree of holineſs,</hi> but loveſt it and
longeſt after it, and hadſt rather
be <hi>more holy</hi> then be <hi>more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
or <hi>more rich.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Thou unfeignedly loveſt the
image of Chriſt on the ſouls of all
his ſervants where thou canſt
diſcern it; and ſeeſt a ſpecial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
in a poor humble heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Chriſtian, though never ſo low
or deſpicable in the world, above
all the pompe and ſplendor of the
earth; and thou loveſt them with
a ſpecial love; and the <hi>holier</hi> they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48274:66"/>
are, the <hi>better</hi> doſt thou love
them.</p>
                  <p>9. Thou loveſt the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
ſearching Sermons, and
wouldeſt fain have help to know
the worſt that is in thy heart; and
comeſt unto the light that thy
heart and deeds may be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
                  <p>10. All this is the <hi>bent</hi> and <hi>by as</hi>
of thy <hi>ſoul;</hi> thy <hi>habituated, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
caſe; though there be not
alway the ſame <hi>opportunity</hi> for the
<hi>acts,</hi> nor the ſame <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>life</hi> in
<hi>acting:</hi> It is not only a <hi>good mood</hi>
that thou art <hi>frightened</hi> into by
ſome affliction, and then returneſt
to thy carnal courſe of life again:
But thou <hi>heartily continueſt</hi> thy
<hi>conſent</hi> to the <hi>Covenant</hi> which thou
haſt made with Chriſt, and would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
not turn back to a worldly,
carnal, or a formal life, nor change
thy Maſter, nor forſake the holy
courſe which thou art engaged in
for all the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48274:67"/>
This is the truth of thy caſe,
poor doubting troubled Chriſtian:
Thou canſt not deny it without
much injury to thy ſelf and God.
And therefore-be not now trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at that which I ſhall ſay to the
ſelf-deceivers.</p>
                  <p>And now I am to ſpeak to the
<hi>ſelf-deceiver,</hi> I perceive my task to
be exceeding difficult: To get
<hi>within him</hi> that is ſo <hi>guarded:</hi> and
to pierce his heart that is ſo armed:
and to open his eyes that is willing
to be blind: and to undeceive him
that hath been ſo long deceived,
and that ſtudyeth to deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and is engaged in that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
work, by ſuch ſubtil enemies
that further his deceit, and by ſo
many allurements, and ſuch ſtrong
corruptions, and by a ſeeming ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for the quieting of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
all this is not an eaſie
work. But we muſt attempt it,
and leave the ſucceſs to grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:48274:67"/>
And firſt let me ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
before you all, (for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of your prejudice, and the
calming of your reſiſting hearts)
that it is none of my deſire by the
diſcovery of your hypocriſie, to
ſhame you before others, or to
make you ſeem more miſerable
then you are, or to diſturbe and
grieve you any more then is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the eſcaping of your
exceeding danger, and then your
own ſalvation and comforts do
require. But when we <hi>know</hi> that
Religion is your <hi>buſineſs</hi> in the
world; and that an endleſs world
ſhall preſently receive you; and
that <hi>Chriſt is coming;</hi> and your
ſouls are ready to quit their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and take their leave of
your fleſh till the reſurrection;
and when we <hi>know</hi> that hypocriſie
and ſelf-deceit, is the thing that
you are moſt in danger of, and
that you muſt be ſaved from it, or
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48274:68"/>
be in hell for ever; and that the
enemies of your ſouls will do all
they can, to keep their poſſeſſion
in peace, and to continue your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
till you are paſt remedy;
what would you have us do in ſuch
a caſe? would you wiſh us to be
ſilent, and betray your ſouls, and
damn our own, for fear of diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and diſpleaſing you? How
hard are your hearts, if you would
wiſh us to do thus!</p>
                  <p>Be awakened therefore O all ye
ſelf-deceivers, and know that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie
as the Harlots paint, is but
a baſe and borrowed beauty, that
will vaniſh away when you draw
neer the fire; and that ſelf-deceit
will quiet you ſo ſhort a time,
that it's as good let go your delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory
peace and comfortable dream
to day as to morrow: And its
better now begin and examine
your ſelves, then ſtay till the
dreadful Judge examine you, who
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48274:68"/>
is even at the door! The diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of your caſe is the one half of
your cure: And as you have been
your own deceivers, let us in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
find you ſo equitable to your
ſelves, as to be willing of the light
that muſt undeceive you; and to
go along with us into your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
and help us in the ſearch,
and impartially paſs a <hi>preventing</hi>
judgement, that Chriſt may not
paſs a <hi>condemning</hi> judgement.</p>
                  <p>And in order to your convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and recovery, I ſhall firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with <hi>your miſery,</hi> that ſo
it may awaken you to look about
you, while there is time and hope.
If it were Gods way to work by
ocular demonſtrations, and the
Chriſtian life were a life of ſenſe,
and you had heaven and hell this
hour open to your ſight, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
need ſhould I have to plead this
cauſe with you any further? you
would then ſee and hear that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48274:69"/>
vengeance that would awake you;
and make you preſently fly into
your hearts, and charge conſcience
to deal impartially with you, leſt
ſelf-deceit ſhould bring you to
thoſe flames. But its a <hi>life of faith</hi>
that we are to call you to, and a
<hi>word of faith</hi> that we have to
preach; but of things that are as
ſure as if you ſaw them.</p>
                  <p>And, 1. If thy <hi>Religion</hi> be <hi>Vain,</hi>
thy <hi>hopes and comforts</hi> that are
built upon it, are all but <hi>Vain.</hi> How
<hi>Vain</hi> is that <hi>hope</hi> that will vaniſh
when the <hi>enjoyment</hi> is expected,
and will end in endleſs deſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
what though thou ſit here
with ſo great hopes and confidence
of ſalvation, as maketh thee even
ſcorn the man that queſtions it?
Art thou ever the better when
death awaketh thee, and thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
dream is at an end? when thou
art <hi>dying,</hi> wilt thou <hi>hope?</hi> perhaps
thou mayſt: But when thou art
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48274:69"/>
                     <hi>burning,</hi> wilt thou <hi>hope?</hi> when thou
art <hi>tormented,</hi> wilt thou <hi>hope?
Deſperation</hi> will then be eſſential
to thy miſery. The Devils that
now feed thy <hi>hope</hi> by their deceits,
will then as readily keep awake thy
conſcience, and exaſperate thy
deſpairing ſoul. If now thou wilt
hope under the <hi>threatenings</hi> of
God (that thou mayſt be ſaved in
thy preſent ſtate) wilt thou then
<hi>hope</hi> under his <hi>execution?</hi> Thy flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
and proſperity may cheriſh
thy deceitful hopes for a time; but
who will maintain them, when
God commandeth deſperation to
torment thee? <hi>Job 27. 8, 9 [For
what is the hope of the Hypocrite
though he hath gained, when God

                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:48274:82"/>
is all that thou ſhalt poſſeſs, <hi>Eccleſ.
1. 2, 14. Prov.</hi> 22. 8. And if
conſcience, when thy day of grace
is paſt, ſhall force thee upon the
review to ſay, <hi>My piety was but
ſeeming and ſelf-deceit, and all my
Religion was Vain;</hi> it will be <hi>the
voice of utter deſperation, and will
ſtab the heart of all thy hopes.</hi> This
and no better being the ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
caſe, is not conſcience now
at work within you? and asking
as each of the Diſciples did, <hi>Mat.
26. 24, 25. Is it I?</hi> If thou have
a heart within thee, beſeeming a
reaſonable creature, by this time
thou art afraid of ſelf-deceit, and
willing to be ſearched, and to know
thy hypocriſie, while it may be
cured. For my part, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
no one of you perſonally
to be an hypocrite, as knowing
that hypocriſie is a ſin of the heart,
which in it ſelf is ſeen by none but
God and him that hath it: But my
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48274:82"/>
buſineſs is only to help ſuch to
know and judge themſelves. Could
I name the man to you in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
that had none but a
<hi>ſeeming vain Religion,</hi> I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
you would all look upon
him as a moſt unhappy deplorable
wretch. Alas, ſirs, Hypocrites are
not ſo rare among us, as ſome
imagine. There are few or none,
but <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in this
Aſſembly, or in moſt of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
in the land. I think here are
none that make not a <hi>profeſſion of
the Chriſtian faith,</hi> and of <hi>love to
God:</hi> All therefore that <hi>have not</hi>
this <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> muſt needs be
<hi>Hypocrites,</hi> as <hi>profeſſing</hi> to <hi>be</hi> what
they <hi>are not.</hi> In your baptiſm you
engaged and profeſt your ſelves
the Diſciples of Chriſt, and gave
up your ſelves in ſolemn Covenant
to God, the Father, Son and Holy
Ghoſt: This Covenant you will ſay
you ſtand to yet: &amp; none of you will
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48274:83"/>
be known to have renounced your
Chriſtianity: As Chriſtians you
uſe to come to theſe Aſſemblies,
and here to attend God in the uſe
of his Ordinances: and ſome of
you to renew your Covenant with
him, in the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper. I meet with none that
will ſay [I am no Chriſtian, nor a
ſervant of the God of Heaven:
I am an Infidel, and Rebell againſt
the Lord.] I think there is none
of you, but would take it ill, if I
ſhould call you ſuch, or ſhould
deny you to be Chriſtians, and
men fearing God.] If therefore
you are not ſuch indeed, you muſt
needs be Hypocrites. What ſay
you? Is there any of you that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
your ſelves to be <hi>ungodly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,</hi>
and <hi>ſervants of the Devil,</hi>
and will take this as your current
title, diſclaiming the love and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Lord? I think you will
not. If you are ſuch as you profeſs,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48274:83"/>
you are all Saints, and ſhall be
ſaved. If any of your be not ſuch,
they can be nothing elſe but Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that you are all
either <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> come
now to the bar, and refuſe not a
tryal, that may prevent the errors
of another kind of tryal, that you
cannot refuſe.</p>
                  <p>And here let me ſet before you
your Profeſſion, and then try
your ſelves, Whether you are ſuch
as you profeſs your ſelves to be or
not? And I think I may take it for
granted, that the <hi>Articles of the
Creed,</hi> and the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ptiſmal Covenant,</hi>
is the <hi>leaſt</hi> that every one of you
do profeſs; and that the <hi>deſires</hi>
implyed in the Petitions of the
Lords Prayer, you all profeſs to
be your own deſires; and that
you take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ments
for part of the rule of your obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Let us peruſe them briefly in
the ſeveral parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:48274:84"/>
1. Do you not all ſay that you
<hi>Believe in God the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
Maker of Heaven and
earth,</hi> and that you <hi>will have no
other gods but him?</hi> and are you
not accordingly <hi>engaged in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with him?</hi> you will not deny
it. And what is the meaning of
this much of your profeſſion? It
is no leſs then to <hi>take God</hi> for the
<hi>only infinite good,</hi> to be <hi>loved</hi> with
the <hi>chiefeſt love,</hi> and to take him
for <hi>your abſolute Lord and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the Owner of you and all you
have,</hi> to whom you owe univerſal
abſolute obedience; and that you
are truly willing to love him above
all, and fear him, and truſt him and
obey him accordingly, though
your fleſh and all the world
ſhould be againſt it. He that
meaneth not all this, doth diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or lye when he ſaith, he taketh
God to be his God. For <hi>to be God,</hi>
is to <hi>be this much to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:48274:84"/>
And really <hi>is it</hi> thus with you,
as you profeſs? ſpeak but as men
that dare not lye before the Lord
that knows your hearts? Do you
indeed <hi>Love God as God?</hi> with your
<hi>ſuperlative love:</hi> Are your <hi>hearts
ſet</hi> upon him? Do you make it
your principal care to pleaſe him?
Is it your delight to do his will?
Is it ſweeter to you to think and
ſpeak of him, then of the world?
Doth it grieve you moſt to offend
him? In a word, you are not ſuch
ſtrangers to <hi>Nature,</hi> but you know
<hi>what love is.</hi> And you are not ſuch
ſtrangers to your <hi>own hearts,</hi> but
you know what it is, to <hi>love your
pleaſure,</hi> your <hi>profit,</hi> your <hi>honour</hi>
and your <hi>friend;</hi> can conſcience
ſay before the Lord, that you love
him better then all theſe? if not
more <hi>paſſionately,</hi> yet more deeply,
effectually and reſolvedly; with
a love that will cauſe you to deny
and part with all for him? If you
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48274:85"/>
thus truly love him as God; (and
above all) how comes it to paſs
that you ſeek the world more
carefully, and eagerly then him?
and that you are more pleaſed with
worldly thoughts and ſpeeches and
employments, then with divine?
were not the Hypocrite juſtly
blinded, and a willfull ſtranger to
himſelf, he could not but know
that he loveth not <hi>God as God,</hi> and
<hi>above all.</hi> And to love him <hi>in
ſubordination to your fleſh</hi> and its
<hi>contents,</hi> is not at all <hi>to love him as
God:</hi> As it is no degree of conjugal
love, to love a wife but as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
nor no degree of the love
due to your Soveraign, to love
him as an equal, or as a ſlave.</p>
                  <p>And if really you take God for
<hi>your abſolute Lord and Governour,</hi>
why is it then that you take no
pleaſure in his <hi>Laws;</hi> but count
them too <hi>ſtrict</hi> and had rather be
at your own diſpoſe? why is it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48274:85"/>
that you obey your fleſhly deſires,
before and againſt the God whom
you acknowledge? why will you
not be perſwaded to that holineſs,
juſtice and charity which you know
his Law commandeth you? why
do you willfully continue in thoſe
ſins, which conſcience tells you
God forbids? will you live in will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
diſobedience, and love your
ſins, and loath your duty, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately
continue thus, and yet
profeſs that you take God for
your God, and conſequently for
your Lord and Governour? and
yet will you not confeſs that you
are diſſembling Hypocrites?</p>
                  <p>2. Do you not all profeſs that
you <hi>believe in Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> and
have you not in <hi>Covenant</hi> taken
him for your <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Lord?</hi>
And do you <hi>ſo indeed,</hi> or do you
not play the <hi>Hypocrites?</hi> If you
believe in Chriſt, and take him for
your <hi>Saviour,</hi> you then take your
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48274:86"/>
                     <hi>ſins</hi> for the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi> of
your ſouls, and you are ſo <hi>grieved</hi>
for them and <hi>weary</hi> of them, and
<hi>humbled</hi> in the apprehenſion of
your loſt eſtate, that you fly to
Chriſt as your only refuge, from
the wrath and curſe of the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Majeſty, and value his juſtifying
and healing grace before all the
riches of the world; and you are
willing to take his bittereſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
and uſe the means appointed
by him, for the deſtruction of your
ſin, and the perfecting of his
graces. And is it thus with you,
that have unhumbled hearts, that
never felt the need of Chriſt, as
condemned miſerable men muſt
do? and that love the ſin that he
would cure, and are unwilling to
be mortified and ſanctified by his
grace? Unleſs a carkaſs be a man,
ſuch Hypocrites as theſe are no
true Chriſtians, and have but a
ſeeing ſelf-deceiving faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:48274:86"/>
3. Do you not all profeſs <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> and are
you not engaged to him in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
as your Sanctifier? And do
you not groſly play the Hypocrites
here? If not, how comes it to paſs
that you ſtick in your natural
ſtate, as if you had no need of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification?
and live as quietly
without any acquaintance with
true Regeneration, and the Spirit
to dwell and rule within you, as it
you needed no ſuch change? Or
elſe that you take up with a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi>
an <hi>affected,</hi> or a <hi>forced</hi> kind of
Religion, in ſtead of Sanctification
and ſpiritual devotion? And how
comes it to paſs that you diſtaſte
the <hi>higheſt degrees</hi> of holineſs? and
that you will not be brought to
the mortification, ſelf-denyal, and
unreſerved obedience, which are
the eſſence of ſanctification? As
for the more deboiſt prophane ſort
of Hypocrites, that make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48274:87"/>
mock of godlineſs, and ſcorn
at the very name of Holineſs and
Sanctification, and deride at all
that pretend to have the <hi>Spirit;</hi>
I had rather tremble at the
thought of their miſery, then now
ſtand to reprove that notorious
hypocriſie, which profeſſeth to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in the Holy Spirit</hi> which they
deride; and Covenanteth with
the Sanctifier, while they hate and
mock, or at leaſt do obſtinately
refuſe ſanctification. When God
himſelf tells us, <hi>Rom. 8. 9. [That
if any man have not the Spirit of
Chriſt, the ſame is none of his.]</hi> And
therefore to deride a man for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
that he hath the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is
to deride him for profeſſing <hi>to be a
Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Do you not all profeſs to
<hi>[Believe the Holy Catholick
Church]</hi> that is, that Chriſt hath
a people diſperſed through the
world, that are ſanctified by his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48274:87"/>
Spirit, and made a holy peculiar
people, whom he loveth as his
Spouſe and as his own Body, of
which number you muſt be if you
will be ſaved? And yet at the ſame
time, the <hi>members</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi>
you contemn; the <hi>holineſs</hi> of it
you ſecretly hate; and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Paſtors in it you deſpiſe and
diſobey. Is not this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie?</p>
                  <p>5. You all profeſs to <hi>[Believe
the Communion of Saints:]</hi> that
is, that the true members of the
Catholike Church are all <hi>Saints,</hi>
that have one and the ſame Spirit,
and walk by the ſame holy Law
or Rule, and in holineſs muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
together, and joyn in Church
order, for the publick worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of God, according to his own
inſtitution: and muſt purely and
fervently love each other, with
ſuch a charity as ſhall make one as
ready to relieve another, when
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48274:88"/>
God calls for it, as if our riches did
belong in <hi>Common</hi> to the Saints.]
This is the meaning of this Article
of your Creed. And do I then
need to ask you Whether thoſe
that profeſs this, are not Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
if they <hi>hate</hi> the <hi>Saints,</hi> and
their inward ſpiritual <hi>Communion,</hi>
and if they love them but with
that lifeleſs charity that <hi>James</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth?
<hi>Jam. 2. 14, 15, &amp;c.</hi> Or
if they deſpiſe or hate the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
Ordinances and Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church? And if
they live in Communion with
drunkards, with harlots, with
worldlings, or ſenſual, vain, or
ambitious men, and fly from the
<hi>Communion of Saints?</hi> what doſt
thou, when thou ſayſt <hi>[I believe
the Communion of Saints]</hi> but ſay
<hi>[I am a diſſembling Hypocrite]</hi> if it
he thus with thee?</p>
                  <p>6. You all profeſs to <hi>[Believe
the forgiveneſs of ſins;]</hi> that is,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48274:88"/>
that through the blood of Chriſt
all true repenting and believing
ſinners, ſhall be forgiven, and are
not ſhut up under remedileſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.
And alſo I think you all
profeſs that you do <hi>Repent</hi> your
ſelves, that <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> may be
<hi>yours.</hi> And yet you love your
ſin: you love not to be told of it:
you will not believe it to be ſin, as
long as you can ſtrive againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction;
and when you muſt needs
confeſs it, you will not forſake it;
but while you ſeem to reform by
parting with ſo much as you can
ſpare, your dearer ſins, which
pleaſure and honour and profit are
much engaged in, you will not
forſake: though repentance do
conſiſt in turning from ſin to
God; and Chriſt hath aſſured you,
that <hi>except you repent, you ſhall all
periſh,</hi> Luk. 13. 3, 5. Is not this
therefore palpable <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> to
profeſs repentance for remiſſion
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48274:89"/>
of ſin, and ſtill keep the ſin which
you ſay you repent of, as if you
thought to mock God with names
and ſhews?</p>
                  <p>7. You all profeſs to <hi>[Believe
the Reſurrection of the body; and
that Chriſt ſhall come again to judge
the quick and dead.]</hi> But do you
<hi>live</hi> as men that believe indeed,
that they are paſſing unto ſuch a
judgement? If you ſeriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to be judged for your lives,
for the words you ſpeak, the deeds
you do, the time you ſpend, the
means of grace which you neglect
or uſe, and for all that you receive
and do, is it poſſible you could ſo
waſte your time, and neglect the
means of your ſalvation, and ſin
ſo boldly and obſtinately as you
do?</p>
                  <p>8. You all profeſs that you <hi>[Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the life everlaſting]</hi> that the
<hi>Righteous ſhall go into their maſters
joy,</hi> and the reſt <hi>into everlaſting
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48274:89"/>
puniſhment</hi> in hell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.
and 13. But do you not play the
Hypocrites? Can you heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that you ſtand ſo near to
heaven or hell, to everlaſting joy
or torments, and make no greater
a matter of it, nor make no better
preparation for it, nor beſtir your
ſelves no more in a caſe of ſuch
unſpeakable weight? If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſincerely the <hi>glory</hi> of heaven,
you ſet your hearts on it, more
then upon earth, and take it for
your portion and moſt deſireable
felicity. But do I need to tell the
worldly fleſhly Hypocrite how far
he is from this?</p>
                  <p>9. You profeſs (as the ſumm of
the ten Commandements) that you
<hi>Love God above all, and your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as your ſelves.]</hi> But doth
not your <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> and quarreling
with your neighbours, when they
do but ſtand in the way of your
honour or commodity, convince
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48274:90"/>
you of hypocriſie in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion?</p>
                  <p>10. In the uſe of the Lords
prayer, what word do you ſpeak
that is not in <hi>hypocriſie?</hi> Do you
firſt and principally deſire the <hi>hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of Gods name,</hi> the <hi>coming of
his Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>the doing of his
will?]</hi> when you are far more
tender of your <hi>own names</hi> then of
Gods, and more regardful of your
own <hi>honour?</hi> And when you care
more for your own proſperity
then for the proſperity of the
Church and Goſpel; and do your
ſelves become the hinderers of his
Kingdom and Government in the
Church and in the ſouls of men?
And when you cannot abide to do
his <hi>Will,</hi> when it croſſeth the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of your fleſh, but diſlike it as
too ſtrict, and had rather the
Word and Will of God were
agreeable to yours, then you will
conform your own to his?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:48274:90"/>
Do you only deſire <hi>[Your daily
bread,</hi> and that in <hi>ſubordination to
the honour, and Kingdom, and will
of God.]</hi> Or rather do you not
play the Hypocrites in ſaying ſo,
when it is not <hi>[daily bread]</hi> that
will content you; but plenty and
proſperity is ſweeter to you then
<hi>holineſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you pray for <hi>[The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
of your ſins, as you forgive
others]</hi> you intimate that you are
weary of your ſins, and hate them,
and would forſake them; and that
you forgive all that have wronged
you, out of the ſenſe of your own
tranſgreſſions, and of the love of
Chriſt: but is all this ſo, or is it
meer diſſembling, when you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
not your ſin, nor are willing
to forſake it, and when your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
know that there be ſome
that you forgive not?</p>
                  <p>You pray againſt <hi>[being led into
temptation]</hi> and yet you <hi>love</hi> it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48274:91"/>
and caſt your ſelves into it. Into
<hi>tempting company,</hi> and tempting
<hi>talk,</hi> and tempting <hi>employments:</hi>
And for recreation, meat, drink,
apparel, houſes, attendants, eſtate,
reputation, and almoſt all things
elſe, you <hi>love</hi> and <hi>chooſe</hi> that
which is <hi>moſt tempting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You pray to be <hi>delivered from
evil:]</hi> when the evil of your pride,
fleſh pleaſing, and worldlineſs, you
ſo love, that indeed you <hi>would not</hi>
be delivered from them. What can
you ſay to excuſe all this from
palpable <hi>Hypocriſie?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, you pretend to all
that neceſſary to ſalvation; but
have you that in reality which you
pretend to?</p>
                  <p>1. You think your ſelves <hi>wiſe
enough</hi> to be ſaved. But is it not
<hi>folly</hi> that goes under the name of
<hi>wiſedom?</hi> When you ſhould be
converted and lead a holy life, you
are <hi>wiſe enough</hi> to give reaſons for
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48274:91"/>
the <hi>contrary,</hi> and <hi>wiſe enough</hi> to
confute the Preacher, and prove
him a fool, inſtead of obeying the
call of God. You are <hi>wiſe enough</hi>
to prove the Phyſician to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and to caſt away the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
that ſhould heale you. And
what if no body could deal with
you in ſubtilty of argument, but
you could ſay that againſt the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
means of your own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that none can anſwer? when
you <hi>die by your wiſdom;</hi> and have
diſputed your ſelves out of the
reach of mercy, will you not bewail
it then as <hi>folly?</hi> Is he <hi>wiſer</hi> that
being hungry eats his meat, or he
that gives ſuch reaſons for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
it, and pleadeth ſo learnedly
againſt eating and drinking, that
none can anſwer him? Is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
man wiſer that makes
friends for a pardon? or he that
with unanſwerable ſubtilty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth
againſt it, till the ladder be
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48274:92"/>
turned? ſuch is your vain and
<hi>ſeeming wiſdom.</hi> You are <hi>not wiſe
enough</hi> to be <hi>cured,</hi> but to <hi>give
reaſons</hi> why you ſhould <hi>continue
ſick.</hi> In the iſſue it will prove, that
you were not <hi>wiſe enough to be
ſaved,</hi> but notably wiſe to reſiſt
ſalvation, and plead your ſelves
into hell.</p>
                  <p>2. You pretend that you have
a <hi>ſaving faith,</hi> when your hearts
refuſe that ſalvation from ſin, and
that rule of Chriſt which is the
object of faith: and when you
will not believe the doctrines, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
or threatnings that croſs
your own conceits; and when
your belief of heaven will not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
your hearts from earth, nor
work you to a holy heavenly
life.</p>
                  <p>3. You pretend to <hi>Repentance</hi>
(as I ſaid before) while you hold
faſt the ſin, and give not up your
ſelves to God: when as if your
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48274:92"/>
                     <hi>neighbour,</hi> or <hi>Maſter,</hi> or <hi>Husband</hi>
ſhould but <hi>beat</hi> one of you, and tell
you when he hath done that he
<hi>repenteth,</hi> and do this as oft as <hi>you</hi>
commit your willful ſins, and ſay
<hi>you repent,</hi> I am confident you
would not take it for <hi>true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
You <hi>repent,</hi> but will not
<hi>confeſs</hi> when it is to your <hi>diſgrace,</hi>
as long as you <hi>can hide</hi> your ſin.
You <hi>repent,</hi> but will not make <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi>
or reparation of injuries
to your power. You <hi>repent,</hi> but
your heart riſeth againſt him that
reproveth you. You <hi>repent,</hi> but
you had rather keep your ſins then
leave them. Whats this but to
<hi>deceive your own hearts,</hi> and to
mock your ſelves with a <hi>ſeeming
vain</hi> and <hi>mock-repentance?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. You pretend to <hi>love God
above all,</hi> (as was before ſaid)
when you love not his Image,
waies or communion: but love
that which he hateth, and ſtill
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48274:93"/>
prefer the world before him.</p>
                  <p>5. You pretend that you have
<hi>true deſires to be godly</hi> and what
God would have you be: But
they are ſuch <hi>deſires</hi> as the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
hath to riſe, and as the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hath to work: that is, if it
could be done with eaſe, and
without labour: you lie ſtill, and
uſe not the means with diligence,
for all your deſires. When you
can fit and have your work done
with wiſhes, and your families
maintained, and your neceſſities
all ſupplied with wiſhes, you
may think to come to heaven with
wiſhes: The good deſires that the
poor may be warmed and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 15.
did neither relieve the poor, nor
ſave the wiſher. <hi>[The deſire of the
ſlothful killeth him, becauſe his
hands refuſe to labour,</hi> Prov. 21.
15.] Up and be doing according to
thy deſires, or elſe confeſs that thy
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48274:93"/>
wiſhes are hypocritical, and that
thou deceiveſt thy own heart by
<hi>Vain deſires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. You alſo pretend to be <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
worſhippers of God.</hi> You pray,
and you read the Scripture and
good books, and you hear the
Word, and receive the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
But I have before ſhewed
you your hypocriſie in theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you
pray againſt the ſin that you love
and would not leave: you pray
for holineſs, when you hate it or
deſire it not, in any degree to croſs
your fleſh: you ſerve God with
meer words (whether of your own
conceiving, or of others preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,)
with ſome forced acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of that God that hath
not your hearts or lives. Let
Chriſt paſs the ſentence on you,
and not I, <hi>Matth. 15. 7, 8, 9. [Ye
hypocrites, well did</hi> Eſaias <hi>Propheſie
of you, ſaying, This people draweth
nigh unto me with their mouth, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48274:94"/>
honoureth me with their lips: but
their heart is far from me: But in
vain they do worſhip me, teaching
for doctrines the commandements of
men]</hi> You like that <hi>teaching</hi> that
ſooths you in your own opinions,
and galleth not your conſciences
in the guilty place: <hi>A Miniſtry</hi>
you would have, that ſhould ſtand
like an adorned Idol that hurts no
body, and toucheth not your ſores:
or that is but inſtead of a pair of
Organs, or a tinckling Cymbal, to
tickle your fancy, and make
Church-worſhip to be as a kind of
religious ſtage-play to you. But
a true Miniſter of Chriſt, to open
to you the doctrine of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and roundly to awake you
from ſecurity in ſin, and to call
you up to the moſt ſerious holy
heavenly life, and follow you and
let you take no reſt, till you yeild
and practiſe it; and to call you to
open confeſſion of your open ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48274:94"/>
ſins, that you may make
ſuch reparation to the wronged
honour of God and ſouls of men,
as you are capable of, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
to abſolve you, or to
bind you over to anſwer it at the
bar of God, and charge the Church
to avoid communion with you, if
you are impenitent and incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<hi>ſuch a Miniſtry as this</hi> (which
is the Miniſtry of Chriſts appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
you abhor; at leaſt, when
they come to <hi>touch your ſores.</hi>
Then you are too proud to be
taught and ruled by ſuch as theſe,
though you hypocritically profeſs
to be ruled by Chriſt, who ruleth
his Church by his <hi>Spirit, Word</hi>
and <hi>Miniſters</hi> conjunct. Then
you ſay, who gave you authority
to do thus and thus by me? As if
you knew not that Chriſt in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

<hi>ſincere obedience:</hi> If we ask you,
whether you are willing to obey

that any ſhould deny it. But
when it comes to the particulars,
and you find that he commandeth
you that which fleſh and blood is

you will be excuſed: and yet that

will perſwade your ſelves that it is
no duty, and that God would not

have you do that which you <hi>will
not</hi> do. Like a Countrymans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
that promiſeth to do all that
his Maſter bids him: but when he
cometh to particulars, threſhing is
too hard a work, and mowing and
reaping are beyond his ſtrength,
and plowing is too toylſome; and
in the concluſion, it is only an idle
life with ſome eaſie charres, that he
will be brought to. This is the
Hypocrites obedience. He will
obey God in all things, as far as he
is able, in the general: But when
it comes to particulars, <hi>To deny

proſperity for Chriſt, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
the world, and live by faith,
and converſe in heaven, and walk

to forgive all wrongs, to humble

                  <p>In a word, <hi>God</hi> muſt be loved

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48274:97"/>

as <hi>Holineſs:</hi> Though not to
the <hi>height</hi> of their proper <hi>Worth</hi>
(which none on earth is able to
reach) yet ſo, as that nothing be
preferred before them.</p>
                  <p>BUt yet there is one more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
which if I paſs by, you
will think I bawk a chief part of
my text.</p>
                  <p>An unbridled tongue in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour
of Religion is enough to prove
his Religion vain.</p>
                  <p>By an <hi>unbridled tongue</hi> is not
meant all the ſins of our ſpeech.
<hi>[If any man offend not in word, the
ſame is a perfect man, and able alſo
to bridle the whole body. But in
many things we offend all]</hi> Iam. 3. 2.
Every unwarrantable jeaſt, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
word, or haſty raſh expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48274:98"/>
is not enough to prove a mans
<hi>Religion</hi> to be in <hi>vain.</hi> Though
Chriſt ſay that we ſhall <hi>anſwer for
every idle word,</hi> he doth not ſay,
<hi>we ſhall be condemned for every idle
word:</hi> But when the tongue is
unbridled, and is not kept under
a holy Law, but ſuffered to be the
ordinary inſtrument of wilfull
known ſin, or of groſs ſin which
men might know and will not, this
proves the perſon void of holineſs,
and conſequently his Religion
vain.</p>
                  <p>Its true; every Hypocrite hath
not an unbridled tongue: ſome of
them have the bridle of moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and ſome of Religious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and ſome of the preſence
and awe of perſons whom they
eſteem: common knowledge, with
natural manſuetude and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth bridle the tongues of
many an Hypocrite: But as every
wicked man is not a drunkard, or
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48274:98"/>
fornicator, and yet every drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
or fornicator (that liveth in
it) is a wicked man; ſo every
Hypocrite hath not an unbridled
tongue (his vice may lie ſome
other way); but every man that
hath an unbridled tongue is an
Hypocrite, if withall he profeſs
himſelf a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>The ſins of the tongue are of
three ſorts. 1. Such as are againſt

the evidences of prophaneneſs in
the ſpeakers heart; though ſome
of them much more then others:
and if the tongue be not then
bridled, all is in vain.</p>
                  <p>2. Sinfull ſpeeches againſt Juſtice
and charity are theſe: reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parents, or Governours, or
neighbours: railing and reviling:
curſing: provoking others to do
miſchief, or commit any ſin: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing
againſt, and diſſwading
men from truth and duty; and
hindering them by your ſpeeches
from a holy life, and the means of
their ſalvation: calling good, evil,
and evil, good: lying; ſlandering;
falſe witneſs-bearing; back-biting:
extenuating mens vertues, and
aggravating their faults beyond
the certain apparent truth: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
and reciting, and carrying
on evil reports, which you know
not to be true: endeavouring to
cool mens love to others, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48274:99"/>
them ſeem bad, when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prove it: mentioning mens
faults and failings without a call
and juſt occaſion, unchaſt, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
ribald ſpeeches: cheating
and deceitful words to wrong
others in their eſtates: with other
ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>But undoubtedly that ſin of the
tongue which the Apoſtle here had
particular reſpect to, was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
of fellow-Chriſtians,
eſpecially upon the occaſion of
ſome differences of judgement and
practice in the ſmaller matters of
Religion: The Judaizing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
gave liberty to their tongues,
to reproach thoſe that refuſed the
uſe of thoſe ceremonies, which
they uſed themſelves, and placed
much of their Religion in: The
quarrel was the ſame that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
by the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.
and by <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 14. and 15.
and throughout the Epiſtle to the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48274:100"/>
                     <hi>Galathians.</hi> And this is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
that <hi>James</hi> calls vain here,
which was much placed in ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
with a pretenſe of higheſt
knowledge, and a cenſorious vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all that would not do as
they.</p>
                  <p>There are eſpecially three ſorts
that uſe to reproach each other
about the matters of Religion.
1. Thoſe that are hardened to that
height of impiety, as to make a
mock at ſeriouſneſs and diligence
in the practiſe of Chriſtianity it
ſelf, hating and reproaching them
that dare not ſell their ſouls at as
baſe a price as they.</p>
                  <p>2. Thoſe that have ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
charity by faction and
ſelf-conceit, as to confine their
love and honour to their party,
and to ſpeak evil of thoſe that
are not of their own opinions.</p>
                  <p>3. Thoſe that give liberty to
their tongues unſeaſonably, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurably
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48274:100"/>
or unwarrantably to
ſpeak hardly of thoſe that they
<hi>ſuffer by</hi> upon <hi>Religious accounts;</hi>
though perhaps they are their <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours</hi>
whom they are bound to
honour.</p>
                  <p>1. The <hi>firſt ſort</hi> are arrived at
ſuch a meaſure of maliciouſneſs
and miſery, that they are, as mad
men, the objects of compaſſion to
all men ſave themſelves. Their ſin
and miſery is ſo notorious, that I
need not ſay any thing to diſcover
it to <hi>others,</hi> that have any thing of
reaſon and true Religion: And
for <hi>themſelves,</hi> being ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
of God, as to hate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the means of their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

fear the wrath and threatnings of
the Almighty; but boldly to rage

man feareth and departeth from

Yet this much briefly I
ſhall ſay to theſe, if any of them
be this day my auditors, that I may
not leave them as utterly paſt
hope.</p>
                  <p>1. Thou art one of the moſt
ſelf-condemned ſtigmatized ſlaves
of Satan in the world. Thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
openly ſo undoubted a brand
of wickedneſs, that there is no
room for any rational Hope in thy
ſelf, or any of thy friends, that
ever thou ſhouldſt be ſaved, if thou
die in ſuch a ſtate: <hi>Some Hope</hi> is
left that yet thou mayſt be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;</hi>
but <hi>none,</hi> that thou
ſhouldſt be <hi>ſaved without conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
It is poſſible with God that
can do all things, that yet thy
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48274:101"/>
wilful blindneſs may be cured,
and thy tongue may unſay all that
thou haſt ſaid; and thou mayſt
cry out of thy folly, and cry
ſhame againſt thy ſelf, for that
which now thou glorieſt in. It is
poſſible for God of ſuch a ſtone, to
make a child of <hi>Abraham!</hi> and to
melt that hardened heart of thine,
and lay it bleeding at the feet of
Chriſt, and make thee wiſh with
tears or groans, that ſuch thoughts
had never entred into thy heart,
nor ſuch words of malice proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from thy mouth. And happy
art thou, if God will have ſo much
mercy on thee, that haſt derided
mercy, as to vouchſafe thee ſuch a
change. And pray for it, and pray
hard, and pray again, if thou love
thy ſoul: For this is thy Hope:
and thou haſt no other. For that
ever ſuch a wretch as thou ſhouldſt
be ſaved, in the ſtate that now
thou art in, is as impoſſible as for
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48274:102"/>
God to lie; and as impoſſible as
for the Devils to be ſaved. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(but that ſuch a forſaken ſoul,
is a ſenſleſs block, and as a lifeleſs
carkaiſe) that thou doſt not
quake with the fears of Hell, which
way ever thou goeſt; and that
thou art not ſtill thinking whither
thou art going, and how the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
are ready to take thy ſoul, as
ſoon as Death hath opened the
door and let it out, into Eternity!
As careleſly or ſcornfully as thou
ſitteſt here, I wonder that thou
doſt not tremble to conſider,
where it is that thou muſt ſhortly
be, and where thou muſt abide
for ever? It is one of the moſt
notable diſcoveries of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
craft of Satan, that he is able
to keep ſuch a Garriſon as thy
heart in ſo much peace, and to
quiet a poor wretch, that is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to be one hour out of Hell!
That thy ſleep is not broken with
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48274:102"/>
terrible dreams, and that thou doſt
not eat thy meat in terrours; and
that ever a ſmile ſhould be ſeen in
thy face! That thy buſineſs, or
company, or ſports, or pleaſures,
ſhould once put out of thy mind
thy endleſs miſery. While I am
ſpeaking, and thou art hearing,
Hell-fire is burning, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
are waiting, and thy blinded
ſoul is poſting on, and for ought
thou knoweſt, may be there this
night. Poor ſinner, for my part, I
know thee not! and therefore
cannot juſtly be ſuſpected to bear
thee any ill will, or to ſpeak theſe
words with a deſire of thy hurt.
I know this is language that the
guilty do not love to hear. But I
muſt tell thee, that reproacheſt or
derideſt a ſerious holy life, that
except the Blaſphemers of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt, there is few in the world
in more certain miſery then thou.
Other ſinners, though miſerable,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48274:103"/>
may have ſome more <hi>cloak</hi> to <hi>hide</hi>
their miſery. Though the <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard</hi>
ſhall not enter into Heaven,
he may flatter himſelf with the
remembrance that <hi>Noah</hi> was once
overtaken with that ſin. Though
the <hi>Fornicator</hi> or <hi>Adulterer</hi> ſhall
not enter into the Kingdom of
God (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 5.) he may cheat
himſelf awhile, with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of <hi>Davids</hi> guilt. Though
the falſe-hearted, temporizing,
ſelf-ſaving Hypocrite, ſhall not
be ſaved, he may deceive himſelf
by the inſtance of <hi>Peters</hi> denying
his Maſter, and his diſſimulation,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. But what cloak haſt <hi>thou</hi>
to hide thy miſery! Did ever any
true Diſciple of Chriſt, either hate
or reproach his ſervants and his
wayes! What godly man hath
made a mock at godlineſs, (unleſs
it were when he was ungodly.)
If any ſhould think, that an act of
drunkenneſs, or fornication,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48274:103"/>
might conſiſt with grace; no man
that underſtands himſelf can think,
that a ſcorner at an Holy life, hath
himſelf the Holineſs which he
ſcorneth! I would not for a world
be in the caſe of that wretch, that
ſpeaks well of Holineſs in others,
while he lives in fornication, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or worldlineſs himſelf, though
he think that he cuts ſcores by
daily crying to God for mercy.
But I would much leſs for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
worlds be in the caſe of him
that neither is godly, nor can
<hi>ſpeak well of it:</hi> that is not only
void of the Spirit of Chriſt, but
<hi>ſpeaks againſt it:</hi> that is not only
void of the Holy Image of God,
but <hi>hateth it,</hi> and <hi>reproacheth it</hi> in
others. O rather let me have no
tongue to ſpeak, no ſoul to think,
then ever I ſhould ſpeak or think
thus maliciouſly of the Image, and
wayes, and ſervants of the Lord!
I had rather be a dog or a toad,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48274:104"/>
then one of thoſe men that uſe
to mock at ſerious diligent ſerving
of the Lord, or that maliciouſly
reproach his ſervants, and bend
their wits and tongues againſt
them; ſo legibly is the mark of
the Devil upon them, that I muſt
needs tell you that are true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve's,
you are much to be blamed
that you look not on them with
more compaſſion, and weep not
for them, as for men that are

hear them rail at the Laws or
ſervants of the Lord. I mean thoſe
of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>[For

weeping, that they are the enemies of

<hi>think it ſtrange that we run not with

account to him that is ready to judge
the quick and the dead,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.
4, 5</p>
                  <p>2. Thou beareſt moſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the image of the Devil, and
moſt expreſly ſpeakeſt his mind,
and art moſt openly employed in
his works. What is the Devil, but
an apoſtate ſpirit, filled with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
againſt God and his ſervants,
and hating Holineſs, the malicious
Accuſer of the Brethren, ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and reproaching them, and
ſeeking their deſtruction! And
ſhall a malicious, lying ſinner live,
that imitateth Satan in his enmity
to God! O that thou kneweſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48274:105"/>
whom thou ſerveſt! and that thou
kneweſt whom thou ſpeakeſt
againſt! <hi>Wo be to him that ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

9. <hi>Its hard for thee to kick
againſt the pricks,</hi> Acts 9. 5.
<hi>Who ever hardened himſelf againſt
him, and hath proſpered?</hi> Job 9. 4.
If Satan were to ſpeak with open
face, what would he ſay, but as
the tongues of the malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of holineſs do; even to
ſpeak evil of the wayes and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the Lord? Might he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
and ſpeak himſelf in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
and Councils of the great
ones of the earth, he would ſpeak
againſt the ſame men, and to the
ſame purpoſe, as thoſe that I have
deſcribed. <hi>Your tongues</hi> are <hi>his
inſtruments.</hi> You ſpeak what he
ſecretly ſuggeſteth, as verily as if
he had written you your <hi>inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and you had read it in his
words: <hi>He hateth</hi> holineſs, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48274:105"/>
therefore he tempteth <hi>you</hi> to <hi>hate</hi>
it. He would bring it into hatred
in the world, and therefore he
ſpeaks diſgracefully of it by your
tongues. His will is your will.
And your words are his words:
and the pleaſant'ſt muſick that you
could make him. O how it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him to make a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
reproach the Word and waies
of his Creatour! How eager was
he to have got <hi>Job</hi> to have ſpoken
evil of God!</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Be it known to thee, thou
reviler, that if ever thou be ſaved
thy ſelf, it muſt be in that way that
thou revileſt. Thy hope lyeth in
it. As ſure as thou liveſt, there is
no other way to life eternal.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

ſelf or burn for ever. Either thou
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48274:106"/>
muſt be ſuch as thoſe that thou
doſt ſpeak againſt, or thou art
everlaſtingly undone. And if thou
think to be ſuch a one thy ſelf, and
to come to heaven by the very way
that now thou doſt revile, canſt
thou yet revile it! And if thou
periſh in hell for want of holineſs,
thou ſhalt then have enough of
thy rebellion. Then thou ſhalt cry
out againſt thy own malicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
a thouſand times more,
then ever thou didſt againſt the
ſervants of the Lord. Though the
very diſtinction between the</hi> Godly
<hi>and</hi> Vngodly <hi>be now thy ſcorn, yet
I ſhall be bold to tell thee in the
words of</hi> Henoch, <hi>yea of God,</hi>
Jud. 14. 15. [Behold the Lord
cometh with ten thouſands of his
Saints, to execute judgement upon
all, and to convince all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
among them, of all their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
deeds, which they have ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily
committed, and of all their hard
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48274:106"/>
speeches which ungodly ſinners have
ſpoken againſt him.] <hi>Now you have</hi>
your day, <hi>and</hi> judgement muſt begin
at the houſe of God! and if it firſt
begin at us, what ſhall the end be of
them that obey not the Goſpel of God!
and if the righteous ſcarcely be
ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and
the ſinner appear? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 17, 18.
Bleſſed is the man that walketh not
in the counſel of the ungodly, nor
ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor
ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornful!
But his delight is in the Law of the
Lord; and in his Law doth he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
day and night.—The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
are not ſo; but like the chaffe
which the wind driveth away: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ungodly ſhall not ſtand in the
judgement, nor ſinners in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the righteous: For the

I make no queſtion, but the
worſt of-you will put by all this in
your ſelf-deceit, and ſay, <hi>It is not
holineſs that we ſpeak againſt, but
its Hypocriſie, or Schiſme,</hi> or ſome
ſuch accuſation that malice ſhall
ſuggeſt, will be your mask. But
will you anſwer me theſe few
Queſtions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Why then do you
not imitate them ſo far as they do
well! why are you not as much in
works of holineſs, as they! in
reading, and meditating on the
Word of God, in holy conference,
and ſecret prayer, and inſtructing
your families <hi>&amp;c?</hi> and then leave
them and ſpare not where they do
amiſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Why do you not hate
as much the ſins of the notoriouſly
ungodly, who ſhew them without
ſhame? Nay why do you make
ſuch men your companions?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Why go you to the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48274:107"/>
heart, that is unſeen, and arrogate
the prerogative of God, to cenſure
men of Hypocriſie and ſuch ſecret
ſins that are out of your diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
If you know your heart by
outward actions, inſiſt upon your
proofes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Why ſpeak you not
of their good as well as of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
evil? why are you not more
in ſpeaking well of what is well,
then in ſpeaking ill of what is ill?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. Why is it that you
ſpeak of men that you know not?
and of others that are innocent, for
the ſakes of thoſe that you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to be guilty? and why do you
ſo greedily ſnatch at any matter of
reproach, and take it by hearſay
from the moſt ignorant, raſh, or
malicious mouths?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. If it be Hypocriſie or
other vice that you ſo hate; why
do you not hate them in your
ſelves? why live you ſo viciouſly,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48274:108"/>
while you profeſs obedience to
the Lord? and why do you take
on you to believe a heaven and
hell hereafter, and to give up your
ſelves in Covenant to God, and
live ſo contrary to that profeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and Covenant?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 7. Do you not feel that
it is partly malice, and partly the
recriminations of a guilty galled
conſcience, that fain would ſteal
a little peace by thinking others to
be as bad as you?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall diſmiſs this unhappy ſort
of men with theſe two requeſts.
1. You are the men that of all
others have the moſt notable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
for <hi>your</hi> conviction, of the
miſery of your preſent ſtate: and
therefore I beſeech you take that
advantage. One would think it
ſhould be the eaſieſt matter in the
world, for ſuch as you to know
that you are ungodly, that hate
godlineſs and oppoſe it? you have
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48274:108"/>
no plauſible pretence for ſelf-flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
or ſelf-deceit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
confeſs your miſery, and look
out to Chriſt, for help and pardon,
while there is hope and time.</p>
                  <p>2. For the time to come, will
you but <hi>try</hi> a ſerious holy life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ſpeak againſt it any more?
For ſhame ſpeak not evil of the
<hi>things you know not,</hi> as thoſe bruits
deſcribed, <hi>Jud.</hi> 10. And holineſs
was never <hi>well known</hi> but by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi>
O that you would be
intreated but to yeild to this moſt
equal motion. Away with your
worldly fleſhly lives; and live in
faith and holineſs, a juſt, a ſpiritual
and heavenly life, but one year, or
one quarter, or one moneth, and
then if by <hi>experience</hi> you find juſt
cauſe for it, reproach a holy life,
and ſpare not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:48274:109"/>
II. TO the ſecond ſort, (that
ſpeak evil of men upon
differences of opinion, eſpecially
while they profeſs the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
in all the eſſential neceſſary
parts,) I ſhall propoſe theſe ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations
of their ſin, for their
humiliation.</p>
                  <p>1. Conſider, can you think it
agreeable to the Law of Chriſt, to
reproach men behind their backs,
and unheard, for that which you
never ſoberly and Chriſtianly told
them of to their faces? Did you
lovingly firſt admoniſh them, and
impartially hear what they can ſay
for themſelves? what is your end
in ſpeaking againſt your brother?
Is it to do him <hi>hurt,</hi> or <hi>good?</hi> If
<hi>hurt,</hi> be ſure you do him <hi>Juſtice;</hi>
and backbiting is not the way of
<hi>Juſtice.</hi> If <hi>good,</hi> you croſs your
own intention. For what <hi>good</hi>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:48274:109"/>
can it do him, that another hears
him evil ſpoken of?</p>
                  <p>2. If you are <hi>Chriſts Diſciples,</hi>
it muſt be <hi>known to all men by your
ſpecial love to one another,</hi> Joh. 13.
35. And is reproach and evil-ſpeaking
the fruit or evidence of
ſuch love? can you talk ſo of the
friends that are moſt dear to you,
or that you love indeed? how do
our hearts riſe againſt that man,
that ſpeaks reproachfully of our
deareſt friends? Love would ſcarce
ſuffer you to endure ſuch abuſe of
Chriſtians in another, without a
ſerious reprehenſion: much leſs
to be the abuſer of them your
ſelves.</p>
                  <p>3. Your evil ſpeaking of your
brethren deſtroyeth <hi>love in others,</hi>
as it proves the want of it in your
ſelves. And to <hi>deſtroy their love,</hi> is
to <hi>deſtroy their ſouls.</hi> You do your
worſt to quench the love, both of
him that you ſpeak evil of, and of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48274:110"/>
them to whom you ſpeak it. <hi>Good</hi>
is the object of love: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſpeak of men, and manifeſt
them to be <hi>lovely,</hi> is the only way
to make them <hi>loved. Evil</hi> is the
object of hatred: and therefore
to ſpeak evil of them, is to make
them ſeem hateful, and draw men
to the guilt of hating them. To
<hi>praiſe</hi> a man will do more to make
him <hi>loved,</hi> then if you only <hi>intreat</hi>
another to love him. And to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe</hi>
a man will do more to make
him hated, then if you directly
<hi>perſwade</hi> another to hate him. And
what ſervice you do the Devil, and
what diſſervice unto Chriſt, by
deſtroying love, and ſowing
hatred among his ſervants, were
you impartial, you might eaſily
diſcern.</p>
                  <p>4. Is it not ſhame and pitty,
that the followers of Chriſt ſhould
imitate the Devil, and ungodly
men, as by detraction and reviling
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48274:110"/>
words they do? you aggravate
your brethrens faults, and find
faults where there are none; and
ſo do Satan and ungodly men. You
have a ſecret deſire to make them
ſeem contemptible and vile; and
ſo have Satan and ungodly men.
And hereby you ſeem to juſtifie
the wicked, and encourage them
in their reproaching. They think
<hi>they</hi> may boldly ſpeak ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of you all, as they hear you
ſpeak of one another. O what
pitty is it to hear the profeſſed
children of the Lord, to uſe the
hell-bred language of his enemies,
as if they had gone to ſchool to
Satan!</p>
                  <p>5. Are there not tongues
enough ſharpened againſt us in
the world, but we muſt wound
each other with our own? Is it
not enough, if we are the ſeed of
Chriſt, that every where the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
ſeed do hate us; and that all
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48274:111"/>
manner of evil is falſly ſpoken of
us, and that we are made as the
ſcorn and the off-ſcouring of all
things, but we muſt alſo hate and
reproach each other? Have you
not load enough from the world?
Have you not enemies enough to
do the <hi>work</hi> of <hi>enemies,</hi> but friends
muſt do it? And hath not Satan
inſtruments and tongues enough
of his own, but he muſt uſe thoſe
that are Chriſts againſt himſelf?</p>
                  <p>6. If thou hate thy brother, yet
ſure thou doſt not hate <hi>thy ſelf.</hi>
Why then doſt thou <hi>hurt and ſhame
thy ſelf?</hi> His hurt is but to be
<hi>defamed,</hi> which is little, if any thing
at all (for it is much in himſelf
whether it ſhall hurt him.) But
<hi>thy</hi> hurt that doſt it, is to provoke
God againſt thee, and incur his
wrath, and wound thy ſoul by the
guilt of <hi>ſin.</hi> And if another <hi>hurt</hi>
thee, in the heel, wilt thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſtab thy ſelf to the heart? If
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48274:111"/>
another be bad, wilt <hi>thou</hi> become
ſo by unjuſt defaming him? And
how doſt thou croſs thine own
intentions? The ſtone that thou
caſteſt at him, flyes back in thy face.
Thou proclaimeſt thy own tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
and ſhame, when thou
art uncharitably proclaiming his.
Is not a backbiter, a reviler, if not
a malicious calumniator, a worſe
name (which thou tak'ſt to thy ſelf)
then that which thou canſt faſten
on him whom thou doſt reproach?</p>
                  <p>7. Thy uncharitable ſpeeches
are a dangerous ſign of an unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and unpardoned ſoul. If thou
canſt not forgive, thou art not
forgiven. Did you know your
ſelves, it would teach you to deal
more compaſſionately with others.
You would have the act of Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as extenſive as you could, if
you knew what danger you are in
your ſelves. Do you not know as
much by your ſelves as you have
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48274:112"/>
to reproach your brother with?
Do you not then invite both God
and man to take you at the worſt,
and uſe you as you uſe your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
methinks you ſhould rather
be deſirous of a more tender and
indulgent way, as knowing what
<hi>need your ſelves</hi> have of it.</p>
                  <p>If you ſay, <hi>[O but he hath done
thus and thus againſt me]</hi> Let
conſcience ſay what <hi>you</hi> have done
your ſelves againſt God &amp; others.
If you ſay, <hi>He is a Schiſmatick, an
Hypocrite, or this or that;</hi> remember,
that malice is blind, &amp; never wants
matter of accuſation or reproach,
&amp; innocency is no defence againſt
it: elſe Chriſt and his Prophets and
Apoſtles had been better uſed by
the world. And ask conſcience
whether more then you can truly
ſay of him, may not be ſaid againſt
your ſelves. If all ſuch muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed,
how infamous will you be?</p>
                  <p>8. If you will <hi>ſpeak</hi> ill, you muſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48274:112"/>
                     <hi>hear</hi> ill. You teach men how to uſe
you. <hi>[Si mihi pergit quae vult
dicere, quae non vult audict.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

uſually in juſtice ſuffereth it ſo to
be. And as thoſe that by violence
trample down others, when they

on themſelves; ſo thoſe that take
their advantages to inſult, and
defame others, do uſually live to
be defamed. For <hi>with what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

ranks you ſhould refer the
common names of ſcorn that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
perſons have been moſt
loaded with among us, you muſt
judge by the particular occaſion
and perſon. It is not my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48274:113"/>
on or deſire to plead for any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
diſobedience, irregularity,
or hypocriſie; much leſs to palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
hereſies or odious crimes that
are cloaked with the name or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Religion. It is the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
that I am all this while
detecting. But I muſt ſay that it
hath been the higheſt brand or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>Hypocriſie and impudent
profaneneſs conjunct,</hi> and one of the
moſt crying tranſgreſſions of this
Land, that men baptized into the
Name of Chriſt, have made a ſcorn
at the diligent ſerving of him,
and lived in the hatred of that
Religion in the life and practice,
which themſelves profeſs. And
that if upon ſome ſmall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
differences, any of their
ſuperiours have but encouraged
them, to uſe any nickname of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
againſt their moſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious
brethren, they have been
glad of the occaſion, and uſed
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48274:113"/>
thoſe reproaches againſt the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
practice of Religion, which
others pretend to uſe only againſt
mens different opinions, which
they account their exorbitancies
or miſtakes. How the names of
[Zealots, Preciſians, Puritans,]
and ſuch like, have been uſed in
this Land; and what ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have been made thereby (and
by the diſcountenance of thoſe
that ſhould have cheriſhed a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
holy life) to be the common
ſcorn; and how great a hindrance
this hath proved to the ſalvation
of many thouſand ſouls, is a thing
that's much more ſad to mention,
then difficult to prove. And when
one nickname is grown out of uſe,
the ſerpentine enmity watcheth
for the opportunity that's afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by differences and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the times, to take up
another that may have a ſharper
ſting. The dead form of Religion,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48274:114"/>
and as much as you will of <hi>words</hi>
and <hi>ſhews,</hi> they can reverence or
endure: But <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Seriouſneſs,</hi>
and <hi>Practice</hi> is the thing they hate.
Juſt like a Bear or other ravenous
creature, that will let their prey
alone while it <hi>ſeems dead</hi> and <hi>ſtirs</hi>
not: but if it <hi>ſtir,</hi> they leap upon
it, and tear it into pieces. And
therefore it is that the diligent
zealous exerciſe of Religion,
among the Papiſts, by Images, and
Tautologies, and lifeleſs Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and forms is not half ſo much
hated or reproached by the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
as the ſerious exerciſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
duties, that all are in
words agreed in, is here with us.
To pray in our families; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
our children and ſervants in
the neceſſary points of faith and
duty; to exhort a drunkard, a
ſwearer, a covetous perſon, or
other ungodly ones to repent and
to give up themſelves to a holy
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48274:114"/>
life; to take up any ſerious ſpeech
of death and judgement, and the
life to come, and the neceſſary
preparations thereto; theſe and
ſuch like are the odious marks of
a <hi>Zealot,</hi> a <hi>Preciſian,</hi> or <hi>Puritan</hi>
with the ungodly rabble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that
ſerving the great and glorious
God is with them become a matter
of ſcorn; while ſerving the Devil
is taken for their glory, if they
can but do it in the plauſible leſs
diſgraceful mode.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe ſome of the chief
accuſers of the Brethren, would

<hi>Hypocrites,</hi> but with the openly
prophane.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, 1. Even
theſe profeſs themſelves to be
Chriſtians, and therefore are <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi>
when they are not what
they do profeſs. 2. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
themſelves that they are as
truly godly as thoſe that they
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48274:124"/>
reproach: and do not think that
it is godlineſs indeed for which
they do reproach them: But for
engroſſing the name or reputation
of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> to themſelves, and for
ſome differing manner or way of
worſhip. For this is one of the
moſt notable cheats, by which the
devil undoes the empty Formal
Hypocrite: Finding that this man
doth own Chriſtianity, in his
Opinion, but is void of the true
Spirit, and power, and life of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, he raiſeth ſome
controverſies between the ſerious
Chriſtian and the Hypocrite, about
ſome controvertible points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or about ſome modes or
circumſtances of Diſcipline and
external worſhip: and when they
fall into two ſides, the Hypocrite
thinks that it is but in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
that the difference lyes:
The queſtion, (thinks he) is not
whether men ſhould be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48274:124"/>
godly and Religious: But
whether my way of Religion or
the Puritans and Preciſians be
better!] And preſently he hence
concludes, that indeed it is he that
is the more truly Religious: [For
(ſaith he) my judgement is ſound,
and the Puritans is erroneous: I
am of the judgement of the
Church, which he is againſt: The
Reverend Prelates, or Doctors are
more of my ſide then on his: I am
for order, and he is for confuſion,
and unreverence, and followeth
the humours and fancies of his own
brain.] And thus the Devil turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his eye from the main differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and makes him believe that
it is theſe controverſies that are all
that ſets them at a diſtance. But
alas man, thou overlookeſt the
point that thy life and ſoul lyeth
on. Agree firſt in the ſerious
hearty entertainment and practice
of the ſubſtance of that holy truth,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48274:125"/>
which you are both in point of
<hi>Opinion</hi> agreed in, and do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
thy ſelf in the things which
thou alloweſt; contradict not thy
Creed and profeſſion by thy fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
worldly, negligent, careleſs and
ungodly life; but love God with
all thy heart and might; and firſt
ſeek his Kingdom and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
(which thou confeſſeſt
thou ſhouldeſt do) and then the
principal difference is healed, and
thou haſt ſcaped the principal
danger of thy ſoul: and then it is
not a few circumſtantial differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
that will divide your hearts,
or divide you from each other in
the life to come. Men that differ
about Biſhops, and ceremonies, and
forms of prayer, may be all true
Chriſtians, and dear to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and to Chriſt, if they be
practically agreed in the life of
godlineſs, and joyn in a holy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
converſation. But if you
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48274:125"/>
agree in all your opinions and
formalities, and yet were never
ſanctified by the truth, you do but
agree to delude your ſouls, and
neither of you will be ſaved for all
your agreement.</p>
                  <p>III. THE third ſort to be
ſpoken to, is thoſe that
let out their paſſion in hard
ſpeeches, againſt ſuperiours or
others that they think do wrong

account. At this time I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the injury be real, and the
complaint be juſt; It yet beſeems
not Chriſtians to revile.</p>
                  <p>1. Conſider, how contrary this
is to the example of our Lord.
And that he left us his example in
this particular, with a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
for our imitation.
When he was falſly accuſed, and
the high Prieſt urged him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

                     <hi>for himſelf,</hi> Matth. 26. 62,
63. <hi>he was ſilent, to ſhew that he
could bear a falſe accuſation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſo much as vindicating his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
by a juſt defence. O learn
both the leſſon and motives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to you,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 18.
<hi>to the end.</hi> [Servants be ſubject to
your Maſters with all fear; not only
to the good and gentle, but alſo to the
froward. For this is thankworthy,
if a man for conſcience toward God
endure grief, ſuffering wrongfully:
For what glory is it if when ye are
buffeted for your faults, ye ſhall take
it patiently? but if when ye do well,
and ſuffer for it, ye take it patiently,
this is acceptable with God. For
even hereunto were ye called, becauſe
Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us; leaving
us an example, that ye ſhould follow
his ſteps: who did no ſin, neither
was guile found in his mouth: who
when he was reviled, reviled not
again: When he ſuffered, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48274:126"/>
not; but committed himſelf to
him that judgeth righteouſly.] <hi>Here

28, 29.</p>
                  <p>2. Conſider, as our <hi>Kingdom is
not of this World,</hi> ſo we are not to
ſtrive for worldly preheminence,
nor with carnal weapons, but
muſt know that our <hi>greatneſs</hi> here
is in being the <hi>leaſt,</hi> and <hi>our digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in being the ſervants of all; and
our gain is by our loſs, and our
honour by evil reports, and by
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48274:127"/>
diſgrace, and our advancement by
our debaſement, and our prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by being kept from worldly
honour, and our joy by ſorrow,
and our exaltation by humiliation:
And therefore it is contrary to
our ſtate of <hi>faith,</hi> to murmur
at them that deprive us of the
pleaſures of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> or the eaſe and
priviledges of the fleſh. Mark the
deſcription of Chriſtianity in the
Goſpel, and ſee how much of it
conſiſteth in contempt of the
eſteem and honours of the world,
and of all the accommodations and
pleaſures of the fleſh, becauſe of
the expectation of the unſeen
eternal pleaſures; and in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
all, and taking up our
croſſe and following a crucified
Chriſt: and in patience, and
meekneſs, and forbearing and
forgiving: and rather then ſeek
either verbal or actual revenge,
to give the cloak alſo to him that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48274:127"/>
takes away our coat, and turn
the other cheek to him that ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
us. Unmortified paſſion, and
untamed nature, will not give ſome
men leave to underſtand theſe
paſſages of Chriſt; but they ſearch
for ſome ſuch figure to expound
them by, as ſhall annihilate the
plain and proper ſenſe. <hi>Self-love</hi>
ſo blindeth men, that when they
read theſe Goſpel precepts, they
feel not their conſciences touched
and bound by them; but they
read them as if they read them
not, and retain no more, then if
it were non-ſenſe which they read.
Had the commands aforeſaid (of
patience, forbearing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving)
but as much force and
efficacy upon the ſouls of moſt
profeſſours, as the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have that are againſt ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and curſing, and drunkenneſs,
and fornication, we ſhould have
much better maintained our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48274:128"/>
and our peace, and have
more honoured our profeſſion, by
ſhewing the world Chriſtianity
exemplified, in its proper genuine
nature and effects.</p>
                  <p>3. Conſider, it is not oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
perſecution, or hard uſage
that will exempt us from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which requireth us to <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
our ſuperiours, (our <hi>Natural,</hi>
and <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.)
It is the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>froward,</hi>
and not only the <hi>good</hi> &amp; the <hi>gentle</hi>
that we muſt honour and obey.
And the reaſon is plain from their
<hi>Original</hi> and <hi>end.</hi> It is not as <hi>our
Truſtees,</hi> or <hi>agents,</hi> or <hi>friends only,</hi>
that our rulers muſt be honoured:
but as the Officers of the God of
heaven: nor is it only as they do
good to us: but as they preſerve
order and juſtice in the world,
and are the pillars of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.

common good we muſt be careful
to keep up the honour of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
even when we ſuffer by

Gods, and he is engaged to repay,
and hath commanded us not to

not ſtep into the Judges tribunal

places, you know not how far you
might be prevailed againſt your
ſelves. If <hi>little temptations</hi> can
make you miſcarry in your places
ſo oft and foully as you do, what
would you do if you had the
<hi>ſtrongeſt baits</hi> of the world, and
allurements of the fleſh, and the
moſt dangerous temptations that
Satan could aſſault you with?
Have you not ſeen of late before
your eyes, how low ſome have
fallen from high profeſſions, and
how ſhamefully the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
perſons have miſcarried,
tha were lifted up, and put to the
tryal of ſuch temptations of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
as they had never been
uſed to before? O pitty thoſe
that have ſuch dangerous tryals
to paſs through, and be thankful
that you ſtand on ſafer ground;
and do not cruelty envy them their
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48274:131"/>
perils, nor reproach them for their
falls, but pray, and daily pray for
their recovery.</p>
                  <p>6. Conſider, this ſpeaking evil
of thoſe by whom you ſuffer, hath
too much of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi>
nature in it, to be good. If
<hi>another</hi> ſuffered as you do, and you
were advanced as another is, would
you not ſpeak more mildly then?
Or if not ſo, yet the proneneſs of
nature to break out into reviling
words, though it were for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and for God, doth intimate to
you that it hath a ſuſpicious root.
Do you find it as eaſie to be meek
and patient, and forgive a wrong,
and love an enemy? Take heed
leſt you ſerve Satan in vindicating
the cauſe of God. Its an unfit
way of ſerving God, to do it by
breaking his Commands. Read
ſeriouſly the deſcription of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,
hurtful, ſoul-tongued
zeal, in <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. and then tell me
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48274:132"/>
what thanks Chriſt will give
you for it. The two great Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> thought it
would have notably honoured
Chriſt, and curbed the raging
Spirit of the ungodly, if he would
have let them call for fire from
heaven, to conſume a Town that
refuſed to receive him. But doth
Chriſt encourage their deſtroying
zeal? No: but he tells them, <hi>Ye
know not what ſpirit ye are of.]</hi>
They little knew how unlike to the
tender merciful healing Spirit of
Chriſt, that fiery hurting ſpirit
was, that provoked them to that
deſire! nor how unpleaſing their
temper was to Chriſt. This is the
very caſe of many thouſand Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
that are yet young, and
green, and harſh, and have not
attained to that mellowneſs, and
ſweetneſs, and meaſure of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that is in grown experienced
Chriſtians. They think their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48274:132"/>
and deſires of ſome plagues
on the contemners of the Goſpel,
are acceptable to God, (and blame
the charitable as too cold:) when
they little know what ſpirit it is
that raiſeth that ſtorm in them,
and how unlike, and unacceptable
it is to Chriſt. Were you as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to ſerve all others in love, and
to ſtoop to their feet for their
ſalvation, and to become all things
(lawful) to all men, that you may
win ſome, this ſaving zeal would
be pleaſing to your Lord, who
comes to do the work of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
and not of the Souldier, to
<hi>ſave</hi> and not to deſtroy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
moſt approves of thoſe that
ſerve him moſt diligently in his
ſaving work.</p>
                  <p>7. Laſtly, conſider your paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and evil ſpeakings will but
increaſe your ſuffering, and make
it ſeem juſt, if otherwiſe it were
unjuſt. If you are not meek, you
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48274:133"/>
have not the promiſe of inheriting
the earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 5 If you
honour not your Parents or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
you have not the promiſe
that your <hi>daies ſhall be long in the
land.</hi> And your evil ſpeaking
will make men conclude, that you
would do evil if you could and
durſt. As its ſaid to be <hi>Zoilus</hi>
anſwer when he was askt, why he
ſpoke evil of <hi>Plato</hi> and ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

Give not occaſion for ſuch a

                  <p>[Finally, be ye all of one mind,
having compaſſion one of another:
love as brethren: be pittiful: be
courteous: not rendering evil for
evil, or railing for railing; but
contrariwiſe bleſſing, knowing that

<hi>Is it not lawful to call a spade a

of the hurtful crimes of others?</hi> I
anſwer. 1. Yes, when as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
a Miniſter, or a brother,
you have a juſt call to tell them of
it lovingly, though plainly, to their
faces, in order to their recovery.
2. And when you have a juſt call
to ſpeak of it to others, either in
ſeeking juſtice, or in charity and
mercy, for the preſervation of
thoſe that elſe will be more hurt
by the ſilencing of mens faults,
then you do hurt by mentioning
them.</p>
                  <p>But, 1. You may not ſlander
men as guilty of what indeed they
are not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:48274:134"/>
2. You may not make mens
faults ſeem worſe then they
are.</p>
                  <p>3. You muſt endeavour the
<hi>good</hi> of the perſon as much as you
can, while you blame the ſin.</p>
                  <p>4. You muſt not mention mens
faults without a call: unleſs the

                  <p>5. You muſt not do it with a

                  <p>6. You muſt manifeſt love and

                  <p>7. You muſt difference between
raigning ſins, and humane frailties:
and between a courſe of ſin, and an

                  <p>8. You muſt be more ready to

of the evil: and not maliciouſly

1. You make a <hi>Great</hi> matter of
a <hi>Little</hi> one. As there is not ſo
great <hi>good</hi> in the proſperity of the
fleſh, as worldlings think; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there ſo great evil in the

poverty, impriſonment, reproach

that all ſhall work together
for your good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</p>
                  <p>2. You make a <hi>ſtrange</hi> matter of
that which is the <hi>ordinary condition
of believers:</hi> To be hated of all
men; to have all manner of evil
ſpoken falſly of you: to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
from one City to another:
to be killed all the day long, and
counted as ſheep to the ſlaughter.
Do theſe ſeem <hi>ſtrange</hi> matters to
you? did you never read or hear
the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> nor know the terms
of Chriſt till now? did you never
read of forſaking all for Chriſt, if
indeed you would be his Diſciples?
did you never count what it muſt
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48274:135"/>
coſt you to be ſaved? did you not
renounce the world and the fleſh
in your Baptiſmal (oft renewed

think it not ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the fiery tryal, as if ſome
ſtrange thing happened to you:
But rejoyce, in as much as ye are
partakers of Chriſts ſufferings.]
And will you think ſo ſtrange of
ſmaller matters, as to think they
excuſe your impatience, and evil
ſpeeches?</p>
                  <p>BY this time you may ſee, if you
are willing to ſee, that all
among us that are not real Saints,
are Hypocrites, if they profeſs
themſelves Chriſtians and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God: and that miſerable
ungodly ſouls, that call ſuch <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi>
as are more diligent then
themſelves for their ſalvation, do
but diſcover their ignorance and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48274:136"/>
malignity, and condemn themſelves
in bewraying their hypocriſie,
while they reproach the practice
of the ſame Chriſtian Religion,
which themſelves profeſs; and
the obedience to that Scripture,
which they confeſs themſelves to
be the Word of God. All the
prophane, and unſanctified among
us, that call themſelves Chriſtians,
are certainly Hypocrites. And
for the godly, it is the very ſame
Religion, that is profeſt by them
and you: It is the ſame engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Vow that you all made
to God in baptiſm: And ſuffer
but reaſon impartially to tell you,
when two men have entred the
ſame Covenant, and one never
mindeth it ſo as to keep it; and
the other makes it his chiefeſt care;
which of theſe is liker to be the
diſſembler in his Covenant? When
two men profeſs themſelves the
ſervants of God, and ſuch as place
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48274:136"/>
their hopes in heaven, and one of
them makes a jeaſt of ſin, and
ſerveth the fleſh and the world
which he hath renounced, and
hates thoſe that diligently ſerve
the Lord; and the other maketh
it the principal care and buſineſs
of his life to ſerve and pleaſe him,
inſomuch as he is reproached for
it, as making more ado about it
then needs; which of theſe are
Hypocrites, and which are ſerious,
in the performing of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and living according to
their profeſſion? If two ſervants
promiſe to do your work, and one
labour as hard as he can, and the
other ſit down and deride him for
making ſo much ado, which was it
that plaid the Hypocrite in his
promiſe? If diligence in Gods
ſervice be a ſign of hypocriſie,
then promiſe-keeping is hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and promiſe-breaking is ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
And then you may transfer
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48274:137"/>
the caſe to God (who will be the
rewarder of them only that <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently</hi>
ſeek him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.) and
ſay that it is his faithfulneſs to
break his promiſes, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs
to keep them. But
who will ſpend words on ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
abſurdities? ſo groſs, that
the Devil would have ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a fool to vent them, if he had
not made his followers ſuch fools
as to believe them. But for the
faithful ſervants of the Lord, let
them know, that they muſt ſerve
him on ſuch terms: They muſt
live above the judgement and
reputation of this world; and be
content that God the ſearcher of
hearts ſhall be their Judge, who
knoweth both ſincerity and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie;
and will bring forth
their righteouſneſs as the light.
Chriſtians, you muſt not only <hi>be
ſincere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> but alſo patiently expect to
be <hi>accounted hypocrites,</hi> and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48274:137"/>
at as the only diſſemblers of the
world: You muſt not only <hi>be
honeſt,</hi> but patiently expect to be

only <hi>bewiſe</hi> and <hi>ſober,</hi> but patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to be <hi>called covetous,</hi> even though
you give away all that you have.
You muſt not only <hi>be chaſte and

to be defamed as incontinent
and licentious, and as Chriſt was
called, a wine-bibber, a friend of
Publicans and ſinners. A Miniſter
muſt not only lay out himſelf

that he hath on his Maſters work;
but alſo patiently expect to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
unfaithful, cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48274:138"/>
he doth not anſwer, and be

and that is, moſt, that have a <hi>ſelf</hi>
that ruleth at home, and therefore
they think ſhould be the Idol of
others, as it is their own: and
that are but unacquainted with
the reaſons of thoſe things that do
diſpleaſe them. Its little comfort
to us to do good, if we cannot bear
the eſtimation of doing evil, and
cannot loſe all the obſervation,
acknowledgement and applauſe of
man, as if we had never done the
good at all. It is far from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
perfection <hi>to be honeſt,</hi> and <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and <hi>ſincere,</hi> if we muſt <hi>needs</hi> be

cannot patiently be <hi>eſteemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt,
ungodly,</hi> and <hi>hypocritical;</hi>
and be <hi>judged worſt,</hi> when we <hi>are
beſt;</hi> what have the ſervants of
Chriſt loſt their lives for in flames,
and by other ſorts of torments, but
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48274:138"/>
for the <hi>beſt</hi> of their <hi>ſervice,</hi> and
<hi>greateſt</hi> of <hi>their piety</hi> and <hi>fidelity?</hi>
When dogs bark at paſſengers,
commonly it ſignifieth but two
things, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are perſons
<hi>that they know not,</hi> or <hi>that they
hate:</hi> but it is no ſign that the
perſons are bad, or poor, or ſick:
For be they never ſo bad and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
if <hi>they know them,</hi> and
<hi>love them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the dogs will not bark at
them. See that thou be not an
<hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and then it muſt be
accounted a ſmall matter by thee,
to be <hi>called an Hypocrite:</hi> yea if
perſons that fear God themſelves
ſhall ſo eſteem thee, it is no other
affliction but what thou muſt be
armed for, and patiently undergo.
Even from the godly through
miſtake, we oft ſuffer moſt for our
greateſt duties, and are cenſured
moſt for that which God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
moſt approve us for; and
loſe our reputations for that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48274:139"/>
which God would be greatly
offended with us if we did other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
As ever then you would not
prove your ſelves Hypocrites, ſee
that you look not for the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
reward, as Chriſt calls it,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 2. which is, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of men; be they good or
bad men, their overvalued ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
may be but the Hypocrites
reward. To be content and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
in doing well, and being
judged to do ill; and in being good,
and being judged to be bad, is the
property of him that is ſincere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
therefore to be unthankfully
requited, and reviled, and ſpit
upon, and buffeted, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
uſed and put to death, even
by thoſe whoſe lives and ſouls he
had with greateſt care and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion,
pittied, this was the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of love and ſelf-denyal that
was ſet us by our Lord. And
though we cannot reach his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48274:139"/>
and diſtempered Chriſtians
find much ſtrugling before they
can bring themſelves to patience,
under ſuch ingratitude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
uſage from the world,
eſpecially from their miſtaken fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
brethren, yet in ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
meaſure, it muſt be done.
For he that cannot ſerve God
without the Hypocrites reward, is
but an Hypocrite. If he will not
be a Chriſtian, obedient, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
diligent, faithful, for heaven
and the pleaſing of God alone, he
is not a Chriſtian indeed. And,
alas, what a pittiful reward is it,
to be thought well of, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
by the tongues of mortal
men? How few, were ever the
more holy by applauſe? but thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
have been hurt, if not undone
by it. Thou giveſt all thou haſt
to the poor: thou ſpendeſt thy
ſelf wholly, and all that thou haſt
for the ſervice of God, and the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48274:140"/>
good of others: Its well: it muſt
be ſo. But after all thou art
cenſured, ſlandered, vilified and
unthankfully, and unmannerly
uſed. And what of that! what
harm doſt thou fear by it? what
advantage thy pride and ſelfiſhneſs
might have taken, even by due
applauſe and thankfulneſs, its eaſie
to perceive: But now, the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is taken out of thy way: thou
art ſecluded from all creature-comforts;
and ſo art directed and
almoſt forced to look up to the
love of God alone: Now thou
haſt no other reward before thee,
its eaſier to look ſingly on the
Saints reward. When God hath
no competitour, to whom elſe
then canſt thou turn thy
thoughts? when all others abuſe
thee, it is eaſieſt to have recourſe
to him. When earth will ſcarce
afford thee any quiet habitation,
thou'lt ſurely look to heaven for
reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:48274:140"/>
Thus much I thought meet to
interpoſe here for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſincere, on occaſion of
the worlds unjuſt accuſations; and
ſo to perſwade them to be ſatisfied
in the portion of the ſincere. I
now return again to the ſelf-deceiver.</p>
                  <p>ANd here I ſhall conclude all
with theſe two requeſts to
you, which as one that foreſeeth
the approaching miſery of <hi>ſelf-deceivers,</hi>
I earneſtly intreat you,
for the ſake of your immortal
ſouls, that you will not deny me.
The firſt is, that you will be now
but as willing to try your ſelves, as
I have been to help you; and as
diligent and faithful when you are
alone, in calling your own hearts
to a cloſe examination, as I have
been to hold the light here to you.
O refuſe not; delay not, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48274:141"/>
your ſelves ſometimes from
the world, and ſet your ſelves as
before the eye of God, and there
bethink your ſelves whether you
have been what you have vowed
and profeſt to be! and whether
that God hath been deareſt to
your hearts, and obeyed in your
lives, and deſired as your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
who hath been confeſſed and
honoured with your lips? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
there, that God judgeth not as
man; nor will he think ever the
better of you, for thinking well of
your ſelves: and that there muſt
go more to prove your approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God, then commonly
goes to keep up your reputation in
the world. The Religion that
ſerveth to honour you before
men, and to deceive your ſelves,
will never ſerve to pleaſe the Lord
and ſave your ſouls. And the day
is at hand when nothing but God
can give you comfort, and when
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48274:141"/>
ſelf-deceivers will become ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
ſelf-tormentors. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
go willingly and preſently to
the Word, to your lives, and hearts,
and conſciences, and try your
ſelves, and try again, and that with
moderate ſuſpicion, that in ſo
great a buſineſs you may not be
deceived, and be ſelf-deceivers.</p>
                  <p>2. My ſecond requeſt is, that if
you do diſcover, or but juſtly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
your ſelves of hypocriſie and
ſelf-deceit, you would ſtick there
no longer, but preſently change
your <hi>vain Religion,</hi> your <hi>ſeemings</hi>
and formalities, for the power of
godlineſs, and ſincerity of heart.</p>
                  <p>But I ſuppoſe that ſome of you
will ſay, There lies the difficulty.
O that we could do it? But how
ſhould it be done?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; If thou be really
willing to be above Hypocriſie,
and a vain Religion, the cure is
half wrought at leaſt. And I will
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48274:142"/>
not tire thee now with many, but
help and try thee by theſe few
directions.</p>
                  <p>In general; Be but what thou
haſt promiſed and vowed to be in
thy Baptiſm, and what thou ſtill
doſt profeſs to be as a Chriſtian,
and it will ſerve the turn: what
that is, I have told you before.</p>
                  <p>More particularly. <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
renew thy Covenant
with God: and with a grieved
heart, bewailing that thou haſt
been a Covenant-breaker, give up
thy ſelf preſently to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son and Holy Ghoſt, as thy
Creatour, Redeemer, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,
thy Owner, thy Ruler, and
thy Father.</p>
                  <p>2. Renounce ſincerely the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
the World, and the Fleſh, and
be at a point with all below; and
quit all conceits and hopes of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
or reſt on earth: And abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
devote and reſign thy ſelf,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48274:142"/>
and all thou haſt to the will and
ſervice of thy Lord, without any
ſecret exceptions or reſerves. This
is the property and plague of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
that ſecretly they have
exceptions and reſerves in giving
up themſelves to God. They will
follow him, except it would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
them or undo them in the
world: he ſhall have all, provided
the fleſh may not be too much
pinched: that is, in plain Engliſh,
they take him not <hi>for God,</hi> but for
a <hi>ſecond</hi> to <hi>themſelves</hi> and the
<hi>world,</hi> and will give him but what
the fleſh can ſpare.</p>
                  <p>3. Fix the eye of a lively faith
upon God and upon the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
joyes, and there take up thy
whole reward, and look for no
other. Quit all expectations of a
reward from men. Let it ſeem a
ſmall thing to thee, what any
mortal man ſhall think or ſpeak of
thee; unleſs as Gods honour or
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48274:143"/>
intereſt is concerned in thine.
I have told you before, that he is
an Hypocrite that will not be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without the Hypocrites reward;
and that can ſail no further then
he is moved by the wind of mans
applauſe, or of ſome other worldly
end.</p>
                  <p>4. Stick not in any externals of
Religion, nor in notions and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
uneffectual opinions. So far
art thou Religious, as thy ſoul is
engaged unto God, and thy life
imployed for him: And ſo far
thou doſt truly worſhip him as
thy heart is drawn up to him in
love, and as thou doſt fear him,
admire him, truſt him, and take
thy pleaſure in him. Think not,
that it is a ſaving Religiouſneſs, to
be of ſuch or ſuch an opinion, or
ſuch a party, or ſuch a Church,
or to ſay over ſo many words of
prayer, or to keep a task of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
duties; or to be of a ready
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48274:143"/>
voluble tongue, in Preaching,
Prayer or Diſcourſe. Religion
lyeth in the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Indulge</hi> not thy ſelf in <hi>one
known ſin. Retain</hi> no <hi>groſs</hi> or <hi>will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
ſin: <hi>Plead</hi> for no <hi>Infirmity,</hi>
but make it the buſineſs of thy life
to extirpate the relicts of the body
of death. Be willing of the moſt
ſearching Word, and of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
reproof, and of all the help
thou canſt get againſt ſo dangerous
an enemy.</p>
                  <p>6. Stint not thy ſelf in any <hi>low</hi>
degrees of holineſs; but love, and
long, and ſtrive after the <hi>higheſt.</hi>
If thou bear a ſecret core of diſtaſt
againſt thoſe that outgo thee, it is
a mortal ſign. Thou muſt be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in deſire,</hi> or thou art <hi>not
ſincere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Walk alwaies as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the holy, dreadful, heart-ſearching
God: Remember that
he ſeeth thy ends, thine affections,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48274:144"/>
and all thy thoughts. Be the
ſame therefore in ſecret as thou
art in publike, ſincerely ſearch the
Word of God, and know what it
is that he would have, and that
reſolve on, if all the world ſhould
be againſt it. Unreſolvedneſs is
hypocriſie: and temporizing or
following the greater ſide, for the
ſecurity of the fleſh, is no better.
Never think thou canſt be too
holy, or too obedient. But make
it thy ſtudy to do God all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
that thou canſt, whatever
ſuffering or coſt it put thee to. Be
not aſhamed openly to own the
cauſe of Chriſt. In the preſence
of the greateſt, remember that thy
maſter is ſo much greater, that
they are worms and vanity to him.
Take heed of culling out the eaſie
and cheap part of Religion, and
laying by the difficult and dear.
Thy Religion muſt be as the <hi>heart</hi>
in thy breaſt, which is alwaies
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48274:144"/>
working, and by which thou liveſt;
which cannot ſtop long, but thou
wilt die. But the Hypocrites Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is like the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t</hi> upon his
head, for ornament and ſhelter
from the weather, and not for
life: in the night when none ſeeth
him he can lye without it; and in
the day he can put it off for the
ſake of a friend, and perhaps ſtand
bare in the preſence of a greater
perſon that expecteth it. So can
the Hypocrite too oft diſpenſe
with his Religion.</p>
                  <p>8. Be hearty and ſerious in all
thou doſt. Hear, and read, and
pray as for thy life. <hi>Sincerity</hi>
conſiſteth much in <hi>ſeriouſneſs.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thou art almoſt at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world! while I am ſpeaking
and thou art hearing, we are both
haſting to our endleſs ſtate. O how
ſhould men live on earth, that muſt
live here for ſo ſhort a time, and
muſt live for ever in heaven or
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48274:145"/>
hell: Theſe things are true, and
paſt all queſtion: and therefore
for your fouls ſake loſe not heaven
by trifling. Pray not in jeaſt, and
ſerve not God in jeaſt, and reſiſt
not ſin in jeaſt, leaſt you be damned
in good ſadneſs. When you are at
work for eternity, its time to do
it with all your might. O what
unconceivable mercies are now
offered you! O what an excellent
price is in your hands! and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is ſo likely to deprive you of
the benefit, as dreaming and dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when you ſhould be up and
doing; as if this were not your
buſineſs, but your play; and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and damnation were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of ſport. O do but ſet your
ſelves to the pleaſing of God, and
the ſaving of your ſouls with all
your might, and ply it with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
as your chiefeſt work, and
then you are out of the danger of
the Hypocrite. But if ſtill you
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48274:145"/>
will give the world the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
and your fleſh muſt be
pleaſed, and your proſperity ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
and God muſt have but
complements, or the leavings, your
miſery is at hand, and vengeance
ſhall undeceive thoſe hearts that
would not be undeceived by the
Word. And you ſhall remember
to the increaſe of your anguiſh,
that you were told this day, that
your <hi>ſeeming trifling</hi> Religion
would prove vain. But I beſeech
you, as you are men, as you love
your ſouls, diſmiſs us with ſome
better hopes; and now reſolve to
be downright Chriſtians. Which
as I have begged of you, I ſhall now
beg of God.</p>

                  <p>We ſhall begin with the firſt and

is a <hi>greater</hi> extraordinary difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that he tells us of as to the <hi>rich</hi>

promiſed to them that love him?
but ye have deſpiſed the poor. Do
not rich men oppreſs you, and draw

[The ground of a certain rich man

And when he would deſcribe a

                  <p>4. What men do more <hi>careleſly

as droans on other mens labours,
as if they <hi>owed</hi> nothing to <hi>God</hi> or
the <hi>Common wealth,</hi> but all to their
<hi>own fleſh.</hi> Their <hi>morning hours</hi>
which are moſt ſeaſonable for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
and holy addreſſes unto
God, and the works of their
calling, are perhaps conſumed in
exceſs of ſleep: The next are
waſted in long attiring and curious
adorning of their fleſh: from
thence they paſs to vain diſcourſe,
to needleſs-recreations, to eating
and drinking, and ſo to their vain
talk and recreations again, and
thence to the repleniſhing of their
bellies, and ſo to ſleep: And thus
the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>fool</hi> that Chriſt
deſcribeth in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 19. are
turned by them into <hi>deeds,</hi> and it
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48274:155"/>
is the language of their ſenſual
lives. <hi>[Soul thou haſt much goods
laid up for many years; take thine
eaſe, eat, drink and be merry.]</hi>
Sleeping and ſporting, and jeaſting;
and idle talking, and eating and
drinking, and dreſſing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing,
with worldly cares and
paſſions intermixt, are the very
buſineſs and employment of their
lives. Thus contemptuouſly do
they waſte their precious hours,
while God ſtands by, and time
makes haſte, and death draws near,
and their miſerable ſouls are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared,
and heaven or hell are
hard at hand; and <hi>this is all</hi> the
time of preparation, that ever ſhall
be allowed them. O do but look
on theſe diſtracted piteous ſouls,
that have but a ſhort uncertain
life to provide for a life that hath
no end, and ſee how they forget or
ſenſleſly remember the matters of
infinite concernment! ſee how
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48274:155"/>
they trifle away that time that
never will return! how they ſport
and prate away thoſe hours which
ſhortly they would recall, were it
poſſible, with the lowdeſt cryes, or
recover with the deareſt price!
When they know not but in a
laughter-or a merry jeaſt, their
breath may be ſtopped by an arreſt
from heaven, or juſtice may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
their miſerable unready
ſouls with the cards in their
hands, or the cup at their mouths,
when they have not the leaſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of being out of hell an hour,
and yet can ſell this time for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and baſely caſt it away on
toyes, which is <hi>all that ever they
ſhall have</hi> to prevent everlaſting
miſery, or to procure everlaſting
joy: ſtand by a while, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the diſcourſe of ſenſual
gallants, and mark how dayes and
weeks are ſpent, and then tell me
whether the <hi>proſperity</hi> of ſuch <hi>fools</hi>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:48274:156"/>
be not made the occaſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooling

                  <p>5. What men in the world do
<hi>live ſo ſenſual a life as rich</hi> and
<hi>proſperous worldlings</hi> live? The
difference between the ſanctified
and the unſanctified, the children
of God and of the Devil, is, that
one of them <hi>liveth after the Spirit,</hi>
and the other <hi>liveth after the fleſh,</hi>
as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. to <hi>ver.</hi> 14. you may
read at large. And how few of
theſe <hi>Dives'es</hi> do think the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <hi>I keep under my body and bring it

not how far the fleſh is their
enemy; or elſe (as they have ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally
renounced it) they would uſe
it as an enemy.</p>
                  <p>6. In their <hi>prosperity</hi> theſe fools
have not the wit to <hi>love or bear the
means of their preſervation</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</hi>
They have the <hi>ſoreſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies,</hi>
and are moſt impatient of
the <hi>remedies.</hi> They are in the
<hi>ſtream</hi> of temptations, and have
greater need of help then others;
and yet there is none that reject
it with more contempt and pride.
Plain-dealing Preachers which
honeſt humble ſouls delight in, do
ſeem intolerable ſawcy fellows to
theſe ſons of pride. If we tell them
but of the ſin that God hath moſt
plainly condemned in his Word,
or of the judgement which he hath
there denounced, and make the
moſt prudent and modeſt applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48274:157"/>
of it unto them, we ſeem to
wrong them, and ſtir up their
pride and enmity againſt us, and
provoke them to ſlanderous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminations
or revenge. It trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
them not to <hi>commit it,</hi> or to
<hi>keep it,</hi> but to <hi>hear</hi> of it: And
they take us to be <hi>more faulty</hi> for
<hi>admoniſhing</hi> them of it, then <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>
for being <hi>guilty</hi> of it.
Though we are by office the
Meſſengers of Chriſt, that will
tell them of it ſhortly to their
faces, and feareth not the proudeſt
ſon of <hi>Belial,</hi> yet are they too
ſtout to be admoniſhed by ſuch as
we, but reject our meſſage with
hatred and diſdain. And indeed
it is a wonder of mercy that the
prevalency of this impatient guilt
and malice, hath not ere this
turned plain and faithful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into ſome toothleſs formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or homilies, and ſilenced the
Preachers for the ſecurity of the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48274:157"/>
offendors; and expelled the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
leſt they diſpleaſe the ſick.
The Lord ſtill prevent it. If we
tell them with the greateſt cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but of the neceſſary truths,
without which a ſinful ſoul is never
like to be humbled or ſaved, we
are taken to be turbulent, and
injurious to the eaſe or honour of
theſe auditors. They <hi>muſt</hi> hear of
the neceſſity of regeneration and
holineſs, and of the weight and
worth of things eternal: and yet
they <hi>cannot bear</hi> to hear it. They
<hi>muſt</hi> have heart-ſearching, and
heart-breaking truths, in a ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
awakening manner brought
home to them, if ever they will be
ſaved by them: but they cannot
endure it. The Surgeon is into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
that would ſearch their
ſores: and yet there is no other
way to heal them. Alas the heart
of man is ſo hard, that all the skill
and induſtry of the Preacher can
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48274:158"/>
ſcarce ſufficiently ſharpen and ſet
home the truth that it may enter:
But nothing that is <hi>ſharp</hi> can be
<hi>endured</hi> by theſe tender ſouls. Such
language as Chriſt and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles uſed, doth
ſeem too rough for ſilken eares.
Their <hi>honour</hi> muſt not be blotted
with the mention of their odious
ſins, and deplorable miſery. To <hi>be</hi>
a <hi>glutton,</hi> or a <hi>drunkard,</hi> or a
<hi>wanton,</hi> or filthy <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rnicator,</hi> or a
malicious <hi>Cain,</hi> they can endure:
But to be told <hi>[Thou art the man]</hi>
though it be in ſecret, and with
love and tenderneſs, they cannot
bear. The Miniſter is thought to
wrong them that ſhall ſecretly and
faithfully admoniſh them, and tell
them truly what will be the end:
But Chriſt will execute all his
threatnings, and make them <hi>feel</hi>
what now they <hi>hear,</hi> and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
them to confeſs that he
doth not wrong them. We <hi>wrong</hi>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:48274:158"/>
them now, if we tell a Gentleman
of his impiety, and ſenſuality, and
pride, and of his vilifying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
time, and caſting it away on
cards, and idleneſs, and unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
talk: yea though he be ſo far
forſaken of common grace and
reaſon, as to hate and deride the
ſerious practice of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and the way that the God
of heaven hath preſcribed as flatly
neceſſary to ſalvation, yet cannot
he endure to hear of his enmity
againſt the Lord, nor to be told
that he beareth the image of the
Devil, while he is againſt the image
and Laws of Chriſt. Should we
but privately read a text to them
that condemneth them, they are
as angry with <hi>us</hi> as if <hi>we made</hi> the
Scripture which we read; and it
were not the Word of <hi>God,</hi> but
<hi>ours.</hi> If we tell them that <hi>[With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
holineſs none ſhall ſee God,]</hi> Heb.
12. 14. and that <hi>[Except they be
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48274:159"/>
regenerated, converted, and become
as little children</hi> (in humility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

enter into the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
Matth. 18. 3. Joh. 3. 3, 5, 6.
that <hi>[If any man have not the

the Kingdom of God,]</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9,
10, 11. Eph. 5. 3, 4, 5, 6. they
think we talk too preciſely or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly
to them. You would
think by their proud contempt of
his threatnings, and their boldneſs
and careleſneſs in ſin, that theſe
ſilk-worms did imagine they had
<hi>conquered heaven,</hi> and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
God were <hi>afraid</hi> to meddle
with them; or that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
his Laws and pervert his
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48274:159"/>
judgement for fear of diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or offending <hi>them.</hi> Little do
they think how many <hi>Dives'es</hi> are
now in hell. But methinks they
might eaſily believe, that their
honourable fleſh is rotten and
turned to common earth; and
that death will make bold to tell
<hi>them</hi> alſo, when their turn is come,
that they have been pampering but
a piece of clay; and that it was
not worth the loſs of heaven, nor
the ſuffering of hell, to ſpend ſo
much time and care and coſt to
feed up a carkaſs for the worms.
We muſt now ſubmiſſively ask
their leave, to tell them what God
hath ſaid againſt them. But God
will not ask them leave to make it
good upon the higheſt, the proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and ſecureſt of them all; <hi>[For

you endure to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>conſider</hi> of
theſe things? How then will you
endure to <hi>feel</hi> them? God will not
flatter you. If all your greatneſs
enable you not to repulſe the

the gout or ſtone; and all your
honour or wealth will not cure a
feaver, or eaſe you of the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake;
how little will it do to ſave
you from the everlaſting <hi>wrath</hi> of

which muſt ſhortly paſs on all that

7. Yea if there be any perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
raiſed againſt the Church of
Chriſt, who are the chief acters in
it, but the <hi>proſperous, blinded,
ſenſual great ones</hi> of the world?
The <hi>Princes</hi> make it their petition
againſt <hi>Jeremy</hi> to the King, <hi>[We
beſeech thee let this man be put to
death: for thus he weakeneth the
hands of the men of war—and
the hands of all the people in ſpeaking
ſuch words unto them: for this

people but the hurt,</hi> Jer. 38. 4. It

6. 5.] Were it not leſt ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious

and think I ſought to diminiſh the
<hi>reputation of Magiſtrates,</hi> while
I ſhew the effects of the <hi>proſperity
of fools,</hi> I ſhould give you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48274:162"/>
of ſuch lamentable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and tell you how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the <hi>great ones</hi> of the world
have in all ages ſet themſelves and
taken counſel againſt the Lord and
againſt his Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. and
ſtumbled upon the corner-ſtone,
and taken no warning by thoſe
that have been thus broken in
pieces before them. How ready is
<hi>Herod</hi> to gratifie a wanton dancer
with a Prophets head? In a word,
as Satan is called the <hi>Prince of this
world,</hi> no wonder if he rule the
<hi>men of the world, that have their
portion in this life,</hi> Pſal. 17. 14.
and can command his armies, and
engage them, and enrage them
againſt the ſervants of the Moſt
High, that <hi>run not with them to the
ſame exceſs of ryot,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 4.
And as <hi>James</hi> ſaith (as aforecited)
<hi>[Do not the rich oppreſs you, and
draw you before the judgement ſeats?
Do they not blaſpheme that worthy
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48274:162"/>
name by which you are called?</hi> Jam.
2. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>8. And in all this ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
how <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> and <hi>ſecure</hi> are
theſe <hi>proſperous fools?</hi> as merry
within a year, or month, or week
of hell, as if no harm were near.
How wonderful hard is it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them of their miſery? The
moſt learned, wiſe or godly man,
or the deareſt friend they have in
the world, ſhall not perſwade
them that their caſe is ſuch as to
need a converſion and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
change. They cannot abide
to take off their minds from their
ſenſual delights and vanities, and
to trouble themſelves about the
things of life eternal, come on't
what will; they are reſolv'd to
venture, and pleaſe their fleſh, and
enjoy what the world will afford
them while they may, till ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God ſurprizeth them with his
dreadful call, <hi>[Thou fool, this night

                  <p>II. I Should next ſhew you <hi>how
it is</hi> that <hi>proſperity</hi> thus <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth
fools.</hi> Briefly, 1. By the
<hi>pleaſing</hi> of their <hi>ſenſitive appetite</hi>
and fancy, and ſo overcoming the
power of reaſon. <hi>Perit omne ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium
cum res tranſit in affectum.</hi>
Violent affections hearken not to
reaſon. The beaſt is made too
headſtrong for the rider. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32
15. [Jeſurun <hi>waxed fat and kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
—then he forſook God that
made him, and lightly eſteemed the
rock of his ſalvation.] 2. The
friendſhip of the world is enmity to
God: and if any man love the world,
the love of the Father is not in him,</hi>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:48274:163"/>
Jam. 4. 4. 1 Joh. 2. 15. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the more <hi>amiable</hi> the
world appears, the more <hi>ſtrongly</hi>
it doth <hi>allure</hi> the ſoul to <hi>love</hi> it.
And to the <hi>proſperous</hi> it appeareth
in the moſt <hi>entiſing</hi> dreſs.</p>
                  <p>3. And hereby it taketh off the
ſoul from God. We <hi>cannot</hi> love
and <hi>ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> The
heart is gone another way when
God ſhould have it. It is ſo full
of love, and deſire, and care, and
pleaſure about the creatures, that
there is no room for God. How
can they love him with <hi>all their
hearts,</hi> that have let out thoſe
hearts to vanity before?</p>
                  <p>4. And the very noiſe and buſle
of theſe worldly things, diverts
their minds, and hindereth them
from being ſerious, and from that
ſober conſideration that requireth
ſome retirement and vacancy from
diſtracting objects.</p>
                  <p>5. And the ſenſe of preſent eaſe
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48274:164"/>
and ſweetneſs, doth make them
forget the change that's near.
Little do they think whats neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to comfort a departing ſoul,
when they are in the heat of pride
or luſt, or taken up with their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
and delights. In the midſt
of bravery and plenty, feaſting and
ſporting, and ſuch other enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
of the ſenſes, its hard
to hold communion with God,
and to ſtudy the life to come in
ſuch a Colledge or Library as this.
<hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> make men
<hi>drunk:</hi> and the tickled fancy
ſports it ſelf in abuſing the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
mind. And theſe frisking
Lambs, and fattened beaſts, forget
the ſlaughter: they think in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
there will be no Winter; and
their <hi>May</hi> will continue all the
year. Little do they feel the
piercing, griping, tearing thoughts,
that at death or judgement muſt
ſucceed their ſecurity and mirth.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48274:164"/>
O how hard do the beſt men find
it, in the midſt of health and all
proſperity, to have ſuch ſerious
lively thoughts of heaven, and of
the change that death will ſhortly
make, as they have in ſickneſs and
adverſit, when death ſeems near,
and deluding things are vaniſhed
and gone! The words of God
have not that force on a ſleepy
ſoul in the hour of proſperity, as
they have when diſtreſs hath
opened their eares. The ſame
truths that now ſeem common,
lifeleſs inconſiderable things, will
then pierce deep, and divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the joynts and marrow, and
work as if they were not the <hi>ſame</hi>
that once were laughed at or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded.
<hi>Eccleſ. 7. 2, 3, 4. It
is better to go to the houſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then to the houſe of feaſting;</hi>
(do you believe this?) <hi>for that is
the end of all men, and the living
will lay it to heart. Sorrow is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48274:165"/>
then laughter: for by the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the countenance the heart is
made better. The heart of the wiſe
is in the houſe of mourning, but
the heart of fools is in the houſe of
mirth.]</hi> I beſeech you take pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
your character and name
here from the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Moreover theſe</hi> fools <hi>are by</hi>
proſperity <hi>ſo lifted up with</hi> pride,
<hi>that</hi> God abhors <hi>them, and is as it
were</hi> engaged <hi>to</hi> abaſe <hi>them. For</hi>
[The Lord will deſtroy the houſe of
the proud,] <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 25. [Every
one that is proud in heart is an
abomination to the Lord: though
hand joyn in hand, he ſhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed,]
<hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 5. [He ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
the proud in the imagination
of their hearts: He hath put down
the mighty from their ſeats, and
exalted them of low degree: He hath
filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he hath ſent empty
away,] <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 51, 52, 53. [In

[For every one that exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſhall be abaſed: and he that
humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted,
<hi>Luk. 18. 14.]</hi> For God reſiſteth the
proud, but giveth grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
1 <hi>Pet. 5. 5.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. But no way doth their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
ſo deſperately precipitate
them, and make them the ſcorn of
heaven, and the foot-ball of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
contempt, as by <hi>engaging
them in oppoſition to the word, and
wayes, and ſervants of the Lord.</hi>
When it hath drawn them to thoſe
ſins which God condemneth, and
his Miniſters muſt reprove, and
hath puft them up with pride,
which makes them impatient of
his reproofs, and hath increaſed
their worldly intereſt and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and fleſhly proviſion, which
he commandeth them to deny,
this preſently <hi>involveth them in a
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48274:166"/>
controverſie with Chriſt,</hi> before
they are aware, and caſteth them
into the temptation of <hi>Herod</hi>
when he was contradicted in his
luſt; and they think they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to ſtop the mouths that
dare reprove them, and to keep
under the people, and doctrine,
and diſcipline of Chriſt, that are
ſo contrary to them, and croſs
them, and diſhonour them in their
ſin: and to pluck away this thorn
out of their foot, and caſt it from
them. And thus their proſperity
and carnal wiſdom that is imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſecure it, engageth the
earth-worms in a war with Chriſt:
and then you may conjecture how
long they can endure to <hi>kick
againſt the pricks,</hi> and irritate the
juſtice and jealouſie of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
and preſume to <hi>abuſe</hi> the
<hi>apple of his eye;</hi> and who will have
the better in the end? The ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is more able to reſiſt the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48274:166"/>
flames, and a fly to conquer all the
world, then theſe daring lumps of
walking clay, to conquer God, or
ſcape his vengeance. <hi>Iſa. 27. 4.
[Who would ſet the bryers and
thornes againſt me in battel? I
would go through them: I would
burn them together.]</hi> Iſa. 45. 9.
<hi>[Wo to him that ſtriveth with his
Maker: let the potſherds ſtrive
with the potſherds of the earth.]</hi> Job
9. 4. <hi>[Who hath hardened himſelf
againſt him and hath proſpered?]</hi>
They all <hi>imagine a vain thing,</hi> that
<hi>ſet themſelves and take counſel
together againſt the Lord, and his
anointed, to break his bonds, and caſt
away his cords from them. He that
ſitteth in heaven will laugh, the
Lord will have them in deriſion:
then ſhall he ſpeak unto them in his

                  <p>III. BEfore I tell you what <hi>uſe</hi>
to make of the Doctrine
of this text, I ſhall firſt tell you by
way of caution, what <hi>uſe</hi> you
ſhould <hi>not make</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>1. Though the proſperity of
fools deſtroy them, do not hence
accuſe God that giveth them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.
2. Nor do not think to
excuſe your ſelves. 3. Nor do
not think that riches are evil: for
the <hi>things</hi> are <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>mercies</hi> in
themſelves, and being rightly uſed,
may further their felicity. But it is
the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> of their
<hi>hearts,</hi> that thus abuſeth them, and
maketh <hi>good</hi> an <hi>occaſion</hi> of evil. I
may allude to <hi>Pauls</hi> words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48274:168"/>
the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7, 13.
<hi>[Are they ſin? or is that which is good
made death to them? God forbid. But
ſin, that it may appear ſin, worketh
death by that which is good: becauſe
they are carnally ſold under ſin.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Nor muſt you <hi>caſt away</hi>
your riches, or <hi>refuſe</hi> them when
offered by God. But take them as
a faithful ſteward doth his Maſters
ſtock, not <hi>deſiring</hi> to be overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
or endangered with the
charge, but <hi>bearing</hi> what is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
on you, reſolving to improve it
all for God. Not <hi>loving</hi> nor <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring</hi>
wealth, authority or honour,
nor yet ſo <hi>lazie, timerous</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtſul</hi>
as not to <hi>accept</hi> the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and charge, when God may be
ſerved by it. To <hi>caſt away</hi> or <hi>hide</hi>
your talents, is the part of an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
ſervant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Take heed leſt under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of contemning riches and
proſperity, you be tempted to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48274:168"/>
                     <hi>contemn your Governours,</hi> or to
<hi>ſpeak evil of dignities,</hi> or diminiſh
the honour of thoſe that are ſet
over us, whoſe honour is neceſſary
to the ends of Government, and
therefore to the peoples good.
Though <hi>James</hi> reprove the Church
for partiality in over-honouring a
man for a <hi>gold-ring</hi> or <hi>gay apparel,</hi>
yet doth he not go about to abate
the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>authority. Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,</hi>
and <hi>riches</hi> muſt be here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>6. Take heed leſt while you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
of the miſery of the rich, you
think to be ſaved meerly for being
<hi>poor.</hi> For <hi>poor</hi> or <hi>rich,</hi> if you be
<hi>ungodly,</hi> you muſt <hi>turn</hi> or <hi>die.</hi> God
doth not condemn men for their
<hi>riches,</hi> but their <hi>ſin:</hi> Nor ſave any
for their <hi>poverty,</hi> but their <hi>faith</hi>
and <hi>piety</hi> (through Chriſt.)</p>
                  <p>But the Uſes you ſhould make
of the Text are theſe.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Grudge not</hi> at the <hi>proſperity</hi>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:48274:169"/>
of ungodly men, but compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
them in their danger and
miſery.</p>
                  <p>2. Be <hi>not afraid</hi> of the <hi>proſperity</hi>
of the wicked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 16, 17, 18,
19. Its <hi>they</hi> that ſhould be <hi>afraid,</hi>
that have ſo <hi>low</hi> to fall.</p>
                  <p>3. Take heed that you <hi>deſire not
riches</hi> or <hi>proſperity:</hi> unleſs you
deſire that the way ot heaven
ſhould be made <hi>harder</hi> to you, that
is <hi>ſo hard</hi> already. Be <hi>contented</hi>
with <hi>food and rayment. Deſire</hi> but
<hi>your daily bread,</hi> unleſs as it is
needful for your Maſters ſervice,
and the relief of others.</p>
                  <p>4. Honour thoſe ever with a
<hi>double honour,</hi> that are <hi>great and
godly,</hi> that are <hi>rich and religious;</hi>
not becauſe they are <hi>rich,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are ſo <hi>ſtrong and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in grace,</hi> as to overcome ſuch
great temptations; and to be <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi>
in the midſt of <hi>earthly plenty,</hi>
and to be faithful ſtewards of ſo
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48274:169"/>
much. Religious faithful Princes
and Magiſtrates cannot eaſily be
valued and honoured too much.
What wonders are they in the
moſt part of the earth! what a
bleſſing to the people that are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by them! Were they not ſtrong
in faith, they could not ſtand faſt
in ſuch a ſtormy place. Where is
there in the world a more lively
reſemblance of God, then a <hi>holy
Prince</hi> or <hi>Governour,</hi> that liveth
no more to the fleſh then the
pooreſt, for all his abundance of
fleſhly accommodations, and that
devoteth and improveth all his
power, and honour, and intereſt, to
the promoting of holineſs, love
and concord?</p>
                  <p>5. Let <hi>great men</hi> have a double
intereſt in your <hi>prayers. They</hi> have
a <hi>double need</hi> of <hi>grace and help;</hi> and
<hi>we</hi> have a <hi>double need</hi> that they
ſhould be <hi>gracious.</hi> O think how
hard it is to ſave their faith, their
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48274:170"/>
innocency, and their ſouls, and to
ſave the Goſpel and the publike
peace in the midſt of ſo many and
great temptations. And therefore
pray hard, where prayer is ſo
needful.</p>
                  <p>And O that I were now able to
ſpeak ſuch enlightening and
awakening words to you, as might
ſhew you at once your <hi>worldly
proſperity,</hi> and the <hi>heavenly glory,</hi>
in their proper value! and that
God would now open your eyes
and hearts, accordingly to eſteem
and ſeek them. Gentlemen, will
you give this once an impartial
hearing, to one that <hi>envyeth</hi> not
your wealth, but foreſeeth the end
of it, and how it will forſake you,
and in how deplorable a caſe you
will then be found, if you have not
laid up a treaſure in heaven, and
ſecured the everlaſting riches. I
grudge you not your proſperity:
for <hi>God</hi> doth not grudge it you:
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48274:170"/>
yea the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf can afford it
you for a time, while you ſerve
him by it, and are captivated to
his will in theſe golden fetters. And
ſay not that it is I, that call ſuch
<hi>fools:</hi> you ſee <hi>here</hi> it is <hi>God,</hi> that
knoweth what he ſaith, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to ſpeak it. But let me
with due ſubmiſſion propound to
your ſober conſideration, theſe
Queſtions which your conſciences
are concerned to reſolve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Can any thing prove

and to admire a gilded poſt, or an

while the ſoul is under the wrath of
God, and in the gall of bitterneſs,
and bonds of its iniquity? and by
the noiſe, and buſineſs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

is not ſure of another hour, and

ſo great a work, as the ſecuring

women be courting, and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
and fooling away their
precious time, when the work is
undone for which they were born
into the world, and for which
they have their lives, and all their
mercies?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. Should all this be
done by thoſe that ſin againſt their
knowledge, and confeſs all this
while that the world is vanity,
and know how it will leave them,
and that all this is true?</p>
                  <p>O ſirs, it muſt needs be the grief
of a foreſeeing man, to think,
when <hi>you forget</hi> it, what a change
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48274:173"/>
is coming, and what a ſad prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
you are making, and how
little a while the muſick, the feaſt,
the cards and dice, the filthy luſts
and wanton dalliance will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue?
and what a damp of ſelf-tormenting
deſperation will ſeize
upon thoſe careleſs ſcornful
hearts, that now will not be
wakened and warned, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
any further then they ſee or
feel! In compaſſion to thoſe that
are paſſing hence to another
world, I beſeech you ſometime
withdraw your ſelves from ſenſual
divertiſements, and ſoberly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
you, whether <hi>this be</hi> the
<hi>place</hi> and <hi>company</hi> that you muſt
be with for ever? how long this
merry life will laſt! and whether
this be the work that the God of
heaven did ſend you about into
the world? and whether it would
be more comfortable to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
when time is gone, to think
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48274:173"/>
of your dayes of ſenſual delight,
or of a holy, and humble, and
heavenly converſation! and to
hear with <hi>Dives,</hi> Luk. 16. 25.
<hi>[Son, remember that thou in thy life
time receivedſt thy good things, and</hi>
Lazarus <hi>evil things: but now he is
comforted, and thou art tormented.]</hi>
O then you would wiſh that you
had never heard thoſe aery titles,
and never poſſeſt thoſe ſumptuous
houſes; nor never taſted thoſe
delicious feaſts; nor never worn
that gay attire; nor never known
that deceiving company; nor
been polluted and brutified with
thoſe beaſtly luſts! Then conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will force the now befooled
<hi>Dives</hi> to cry out, [O that I had
been the moſt deſpiſed man on
earth, while honour did befool
me? O that I had lain in medicinal
poverty and rags, when I took
this mortal ſurfeit of proſperity?
O that I had lain in tears and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48274:174"/>
when I was infatuated by
fleſhly mirth and pleaſure! and
that I had been among the Saints
that foreſaw and provided for this
day, when I drown'd the voyce of
Chriſt and conſcience, with the
laughter of a fool, and the noiſe
of worldly buſineſs and delights!]
O then how revengefully will you
befool your ſelves, that had time
and knew no better how to uſe
it! And how ſenſibly will you
juſtifie the wiſdom of believers,
that bent their care for things
eternal! I am aſhamed of my
heart, that melts not in compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the foreſight of your wo!
and that I beg not of you with

For many walk, of whom I have

Chriſt; whoſe end is deſtruction,
whoſe God is their belly, and whoſe

earthly things.]</hi> When the <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi>
of believers <hi>is in heaven, from
whence they look for the Lord their
Saviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe you are <hi>afraid</hi> of the
<hi>auſterities of Religion;</hi> and the
Devil would perſwade you, that
it is but a ſelf-tormenting, or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical
life, that we commend
to you under the name of <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs:</hi>
eſpecially when you ſee
the ſadneſs of ſome honeſt ſouls,
that are abuſed by Satan through
the advantages of melancholy. But
I muſt proſeſs, it is <hi>ſorrow</hi> that
I call you from and would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent:
It is no unneceſſary grief
that I would perſwade you to, but
to a life of heavenly peace and joy.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48274:175"/>
If Satan have abuſed any ſervants
of Chriſt, by darkening, and
troubling, and diſcomforting their
minds (which is his ordinary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
when he can no longer
keep men quiet, and careleſs, and
preſumptuous in their miſery;)
this is clean contrary to the nature
of Religion, and the commands
of Chriſt, that chargeth them
<hi>alway to rejoyce.</hi> Do you think
that I cannot have more ſolid joy
with my <hi>daily bread,</hi> in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of the <hi>love of God,</hi> and
the belief of his promiſes of eternal
life, then fooliſh mirth comes to,
that's likened to the <hi>crackling of
thorns</hi> in the fire? <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 6.
you</hi> are for <hi>mirth;</hi> and <hi>we</hi> are for
<hi>mirth:</hi> but its a hearty, ſolid,
ſpiritual, grounded, laſting mirth
that we invite you to: and its a
beaſtly ſenſual pleaſure that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
men deſire. For my part,
its almoſt half my work, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48274:175"/>
the joyes of true believers,
and to diſſwade them from ſuch
cauſeleſs deſpondencies and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
as would rob them of their

and thanks and praiſe. Had you
but taſted once the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this <hi>inward feaſt,</hi> and <hi>yours,</hi>
I ſhould need no more words with
you, to perſwade you that <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
is a life of <hi>joy.</hi> Dare any of
you ſay and ſtand to it, that there
is not <hi>greater matter for joy</hi> in
the love of Chriſt, then in the love
of a harlot? in the aſſurance of
ſalvation, then in lands and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips?
in the foreſight of heaven,
then in the company of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
voluptuous people, that
have not wit enough to be ſerious,
nor ſaith enough to foreſee that
which will ſo ſadly and ſpeedily
ſpoil the ſport? To be fooliſhly
merry in the midſt of miſery, doth
but make you the objects of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48274:176"/>
greater compaſſion. Be as merry
as you can, ſo it be grounded, and
durable, and cauſed by that which
God, and faith, and ſolid reaſon
will approve; and doth not tend
to greater ſorrows. Bethink you
well whether Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
lived not a more comfortable
life then you? And imitate them
in their way of mirth and ſpare
not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if you are unſanctified ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
worldly men, lay by your
mirth till you are fitter for it;
and take your portion from the
Apoſtle</hi> James 5. 1, 2, 3, 5. [Go
to now ye rich men; weep and howl
for your miſeries that ſhall come
upon you. Your riches are corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and your garments moth-eaten:

and the ruſt of them ſhall be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

on earth, and been wanton:
ye have nouriſhed your hearts as in
a day of ſlaughter.]</p>
                  <p>What pitty is it to ſee men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy

ſee them ſo eager for proſperity,
and ſo regardleſs of the proper

like the Bee that is drowned in her
own honey. And do not ſo
greedily deſire a greater burden
then you can bear: and to have
more to anſwer for, when you
have been ſo unfaithful in a little!
And if you believe Chriſt that tells
you how <hi>hardly rich men come to
heaven,</hi> and how <hi>few of them are
ſaved,</hi> long not for your danger,
and grudge not if you have not
theſe exceeding difficulties to
overcome. You would be afraid
to dwell in that air where few
men ſcape infection: or to feed

look not then for laced ſpeeches,
but will more patiently hear our

2. Then you will <hi>ſeem ſerious your

3. Then you have <hi>ſome better reliſh</hi>

and you would tell others
that its wiſer to <hi>be delighted in the
Law of God, and meditate in it day

as contemptuouſly of the honour,

for which we can never
(regularly) do too much. And
why are you not now of the mind
that you will be at death or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but that your ſolly doth
turn your proſperity to your

for the Lords ſake, retire from the

no hurt but what ſhall certainly
procure his good? 5. Nor any,
but what he may rejoyce in: and
is ſure ſhall be the matter of his
thanks when it is paſt? that ſhall
loſe nothing but what he hath
already forſaken, and eſteemeth
