            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63024:2"/>Since I overgrew that Religion which is taken up <hi>moſt</hi> on <hi>humane truſt,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing knowledge I increaſed mens diſpleaſure; and my judgement not falling juſt into the mold of <hi>any Sect</hi> among <hi>Church-dividers,</hi> there is ſcarce <hi>any Sect</hi> which doth not, according to their <hi>various intereſts,</hi> ſignifie their diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

Simple Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is <hi>my Religion</hi>: I determine to <hi>know nothing</hi> but <hi>Chriſt Crucified</hi> (and <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>) And I am paſt all doubt, that till <hi>ſimple Chriſtianity</hi> become the terms of <hi>Church-Unity and Concord,</hi> the <hi>Church will never ſee Unity or Concord,</hi> which ſhall prove <hi>univerſal</hi> or <hi>durable.</hi> So certain am I, that the Wits of the <hi>Learned,</hi> much leſs
<pb facs="tcp:63024:3"/>
of the <hi>Community of vulgar</hi> Chriſtians, will never arrive at the ſtature, of <hi>Concord, in numerous and difficult points</hi>: Nor the <hi>marvellous diverſity</hi> of <hi>Educations, occaſions, temperatures</hi> and <hi>capacities,</hi> be <hi>ever united</hi> in any thing but what is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And as Certain am I, that the <hi>Univerſal Conſcience</hi> of <hi>true believers</hi> will <hi>never unite,</hi> in any thing which is not <hi>evidently divine.</hi> And yet as certain am I, that the forſaking of the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> Acts 15.28. and of <hi>Pauls Deciſion,</hi> Rom. 14. &amp; 15. hath been the <hi>Engine</hi> of <hi>Church-Diviſions</hi> and <hi>many calamitous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions</hi> to this day: And that that <hi>bleſſed Prince</hi> who muſt have the honour and comfort of <hi>beginning</hi> the <hi>true heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> of the Churches, muſt pare off <hi>all their ſuperfluities,</hi> and leave them at beſt among their <hi>things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> and unite them on the terms of <hi>ſimple Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to <hi>Popery</hi> I have certainly
<pb facs="tcp:63024:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
found, that the Croſs <hi>Intereſts</hi> and <hi>Paſsions</hi> of Diſputers have made us (though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally too diſtant) to ſeem commonly about <hi>many Doctrinals more diſtant</hi> than indeed we are: And that it had been better with us, if ſuch men as judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Ludov. le Blank,</hi> had had the ſtating of our Controverſies at the firſt, that <hi>differing words</hi> and <hi>methods</hi> might not have paſſed with either ſide for <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable errors</hi> in the faith. I mean in the points of <hi>fore-knowledge, predeſtination, providence, predetermination, concurſe, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, free-will, univerſal Redemption, ſufficient Grace, effectual Grace,</hi> the <hi>nature of Faith, Juſtification, Sanctification, Merit, Good Works, Certainty of Juſtification,</hi> and of <hi>Salvation, Perſeverance,</hi> &amp;c. For my <hi>knowing this to be true,</hi> I am cenſured by thoſe on <hi>one extream,</hi> as too favourable to the Papiſts (being indeed an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to injury, calumny, uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or cruelty to any in the world.) But I am much more diſpleaſing to the
<pb facs="tcp:63024:4"/>
               <hi>Roman party</hi>; Becauſe I know, that <hi>One man</hi> is <hi>naturally uncapable</hi> of being the <hi>Monarch of all the world</hi>: That the <hi>King of Rome</hi> (as the <hi>Geographia Nubienſis</hi> calls him) was never by Chriſt made <hi>King of Kings</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords</hi>: That he <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was,</hi> nor <hi>can be</hi> a Paſtor at the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes,</hi> and over <hi>all the Earth,</hi> or as far as <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Candiſh</hi> did Navigate: That it<hi>'s</hi> a ſorry Argument, [<hi>Monarchy is the beſt Government</hi>: Ergo, <hi>An univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is beſt</hi>:] That the Government ſetled in <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> is for <hi>Princes</hi> to rule <hi>Churchmen and all,</hi> by the <hi>Sword,</hi> and the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of all <hi>particular Churches,</hi> to rule their <hi>Congregations</hi> by the <hi>Church-Keys,</hi> that is, by the <hi>Word,</hi> uſing <hi>Synods</hi> for due <hi>concord</hi> and <hi>corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency</hi>: And <hi>this much</hi> will do better than all the ſtir that the <hi>Clergies Ambition</hi> hath made in the world.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Dialogue</hi> cometh not to you, from an apprehenſion of any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary excellency of it, as if it did much more than is already done: but as extorted by mens neceſsity; <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe ſo many ignorantly turn Papiſts of late; <hi>2.</hi> And ſome are pleaſed <hi>to Say</hi> (I dare not ſay, <hi>To Think</hi>) that it is long of men in my condition; <hi>3.</hi> And it is the Art of the Papiſts (which our vanity encourageth) to ſeek to bring the old Books into oblivion (which are unanſwerable) and to call ſtill for new.</p>
            <p>The intended Uſe of this is, <hi>1.</hi> To tell thoſe that will diſpute with a Papiſt, on what terms and in what order to proceed, leſt they be cheated into a ſnare.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:63024:9"/>
               <hi>2.</hi> To teach the Ignorant Doubters truly to underſtand, wherein the difference between us and the Papiſts doth indeed conſiſt; that the talk of Sectaries Calling that which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth them, <hi>Popery,</hi> nor the ſcandal of our real or ſeeming diviſions, may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude them, nor Papiſts puzzle them by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to prove every word in our thirty nine Articles or other Writings.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> To Reſolve all that will be Reſolved, by <hi>Senſes, Reaſon, Scripture,</hi> or the <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and Tradition of the Church.</p>
            <p>Of the multitude of Reaſons againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery enumerated, I have here made good but one, by a ſpecial diſputation; becauſe I would not make the Book too big. The reſt I ſhall eaſily prove in another Volume, if greater work and ſhortneſs of life do not hinder it; (which I fully expect.) And leſt I have no more opportunity to anſwer their Charges againſt us on the other ſide, I have reprinted and added (Corrected) the firſt part of my <hi>Key for Catholicks,</hi> where it is long ago done, and never anſwered. There is extant
<pb facs="tcp:63024:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one Piece of theirs againſt me, unanſwered, called, Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s <hi>Rejoynder</hi> about the <hi>Viſibility of the Church:</hi> which I ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly profeſs I have left unanſwered, as ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unworthy of my precious Time, till I have no greater matter to do, which I hope will never be. And he that will well ſtudy his opening of the terms in the latter end, will ſee to how pitiful a caſe they are reduced. I conclude with this ſolemn Profeſsion, That I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the truth of what I write, and muſt dye ere long in the faith which I here profeſs, and lay my hopes of endleſs happineſs on no other way: And that I would joyfully receive any Saving Truth, from Papiſts or any other, who will bring it me, with ſuch evidence as may make it indeed my own. The Lord Unite us by <hi>Truth, Love</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <speaker>R.</speaker>
                  <p>Moſt eaſily: I pray you do but mark: 1. It is their principal Doctrine that the Pope is the Head of the Univerſal Church on earth; and that the Church ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to him, is the Univerſal Church; and that out of that Church there is no ſalvation; and that no one is a true member of Chriſt and his Church, who is not a ſubject of the Pope.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And they all confeſs that every one ſhall be ſaved that is a true Chriſtian, and keepeth his Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and that Loveth God above all. So that they muſt needs hold that none in the world but Papiſts, do truly Love God, &amp; keep that Covenant, and are true Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Now if you can know that you have the true Love of God, and are true to your Baptiſm, you muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that Popery is falſe, which ſaith that none Love God above all but Papiſts.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>D.</speaker>
                  <p>But what if I have not Loved God, and obeyed him, above my fleſh?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>R.</speaker>
                  <p>I'le tell you what followeth. 1. It is no wonder if you forſake the Proteſtants Religion, who never truly entertained it. If your <hi>Heart and Life</hi> were not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63024:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unfeignedly to God,</hi> you were <hi>no true Chriſtian,</hi> nor indeed had any true Religion at all: And he that hath no Religion, turneth from none which he truly had. If you were never a <hi>true Chriſtian,</hi> you were never a <hi>true Proteſtant:</hi> And then what wonder if you turn Papiſt? For you have no <hi>experimental Knowledge</hi> of that Religion which you ſeem to forſake.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And how could you expect better, but that God ſhould penally forſake you, and give you over to believe deceits, if you have dealt ſo falſly and deceitfully with him, as to live to the world and fleſh which you renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and neglect that God and Saviour and ſanctifier to whom you were ſo ſolemnly devoted? And if you have been ſo treacherous and unwiſe, as to prefer a bruitiſh tranſitory pleaſure, before Gods Love and the Joyes of Heaven?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And what honour is it to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that none but Infidels and falſe-hearted hypocrites, and perfidious breakers of their Covenant with God, did ever turn to them? If you turn Papiſt, you confeſs that you were a wicked hypocrite before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But the chief thing which I would tell you is, that turn up and down as oft as you will, to this Church or that Church, to this ſide or that ſide, you will never be ſaved, unleſs you become a <hi>holy, ſerious, mortified Chriſtian:</hi> As long as you love pleaſures, wealth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour more than God and Holineſs and Heaven, you ſhall never be ſaved, whether you be Papiſt, or a profeſſed Proteſtant. It would make the heart of a Chriſtian ake, to ſee ſo many thouſands cheated by the Devil, to take this opinion or that opinion, called <hi>the true faith,</hi> and this ſide or that ſide, called the <hi>true Church,</hi> to be to them inſtead of a <hi>holy heavenly heart and life.</hi> And how many thouſands, eſpecially Papiſts, that are truly of <hi>no Religion,</hi> do diſpute, and plot and diſquiet the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63024:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
world, as <hi>for Religion.</hi> To hear a prophane man ſwear that his Religion is right; or that man to think to be ſaved for being of the true Church and <hi>faith,</hi> whoſe heart was never ſet on Heaven, but liveth in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, lying, idleneſs, fornication, and thinketh that the Prieſts abſolution ſets all right again. Without true Holineſs no man ſhall be ſaved, what Church ſoever he joyn with; and with it no man ſhall be damned. For God cannot hate them that have his nature, and Image.</p>

                  <p>SIR, I am deſired by this perſon, who is brought by ſome of you to doubt of our Religion, to debate this Caſe with you in order to his ſatisfaction, <hi>Whether the Papiſts or the Proteſtants</hi> be the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Safe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>That is too large a Queſtion: We cannot diſpute of all our Religion at once: I will begin with you, about ſome one of the Articles of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> or the Viſibility of your Church in all Ages, or the Reſolution of your faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this I will do only on theſe conditions, 1. That you bring ſome expreſs Text of Scripture, which without your Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, Reaſonings or Conſequences, doth aſſert that Article of yours which I ſhall accuſe, or contradict any Article of our faith, which ſhall be queſtioned. 2. Or if you will go from the expreſs words to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, that we keep to the ſtricteſt Rules of Logick, and that you uſe nothing but Syllogiſm, and that all be done in writing, and not by word of mouth.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>R.</speaker>
                  <p>Neighbour <hi>D.</hi> you promiſed me to bring another kind of Diſputant: You hear his conditions: you ſhall hear my anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Caſe which you told me you were in doubt of, and deſired ſatisfaction in, was <hi>Which is the True
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63024:15"/>
and Safe Religion?</hi> This he refuſeth to Diſpute. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that we cannot diſpute of our whole Religion at once. But did you never hear him give any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt our Religion? If he have, Why can he not do it now? I expect not all in a word, but let him give them one by one, and ſay his worſt. I am ſure I can give you many againſt theirs: And we will after debate them particularly as largely as you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If <hi>Writing</hi> be it that you deſire for your ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I ask you, whether you have read all, or the fourth part, of what is written againſt Popery already. Have you read Dr. <hi>Challoner</hi> of the Catholick Church? Dr. <hi>White,</hi> Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> Dr. <hi>Downame</hi> of Antichriſt, <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> Dr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> Biſhop <hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Can you ſtay ſo long unreſolved without injury to your ſoul, till he and I have done writing? You cannot but know, that from Sheets we muſt proceed to the writing of Volumes, in anſwering each other, as others have done. And this is like to be many years work, for men that have other buſineſs: And how know you that we ſhall all Live ſo long?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Are you able when it cometh to tedious Volumes to examine them, and find who is in the right? Or will you not rather take him to conquer, who hath the laſt word? And it's like that will be the longeſt liver?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And as to a ſtrict ſyllogiſtical form, do you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that beſt? I avoid it not, but ſhall conſent to uſe it as far as you underſtand it. Do you know all the Logical forms of arguing, all Moods and Figures, and all the fallacies? Or do you not perceive, that you have broken your promiſe with me, and brought a

                  <speaker>D.</speaker>
                  <p>I muſt needs profeſs, that the Queſtion which I would have debated, is, <hi>Which is the True and Safe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</hi> And that it is not tedious writings, nor long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, but preſent conference which muſt ſatisfie me. And that it is plain Scripture and Reaſon that muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie me, who underſtand not Logick. I pray let me hear your own <hi>Conditions</hi> which you think more juſt.</p>

                  <p>The Conditions which the nature of the Cauſe directeth us to, are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That we firſt truly ſtate the queſtion to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed: For we cannot diſpute till we are agreed of what: That is, 1. That we agree what we mean by our [<hi>Religion</hi>]; and 2. That I tell you, what is the Religion of Proteſtants, which I undertake to defend: And that he tell us what is the Religion of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, which muſt be compared with it.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That our Conference conſiſt of theſe ſeveral parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That premiſing the principles in which we are agreed, I tell you the Reaſons why you ſhould not be a Papiſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he tell you the Reaſons why you ſhould turn Papiſt, or what he hath againſt Our Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That then <hi>we</hi> come to diſpute theſe Reaſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly: where I will prove <hi>my</hi> charges againſt them, and he ſhall prove <hi>his</hi> charges againſt us one by one.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. And that in all our diſputes, we ſhall conſent, 1. Not to interrupt each other in ſpeech; but if the length ſeem to overmatch the hearers memory, we will take brief Notes to help our memories, as we go, and crave the recitation of what ſhall be forgotten: For the ſtrength of Truth lyeth ſo much in the connexion of its parts, that when it is mangled into ſcraps by uncivil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63024:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is deformed and debilitated and cannot be well underſtood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we bind our ſelves by ſolemn promiſe, to ſpeak nothing which we unfeignedly judge not to be truth, nor any thing deſignedly to hide or reſiſt the truth which we diſcern.</p>
                  <p>Theſe terms are ſo juſt and neceſſary, that I will avoid him as a fraudulent wrangler who will deny them. For I come not to ſcold, nor to try who hath the ſtrongeſt Lungs, the nimbleſt Tongue, or the lowdeſt voice, or the greateſt confidence, or fierceſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but to try who hath the truth, and which is the true way to Heaven. For the ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive; eſpecially about words and barren notions; for that doth but tend to increaſe ungodlineſs.</p>

                  <p>For 1.

                  <p n="1">1. Their Uſe is to ſignifie how the Conjunct Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors who uſe them do <hi>underſtand</hi> the Holy Scriptures in <hi>thoſe points:</hi> And that partly for the ſatisfaction of all <hi>forreign Churches,</hi> who may hear us accuſed of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie or Error; and partly to be a hedge to the Doctrine of <hi>young Preachers,</hi> to <hi>keep</hi> them from vending miſtakes in the Churches, and alſo to <hi>try the ſoundneſs</hi> of their underſtandings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

E. g.</hi> My Religion is, that <hi>our God is only the true God.</hi> If now I ſay alſo, that <hi>Hercules</hi> is not God, and <hi>Bacchus</hi> is not God, and <hi>Venus, Mars, Mercury, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Neptune, Pluto, Ceres, &amp;c.</hi> are not Gods; is this a <hi>new Religion,</hi> or an <hi>addition</hi> to the former?

                  <p>Obſerve I pray you, that <hi>Popery</hi> is <hi>againſt my Religion,</hi> that is, againſt <hi>much</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>; and therefore <hi>my Religion is againſt Popery.</hi> But I will not quarrell with you about words: When God hath Revealed to us his <hi>Will,</hi> and the Papiſts add their corrupting inventions, <hi>Gods Revealed Will is my Religion</hi>: your <hi>Corrupting additions</hi> are contrary to it: Call my rejecting ſuch <hi>Corruptions</hi> and <hi>additions,</hi> by the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>my Religion</hi> Reductively (as <hi>Nihil</hi> is <hi>objectum Intellectus, &amp; Malum Voluntatis</hi>; and as <hi>non-agere</hi> is part of obedience); or Call it <hi>no part of my Religion</hi> in the <hi>primary notion,</hi> but a <hi>Rejecting of its contraries</hi>; ſo we underſtand each other I care not.</p>

is included in the ſenſe of an Affirmative: But your <hi>remoter additions,</hi> are contrary to our Religion, but not ſo directly.

Now to ſay, that it is none of my Religion to deny your Negative, who ſay <hi>There is no bread,</hi> would import that It is none of my Religion which affirmeth that <hi>there is bread.</hi> Contradictions cannot both be true: Properly that word that ſaith <hi>There is bread</hi> is my Religion: But this word contradicteth you that ſay <hi>There is none.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in another inſtance; my Religion ſaith, that <hi>The Righteous ſhall go into life everlaſting,</hi> and <hi>the reſt to everlaſting puniſhment</hi>; and tells us of a <hi>Heaven and Hell only</hi> hereafter: And you tell us of <hi>Limbus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum &amp; Infantum,</hi> and of <hi>Purgatory:</hi> The Scripture en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth us by conſequence to confute this: but if it did not, it were enough for me to ſay, <hi>It is none of my Religion,</hi> becauſe not Revealed by God in <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Scripture</hi>; And as it is <hi>your Addition,</hi> ſo to <hi>deny</hi> it, is not <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>properly my Religion</hi> it ſelf, but the <hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of my Religion. God tells us in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that <hi>He created Heaven and Earth.</hi> If one ſhould aſſert as from God, that God created <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Heavens and ten thouſand Earths,</hi> this is a <hi>faith</hi> of his own invention or addition, and it is enough for me to ſay, <hi>I have no ſuch faith</hi>; becauſe God revealeth no ſuch thing.

                  <p>However, I appeal to any that have not been diſputed out of their wits, whether, If God would give us as full a <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and Hell, and Angels and Bleſſed ſouls, as we have of the Bread and Wine before us, and as full a <hi>Hearing</hi> of all that they ſay, in juſtification of Holineſs, or Lamentation of ſin, and as full ſenſible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the world we go to, and our title to it, as we have with this world, I ſay, whether this would not be more aſcertaining and ſatisfactory to us, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all doubts, more than our preſent <hi>faith</hi> doth? I love not to hear men <hi>lie as for God,</hi> and talk and boaſt againſt <hi>their experience,</hi> as if the intereſt of faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it. Things revealed to faith <hi>Are Certain and Infallible.</hi> But that is becauſe we have <hi>certain evidence</hi> 1. That <hi>God cannot lie</hi>; 2. And that <hi>God revealed them</hi>; and ſo that they <hi>are True.</hi> But if we did <hi>ſee, feel, taſte,</hi> &amp;c. we ſhould be <hi>more certain.</hi> Elſe why is it ſaid, that we <hi>now know but enigmatically</hi> and as <hi>in a glaſs</hi>; and as <hi>children</hi>; but hereafter <hi>ſhall ſee as face to face, and know as we are known, when faith is done away,</hi> as being more Imperfect than <hi>Intuition.</hi> We have <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> to <hi>prove,</hi> that the Revelation made to <hi>David, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Peter, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. were of God, and that their <hi>words</hi> are by us to be believed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to ſee, hear, taſte, feel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be a more <hi>quieting Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore when all <hi>the ſound ſenſes of all men liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> perceive after conſecration, that there is <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> this <hi>Certainty</hi> is, 1. in order <hi>antecedent to that of faith,</hi> and 2. by <hi>Evidence, more ſatisfying</hi> and aſſuring

But you cannot make your doctrines hang together. 2. And they that are Baptized in Infancy are baptized into the ſame faith which they continue in at age.

               <p>With many Papiſts confident and vehement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations go inſtead of Arguments, and we oft hear them ſay, [<hi>If this be not true, I am content to be torn in a thouſand pieces: We will ſeal it with our blood: We will lay our ſalvation on it: And do you think we have not ſouls to ſave? &amp;c.</hi>] Which is much like as if they would end all Controverſies by <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wagers</hi> that they are in the right, or by <hi>proteſting</hi> that they are <hi>honeſter and credibler men</hi> than their adverſaries: And it is no more than a Quaker or other ſuch Sectary will ſay: the moſt proud and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant being uſually the moſt confident: But yet though I expect not that you ſhould receive any thing from me, upon <hi>Proteſtations,</hi> but upon <hi>Proofs,</hi> I will here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you that I will charge nothing on the Papiſts, but what in my Conſcience I am verily perſwaded to be true.</p>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Their Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is ſo <hi>notoriouſly falſe</hi> and <hi>inhumane,</hi> even contrary to the fulleſt aſcertaining evidence that mankind can expect on earth, (<hi>viz.</hi> for all men on pain of damnation to believe, that there is <hi>no Bread,</hi> and <hi>no Wine,</hi> when all the ſoundeſt ſenſes of any men in the world, do perceive Bread and Wine, by <hi>ſeeing</hi> it, <hi>taſting</hi> it, <hi>feeling</hi> it, <hi>ſmelling</hi> it, and by the <hi>notorious effects</hi>; and all this built upon <hi>no Revelation of God, no Reaſon</hi> at all, nor any true <hi>conſent</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> but <hi>clean contrary to them all</hi>;) that I ſolemnly profeſs, that I find it an <hi>utter Impoſſibility</hi> to believe it: And it often puts me to a doubt, Whether it be poſſible for any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man unfeignedly and fully to believe it, and Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be <hi>really any ſuch Papiſt in the world:</hi> or Whether moſt do not for carnal reſpects take on them to believe it, when they do not; or rather the Vulgar underſtand their words, as not really excluding the true being of <hi>Bread and Wine</hi>; and the reſt only ſomewhat overawing their own reaſon with a reverence of their Church, ſo far as not to <hi>contradict,</hi> or ſo far as <hi>noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally</hi> to own it, when they do not from the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the thing.</p>
            <p>So many contradictions, abſurdities, and impieties are to be by them believed with it, that I am ſure no man that underſtandeth them, can poſſibly believe them all.</p>
            <p>And all this muſt be done by <hi>Miracles, ſtupendious miracles, daily</hi> or <hi>common miracles,</hi> which <hi>every Prieſt</hi> can do at <hi>his pleaſure,</hi> and <hi>never fail, ſober</hi> or <hi>drunken,</hi> greater than raiſing a man from the dead; ſo
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63024:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that every beaſtly, ſordid, ignorant Prieſt, ſhall do more miracles by far, than ever Jeſus Chriſt did in all his life on earth, as far as we know by the holy Records, (if he live as long). He that can believe all this, may next believe, that there is neither Earth under his feet, nor the Firmament over his head, nor Water, nor Air, nor any other Creature, and that he hath no <hi>being</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> The Faith or Religion of the Papiſts, as deſcribed by themſelves, is ſo far from Infallibility, as that it is utterly uncertain, unintelligible, and meer contradiction and confuſion; and a changeable thing; ſo that no man knoweth whether he have it or not, and whether he have it all; But whoever hath it, he hath certainly a hodge-podge of truth and falſhood.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Their Papacy, which eſſentiateth their Church, is a horrid Uſurpation of Chriſts own Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and of an Office to do that which is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably above the Natural Power or Capacity of any mortal man; even to be the Apoſtle and Governour of the whole world (of Chriſtians at leaſt); To take Charge of all the ſouls on earth; to teach and call thoſe that are uncalled, and to Rule thoſe that are baptized: even at the Antipodes, and in all thoſe unknown or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible parts of the world, which he hath no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of: A far more arrogant undertaking, than to be the Civil Monarch of all the earth; and utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to perform, and which never was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:63024:44"/>IV. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The ſaid Papacy is an arrogant U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation of the Power of all the Chriſtian Princes and Paſtors upon earth, or of a Power over them, never given by Chriſt: It ſetteth up a Kingdom in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and taketh from Paſtors the power which Chriſt gave them, over their particular flocks.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The ſaid Papacy is a meer humane Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: They confeſs themſelves, that it is not of Divine faith that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is St. <hi>Peters</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor by Divine Right: It is no article of their <hi>own faith:</hi> But Hiſtory fully aſſureth us, that it was but in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop was made Supream: as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> And that he ſtandeth on the ſame <hi>humane</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as the <hi>other four Patriarchs</hi> of the Empire did.

But they abuſe the world, and claim that power <hi>over all the Chriſtians on earth,</hi> which <hi>one Prince</hi> gave his ſubject-Prelates <hi>in his Empire:</hi> As if the <hi>General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>France</hi> ſhould pretend to be a <hi>General Council</hi> of <hi>the world,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſhould call himſelf Archbiſhop of all the Church on earth, and claim the government of it.</p>

And <hi>Tradition</hi> condemneth them to this day, while they plead Tradition.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> It is Treaſon againſt Chriſt for the Papiſts who are but a <hi>Sect,</hi> and not the third part of the Chriſtians in the world, to call themſelves the <hi>whole Church,</hi> and unchurch all the reſt, and ſeek to rob Chriſt of the far greateſt part of his Kingdom, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them to be ſuch: As if they would deny two third parts of this Kingdom to be the Kings. They are Sectaries and Schiſmaticks by this arrogant dividing from all the reſt, and appropriating the name and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Church to themſelves alone.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> By making an <hi>unlawful</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible Condition</hi> and Center of <hi>Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> they are the <hi>greateſt Schiſmaticks</hi> in all the world: The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Dividers</hi> of the Church upon pretence of <hi>

            <p n="9">
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:63024:45"/>IX. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> They ſtudiouſly brand themſelves with Satans mark of malice, or uncharitableneſs and cruelty to mens ſouls: while they ſentence to <hi>damnation two third parts</hi> of the Chriſtian world, becauſe they will not be the ſubjects of their Pope: And they think their way to Heaven is ſafeſt, becauſe they are bolder than us in damning other Chriſtians: Whereas <hi>Love</hi> is the mark by which Chriſts Diſciples muſt be known to all.</p>
            <p n="10">X. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> They are inhumanely <hi>cruel to mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:</hi> And this is their very Religion: For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at the <hi>Laterane</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> the third decreed, that thoſe that believe not, or deny Tranſubſtantiation are Hereticks, and all Temporal Lords ſhall exterminate them from their Dominions: That is, no man ſhall be ſuffered to live under any Chriſtian Lord, that will not renounce all his ſenſes, and profeſs that he believeth that they are all deceived by God himſelf; which is not only to renounce their <hi>Humanity,</hi> but their <hi>Animality</hi> or ſenſe it ſelf. So that <hi>no men indeed,</hi> are to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to live, but only ſuch as <hi>deny themſelves to be men:</hi> What Heathens, what Turks, did ever exerciſe ſuch Inhumane fury? Beſides their burning and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men as Hereticks that will not do all this and more, and will not ſay as they require them.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> Their Church <hi>indeed</hi> is <hi>inviſible,</hi> while they deny it, and an unknown thing: For, 1. Men are forced into it by ſuch bloody Laws, as that they cannot rationally be known to be <hi>Conſenters:</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:63024:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. And they have <hi>no certain faith</hi> to <hi>conſtitute</hi> a Church-member: For they hold that his obligation to believe, is according to his <hi>inward and outward means,</hi> of which no man can poſſibly judge: And ſo no man can know whether <hi>himſelf</hi> or <hi>another</hi> have <hi>that faith</hi> which is required as neceſſary to ſalvation. And many of them ſay, That they <hi>that believe not in Chriſt,</hi> have <hi>ſaving faith,</hi> and <hi>are in the Church,</hi> if they had not ſufficient means.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> The Papacy doth intolerably tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over Kings, and teach ſuch Doctrines of Perjury and Rebellion, as their very Religion, as is not in the practice of it to be endured in any Kingdom; nor dare they fully practiſe it: The Crowns and Lives of Princes being at the mercy of the Pope; As the ſaid <hi>Laterane</hi> Council ſheweth.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> Their <hi>Church</hi> is oft <hi>Eſſentially unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, heretical and wicked,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> is often ſo, who is an <hi>Eſſential part</hi> of it: And therefore it is not the <hi>holy Catholick Church.</hi> General Councils have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination judged their Popes to be <hi>Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Adulterers, Murderers, Simoniſts,</hi> yea, guilty of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> or <hi>Infidelity</hi> it ſelf. And the <hi>Church</hi> cannot be <hi>Holy,</hi> whoſe <hi>Eſſential part</hi> is ſo unholy.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> Their Churches <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> is ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly <hi>interrupted,</hi> and their Papacy ſo often alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in its cauſes, as that it is become a confounded and a meer <hi>uncertain</hi> thing.

Hereticks, Simoniſts, Murderers, Sodomites, Adulterers have poſſeſſed the Seat, who were therefore <hi>uncapable,</hi> that the line of ſucceſſion muſt needs be interrupted by them.

            <p>And alſo <hi>de individuo</hi> there have been long two or three Popes at once, and conſequently two or three Churches: And to this day none knoweth which was the right.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> They plead for a Church which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a being in the world; that is, <hi>All Chriſtians Headed by one Pope</hi>; When <hi>all the Chriſtian world</hi> did never take him for their Head, nor were governed by him to this day.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> They dreadfully injure the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> as if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and all the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in all thoſe Sacred Records, had not had <hi>skill</hi>

or <hi>will</hi> to ſpeak <hi>intelligibly,</hi> and <hi>plainly</hi> to deliver us the doctrines neceſſary to ſalvation: But they make their <hi>Voluminous Councils</hi> more <hi>intelligible</hi> and <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>; as if they had done better than Chriſt and his Apoſtles: And when men muſt only <hi>Diſcern Gods Laws,</hi> and <hi>Judge Cauſes by the Law,</hi> they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Judges of the Law it ſelf,</hi> that is, of God the Judge of all, and of the Law by which they muſt be judged.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> There is no other Sect of Chriſtians under Heaven which hath ſo many differences among themſelves, or have written ſo many Books againſt one another as the Papiſts: And though many of them are of great importance, yea, ſome are about the very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Conſtitutive Head of their Church, yet have they no handſomer way to palliate all by, than by ſaying that theſe are but <hi>Opinions,</hi> and no <hi>Articles of faith,</hi> and the Infallible Judge <hi>dare</hi> not decide them: No though it be diverſity of <hi>Expoſitions</hi> of <hi>Gods own Word,</hi> yet Commentators ſtill differ without any hope of a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as if <hi>Gods Word</hi> were not to be <hi>believed,</hi> but were only the matter of <hi>uncertain Opinion,</hi> till the Pope and Council have expounded it, and no more Scripture is <hi>de fide</hi> than they expound.</p>

And as Repentance is the great evidence of the pardon of ſin; ſo <hi>Impenitency</hi> is that mortal ſign of an unpardoned ſoul, without which no ſin doth qualifie the ſinner to be Excommunicated by man, or damned by God: And a ſin <hi>materially leſs, is more Mortal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented</hi> of, than a greater truly lamented and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</p>

For it is a part of Popery to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that none are in a ſtate of ſalvation, but the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Pope,</hi> or members of the Papal Church; And conſequently that no others have true Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance

or Love to God: Or elſe that God is falſe in promiſing ſalvation, to all that have true Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Love to God. All therefore that know their own hearts to be truly devoted to God, are ſafe from Popery; And ſeeing it is agreed on both ſides, that none can or ought to turn Papiſts but <hi>ungodly hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> (or Knaves) no wonder if ſuch are deluded by the moſt palpable deceits, and forſaken of God whom they perfidiouſly forſook.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> I. Becauſe that <hi>humane nature</hi> is ſo formed, that the <hi>Intellect</hi> hath no other way of <hi>perceiving things ſenſible,</hi> but as they are firſt perceived by the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and by it tranſmitted to the <hi>Intellect</hi> (or made its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects): And if about <hi>Spirits</hi> it hold not, that <hi>There is nothing in the Intellect, which was not firſt in the ſenſe:</hi> yet about <hi>things ſenſible,</hi> it doth undenyably hold: And alſo that the <hi>Intellect of it ſelf</hi> is not <hi>free</hi> to perceive things ſenſible otherwiſe than as they are <hi>ſenſed,</hi> or not to perceive them; but is <hi>naturally neceſſitated</hi> to perceive them. So that it is a contradiction for a man to be a man, conſiſting of a <hi>reaſonable ſoul,</hi> with <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive faculties</hi> and a body, and yet not to be formed to judge of <hi>things ſenſible</hi> as <hi>ſenſe perceiveth them.</hi>

                  <p>Mad men are your fitteſt preſidents: But, 1. I told you how mans nature is made by God to judge of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63024:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things: I told you not that this nature may not be <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,</hi> and <hi>hindered</hi> from right action. Did I ever ſay, that the <hi>eye</hi> may not be <hi>blinded,</hi> or the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtracted? Blind men and mad men judge not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tendency of <hi>Nature,</hi> and therefore <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge.</hi> The Connexion of the Intellect to the ſenſe is eſſential to man as man; but ſo is not the <hi>ſoundneſs</hi> or right exerciſe of his faculties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> II. Hence I argue, that <hi>ſenſation</hi> and the <hi>underſtandings perception thereby,</hi> is the <hi>firſt perception</hi> of mans ſoul, and all that <hi>follow</hi> are but the <hi>rational improvements of it,</hi> and therefore ever <hi>preſuppoſe</hi> it: The natural order of the ſouls apprehenſions is this, beyond all controverſie. Firſt <hi>Senſe</hi> perceiveth <hi>things ſenſible,</hi> and the <hi>Imagination</hi> the <hi>Images</hi> of them. Next the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> by a <hi>ſimple perception</hi> conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of them as it findeth them in the <hi>imagination.</hi> Thirdly, then by this <hi>Thinking</hi> or <hi>Knowing,</hi> we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive alſo our <hi>own Act,</hi> that we do ſo <hi>Think</hi> or <hi>Know.</hi> And then Fourthly, We <hi>compound</hi> our <hi>conceptions,</hi> and form <hi>organical notions,</hi> and ſpin out <hi>concluſions</hi> from what we firſt perceive. Now if the <hi>firſt perceptions</hi> be <hi>uncertain</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> it muſt needs follow, that all thoſe <hi>following thoughts,</hi> and <hi>reaſonings</hi> which do but <hi>improve</hi> them, are at leaſt <hi>as uncertain</hi> and <hi>falſe,</hi> if not more. So that there can be no more certainty in any of the <hi>Concluſions</hi> as ſuch, than there is in the <hi>premiſes</hi> and <hi>principles.</hi> Therefore if mans <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>moſt natural neceſſary</hi> perceptions are <hi>falſe,</hi> all the following actions or reaſonings of his mind muſt be no better. All being finally reſolved into theſe <hi>perceptions by ſenſe,</hi> there is no Truth or Certainty in mans mind at all, if there be none in theſe.</p>

                  <p>To make it good, do but firſt obſerve, 1. That <hi>Gods Eſſential Will</hi> or <hi>mind</hi> is not <hi>in it ſelf</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſeen by man; but known only by ſome <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this Revelation is nothing but ſome SIGNES: For there is nothing in the Univerſe of Beings, but GOD and CREATURES and the ACTS or Works of Creatures. Now it is not <hi>Gods own Eſſence</hi> which is the <hi>Revelation</hi> in queſtion. Therefore it muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>A Creature</hi> (or work of God), or an <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Work</hi> of a <hi>Creature.</hi> As the <hi>voice</hi> on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and that of Chriſt at his baptiſm and tranſfiguration, and the written Tables of Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were either the <hi>works</hi> of God immediately, and ſo created <hi>Signs</hi> of his mind; or elſe the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> and ſo <hi>Imperate Signs</hi> of his mind. Nor it is not the <hi>ordinarineſs</hi> or <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs</hi> of the way of <hi>making</hi> theſe ſigns, which maketh them <hi>currant</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>credible:</hi> For if God can make a <hi>Natural falſe ſign,</hi> he can make a <hi>ſupernatural falſe</hi> one, for ought any mortal man can prove. Only all the queſtion is, Whether it <hi>be indeed a ſign of the mind and will of God or not?</hi> Now the <hi>works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> are Gods <hi>Natural Signs,</hi> and his <hi>Natural objective Light and Law</hi>; as the perception of them is the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:63024:52"/>
or <hi>Active Light and Law of Nature: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> of God, theſe <hi>Natural ſigns</hi> do ſignifie or reveal <hi>plainly,</hi> and <hi>ſome things darkly:</hi> And ſo it is with <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural ſigns</hi>; As the <hi>written Tables,</hi> the <hi>voice</hi> of an <hi>Angel,</hi> the <hi>words</hi> of an <hi>inſpired Prophet</hi> or <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, &amp;c.</hi> Now there is no other way for God to ſpeak or reveal falſly, could he do it, but 1. Either to make a <hi>falſe ſign,</hi> naturally or ſupernaturally, or 2. To <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine mans ſenſe</hi> or <hi>mind</hi> to a falſe perception. And if God can do this <hi>naturally,</hi> why not <hi>ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, <hi>à fortiore</hi> mark how you teach the Infidel to inferr? 1. Gods <hi>Natural Revelations</hi> are <hi>Common,</hi> and his <hi>ſupernatural rare.</hi> 2. Gods <hi>Natural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are moſt <hi>certainly</hi> his <hi>own Acts:</hi> But how far a <hi>Voice</hi> or <hi>Book</hi> from a <hi>Spirit,</hi> may be the Act of that Spirit or Angel as a free Agent, and how far that Agent is fallible or defectible, we could not tell, if we had not farther Evidence of Gods owning it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you make Gods own ordinary Natural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or ſignifications to be falſe, how will you be able to diſprove the Infidel about the reſt? 3. And then note, that our Caſe is yet lower and plainer than all this: For if the very <hi>Being</hi> of the Creatures, which is the <hi>Matter</hi> of theſe <hi>Signs</hi> be uncertain to us, and all our ſenſes and minds deceived about it, then we have no place for enquiry, Whether this <hi>Creature</hi> be any ſign of the mind of God. As if the <hi>hearing</hi> of all men was deceived, that thought they heard that voice, [<hi>This is my Beloved Son</hi>] or <hi>Pauls,</hi> that thought he heard Chriſt ſpeak to him [<hi>Saul, Saul, &amp;c.</hi>] or if their <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Intellects</hi> were deceived, that thought they <hi>ſaw Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>miracles</hi>; or that think now that they read the Bible, and indeed there be no ſuch thing as a Bible, no ſuch words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then there is no room to enquire what
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63024:52"/>
they <hi>ſignifie:</hi> For <hi>nothing</hi> hath <hi>no ſignification.

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> V.

                  <p>This is the old ſong over and over. Revelation without ſenſe (to you and ordinary Chriſtians at leaſt) is a contradiction. How know you that God hath any revelations? If by <hi>preachers words,</hi> How know you that there is a <hi>preacher,</hi> or a <hi>word</hi> but by ſenſe? If by <hi>books,</hi> How know you that there <hi>is a book,</hi> but by ſenſe?</p>

                  <p>Say ſo of your Church too, your Pope, Council or Traditions; that we may truſt them in all caſes ſave one or two, in which it is certain that they do lye!

was really a Serpent or not; If it was, then it was no deception to judge it ſuch: If not, ſenſe was not at all deceived: For it perceived nothing but the ſimilitude and motion, and thoſe (with the ſubſtance) were certainly there.

                  <p>But by all this we may perceive, that there is no end of Controverſies with you to be hoped for: For how is it poſſible to bring any thing to a more ſatisfying iſſue, than when the ſenſes of all the world do as clearly perceive it, as any ſenſible thing can be perceived?

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. GOd owneth not Contradictions (nor can do). The Papiſts doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, or nullification of the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread and Wine, is contradictious: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not owned by God.</p>
                  <p>The Major I know no man that denyeth.</p>
                  <p>The Contradictions are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. You feign many <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>no ſubſtance</hi>; which is a groſs contradiction. For to be an <hi>Accident</hi> is eſſentially <hi>Relative</hi> to a ſubject or ſubſtance: And <hi>ejus eſſe eſt ineſſe.</hi> To be a <hi>Father</hi> without a Son, or a Son without a Father, a Husband without a Wife, or a Wife without a Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are contradictions: And ſo it is to be an <hi>Accident of nothing,</hi> or without a <hi>ſubject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Particularly, 1. The <hi>quantity of nothing</hi> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: We can <hi>meaſure</hi> the Bread, and Wine: To be an <hi>inch</hi> in longitude, latitude or profundity, and yet to be <hi>no ſubſtance</hi> is a contradiction. To be (as the Wine is) a <hi>quart,</hi> a <hi>gallon</hi> of <hi>Nothing</hi> is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So for <hi>number</hi>; we can number the <hi>wafers</hi> or <hi>pieces</hi> of Bread, and the <hi>Cups</hi> of Wine: And to be <hi>twenty, forty,</hi> an <hi>hundred nothings,</hi> is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So for the <hi>Weight,</hi> To be an <hi>ounce,</hi> a <hi>pound,</hi> or <hi>ten pound,</hi> of <hi>nothing,</hi> is a contradiction.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:63024:60"/>4. So for the <hi>figure</hi> or <hi>ſhape:</hi> It is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be a <hi>round nothing,</hi> a <hi>ſquare nothing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So is it to be a <hi>ſweet nothing,</hi> a <hi>ſharp nothing,</hi> an <hi>auſtere nothing, &amp;c.</hi> as the <hi>Wine</hi> is fancied by you.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Or to be an <hi>odoriferous nothing:</hi> A <hi>rough</hi> or a <hi>ſmooth nothing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Or to be a <hi>white nothing,</hi> or a <hi>red nothing,</hi> or any coloured <hi>nothing.</hi> The ſame I may ſay of <hi>ſite,</hi> and of a multitude of Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is a contradiction, for <hi>Nothing</hi> to have all thoſe <hi>Real notable effects,</hi> which it is certain that the conſecrated <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> have.</p>
                  <p>As, 1. That when a man or a beaſt, is <hi>really nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed</hi> by the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and <hi>ſpirits</hi> are made of it, (as they may live by it many months,) that theſe ſhould be the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>nothing,</hi> or made out of <hi>no ſubſtance</hi> by way of <hi>Nutrition,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a proper Creation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the Conſecrated <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> do part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn to <hi>Excrements, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, Dung</hi> and <hi>Spittle,</hi> that all the Excrements are <hi>nothings</hi> or <hi>made of nothing</hi> without a <hi>new Creation,</hi> is a contradiction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the <hi>Wine</hi> ſhall (as it may do) make a <hi>man</hi> or a <hi>ſwine drunk,</hi> that he is made <hi>drunk</hi> by <hi>nothing</hi> or no <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> when as that <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> is eſſentially the operation of the ſpirits of the <hi>Wine</hi> upon the ſpirits of him that drinks it, this alſo is a contradiction. And God maketh not contradictions true.</p>

                  <p>It is the plea of an Infidel to ſay that <hi>God</hi> cannot do this or that. Will you limit the power of the Almighty? Will you ſay that God <hi>cannot</hi> make Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, quality, ſite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without ſubſtance, becauſe we cannot? It is blaſphemy to ſay God cannot.</p>

                  <p>God <hi>can</hi> do All things that are <hi>works of Power:</hi> God <hi>can do nothing</hi> which is a work of <hi>Impotency, defectiveneſs, naughtineſs,</hi> or <hi>folly,</hi> or which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions in themſelves. And when we ſay <hi>God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi> we do but ſay either that God is <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> or that the thing is <hi>Nothing,</hi> but a falſe name, and not capable of being any ones work. God <hi>cannot lye,</hi> becauſe he is perfect and Almighty, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wanteth power. God cannot make you to be a <hi>man</hi> and <hi>no man,</hi> a <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>no ſubſtance,</hi> in the ſame ſence, at the ſame time: becauſe it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
                  <p>But if this Argument did not hold, and it were no contradiction, for God to overturn his ſetled courſe of Nature, I ſhall ſhew you next that we have other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons enough to judge that he doth it not. If he <hi>Can</hi> make darkneſs to give Light, and a clod to be to the World inſtead of the Sun, without changing it, or a ſtone to underſtand and ſpeak without changing it, yet that God <hi>doth</hi> none of this, both reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience prove.</p>

                  <p>THat doctrine which aſſerteth a multitude of falſe or feigned Miracles is falſe and not of God: But ſuch is the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation— <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
               </sp>
               <p>I will 1. Shew you what Miracles it aſſerteth; and 2. Prove that they are feigned or falſe.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is a Miracle for <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> yea, into <hi>nothing</hi>; and this by the <hi>ſpeaking</hi> of <hi>four words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. It is a Miracle (or Contradiction) for the Bread and Wine to be turned into <hi>Chriſts Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and yet neither the <hi>matter</hi> nor <hi>form</hi> of it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any of the matter of Chriſts body and blood.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It is a Miracle, (or a contradiction rather as aforeſaid) for the Accidents to be the Accidents of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> or no <hi>ſubſtance</hi>; to be the <hi>quantity</hi> of <hi>Nothing,</hi> the <hi>ſhape,</hi> the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>nothing,</hi> the <hi>colour, ſavour, ſmell</hi> of nothing, and ſo of all the reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is a Miracle to have all the ſound ſenſes of all ſorts of men in the world ſo deceived herein, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>bread, wine</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> if there be none.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is a Miracle to have the ſenſes of Mice and Rats, and Dogs and other Brutes alſo deceived when they eat and drink it.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. It is a Miracle (or contradiction) to have <hi>nothing</hi> without a Creation, to become <hi>excrements:</hi> or elſe thoſe <hi>excrements</hi> to be <hi>nothing</hi> alſo: And the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63024:62"/>
                  <hi>Accidents</hi> of all thoſe <hi>excrements</hi> to be the <hi>Accidents of Nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. It is a Miracle to be <hi>nouriſhed</hi> by <hi>Nothing:</hi> (For you ſay, that it is not <hi>Chriſts body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> that nouriſheth the fleſh.) To have fleſh and blood made of <hi>nothing,</hi> is a creation.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. It is a Miracle to be <hi>drunk</hi> with <hi>nothing,</hi> when the <hi>Wine</hi> is annihilated or gone, and <hi>ſeemeth</hi> to be it that cauſeth the effect: Yea, for Beaſt or man to be ſo drunk.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. It is a Miracle (or contradiction) for Chriſt to eat his own body (as the Papiſts hold he did); and yet it was his <hi>Whole Body</hi> which did eat his <hi>body,</hi> and yet he had but one body.</p>
               <p n="10">X. It was a Miracle (or contradiction) for <hi>Chriſts</hi> entire body to be nouriſhed by that eaten body, and that the eaten body turned into the ſubſtance of his eating body: And yet all was but one.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. It was a Miracle that Chriſts <hi>Eaten body</hi> being not dead but living with a humane ſoul, ſhould be broken and eaten by him and his diſciples, and yet feel no pain by it.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. It was a Miracle that his whole body was on the Croſs; and yet part of it in the diſciples bellies at that time; or at leaſt before that eaten by them.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. It was a Miracle (or contradiction) that Chriſts eaten body now nouriſheth not the fleſh of any man; and yet did nouriſh the fleſh of the diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death. Or if it did not nouriſh them, it was a Miracle that what they eat and drank then did not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them, (or Chriſt what he eat and drank).</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. It was a Miracle that the whole body of Chriſt ſhould ariſe and live, and aſcend to Heaven, when the diſciples had eaten it.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:63024:62"/>XV. It is a Miracle that every Receiver eateth the whole body of Chriſt, and not a part, and yet that he hath but one body; or that they eat each a part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dividing him.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. It is a Miracle that as ſoon as the ſpecies of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> periſh or ceaſe in the Eater, Chriſts body and blood ceaſeth to be in him, and this without his detriment.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. It is a Miracle that there is ſuch a local di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the conſecrated bread and wine all over the world; and yet no ſuch diſtance between the parts of Chriſts body, and yet that bread to be his body.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. It is a Miracle that bread and wine is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated or ceaſe every Maſs, and yet that the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of corporeal matter in the whole world is no whit diminiſhed: or elſe that thoſe four words can ſo anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate and diminiſh the matter of the world.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. It is a Miracle that Chriſts body and blood increaſe not, when ſo many millions of parcells of bread and wine are turned into it.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. It is a Miracle that Chriſts body and blood is not diminiſhed, when by the Corruption of the ſpecies of bread and wine, it vaniſheth away.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. It is a Miracle that Chriſts body and blood ſhould be ſo received into the bowels of a wicked man, and yet not be any way defiled by his ſin, nor by his bodily uncleanneſs.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. It is a Miracle that a Baker diſpoſitively, and a Prieſt effectually can make his own God, and eat him when they have done.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. It is a Miracle that when Worms are bred of that which was bread and wine, theſe worms are really generated of <hi>nothing,</hi> or created; (or if as ſome ſay, the bread and wine do ſubſtantially return again, and breed them, that is another, a double miracle.)</p>
               <p n="24">
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:63024:63"/>XXIV. And it is a Miracle that the Corporeal matter of the world ſhould by theſe Worms be daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, out of nothing, or out of meer accidents that have no ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. It is a Miracle that men may be poyſoned by the Sacramental Elements as ingredients in the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet that they are no ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. It is a Miracle or Contradiction, that when <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> (formally ſuch) enter not into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, but Glorified bodies are all <hi>ſpiritual bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> (though not Spirits), and therefore not <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood:</hi> Yet Chriſts <hi>body</hi> in the Sacrament ſhould be truly and properly <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and yet the ſame with his glorified body (which is not fleſh and blood:) which is the Papiſts doctrine; and the bread turned into ſuch fleſh.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. It is a Miracle that the ſame <hi>Body</hi> which in Heaven is brighter in Glory than the Sun, and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above Angels, ſhould yet ſhew no ſigns of Glory on the Altar, in the Cup, in the hand, mouth or belly of him that taketh it; but all its Glory be ſo hid.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. It is a Miracle (or Contradiction) that Chriſts Humiliation ſhould be paſt, and his whole Body Glorified, and yet that to be torn with the teeth of a wicked man, to be eaten by Mice, Rats or Dogs, to go into the filthy guts, to be trodden in the dirt, ſhould be neither painful, nor any diminution of the Glory of that ſame body. Indeed his body on the Croſs might be broken, and his blood ſpilt and trodden on, becauſe he was a ſacrifice for ſin; and it was the time of his Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Humiliation: But now for the ſuffering of death he is crowned with Glory and Honour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9, 7.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. It is a Miracle that the <hi>Living Body</hi> of our Glorified Redeemer ſhould give no evidence or ſign of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63024:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
life; neither ſtir, nor ſpeak, nor have breath, pulſe, warmth, or other property of life appearing.</p>
               <p n="30">XXX. It is a Miracle, at leaſt, that <hi>fleſh</hi> ſhould have none of the common notes or properties of fleſh, not to be made of food, of blood and chyme, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of the <hi>fibrae</hi> which fleſh conſiſteth of; not to have the colour, taſte, odour or other ſuch accidents of fleſh: And that Blood ſhould have none of theſe noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying accidents of <hi>blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">XXXI. It is a Miracle or Contradiction, that <hi>Chriſts Fleſh</hi> was <hi>Broken</hi> before it was broken, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed before it was ſacrificed, I mean really broken and ſacrificed at his Supper, when yet he was whole and not really ſacrificed till he was nailed to the Croſs. And ſo that his blood was really and properly ſhed in his Supper, and yet no skin broken, nor his blood really ſhed till his ſide was pierced on the Croſs. And that he that was but <hi>once offered</hi> and <hi>ſacrificed,</hi> ſhould yet be offered and ſacrificed once on one day, and another time on another day.</p>
               <p>Here are one and thirty Miracles or Contradictions: Let us hear ſome of the Aggravations of them, as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is a Miracle of theſe Miracles, that there ſhould be as many Miracle workers as Prieſts in the world: How many thouſand are they in <hi>France</hi> alone? And ſo in many other Countreys. Whereas in Chriſts own time, they were comparatively but few.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That the Pope or any Prelate can make a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle worker when he pleaſe, yea, a thouſand; as if the Holy Ghoſt were at his will.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It is a Miracle of theſe Miracles that a Simoniſt who buyeth the Prieſthood with money, doth buy the Holy Ghoſt to work Miracles for that money, which <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was condemned for thinking poſſible.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63024:64"/>
For the Papiſts hold, that the Conſecration of a Simoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal Prieſt tranſubſtantiateth.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is a Miracle that all this power of Miracles ſhould be given to flagitious wicked men; Adulterers, Murderers, Drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. It is a Miracle that all theſe men can work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles at their <hi>own will and pleaſure,</hi> at any hour: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apoſtles had not the Spirit at command, and could not do it when they would.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. It is a Miracle that Miracles ſhould be as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as Maſſes, or the Euchariſtical worſhipping of God; not only on every Lords Day in all Church-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, but any day or hour elſe in the Week. And ſo Miracles be as ordinary almoſt as to eat and drink.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. It is a Miracle that every wicked Prieſt ſhould do ſo <hi>many Miracles in one,</hi> and ſo many more in number than <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> did, in the ſame proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time, as far as the Hiſtory of the Goſpel telleth us: Chriſt is quite exceeded by them all.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. It is a Miracle that every wicked Prieſt can work all theſe Miracles <hi>ſo eaſily,</hi> as with the careleſs ſaying over <hi>four words</hi>: When the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> could not caſt out ſome Devils, or work ſome Miracles, and ſome could not be done but by <hi>faſting and prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. It is a Miracle that <hi>every Prieſt</hi> can work all theſe Miracles upon an <hi>unbeliever</hi> or a <hi>wicked</hi> man: For to ſuch they ſay, it is the <hi>real fleſh and blood of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>no bread or wine</hi>; And the <hi>ſenſes</hi> of all theſe <hi>wicked men</hi> are deceived. Whereas Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>could not do any great miraculous work</hi> among ſome where he came, <hi>becauſe of their unbelief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. It is a Miracle that <hi>God and the Prieſt</hi> ſhould do theſe foreſaid Miracles on <hi>Mice and Rats</hi> and other <hi>Beaſts,</hi> by deceiving their ſenſes, which we find not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63024:64"/>
that Chriſt ever did: or that God ſhould feed them with the miraculous accidents aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. It is a Miracle of theſe Miracles that the Prieſt can thus eaſily work Miracles not only on <hi>other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> but on the <hi>glorified body of Chriſt himſelf,</hi> (by the foreſaid changes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="12">XII. It is a Miracle, that when Chriſt wrought his Miracles uſually before a far ſmaller number, theſe Prieſts work Miracles thus before or on the <hi>ſenſes of all the men in the world</hi> that will be preſent at the Maſs; for all their ſenſes are deceived.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. It is a Miracle that the Abaſſines, Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Greeks, Proteſtants, yea, any that they call Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and Hereticks,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Aquin.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 82. <hi>a.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi>
                  </note> who do not intend to work any Miracle, nor believe Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, do yet work Miracles in each Sacramental ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Euchariſt, not only <hi>without</hi> their <hi>knowledge,</hi> but <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>their belief,</hi> and <hi>againſt their wills:</hi> For they ſay, that even ſuch mens conſecration is effectual.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Either their Prieſts conſecration worketh all theſe Miracles, when they <hi>intend it not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Aquin.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 69. <hi>a.</hi> 9.</note> (as if they ſpeak the words in jeaſt or ſcorn, or in Infidelity,) or only when they <hi>intend it.</hi> If the firſt be ſaid, it is a Miracle of Miracles, that any Prieſt can work ſo many and great Miracles by a jeaſt or ſcorn—If not, then all the buſineſs is come to nothing, and no one but the Prieſt knoweth whether there be any ſuch Miracle at all, and whether ever he eat the fleſh of Chriſt: And ſo it will be in the power of the Prieſt to deceive and damn all the people, according to the Papiſts expoſition of Chriſts words, Joh. 6. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</hi>
               </p>

If not, none but the Prieſt knoweth that there is any body and blood of Chriſt, or that ever he received any: Becauſe none knoweth though the Prieſt intend Conſecration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he intend it to a right end. But if a wicked end will ſerve (as I think moſt of them hold) the Miracle may be great and ſad. For any Roguiſh drunken mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Prieſt may undo a Baker or Vintner at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and by four words deprive him of all his Bread and Wine: Yea, he might nullifie all the <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> in the <hi>City,</hi> and ſo either make a famine at his pleaſure, or elſe make <hi>whole Families</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> live ſtill and be nouriſhed without <hi>any ſubſtance</hi> by bare <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> which would be a <hi>Miracle</hi> indeed.</p>
               <p>If the Prieſt can by conſecration change <hi>only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient quantity of bread and wine,</hi> then all that is <hi>overmuch</hi> is <hi>bread and wine</hi> after conſecration.

               <p>If he can do it only on the <hi>Altar,</hi> then want of <hi>an Altar</hi> would fruſtrate the effect (which they hold not). But if he can do it <hi>without an Altar</hi> he may do it in the <hi>Shop and Cellar.</hi>

               <p>If he can do it only on the <hi>bread and wine preſent,</hi> how <hi>near</hi> muſt it be?

               <p>THat theſe are all but feigned Miracles, I thus prove. I. Becauſe the holy Scriptures do plainly deny ſuch an ordinarineſs or commonneſs of the gift of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. 1 Cor. 12.8, 9, 10, 11. [<hi>To one is given by the ſpirit the word of Wiſdom, to another the word of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by the ſame ſpirit, to another faith by the ſame ſpirit, to another the gifts of healing by the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to another the working of miracles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf ſame ſpirit; divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to every man ſeverally as he will.</hi> 28, 29. <hi>And God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, Governments, diverſities of tongues: Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? are all workers of Miracles.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Here it is moſt expreſly told us, that working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles is a peculiar gift of ſome, and even in thoſe times not common to all that were Prieſts. But the Papiſts make it common to every Prieſt, though a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Adulterer, Drunkard, Murderer or Heretick; no one Prieſt in the world is without it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Though ſome few that were workers of iniquity might have ſome ſuch gifts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. Yet that was ſo rare, that Nature it ſelf taught men to judge Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be ſigns of divine approbation: ſo that <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> thence argueth, Joh. 3.2. <hi>No man could do theſe Miracles that thou doſt except God be with him.</hi> And

Act. 2.22. <hi>Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>a man approved of God among you by miracles, wonders and ſigns which God did by him in the midſt of you</hi> — Joh. 5.36. <hi>The ſame works that I do bear witneſs of me that the Father hath ſent me.</hi> Joh. 10.25, 37, 38. <hi>The works that I do in my Fathers name, they bear witneſs of me — If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not: But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works, that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That doctrine which maketh every Ignorant wicked or Heretical Prieſt in the world, far to excell the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelf, in the Greatneſs, Number and facility of Miracles, is falſe: But ſuch is this doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation</hi> —</p>
               <p>I know that Chriſt telleth his Apoſtles [<hi>Greater works than theſe ſhall ye do.</hi>] But 1. There are <hi>Greater works</hi> (ſuch as the converting of greater numbers in the world) which are not <hi>Greater Miracles:</hi> 2. And what was promiſed <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as to <hi>Miracles,</hi> was not promiſed to <hi>every Prieſt</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p>I appeal to the Conſciences of ſober Chriſtians, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſound not as an arrogant if not blaſpheamous ſpeech, to ſay that <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles did fewer and ſmaller miracles</hi> (proportionable to their time) <hi>than every Prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the Minor, it is ſoon proved in its parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of the <hi>Miracles</hi>; thoſe of Chriſt were <hi>exceeding Great:</hi> eſpecially his <hi>Raiſing Lazarus,</hi> and his <hi>own Reſurrection,</hi> his <hi>turning water into Wine,</hi> and his <hi>feeding thouſands</hi> with a <hi>little food</hi> — But he that will examine <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as afore-deſcribed, ſhall find it to have more that is <hi>contrary to nature,</hi> than all theſe, by far. The ſubſtance of the dead body of Chriſt or <hi>Lazarus</hi> did not vaniſh, but remained to be the <hi>organized Recipient matter</hi> of the re-entring ſoul. There were <hi>no Accidents without ſubſtances,</hi> or other ſuch things as are mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The multiplying of food, could at the moſt be but a <hi>new Creation</hi>; But it was <hi>real food,</hi> and none of the contradictions or abſurdities before recited. The turning of <hi>Water into Wine</hi> was <hi>likeſt this</hi> in the Papiſts opinion; but indeed little like it. For the <hi>matter</hi> of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63024:68"/>
                  <hi>water</hi> there remained, with the <hi>form of Wine,</hi> and ſo became the <hi>Matter of Wine,</hi> and did <hi>not vaniſh:</hi> And here was <hi>real Wine,</hi> and <hi>real ſubſtance,</hi> and <hi>not Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents without ſubſtances, deceiving all the ſenſes or Intellectual perceptions.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of the miracles of the Apoſtles, compared with Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as to the <hi>Number,</hi> though Chriſts and his Apoſtles Miracles were <hi>very many,</hi> yet there is no Scripture-evidence that they were for number compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable (for ſo much time) to <hi>every Prieſts.</hi> Chriſts miracles are ſet down in the ſacred hiſtory in <hi>ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and the Evangeliſts ſo much agree in reciting the <hi>ſame miracles,</hi> that (though St. <hi>John</hi> ſay) the <hi>world could not contain the Books that ſhould be written</hi>— yet we find no probability that they were neer ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as <hi>Maſſes</hi> are: when in ſeveral places where Chriſt came, they that looked after Miracles and Signs were denyed them, and had none, but were put off to the <hi>ſign</hi> of the <hi>Prophet Jonah,</hi> &amp;c. Yea <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were in this denyed their <hi>deſired ſatisfaction</hi>; and they that call to him for a miracle on the Croſs. And ſo of the Apoſtles. But every Prieſt doth his miracles <hi>as oft as there is a Maſs,</hi> though <hi>every day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And as to the <hi>Facility</hi> I ſaid before, that [in his <hi>own Country,</hi> among his <hi>own kindred, he could do no mighty work ſave that he layed his hands on a few ſick folk and healed them,</hi> and <hi>he marvelled at their unbelief</hi>] Mark 6.4, 5, 6. And he ſome time <hi>groaned in ſpirit, and wept,</hi> (as for <hi>Lazarus</hi>). And the Diſciples <hi>could not caſt out a Devil,</hi> Mar. 9.18, 28. Luk. 9.40. It was not to be done <hi>but by faſting and prayer.</hi> Its like <hi>Paul</hi> would have cured <hi>Trophimus</hi> if he could, when <hi>he left him ſick.</hi> And as holy men ſpake, not when, nor as they pleaſed, but <hi>when and as they were inſpired by the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63024:69"/>
Holy Ghoſt:</hi> ſo did they <hi>work miracles,</hi> not arbitrarily, but at ſuch times and in ſuch manner as the ſpirit moved them.</p>
               <p>But any the moſt wicked Prieſt can do it <hi>at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, any hour of the day:</hi> and that but by reciting <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum.</hi> Many other diſparities appear in what is ſaid before.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The <hi>End</hi> of the Gift of Miracles confuteth the feigned Miracles of Tranſubſtantiation. The <hi>End</hi> of Chriſts gift was to prove him to be <hi>of God</hi> (as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed) and to prove his <hi>Apoſtles to be of God,</hi> and to confirm the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which they Preached, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. As the gift of Tongues ſo other wonders, were to <hi>convince unbelievers,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. Act. 2. &amp; 4.30. &amp; 5.12. &amp; 7.36. &amp; 8.13. &amp; 14.3. 2 Cor. 12.12.</p>
               <p>But the miracles of Tranſubſtantiation are known to <hi>no unbeliever</hi>; nor to any one in the world by any ſenſe; and have no <hi>ſuch End,</hi> but a contrary effect.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles who were to convert the world, and next Chriſt, to do the greateſt good, were therefore to do the <hi>greateſt miracles:</hi> And it was their argument for Chriſt, Joh. 7.31. <hi>When Chriſt cometh will he do more miracles</hi> than <hi>theſe which this man hath done?</hi> Yet now every ignorant Prieſt pretendeth to far more, who doth but tempt Infidels to deride Chriſtianity by the pretence; as we do Mahometaniſm, for <hi>Mahomets</hi> ſport pretended with the Moon, and other ſuch delirations.</p>
               <p n="5">V. God is not to be ſaid to work Miracles and croſs the eſtabliſhed courſe of nature without proof. But theſe pretended Miracles have no proof — No man liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceiveth them by ſenſe. And that God telleth us of no ſuch things by ſupernatural Revelation, ſhall be further ſhewed anon: In the mean time, it may ſatisfie
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63024:69"/>
us, that they <hi>bring</hi> us no proof, but their own affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they require us to believe.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Matter</hi> of theſe pretended Miracles is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contradicted by the Word of God, as ſhall be proved in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Ad hominem</hi>; Do not the Papiſts forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves here, and contradict their other ſuppoſitions?<note place="margin">So they do by forbidding to eat Fleſh in <hi>Lent</hi>: And yet ſay they eat Chriſts fleſh in <hi>Lent:</hi> When <hi>Irenaeus</hi> cited by <hi>Occumenius Com. in</hi> 1 <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. They make Miracles to be one evidence of <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and therefore <hi>Canonize</hi> men, when they think that they have proof that they wrought Miracles: And yet maintain that a Whoremonger, Drunkard or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick may do many more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They make Miracles a proof that they are the <hi>true Church,</hi> and ſay that among <hi>us</hi> there are <hi>no Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>; and yet they confeſs that every Prieſt, <hi>among us</hi> and all others, whom they account Schiſmaticks and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, do more Miracles than <hi>Chriſt did</hi>; if they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate frequently.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They burn men to aſhes for <hi>working miracles,</hi> even for <hi>making God</hi>; if ſo be, they do it not in the Roman faſhion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They confeſs that the <hi>other Sacraments</hi> are not thus made up of Miracles; no not <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which is our <hi>Chriſtening,</hi> and waſheth us from our ſins: And yet <hi>this Sacrament alone,</hi> muſt by a multitude of Miracles differ from the reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether the Doctrine of their St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and his followers and others, that the <hi>formal words of this Sacrament have a created effective virtue by which they inſtrumentally make the change</hi> (3. q. 78. a. 4. c.) be not an abſurdity rather than a proper miracle.

Here they that call for <hi>expreſs words of Scripture</hi> for our doctrine, without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, may ſee their own faith expreſly contradicted, and our oppoſition juſtified: The Holy Ghoſt here <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly</hi> calleth it <hi>Bread:</hi> And yet no expreſneſs nor evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will ſatisfie them.</p>

                  <p>Why then do you call for <hi>expreſs</hi> texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as our proof, when that <hi>expreſneſs</hi> ſignifieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with you; but you can ſay, It is a <hi>metonymie</hi> or a <hi>metaphor</hi> at your pleaſure. But you ſay ſo againſt notorious Evidence: The Apoſtle calleth it <hi>Bread</hi> ſo
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63024:71"/>
often over and over, as if he had foreſeen your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane hereſie: He calleth it <hi>The Bread which is to be Eaten,</hi> joyned with <hi>Drinking</hi> the <hi>Cup</hi>; never once calling either of them the <hi>Fleſh</hi> or <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but as he reciteth Chriſts words which he expoundeth. Yea he telleth us that <hi>eating this bread,</hi> and <hi>drinking this cup,</hi> is <hi>to ſhew the Lords death till he come</hi>; where he calleth us to look back at <hi>Chriſts death</hi> as paſt, in our <hi>Commemoration,</hi> and to <hi>look forward</hi> to his <hi>perſonal coming</hi> as <hi>future</hi>; but never telleth us that we muſt kill Chriſt and eat him our ſelves (when we have <hi>made him</hi>), nor that his body is there preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the accidents of Bread and Wine.</p>
                  <p>But the reſt of the Scriptures as expreſly juſtifie our doctrine. 1 Cor. 10.15. <hi>The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion</hi> (or <hi>Communication) of the blood of Chriſt:</hi> And <hi>the Bread which we break, is it not the communion</hi> (or <hi>participation) of the body of Chriſt?</hi>] Here it is the <hi>Cup</hi> and the <hi>Bread</hi> after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, if the Holy Ghoſt may be believed.</p>
                  <p>And in the next words the Apoſtle repeateth it in his reaſon [<hi>For we being Many</hi> are <hi>One Bread,</hi> and <hi>One Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For we all partake of one Bread</hi> (or Loaf).] Is not here expreſs proof?</p>

                  <p>So <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42, 46. It is twice more called <hi>Breaking of Bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what elſe can the recitation of Chriſts inſtitution mean, 1 Cor. 11.23, 24. <hi>Panem accepiſſe, fregiſſe</hi>; to have <hi>taken Bread,</hi> and <hi>having given thanks, to have broken?</hi> What is it that he <hi>brake?</hi> Its non-ſence if it

And plain Grammatical conſtruction tells us then, that it muſt be that before mentioned, What he <hi>Took</hi> he <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>brake</hi> and <hi>gave:</hi> But he <hi>took Bread</hi> and the <hi>Cup</hi> —. The ſame is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26, 26, 27. and the other Evangeliſts.</p>
                  <p n="2">II.

And if they tore his fleſh and drank his blood, and yet killed him not, the event altered not the fact: The Jews did but <hi>break his fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſhed his blood.</hi> If you fly to a <hi>good intention, Paul</hi> will come in for ſome further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for his perſecution.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. 1 Cor. 10.21. <hi>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of Devils: Ye cannot be partakers of the Lords table</hi> and of <hi>the table of Devils.</hi> — Here note 1.

                  <p>No doubt but it meaneth that They <hi>ought not,</hi> or <hi>cannot Lawfully</hi>; but thats not all: The text plainly meaneth, <hi>You cannot</hi> have <hi>communion with both:</hi> You may take the <hi>bread and wine</hi> at your peril; but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not partake of it as a <hi>ſacramental feaſt</hi> which God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth you, and ſo partake of <hi>Chriſt</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame is ſaid (expounding this) 2 Cor. 6.15. <hi>What concord hath Chriſt with Belial— and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols?</hi>] Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that Communion with God and Idols, Chriſt and <hi>Belial,</hi> are (ſo far) inconſiſtent: But by the Papiſts doctrine an Idolater and Son of <hi>Belial</hi> may partake of the very <hi>ſubſtance of Chriſts body</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> into his <hi>body,</hi> as verily as he partaketh of his meat and drink.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The Scripture teacheth us expreſly to judge of ſenſible things by ſenſe. Luk. 24.39.

                  <p>Though this be anſwered fully before, I will again tell you, That theſe two notorious falſhoods are all that you have to ſay againſt <hi>Humanity</hi> in this caſe, thats worth the noting. I. It is falſe that you ſay that <hi>ſenſe perceiveth</hi> not <hi>ſubſtance:</hi> When I take up a ſtaff or ſtone in my hand, I do not only feel Roughneſs or Smoothneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but a <hi>ſubſtance:</hi> It is a <hi>quantitative,</hi> and <hi>qualitative ſubſtance,</hi> which I feel, taſte, ſmell, ſee and hear: And this I perceive by <hi>ſenſation</hi> it ſelf, as the medium to the Intellect. It is not the <hi>ſenſe</hi> indeed, but the <hi>Intellect</hi> that giveth it the <hi>Logical notion</hi> or <hi>defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a <hi>ſubſtance</hi>; but it is the <hi>ſenſe it ſelf</hi> that by <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation perceiveth it</hi>; and to deny this is to deny all ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>And if it <hi>were not</hi> ſo, How could any <hi>ſuch ſubſtance</hi> be <hi>known?</hi> when it cannot come into the Intellect but by the ſenſe?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. ☞ Your great cheat (or errour) is by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the firſt and <hi>natural-neceſſary perception</hi> of a <hi>ſenſibile ſenſatum</hi> or <hi>incomplex object,</hi> by the <hi>Intellect,</hi> with the <hi>ſecond conception</hi> of the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>things,</hi> or of Organical ſecond notions, and the <hi>third conception</hi> of them Artificially by the uſe of theſe names and Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal notions, and the fourth perception of Conſequents from thoſe conceptions. To know by <hi>Believing</hi> is but the third or fourth ſort of knowledge, and preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the two firſt. If a man had never heard a <hi>name</hi> or <hi>word</hi> in his life; yet by <hi>ſenſation</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw, ſmelt, taſted, heard, handled things, his <hi>Intellect</hi> would have had a <hi>perception</hi> of the <hi>Thing it ſelf</hi> as it was ſenſate; And this is the <hi>Intellects firſt perception:</hi> And this is it which falleth under our queſtion, <hi>Whether the Intellect in this firſt perception of a ſubſtance</hi> or <hi>Thing as ſenſate, be deceived or not,</hi> when the Thing hath the Conditions
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63024:73"/>
of an object before mentioned. 2. Next this we learn or invent <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>organical notions</hi> for things: And whether theſe be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> and whether they be <hi>apt</hi> or <hi>inept</hi> is all one. This is but an arbitrary work of art. 3. Next this we conceive of things by the <hi>Means</hi> of theſe <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>ſecond notions,</hi> and examine the <hi>Congruence:</hi> and ſo we define them: And this is but a work of <hi>Artificial Reaſoning,</hi> and preſuppoſeth the firſt <hi>Natural neceſſary</hi> perception. Now <hi>Faith</hi> belongeth partly to <hi>this,</hi> and partly to the <hi>fourth,</hi> which is The raiſing of Concluſions, and the weaving of methods; and preſuppoſeth the firſt, yea and the ſecond: It is but an aſſent given by the means of an Extrinſick Teſtimony of God, that this particular <hi>Word</hi> is <hi>True, &amp;c.</hi> Now if the Intellect in its <hi>firſt Perception (natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary)</hi> of the <hi>Thing it ſelf,</hi> as <hi>ſenſate,</hi> be deceived, if <hi>faith</hi> ſhould be contrary to it, 1. It muſt be ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> which is the <hi>immediate contrary perception of a ſenſate object</hi>; which is <hi>no faith,</hi> nor is any ſuch poſſible, (properly called faith): 2. And if faith can come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and undeceive the Intellect, by ſaying that God ſaith otherwiſe, yet this would be no <hi>prevention</hi> of <hi>its decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but <hi>a cure,</hi> preſuppoſing the ſaid deception as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe to be cured. So that to ſay as <hi>Aquinas</hi> that faith <hi>preventeth the deceit of the Intellect,</hi> is a falſhood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of man, and his natural way of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he is compoſed of ſoul and body.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid this over again, leſt errour get advantage by the brevity and unobſervedneſs of that which I ſaid before.</p>

As in Joh. 15.1. <hi>I am the Vine and my Father is the husbandman:</hi> Joh. 10.7, 9. <hi>I am the door</hi>— Joh. 10.14. <hi>I am the good Shepherd and know my Sheep:</hi> Pſal. 22.6. <hi>I am a worm and no man</hi> (which being a propheſie of Chriſt, a Heretick imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating you, might deny Chriſts humanity:) 1 Cor. 10.4. <hi>That Rock was Chriſt</hi>— 1 Cor. 12.27. <hi>Ye are the body of Chriſt</hi> — Mat. 5.13, 14. <hi>Ye are the Salt of the earth: Ye are the lights of the World</hi>— Joh. 6.63. <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you they are ſpirit and they are Life.</hi> Abundance ſuch are in the Scripture, as All fleſh is graſs: Chriſt is the Lamb of God: the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Juda</hi>; the bright Morning Star; the head Corner Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is yet more fully ſatisfactory, that the Hebrew conſtantly putteth [<hi>is</hi>] for [<hi>ſignifieth</hi>] as you may find in all the old Teſtament; having no other word ſo fit to expreſs [<hi>ſignifying</hi>] by: And as Chriſt ſpake after that manner, ſo the New Teſtament ordinarily imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth; As <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelation</hi> agree in ſaying, of the Viſions, <hi>This is</hi> ſuch or ſuch a thing, inſtead of <hi>this ſignifieth</hi> it. So Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.21, 22, 23, 37, 38, 39. He that ſoweth <hi>is</hi> the Son of man: the field is the world: the good ſeed are the Children of the Kingdom; the tares are the children of the wicked one: the enemy is the Devil, the Harveſt is the end. The reapers are the Angels— And thus ordinarily.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Yea, the ſame kind of phraſe uſed before in the Paſſeover, teacheth us how to expound this: Exod. 12.11. <hi>Ye ſhall eat it in haſte, It is the Lords
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63024:75"/>
Paſſeover</hi>— verſ. 27. <hi>It is the ſacrifice of the Lords Paſſeover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Yea the <hi>ordinary way</hi> and <hi>phraſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſts teaching</hi> may yet farther put us out of doubt. For he uſually taught by Parables, and expreſſeth his ſenſe by ſuch aſſertions: As Matth. 13.3. <hi>Behold a ſower went out to ſow,</hi> &amp;c. Luk. 15.11, 12. <hi>A certain man had two ſons, and the younger ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. Luk. 12.16. <hi>The ground of a certain Rich man,</hi> &amp;c. Luk. 16.19. <hi>There was a certain Rich man,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 21.28. <hi>A certain man had two ſons,</hi> &amp;c. Verſ. 33. <hi>There was a certain houſholder which planted a Vineyard,</hi> &amp;c. The Goſpel aboundeth with ſuch inſtances, which teach us how to interpret theſe words of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But moſt certainly all thoſe forementioned texts teach it us, which expreſly call it <hi>Bread after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration.</hi> If we will not believe the Holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who ſo frequently calleth it <hi>bread,</hi> it is in vain to alledge any text of Scripture in the Controverſie.</p>
               <p>Now to feign a courſe of <hi>ordinary Miracles, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>more</hi> than Chriſts, and this to <hi>every Prieſt,</hi> how ignorant and impious ſoever; to pretend that every Pope and Biſhop can for money ſell the Holy Ghoſt or the Gift of Miracles, in Ordination; and all this when no eye ſeeth the Miracles, when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that Angels cannot <hi>naturally ſee it,</hi> yea when all mens ſenſes perceive the contrary; and all this becauſe, that Chriſt ſaid <hi>This is my Body,</hi> while abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance ſuch ſayings in Scripture, yea the words about the <hi>Cup it ſelf,</hi> are confeſſed to be tropical, and when the Scripture expreſly telleth us that there is <hi>Bread.</hi> Judge whether it be poſſible for Satan to have put a greater ſcorn upon the Chriſtian faith, or a greater ſcandal before the enemies of it, or a greater hinderance
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63024:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the Worlds Converſion, than to tell them, you muſt renounce not only your Humanity but all common ſenſe, if you will be Chriſtians, and be ſaved, or ſuffered to enjoy your eſtates and lives.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Laſtly, It is ordinary with their ſubtileſt Schoolmen to confeſs that this their doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation cannot be proved from Scripture, and that they believe it only becauſe their <hi>Church ſaith it,</hi> which muſt be believed, and becauſe that by the ſame <hi>ſpirit</hi> which wrote the Scripture, the <hi>Church is taught</hi> thus to expound it. So that all their faith of this is by them reſolved into a phanatick pretence of <hi>Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; As I have elſewhere ſhewed out of <hi>Durandus, Paludanus, Scotus, Ockam, Quodl.</hi> 6. <hi>li.</hi> 5. <hi>q.</hi> 31. <hi>Rada vol.</hi> 4. <hi>Cont.</hi> 7. <hi>a.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 164, 165.</p>
               <p>And no General Council ever determined it till that at <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Innoc.</hi> 3. Where ſaith <hi>Matth.

               <p>The Papiſts doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence denyeth the Lords Supper to be a true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: Therefore the Papiſts doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is falſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> I know no man that will deny that we have now to deal with.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> needeth no other proof, than the common definition of a Sacrament, and Chriſts own deſcription of this Sacrament in the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Aquinas</hi> concludeth 3. <hi>q.</hi> 60. <hi>a.</hi> 1. that a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is a <hi>ſign</hi>; and <hi>a.</hi> 2. that it is a ſign of a thing ſacred as it ſanctifieth men; and <hi>a.</hi> 3. that it is a Rememorative ſign of Chriſts paſſion, a demonſtrative ſign of Gods Grace, and a prognoſticating ſign of future Glory: And <hi>a.</hi> 4. that it muſt be <hi>Res ſenſibilis</hi> a <hi>ſenſible thing,</hi> it being natural to man to come to the knowledge of things intelligible by things ſenſible, and the Sacrament ſignifieth to man ſpiritual and intelligible Goods: and <hi>a.</hi> 5. that they muſt be things of Divine determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, 1. If the Bread and Wine be gone, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to be a <hi>ſign,</hi> a Real ſenſible ſign, to lead us to the knowledge of ſpiritual and intelligible things. If they ſay that the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> is the <hi>ſenſible ſign,</hi> what mean they by that cheating word
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63024:76"/>
[<hi>ſpecies?</hi>] Not the <hi>ſpecifying form</hi> or matter, but only the <hi>outward appearance.</hi> And is it a <hi>true</hi> or a <hi>falſe</hi> appearance? If True, then there is Bread and Wine: If <hi>falſe,</hi> it is a falſe ſign: And what is that falſe appearance which God maketh a Sacrament of? It is plainly nothing but the Accidents of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> without the ſubſtance. But, 1. When they take the Cup from the Laity, and deny them half the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſure there are then no <hi>Accidents of Wine.</hi> Is there either Quantity, Colour, Smell, Taſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Wine?</hi> They will not ſay it. So that here is no <hi>ſenſible ſign</hi> as to one half.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And herein they deal far more inhumanely with us than the Infidels themſelves: For when they plead againſt Chriſt and Scripture, they grant that the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles</hi> and <hi>Notitiae,</hi> which all mankind ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, are the <hi>certain unqueſtionable light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

                  </note> But the Papiſts deny not only the <hi>Notitias com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes,</hi> but <hi>common ſenſe.</hi> It is nothing with them to damn all the world, that will not believe contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They ſay that the <hi>Quantity</hi> of <hi>Nothing</hi> endued with the <hi>Qualities,</hi> the <hi>Actions,</hi> the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> the <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> the <hi>quando, ubi, ſitus</hi> of <hi>nothing,</hi> is the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>ſign.</hi> Inhumane contradiction! 1. <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> and others ſay truly, that an <hi>Accident</hi> is not properly <hi>Res,</hi> but <hi>Modus Rei, (vel Qualitas,</hi> as he calleth it.) 2. <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> doth not Really differ a <hi>re quanta:</hi> and to ſay, [<hi>The Length, Breadth, Profundity of Nothing</hi>] is a notorious contradiction. And ſo it is of the other Accidents. There is no <hi>Real ſenſible ſign,</hi> and therefore no Sacrament, where there is <hi>nothing,</hi> but the <hi>quantity, colour, taſte, ſmell, &amp;c.</hi> of Nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And they cannot, they dare not ſay, that Chriſts
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63024:77"/>
Real Fleſh and Blood, is the <hi>Sacramental ſign</hi>: For, 1. It is not <hi>ſenſible</hi>; 2. It ſhould be then the <hi>ſign of it ſelf:</hi> The ſign and the thing ſignified cannot be the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The very <hi>ſubſtantiality</hi> or <hi>corporeity</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine as ſuch,</hi> is part of the <hi>ſign:</hi> As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Behold and handle me, a ſpirit hath not fleſh and blood, as ye ſee me have:</hi> So he taketh <hi>Corporeal bread and wine</hi> in their ſight, and <hi>breaketh it,</hi> and <hi>poureth it out,</hi> and <hi>giveth it them</hi> to ſee, to feel, to taſte, to eat, that they may know it is <hi>true bread and wine,</hi> the ſigns of his True Body and Blood. So that to deny the <hi>Corporeity</hi> is to deny <hi>Chriſts Corporeity</hi> in <hi>its ſigns</hi>; and tendeth to the old Hereſie of them that held that Chriſt had but a <hi>phantaſtical body,</hi> or was not indeed Crucified, but ſeemed ſo to be: They teach Hereticks to argue, <hi>The ſign was no Real ſubſtance: Therefore neither the thing ſignified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>nutritive uſe</hi> of the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> was another part of the <hi>ſign,</hi> as all confeſs: As <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> are the <hi>Nutriment</hi> of the body and life of man, ſo is Chriſt <hi>crucified meritoriouſly,</hi> and Chriſt <hi>glorified efficiently,</hi> the life of the ſoul. And he that denyeth the <hi>Nutritive ſign,</hi> denyeth the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> But it is not the <hi>falſe appearance,</hi> or <hi>phantaſm,</hi> or <hi>accidents</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> that are the natural <hi>nouriſhers</hi> of man: Therefore he that denyeth the <hi>nouriſhing ſubſtance,</hi> denyeth the <hi>Real ſenſible Sacramental ſign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saith <hi>Bellarmin de Euchar. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 23. [<hi>In the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt we receive not corporal food that the fleſh may be thence nouriſhed and made fat: but only to ſignifie inward refection.</hi>] So that he acknowledged this to be part of the Sacramental ſign. So <hi>Gregor. Valent.</hi> ſaith that [<hi>The chief and eſſential ſignification of this Sacrament is that which by external nouriſhment is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63024:77"/>
ſignified, the internal ſpiritual refection of the ſoul by the body of Chriſt.</hi>] So that denying the <hi>nouriſhing ſign</hi> is deſtroying the eſſence of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The <hi>breaking of the Bread</hi> and <hi>pouring out the Wine</hi> is confeſſedly another part of the Sacramental ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſign. But, 1. When there is no <hi>Wine,</hi> there is no <hi>pouring it out</hi>: 2. And if there be no <hi>Bread</hi> neither, there is no <hi>breaking it:</hi> Can that be <hi>broken</hi> which is not? They that deny (as the Papiſts do) that the <hi>Bread</hi> is <hi>broken</hi> (ſaying that only the <hi>Quantity of Nothing</hi> is broken) deny the ſenſible Sacramental ſign.</p>
               <p>And here I may note, that we do not well to contend with them for denying the Cup only to the Laity, and granting them only the Bread, when indeed they grant neither, but deny them both: There is (ſay they) no more <hi>Bread</hi> than <hi>Wine,</hi> but only a falſe appearance of it.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Laſtly, The Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. ſheweth that one Sacramental uſe of the Bread was to ſignifie the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Chriſtians,</hi> who are <hi>one Bread,</hi> and <hi>one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> as <hi>one Loaf</hi> is made of many <hi>Corns.</hi> But that cannot be <hi>One,</hi> which is <hi>Nothing: Ens, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num &amp; Verum convertuntur.</hi> To ſay with <hi>Greg. Valent.</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that becauſe it <hi>was Once bread,</hi> and <hi>one bread,</hi> therefore the accidents of it remaining now ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that we are <hi>one bread</hi>; is but to ſay, that There was once a fit ſign, but then there wanted the form: Now after Conſecration, there is no Sacramental ſign, but yet there is a Sacramental form: And in what <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is that form? Doubtleſs it can be no where but in the Brain or Mind of man: That is, man can Remember that once he ſaw Bread: This is the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> in his Intellect: This <hi>ſpecies</hi> is the <hi>ſign:</hi> And ſo we have found out another ſenſe of the <hi>ſpecies of bread,</hi> than many think on; viz. It is that which is called <hi>The ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb facs="tcp:63024:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
intentionalis,</hi> or the <hi>Idea</hi> or conception of <hi>bread</hi> in a <hi>mans fantaſie</hi> and <hi>mind:</hi> And ſo indeed the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is with them an <hi>inviſible thing:</hi> for it is only in mens minds: There is no Sacrament on the <hi>Altar,</hi> but in the <hi>thoughts:</hi> And ſo who hath a Sacrament, and who not, we know not: And a man may by <hi>thinking</hi> make a Sacrament when he will.</p>

                  <speaker>R.</speaker>
                  <p>I Once thought to have next proved out of the Current of Antiquity, the Novelty of this inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane doctrine of the Papiſts, and that the Antients commonly confeſſed, that there was true <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> remaining in the Sacrament after Conſecration: But, 1. I ſhould but <hi>tempt</hi> and <hi>weary</hi> ordinary Readers, who neither <hi>need</hi> any ſuch arguments (having <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> to give them ſatisfaction) nor are able to try them: For it is an indirect kind of dealing, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the unlearned, or thoſe that are ſtrangers to the Writings of the Antients, ſhould believe this or that to be their mind and ſayings, meerly becauſe I tell them ſo. And if they read the plaineſt words, they know not whether I rightly recite them, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving me. And it is as unreaſonable on the other ſide, that the Papiſts ſhould expect, either by their Citations or their general Affirmations, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhould believe them, that the Antients were for Tranſubſtantiation. Till men can both read the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors themſelves, and try the Copies, they can have no ſure hiſtorical notice what the Fathers held, except by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63024:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the common conſent of credible Reporters or Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Not while one ſide ſaith, they ſay this, and the other ſide ſaith they ſay the contrary, and yet their Books are to be ſeen by all. We may bid them <hi>believe us,</hi> and the Papiſts may bid them <hi>believe them,</hi> and a Prieſt may cheat them by ſaying, that his word is the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: But though this will produce a humane belief in the Hearers or Readers, as by advantages it is moſt taking with them, yet that fallible belief is all the Certainty that it can afford them. Therefore I think it moſt ingenuous and reaſonable to give men ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they are capable of underſtanding and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving to certain ſatisfaction.</p>

Who would not laugh at a Fryer, that in his Cell would tell by moral conjectures, all the thoughts and motions of an Army
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63024:80"/>
or Navy, that never ſaw them, and contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of thoſe that were on the ground and intereſſed in their Councils and actions. Obſerve how many falſe ſuppoſitions go to make up your cheats.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You ſuppoſe this a true <hi>General Council,</hi> which is a pack of factious Prelates ſubject to the Pope, and aſſembled at <hi>Rome</hi> in his own Palace, under the awe of his preſence and power. And as if the ſmall number after at <hi>Trent</hi> had ſpake the minds of all the Churches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You ſuppoſe <hi>all the members</hi> of a <hi>Council</hi> to be of <hi>one mind</hi>: when as they determine by the <hi>Major Vote.</hi> And oft times the difference is not above <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> and its poſſible <hi>one Voice</hi> may turn the ſcales: And perhaps <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> or <hi>ten</hi> may be abſent one day, and preſent another, and ſo the Cry of [<hi>the Judgement of all the Biſhops in the world</hi>] may ſignifie no more, but that <hi>two or three</hi> of the other ſide ſtaid a little too long at dinner that day, while the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty carryed it by their abſence. And I pray you where hath God promiſed, that the faith of an hundred and one ſhall not fail, when the faith of ninety nine of the ſame company may fail (ſuppoſing the Council to be two hundred): Or why are the one hundred and one the Biſhops of all the world, and not the ninety nine?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do you think we never read the Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> and before them, of the Councils of <hi>Ariminum, Epheſ.</hi> 2, yea, <hi>Calcedon, &amp;c.?</hi> And yet muſt we ſuppoſe, that men come thither all of one mind? when they have ſuch ſhameful Contentions? Such cunning contrivances to get the majority of Votes? Such awe and terror from the power of the Chief? and ſuch carnal dependances and reſpects to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral worldly intereſts? Yea, ſometimes fighting it out unto blood (as <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> and <hi>Flavianus</hi> caſe doth ſhamefully evince?)</p>

Do we not know the Courſe of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>England</hi> of later times? How much a few men of more than ordinary parts and intereſt, can do with the reſt? And how oft the major Vote hath gone againſt the ſenſe of the far greater number of the Houſe?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And do we not know, that ordinarily he that is ſent to the Council from a Province, is choſen as it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Pope, the King, or the Archbiſhop, or ſome in greateſt power; and rarely according to the free-will and ſenſe of the greater part of the Clergy. If five hundred to one of the Clergy of a Kingdom be of one mind, and the Prince, or chief men, or powerfulleſt Prelates be of another, they will ſend a Biſhop thither of their own mind.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Do you think we know not that all the Papiſts are not paſt the third or fourth part of the Chriſtian world? Why then ſhould their ſenſe be called the ſenſe of all the Chriſtian world?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Do you think we know not how little reaſon you have to ſay, that the Council at <hi>Laterane</hi> ſpake the ſenſe of all the Church? When the Decrees were but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> and recited there without any due Synodical deliberation, and ſome liked them, and ſome diſliked them? as you may find in <hi>Math.

Did theſe Councils all go to bed of one mind, and riſe of another? Or did they not know what their Fathers faith was?

                  <p>But, I. As to all your Citations from true antiquity (for your forged Authors and corrupted Teſtimonies we regard not) they are anſwered by this one true obſervation, that when old Writers ſometimes ſay, that after conſecration it is [<hi>No more bread and wine, but the body and blood of Chriſt</hi>], their whole Context plainly ſheweth, that they mean that it is no more <hi>MEER</hi> or <hi>Common Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>; and uſually they ſo ſpeak. Becauſe <hi>forma denominat,</hi> and it is the <hi>ultimate form</hi> that denominateth, all antecedent forms being but the <hi>diſpoſitio materiae.</hi> As if the queſtion be, <hi>Whether a Shilling be Silver or Money?</hi> Before the Coining, it was <hi>but Silver</hi>; but after, it is no more <hi>Common Silver,</hi> but <hi>Money: Silver</hi> is but the <hi>matter,</hi> and not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominating form.

                  <p>By the <hi>preſent Church,</hi> I mean the far greater part of all the Chriſtians in the world.

                  <p>That they hold that there is <hi>true Bread and Wine after Conſecration,</hi> all impartial Hiſtorians teſtifie, both Papiſts and Proteſtants, and their own ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen; and alſo Travellers who have been among them.

               <head>CHAP. X. The ſecond part of the Controverſie, Whether it be Chriſts very Fleſh and Blood into which the Bread and Wine are Tranſubſtantiated.</head>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>R.</speaker>
                  <p>OUr firſt Queſtion was, <hi>Whether there be any Bread and Wine left after Conſecration</hi>; Our ſecond is, <hi>Whether Chriſts Real Fleſh and Blood be there, as that into which the Bread and Wine are changed?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>And herein 1. I do freely grant, that the change of Chriſts Body by Glorification is ſo great, as that it may be called, though not a Spirit, yet a <hi>ſpiritual body,</hi> as <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. ſaith <hi>Ours</hi> when Glorified ſhall be; that is, A body very like in purity, ſimplicity, and activity to a Spirit: And the general difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſpirit and body was not held by many of the Greek Fathers as it is by us: And if the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> was Infallible, no Angel or other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is <hi>Incorporeal:</hi> Or as <hi>Damaſus</hi> ſaith, [They are Corporeal in reſpect to God, but Incorporeal in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to groſs bodies.] The perfect knowledge of the difference between <hi>Corpus</hi> and <hi>Spiritus,</hi> except by the <hi>formal Virtues,</hi> is unknown to mortal men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I grant therefore, that our ſenſes are no Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges, <hi>Whether Chriſts true body be in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> no more than Whether an Angel be in this room? There are bodies which are Inviſible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I grant that it is unknown to us, how far Chriſts Glorified body may extend? Whether the ſame may be both in Heaven and on earth? I am not able nor willing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63024:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to confute them that ſay, <hi>Light</hi> is a <hi>Body</hi>; nor them that ſay, It is a <hi>ſpirit:</hi> nor them that ſay, It is <hi>quid medium</hi> as a <hi>nexus</hi> of both: I mean <hi>Aether</hi> or <hi>Ignis,</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in its Light. And it is an incomprehenſible won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if <hi>Lumen</hi> be a real <hi>radiant</hi> or <hi>Emanant</hi> part of the Sun, that it ſhould indiviſibly fill all the ſpace thence to this earth, and how much further little do we know. So for the extenſions of Chriſts body, let thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it diſpute for me.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And I will grant that it is very probable that as in Heaven we ſhall have both a <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> ſo the <hi>Body</hi> is not like to have ſo near an <hi>Intuition</hi> and <hi>fruition</hi> of God as the <hi>ſoul.</hi> And whether the Glorified <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not be there a <hi>medium</hi> of Gods Communication of Glory to our <hi>bodies,</hi> yea and his <hi>glorified ſoul</hi> to our <hi>ſouls,</hi> as the Sun is now to our eyes, I do not well underſtand: only I know that it is his prayer and will, that <hi>we be with him where he is to behold his Glory</hi>; and that <hi>God and the Lamb will be the Light of the Heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And I am fully ſatisfied that it is not the ſigns only; but the <hi>Real Body and Blood</hi> of Chriſt, which are given us in the Sacraments (both Baptiſm and the Euchariſt): But <hi>how given us? Relatively, de jure</hi>; as a man is Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Woman in Marriage; or as a houſe and land are delivered to me, to be mine for my uſe; though I touch them not. Thus 1. A <hi>right</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> is given us: 2. And the <hi>fruits</hi> or <hi>benefits</hi> of his <hi>Crucified body</hi> and ſhed blood, are <hi>actually</hi> given us, that is, <hi>Pardon</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> merited for us thereby.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And among the Benefits given us, beſides the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, there are ſome ſuch as we call <hi>Real</hi> or <hi>Phyſical terminatively,</hi> and <hi>hyperphyſical originally ut à Cauſa,</hi> which are the <hi>ſpirit of Holineſs,</hi> or the <hi>Quickening, Illuminating</hi> and <hi>Sanctifying</hi> influence of the ſpirit of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63024:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt upon our ſouls. And the Sacrament is appointed as a ſpecial means of communicating this.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I have met with ſome of late who ſay, that Indeed Chriſts Body and Blood in his humbled ſtate, were not really eaten and drunk by the diſciples, at his laſt ſupper: For the <hi>fleſh</hi> profiteth not to ſuch a <hi>uſe:</hi> But that his <hi>Glorified Body</hi> is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and is extenſively commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, and inviſibly preſent under the form of Bread in the Sacrament; and that as we have a <hi>Body,</hi> a <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive life,</hi> and an <hi>Intellectual ſoul,</hi> ſo Chriſt is the life of all theſe reſpectively; <hi>viz.</hi> His <hi>Body</hi> is made the <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al nouriſhment of our Bodies</hi>; his <hi>ſenſitive ſoul</hi> (for which the word <hi>Blood</hi> is put, becauſe it is in the blood in animals) is the food or life of our ſenſitive ſouls; and his Intellectual <hi>ſoul,</hi> of ours: And to theſe uſes they aſſert the <hi>Real preſence</hi> and <hi>oral</hi> participation of Chriſts Glorified body.</p>
               <p>To all which I ſay, 1. Whether or how far an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible ſpiritual Body is <hi>preſent,</hi> ſenſe is no judge; nor can we know any further than Gods word telleth us. 2. That Chriſt in his Glorified <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> is our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour with God, through whom we have all things, we muſt not doubt. 3. That Chriſt in his Humane and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature now in Heaven, is that Teacher who hath left us a certain word, and that King who hath left us a perfect Law of Life, whom we muſt obey, and a promiſe which we muſt truſt, we muſt not queſtion. 4. That the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt who is our ſpiritual Life, is given us <hi>by, from</hi> and <hi>for</hi> Chriſt our Mediator, we muſt take for certain truth.</p>
               <p>But, though in all theſe reſpects, Faith apprehendeth and liveth upon Chriſt, yet that moreover his <hi>Glorified Body</hi> in ſubſtance, either feedeth or by contact purifieth our Bodies, and his ſenſitive ſoul, our ſenſitive ſouls, and his Intellectual ſoul, our Intellectual ſouls, as if in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63024:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>themſelves,</hi> and not in their effects only they were thus communicated to us, I underſtand not, either by any juſt conception of the thing it ſelf, or any proof of it from the word of God. But if any can help me to ſee it, I ſhall not refuſe inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Nor can I ſee why the <hi>ſoul</hi> of Chriſt ſhould be ſaid to be given in the <hi>Wine only,</hi> and not in the <hi>Bread</hi>; Nor why by this kind of Communication he may not as truly be ſaid to be given us in other Ordinances as in the Euchariſt: Nor know I what they mean by the <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> under which they ſay that Chriſts Body and blood is given: But I am paſt doubt that <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are ſtill really in ſubſtance there.</p>
               <p>And whereas the ſame men ſay that It is Chriſts humbled fleſh and blood as ſacrificed on the Croſs that is <hi>Commemorated,</hi> but his <hi>Glorified Body</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> only which are <hi>Communicated</hi> and <hi>Received,</hi> I muſt ſay, 1. That Chriſt plainly tells us of his <hi>Giving us his Sacrificed Body</hi> or <hi>fleſh</hi> it ſelf to eat, as he is the <hi>Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World:</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>Take, Eat, this is my Body which is broken for you,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that the ſame body is Commemorated and Communicated: But <hi>how Communicated?</hi> In the <hi>effects</hi> of his ſacrifice: His <hi>Body</hi> was given a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to God <hi>for us,</hi> and the <hi>fruits</hi> of that ſacrifice <hi>given to us.</hi> And thus he was given a ſacrifice for the <hi>life of the world</hi>; And thus we do receive him: By our bodily taking and eating the Bread, we profeſs that our ſouls take him to be our Saviour and Cauſe of our Life, <hi>both</hi> as <hi>Purchaſing</hi> and <hi>Meriting</hi> it on Earth, and <hi>Interceding</hi> and <hi>Communicating</hi> it in and from Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And this Doctrine will not ſerve the Papiſts turn, who tell us that <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are ceaſed, and that Chriſts very fleſh and blood is there, into which all the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63024:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſubſtance of the bread and wine are turned; and that his natural Body before his death, was in the ſame ſort given under the forms of Bread and Wine as now; and will not be beholden to this ſubterfuge.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is ſtrange if the Sacrament at the <hi>firſt Inſtitution</hi> ſhould be <hi>One thing,</hi> and ever after another thing; and that the <hi>Bread</hi> ſhould ever ſince be turned into <hi>Chriſts body,</hi> upon the Prieſts Conſecration, and not be turned into it, (becauſe not yet glorified) upon his own words [<hi>This is my Body.</hi>] Therefore we muſt let this go, and ſpeak of what they own and hold indeed. And as for any other <hi>Bodily preſence, influence</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Soul,</hi> beſides that which they call Tranſubſtantiation, we have nothing to do with it in this Controverſie.</p>
               <p>That the ſubſtance of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> is not turned into the ſubſtance of the <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt, is proved.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Becauſe the Glorified <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> and <hi>properly Fleſh and Blood:</hi> Though it be the ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me <hi>Body</hi> which was <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 Cor. 15.50, 51. [<hi>Now this I ſay, brethren, that fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, nor doth corruption inherit incorruption; Behold, I ſhew you a myſterie: We ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed.</hi>] It is not only Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> but other of the beſt expoſitors who ſhew that by <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>corruption</hi> here is not meant <hi>ſin,</hi> but <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally conſidered</hi>; which is ever corruptible: And the Papiſts commonly confeſs this. If therefore it be <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> which the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> are turned into, then either Chriſt hath two bodies, or two parts of one, which are utterly heterogeneal, one <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and the other not; one corruptible and the other incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And this feigneth Chriſt to be <hi>often Incarnate,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:63024:87"/>
even thouſands and millions of times; And to lay down that Incarnate body again as oft as it corrupteth, and to take up a new one as oft as the Prieſt pleaſe; and yet all but one. Whereas the Church and Scripture have ever told us but of <hi>one Incarnation</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And it is expreſly contrary to his promiſe Joh. 6.51. <hi>I am the living bread which came down from heaven: If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live for ever: And the bread which I give is my fleſh which I will give for the life of the world</hi>— v. 34. <hi>Who ſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life— He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him. As the living Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſent me, and I live by the Father, ſo he that Eateth me, even he ſhall live by me— He that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of this bread ſhall live for ever</hi>—.] Theſe are the expreſs promiſes of Chriſt. But the Papiſts ſay that <hi>wicked men</hi> and <hi>unbelievers eat the fleſh of Chriſt,</hi> who ſhall not <hi>live for ever,</hi> nor have <hi>eternal life,</hi> nor <hi>dwell</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but are more miſerable by their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</p>
               <p>I paſs by abundance of other arguments, becauſe commonly uſed, and theſe are as many as my ends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; and I would make the Reader no more work than needs.</p>

                  <p>I Have now made plain to you, 1. <hi>What the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Religion is,</hi> (or at leaſt <hi>my own,</hi> and all that I perſwade you or any other to embrace.) 2. And alſo that it is granted to be all true by the generality of the Papiſts (as is explained and proved.) 3. And I have told you, by an enumeration of ſome particulars, why I am not a Papiſt, and why I do diſſwade you from it. 4. And I have made good my firſt <hi>charge,</hi> in the point of Tranſubſtantiation, if any thing in the world can be proved. The ſecond I ſhall leave till another time, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew you how far their Religion (as Popiſh) is from Infallible Certainty; and what horrid confuſion is among them; and how they have done much to promote Infidelity in the world, by building Religion upon ſome notorious untruths, and upon a multitude of utter uncertainties. Though I doubt not but among them there are many true Chriſtians, who practically reſolve their faith into the ſurer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Divine Revelation, yet I ſhall clearly prove to you, that all thoſe whoſe practical faith is no ſurer or better, than the notional opinions of their Divines will allow, have no certain faith or Religion at all: And what impudency is it to make men believe, that there is no <hi>certainty</hi> of Religion to be had, but in their way, who build their Religion upon ſuch a multitude of <hi>uncertainties</hi> and certain falſhoods, as will amaze you when I come to open them to you, <hi>viz.</hi> that ever ſo
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63024:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many Learned men, and perſons of all ranks, can be induced ſo to jeſt in the matters of their ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>And if I be not by death or other greater work pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, I hope in order to make good all the reſt of the Charges before mentioned, which are our Reaſons againſt the Popiſh way of Religion. In the mean time tell me what you think of that which is already ſaid.</p>

                  <p>To this I have ſeveral things to ſay; 1. <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> doth not make men <hi>wiſe, holy, humble</hi> and <hi>ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi>; but ſets ſuch men apart for the ſacred office, who ſeek it, and have tolerable gifts of utterance: And it is too ordinary for worldly minded men, to make a worldly trade of the Prieſthood, meerly for <hi>eaſe,</hi> and <hi>wealth,</hi> and <hi>honour.</hi> In which caſe, do you not think that the Papiſts who have multitudes of rich benefices, prelacies, preferments, and Church-power, and worldly honour, are liker to be drawn by worldly intereſt, than ſuch as I that am exceeding glad and thankful, if I might but preach for nothing?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do you lay your faith and ſalvation upon plauſible diſcourſes? and will you be of that mans faith, whom you cannot confute? Then you muſt be of <hi>every mans</hi> faith: or indeed of <hi>no mans.</hi> There are none of all theſe ſects, ſo hardly confuted, as a <hi>Porphyry,</hi> a <hi>Julian</hi> or ſuch like <hi>Infidels</hi> who diſpute againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>truth of the Scriptures?</hi> or ſuch Sadducees as diſpute againſt the <hi>Immortality of the ſoul.</hi> Alas, the tattle of Papiſts, Pelagians, Antinomians, Separatiſts, Quakers,

I tell you, if you knew how much harder it is, to deal with one of theſe than with a Papiſt or any other Sectary, you would ſhake the head, to hear one man diſpute for an univerſal Monarch, and another diſpute againſt a form of prayer, and another whether it be lawful to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with diſſenters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> while ſo few of them all can defend their foundations, even the <hi>ſouls Immortality</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor confute a ſubtle Infidel or Sadducee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What if we <hi>all agreed</hi> to ſay that there is no Bread in the Sacrament after Conſecration? Were it ever the truer for that? Will you be deceived as oft as men can but <hi>agree</hi> to deceive you? There is a far greater party Agreed againſt Jeſus Chriſt (even five parts of the World) than that which is agreed for him: Will you therefore be againſt Chriſt too? There are more Agreed for <hi>Mahomet</hi> (a groſs upſtart deceiver) than are agreed for Chriſt: And doth that make it certain that they are in the right?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Will you deny all your ſenſes, and the ſenſes of all the World, as oft as you cannot anſwer him that denyeth them?

                  <p>They ſay that our talk of Prophets and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural revelation are all uncertainties; and if they could <hi>ſee,</hi> they would believe.

                  <p>But I oft think that the <hi>faith</hi> of all <hi>the Church</hi> is much ſurer than my ſenſe, or my private faith: At leaſt it is ſafeſt to venture in the common road, and to ſpeed as the Church ſpeedeth, which Chriſt died for, and is his Spouſe.</p>

                  <p>All true Proteſtants <hi>profeſs</hi> to take Gods <hi>word alone,</hi> or his Revelation in <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> for the whole <hi>Matter</hi> of their Divine Belief and Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But who it is that <hi>ſincerely believeth</hi> little do I know: nor how <hi>much</hi> of this <hi>word</hi> any ſingular perſon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth, and believeth, I can give you no account of.

If <hi>perſonal faith</hi> were that which we diſpute of, I would be accountable for no mans but mine own. In this ſenſe, There are as many <hi>Faiths</hi> and <hi>Religions</hi> as <hi>men</hi>: For every man hath his <hi>Own Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> And if you know that a man erreth in one point, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that he erreth in another. They that believed that the <hi>Reſurrection was paſt,</hi> believed a falſhood: and yet truly believed that <hi>Chriſt was the Meſſiah</hi>: They erred that thought it lawful <hi>to eat things offered to Idols</hi>; and yet they erred not in <hi>believing in Chriſt.</hi> No two men in the world, its like, have the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perſonal faith and knowledge; as I oft ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But if our profeſſed <hi>object</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> that is, <hi>Gods word,</hi> were falſe in <hi>one thing,</hi> we could not be ſure that it were true in any thing.</p>
                  <p>Yet here I told you before, 1. That a man may be much ſurer that <hi>one part</hi> of Scripture is <hi>Gods word,</hi> than <hi>another</hi>; becauſe ſome <hi>Copies</hi> are doubtful in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Readings of ſome particular <hi>words</hi> or <hi>ſentences</hi>; and which of them that ſo differ is Gods word, we oft know not: But ſo much as we are ſure is the word of God, we are ſure is true: So if the Authority of ſome few books was once doubted of, (as 2 <hi>Pet. Jam. Jud. Heb. &amp;c.</hi>) and yet be by any, it followeth not that they doubt of the truth of any, which they know to be the word of God. 2. Or if any do hold that the Penmen might be left to their natural fallibility in ſome by hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical circumſtances or words, it would not follow, that <hi>one Article</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian faith</hi> is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which is plainly as the Kernel of it, delivered in all the Scripture, and alſo by infallible Univerſal Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by <hi>it ſelf,</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament, Creed, Lords Prayer</hi> and <hi>Decalogue.</hi>

                  <p>This is to be the ſubject of our next Conference, and therefore not now to be anticipated; only I ſhall tell you, that It is a meer noiſe of ambiguous words to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the heedleſs that cannot ſearch out the meaning of them. 1. We not only <hi>Pretend,</hi> but <hi>Profeſs</hi> and <hi>prove that our Chriſtian Religion</hi> is altogether <hi>Infallible.</hi> For which end I have written divers Treatiſes my ſelf. 2. And we profeſs that all the myſtical Church of Chriſt (that is all ſincere Chriſtians) do truly and <hi>Infallibly believe</hi> all that is <hi>Eſſential to Chriſtianity,</hi> and as much of the <hi>Integrals</hi> as they can know. 3. And we profeſs that the <hi>Catholick Church-Viſible</hi> (that is, <hi>All profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Chriſtianity in the world</hi>) do <hi>profeſs all theſe Eſſentials</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and are <hi>Infallible in this profeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we hold withall, that there is no <hi>particular
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63024:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church,</hi> or <hi>Biſhop,</hi> no <hi>Synod</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> that is <hi>ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> but that, 1. They that hold to the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> may miſunderſtand and err about ſome <hi>Integrals:</hi> 2. And thoſe <hi>perſons</hi> have no Certainty that they ſhall not <hi>err</hi> by Hereſie or Apoſtacy from the Eſſentials themſelves: So that the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>Infallible,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>eſſentiated</hi> by <hi>believing an Infallible Word</hi>; which who ever believeth not, ceaſeth to be of the <hi>Church:</hi> not <hi>Gods Word infallible,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Church</hi> or any <hi>number</hi> of men <hi>believe</hi> it, or ſay Its true: For <hi>Truth</hi> is before <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith:</hi> As <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was a Philoſopher, becauſe he underſtood and taught the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of real Philoſophy; and not that doctrine cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Phyſicks</hi> or Philoſophy, becauſe that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> knew or taught it.</p>

                  <p>But to deal freely with you, methinks their way of meaſuring out the <hi>Neceſſaries</hi> in Faith and Religion according to mens various parts and opportunities, ſeemeth to me more ſatisfactory than yours, who fix upon certain points (as the <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant</hi>) as <hi>Eſſentials.</hi> For there is great diverſity of mens Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities.</p>

                  <p>This cometh from confounding ſeveral Queſtions as if they were all one.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is one Queſtion, <hi>What is the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. ☞ It is another Queſtion, Whether the Chriſtian Religion be abſolutely neceſſary to the ſalvation of all thoſe to whom it was never competently reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And it is another Queſtion, Whether more than the Eſſentials of Chriſtian Religion be not neceſſary
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63024:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the ſalvation of many who have opportunity to know more? Alas, what work doth Confuſion make in the world!</p>
                  <p>To the firſt, It is evident that as Mahometaniſm is a thing which may be defined, ſo much more may <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> Who that writeth of the ſeveral Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the world, Ethnick, Jewiſh, Mahometan, and Chriſtian, do not take them to be diſtinguiſhable and <hi>diſcernable?</hi> Eſpecially when Chriſt hath ſummed up <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> into a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and given it us in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words, and affixed a flat promiſe of ſalvation to the true <hi>Covenanters,</hi> and the Church hath ever called our Baptiſm, our <hi>Chriſtening?</hi> Is Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Nothing? If Something, Why may it not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and differenced from all falſe Religions? And if ſo, It hath its Eſſential Conſtitutive parts. All this is plain to Children that will ſee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And then as to the ſecond queſtion, it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not our Controverſie at all. It is but Whether any Infidels may be ſaved? Or any that are no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? And if it could be proved, that any are ſaved that are no Chriſtians, do you thereby prove that they are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or members of the Chriſtian Church? or that Chriſtianity is not a Religion which may be defined?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And as to the third queſtion, We are on all ſides agreed in it, That they that have more than the <hi>naked Eſſentials</hi> of Chriſtianity revealed to them aptly, are bound to believe more: Yea, it is hardly conceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that any one ſhould know and believe the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials only, and no more: It is not Eſſential to the Chriſtian Covenant or Chriſtianity to know that the Name of Chriſts Mother was <hi>Mary</hi>; or that <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was the man that condemned him; And if
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63024:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Ignorant man thought that his continuance in the Grave was four dayes, I do not think that this would damn his ſoul to Hell: (Much leſs the not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that <hi>Mary</hi> dyed a Virgin.) And yet it is not like that any man ſhould come to the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity by any ſuch way, as ſhould acquaint him with no one of theſe, or any point beſides the ſaid Eſſentials.</p>
                  <p>And yet it is certain for all this, that he that <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiveth</hi> the <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> and is <hi>true to the Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Covenant, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> whatſoever elſe he want: But it is as true, that he that <hi>Receiveth the Eſſentials, will</hi> (from the ſame <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>obligations</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>more,</hi> when it is aptly notified to him: And he that truly Covenanteth, will honeſtly keep the Covenant he maketh; which bindeth him ſtill to learn of Chriſt. But if any man be ſaved without the <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,</hi> he muſt be ſaved without Chriſtianity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>D.</speaker>
                  <p>But you know that they diſtinguiſh of faith <hi>Explicite</hi> and <hi>Implicite:</hi> He may be <hi>Implicitely</hi> a Chriſtian that believeth not the Eſſentials <hi>Explicitely</hi>; as long as he believeth that which would infer them; if they were made known to him to be indeed the Word of God.</p>

                  <p>Thus do <hi>Words</hi> abuſe and cheat the ignorant: Could you but read their own Dr. <hi>Holden</hi> before cited in his <hi>Analyſ. fid.</hi> you would find this diſtinction juſtly rendred by him ſhameful and ridiculous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their common ſenſe and uſe of it; and the truer ſenſe delivered and vindicated. An <hi>Implicite faith</hi> or <hi>Knowledge</hi> we confeſs to be true, as it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to 1. A <hi>diſtinct,</hi> or 2. To a <hi>well-expreſſed</hi> faith or Knowledge. For it is <hi>Implicite,</hi> ☞ 1. As to the <hi>Object,</hi> when a <hi>man knoweth the whole matter,</hi> but not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63024:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by <hi>diſtinct parts:</hi> As a man may know a Cup of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not know how many drops or drams it is; or he may know a ſentence, and not know how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny letters are in it. 2. Or it is <hi>Implicite</hi> as to the <hi>Act,</hi> when it is yet but a <hi>crude</hi> imperfect conception,<note place="margin">Apply this to Mr. <hi>Johnſons</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder on this Point, and you will ſee his Vanity.</note> and the <hi>thing</hi> is <hi>really</hi> known, but not the <hi>Logical notions,</hi> or Grammatical names, either the <hi>verba oris</hi> or <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> by which it ſhould be expreſſed: So that the man cannot notifie his knowledge to another. Theſe two are called <hi>Implicite</hi>; the firſt ſignifieth <hi>Confuſed</hi> and <hi>General Knowledge,</hi> and the other <hi>Imperfect</hi> and <hi>undigeſted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to call that <hi>Implicite faith</hi> or <hi>knowledge,</hi> which extendeth only to ſome <hi>Principles,</hi> and not to the <hi>Concluſions themſelves,</hi> is 1. To Call <hi>No-knowledge</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> by the name of <hi>knowledge</hi> and faith. 2. And by their application to confound the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> and to make all the Infidels and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to be Chriſtians, and every Fool a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. All men of Reaſon know theſe two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (who own a God), 1. <hi>That God is not a lyer, but all his Word is True.</hi> 2. <hi>That all the Truths in the world are God's, ſome way or other revealed by him.</hi> Therefore, if they knew that the Goſpel were <hi>Gods word,</hi> they would believe it: or if they knew it to be one of thoſe Truths that are in the world, they would take it to be of God. And thus all Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and Turks, and Pagans may (by ſuch abuſe) be called <hi>Implicite Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why then do the Papiſts burn the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>  when if their Religion were true, we are all <hi>Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63024:93"/>
Papiſts.</hi> For we believe, 1. That all Divine Revelations are True; 2. And that all thoſe are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible whom God hath promiſed to make Infallible; 3. And that all thoſe muſt be believed and obeyed whom God hath commanded us to believe and obey; 4. And that we muſt not forſake that Church which God hath commanded us to adhere to; 5. And that all our Lawful Paſtors muſt be reverenced and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to; 6. And all their lawful Precepts obeyed. 7. And all Gods Sacraments holily uſed; 8.

And yet we muſt burn for it, if they can procure it. And yet he is a true believer Implicitely who believeth not the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Deſign</hi> which is predominant here is too viſible, when this Implicite faith cometh to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: For it is not a Belief in <hi>God,</hi> or in Chriſt only that will ſerve the turn, but it muſt be a belief in <hi>the Church,</hi> and <hi>their Church,</hi> and their Pope too, or elſe it will not do. The Implicite faith is the explicite belief of theſe three Articles: 1. All Gods Word is true: 2. All that is Gods Word, which the Church tells us is Gods Word. 3. The Pope and his Council and Subjects are this Church. And yet this man muſt be ſuppoſed if he know no more, <hi>per impoſſibile,</hi> not to know that there is a Chriſt, or who he is as to his Perſon or Office, or what he hath done, or will do for us: And yet that he hath a <hi>Vicar</hi> and a <hi>Church.</hi> Or elſe they may know Chriſt and Chriſtianity before they know that there is any

                  <p>And 1. Do you not know that almoſt all the world was then Heathen and Idolaters? Alas, what was <hi>Judaea</hi> (leſs than <hi>England</hi>) to all the world?

And to this day, are not four ſixth parts of the whole world (at leaſt) Heathens and Idolaters? <hi>Brierwoods</hi> Calculation is, that if you divide the world into thirty parts, nineteen are Heathen, ſix Mahometans, and five only Chriſtians of all ſorts: beſides the vaſt unknown parts of the world, which are not like to have any Religion of ſupernatural Revelation.</p>

And do you not know, that <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>-Heathen were no Barbarians, but of moſt polite li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, and the Fathers of the Learning now in uſe; and that when the Chriſtians aroſe among them, they accounted them Barbarians? And at this day, and long before us, the <hi>Chinenſes</hi> have been addicted to Arts and Literature: And the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> and <hi>Bonzii</hi> are no Barbarians.

If your reaſon be good, how much more will it hold for the Heathens, than the Papiſts? Alas, what a handful are the Papiſts in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the preſent Idolaters! much more in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the <hi>Antient Heathen world,</hi> before <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> and <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> diſpoſſeſſed them of thoſe parts which they now hold!</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Do they talk of <hi>Antiquity?</hi> Why, it was the <hi>Novelty</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in compariſon of Heatheniſm through the world, which was it that hardned them to contemn and perſecute it.</p>

                  <p>But <hi>Chriſtians</hi> may well expect greater helps from God, than Heathens or Mahometans: Therefore that ſo many Great and Learned and Religious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould go ſuch a ſenſeleſs way to another world, methinks ſeemeth ſtrange.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. And are not the Proteſtants as Learned as the Papiſts? Why then will not your argument hold <hi>againſt them</hi> as well as <hi>for</hi> them?

                  <speaker>R.</speaker>
                  <p n="1">1. The Greek Church is judged by wiſe men, te be yet bigger than the Roman, even in this its broken ſtate: But there is no doubt but it was much bigger long after the firſt diviſion, before the Turk did win the Eaſtern Empire.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:63024:96"/>2. But, if it were not ſo, your objection is frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. The Queſtion is either of <hi>Different Churches,</hi> or of <hi>Different opinions</hi> and <hi>parties</hi> in the <hi>ſame Church.</hi> As to the firſt, There are but two opinions in the Chriſtian world, that I know of, about the Conſtitution of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> The one is the opinion of the <hi>Papiſts only,</hi> ☞ that <hi>The Catholick Church is eſſentially conſtituted</hi> both of <hi>Chriſt, and the Pope</hi> as <hi>his Vicar</hi> and <hi>univerſal Monarch,</hi> with all <hi>his ſubjects</hi>; as the <hi>pars Imperans</hi> and <hi>pars ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other is the judgement of all other Chriſtians, (that I know or hear of,) that <hi>The Catholick Church</hi> is <hi>eſſentially conſtituted only of Chriſt as the ſupream Head, or King,</hi> or <hi>pars Imperans,</hi> and <hi>his ſubjects</hi> as the <hi>pars ſubdita</hi>; ☞ And that Patriarchs, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but <hi>Officiales &amp; ſubditi primarii vel nobiles, conſtitutive parts indeed of their particular Churches</hi> (ſome humane, and ſome Divine) but no <hi>eſſential</hi> parts of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>☞ This is the Grand difference between the Papiſts and all other Chriſtians in the World, <hi>What the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church is? Whether it have any Conſtitutive <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Head</hi> or <hi>Monarch beſides Chriſt?</hi> Now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Greeks, Abaſſines, Armenians</hi> and all agree with us in this againſt the Papiſts, it is evident to them that are willing to ſee that we are all of the ſame <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> though not of the ſame particular Churches, nor all for the ſame Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Miniſters; Becauſe we are all for the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive <hi>Head,</hi> and his <hi>ſubjects as ſuch,</hi> and agree in all the Eſſential parts, ☞ So that our differences among all theſe parties or particular Churches or
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:63024:96"/>
Countries is but the difference of <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>parties in one and the ſame Church</hi>; and not a difference of Catholick Churches (which can be but one.)</p>
                  <p>And if that be the queſtion, I undertake to prove that there is no one Sect of Chriſtians known under Heaven, that hath ſo many different opinions within it ſelf, (if half ſo many,) nor have written half ſo much againſt one another, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have done.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But I muſt not here anticipate my further work: when I come to that, I ſhall ſhew you how <hi>ſmall</hi> and how <hi>diſagreeing</hi> a part of the Chriſtian world the Papiſts are. I have elſewhere recited the words of their <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> who boaſteth that the Papacy yet ſtandeth, though almoſt all the world, and beſides Princes, almoſt all the Biſhops and Churches have fought againſt it. Was it then the Univerſal Church? And the words of <hi>Reynerius</hi> who ſaith, that the Churches of the <hi>Armenians</hi> and the others planted by the Apoſtles (without the Empire he meaneth) were not under the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> I ſhall, if I live to do that work, yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier ſhew you, that the Pope was but the chief Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch in one Empire, as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> is the chief Biſhop in <hi>England</hi>; and that his General Councils were but General Aſſemblies of the Empire (inconſiderable occaſional acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals excepted), even as our Convocations, or the Scots General Aſſemblies were, though in a far larger Empire. But all this I have done already in other writings, beyond all reaſonable contradiction.</p>

                  <p>Alas poor man; You talk as if you knew not your ſelf nor mankind! how bad a thing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt unſanctified nature is! Why do you not alſo ask, How cometh it to paſs, that the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the World (even five parts of ſix) are Heathens and Mahometanes! and that moſt of the World are wilful ſelf-deſtroyers; many ruining their very bodies, Eating, and Drinking, and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Idling them into Gowt, Stone, Dropſies and an hundred Maladies: but far more ruining their ſouls. Why do you not alſo ask, How rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures (of all Profeſſions) are ſo worſe than mad, as to ſell their ſouls and everlaſting hopes, for a dream and ſhadow, or for dirt and dung; even for a few Cups or Morſels, or merry hours, which they know are like the mirth of drunkenneſs, which is quickly gone, and ends in ſickneſs and in ſhame! For a great Name, and a large attendance in their way to the grave! For the <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>breath</hi> of mortal man! And for that which all men firſt or laſt, are forced to call meer <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation!</hi> Were not men mad in ſin, had they never heard a Preacher, the ſight of a dead Carkaſs and a grave would do more to make them ſober and conſiderate, than is done with moſt. When moſt of the World will obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately follow the Devil their enemy, by known ſin to everlaſting miſery, againſt all the commands, exhortations, promiſes, threatnings, mercies and warnings of God himſelf, and all the perſwaſions of their trueſt friends, What wonder if the ſame men can be Papiſts or any thing?</p>
                  <p>But I will tell you ſome of the particular Cauſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:63024:97"/>I. Abroad in other Countries, there are all theſe Reaſons eaſily diſcernible. 1. Who knoweth not how great an advantage <hi>Education</hi> hath, to form mens judgements to almoſt any thing, how bad ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever? That which children receive, if it be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to their ſenſible intereſt, how commonly and tenaciouſly do they follow? Whence is it that the whole Empires and Kingdoms of Pagans are all of one mind; and the Kingdoms of Mahometans of another? One Kingdom almoſt all Greek Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and another Papiſts, and another Lutherans, and another Reformiſts, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Hath not education a great hand in this?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of the Countrey, and the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> which they converſe with, is of no ſmall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with mens minds. Eſpecially when men live where almoſt all <hi>are of a mind,</hi> they think that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> is a ſign of <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>modeſty</hi> forbiddeth them to be wiſer than all the Countrey.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And when they know few or none of another mind, how ſhould they know what they are? And when they hear an hundred lies againſt them, and never hear them ſpeak for themſelves, they think that the Law of modeſty, humanity and converſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to believe, that ſo Many, ſo Great, and ſo Learned and Religious perſons will not impudently lie: When as perhaps the lye it ſelf is a <hi>Tradition</hi> which the lyars received on the ſame terms in modeſt credulity from their teachers or fathers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And ſpecially, the Names of <hi>Order, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> deceive many millions of ſouls: For <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> are juſtly amiable to nature it ſelf. And the purblind know not an <hi>Image</hi> from a <hi>Man.</hi>

                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:63024:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>5. Eſpecially when civil Wars, or Church diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords have diſtracted the World, and made men aweary of all that's <hi>preſent,</hi> and ſuſpicious of all things, which ſeemed to have a hand in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments; this maketh men hearken to any thing which pretendeth to <hi>certain ſettlement, Order</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi> Even as a man that by turning round is wheelſick, will lay hold on the next poſt or fixed thing, to keep him from falling down.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And when their Teachers make them believe, that all Chriſtians beſides them do live like mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in Sects and Schiſmes, diſtractedly tearing out one anothers throats, What wonder if this make men willing of any way which pretends to peace, and glad to run into any Cottage which will keep them from ſuch a ſtorm?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But the great cauſe is, 1. The <hi>Blindneſs</hi> of mens minds, 2. The <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of all unrenewed hearts, and 3. The <hi>power</hi> of <hi>carnal Intereſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Few men are of <hi>great natural parts</hi> for wit, and fewer <hi>improve</hi> them, by any ſerious ſtudy of things ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Almoſt all men ſtudy with the byas of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> and <hi>partiality,</hi> and as men that <hi>would</hi> have <hi>one ſide</hi> to be <hi>right,</hi> becauſe it is for their worldly ends.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sin Ruleth in moſt ſouls, and the enmity againſt God and his Laws prevaileth in carnal minds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6, 7, 8. And <hi>enmity</hi> is an ill ſtudent and ſeeker of truth; and friendſhip is an incompetent judge of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. None but a few ſelf-denying perſons can bear to be reproached as Hereticks and Schiſmaticks by all about them.</p>

This makes them think, that they muſt ſeek ſome ſurer ſoberer way than any of us have yet found: and the Papiſts ſet in and tell them,
<q>[All theſe are branches broken off from the true Vine and withered; This it is to depart from the Catholick Church; when they are once gone thence, there is no ſtop or conſiſtence, till they crumble all to duſt and atomes: You muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, or go mad: You ſee

All this is eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by a man of underſtanding; But to the ignorant Vulgar, it ſeemeth unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And alas, how many have given them this ſcandal? <hi>Wo be to</hi> ſome by <hi>whom offence cometh.</hi>

                  <p>And therefore to your queſtion <hi>Why ſo many of late turn Papiſts,</hi> I ſhall but now concludingly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you, as I begun with you, concerning the Cauſe of your own doubts; They that have long lived under the light of the holy Goſpel, and among the mercies which have bleſt this Land, and yet have been ſincerely no true Chriſtians, but loved their fleſhly luſts and pleaſures, and their wealth and worldly honour, more than God, or holineſs, or Heaven, it is no wonder that they eaſily change their party, and can be, in <hi>ſiding,</hi> of <hi>any Religion</hi> who are in <hi>ſincerity</hi> of <hi>none</hi>; and if God forſake their underſtandings, and give them up to ſenſeleſs and unreaſonable opinions, who would not live according to the knowledge which they had, nor obey the truth which was clearly opened to them.

                  <p n="2">2.

but as there are ſome among them truly fearing God (though corrupt with the errours of their education) ſo there are more that <hi>are</hi> of kind and civil natures, which their ill opinions cannot make fierce and ſanguinary nor overcome.

                  <p>The beſt ſhifts that I know are, 1. To do as they do about the condemning of Pope <hi>Honori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> as a Heretick. They ſay that a General Council and Pope too may err in a matter of fact; and ſo they did in judging of <hi>Honorius</hi> his meaning: So they may ſay, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> did decree this as an Article of faith, only becauſe they thought that the Church ſo held it: which was becauſe they thought that the General approved Council of <hi>Laterane</hi> had ſo decreed it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But now finding that it was not ſo decreed there, the error in matter of fact ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was the ſuppoſition, the doctrinal error proveth to be no Article of faith, or <hi>Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liariter decretum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or if this will not do, they are beſt yet ſtretch the words of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> to a more tolerable ſignification, and ſay, That it is not the ceaſing of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine which is meant; but the changing it into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative new form: And ſo, as the <hi>Whole ſubſtance
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63024:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a man is changed</hi> from being a meer Common man, <hi>into a King, a Biſhop,</hi> a <hi>Doctor,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ceſſation of his Humanity; but only <hi>quia forma ultima denominat,</hi> he is not any more to be called meerly <hi>A Man,</hi> but <hi>A King, A Biſhop, &amp;c.</hi> Or, as the <hi>whole ſubſtance</hi> of a piece of Gold is changed into <hi>Currant Coin</hi> by the Kings Stamp, <hi>&amp;c. So the whole ſubſtance of Bread is turned into the (Repreſentative) Body of Chriſt, and the whole ſubſtance of Wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his (Repreſentative) blood; which change</hi> they call <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why ſhould I give counſel to men that will not thank me for it, and that obſtinately refuſe much better?</p>

                  <p>But why ſpeak you nothing of their deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people the Cup? I thought you would principally have faſtned on that.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe it is no part of this preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, which I was firſt to handle, though it concern the ſame Sacrament: But it is ſuch an inſtance, as ſerveth to tell thoſe of the world that will underſtand, what horrid <hi>unreaſonable, auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious arrogance</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> and <hi>Treaſon againſt God</hi> and the <hi>true Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Monarch of the world, and his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Catholick Church (the Popiſh Sect) are guilty of: conſidering,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is as <hi>eſſential</hi> a part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as the <hi>Bread</hi> is: For Chriſt hath made no difference.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It hath the ſame Inſtitution and expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: He that ſaid, [<hi>Take, Eat</hi>] ſaid alſo
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63024:105"/>
[<hi>Drink ye all of this:</hi>] He hath ſaid, [<hi>Do this in remembrance of me</hi>] of <hi>One</hi> as well as of the Other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore to take away an <hi>Eſſential part,</hi> is to take away the Sacrament, and make it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. As it is not a humane body that hath not both <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Heart:</hi> So here.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Therefore by the ſame authority they might have continued the <hi>Cup,</hi> and taken away the <hi>Bread</hi>; or have taken away both.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And on the ſame reaſon they might have taken away Baptiſm, and all Chriſts poſitive Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And for ought I know the Miniſtry it ſelf as inſtituted.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But then <hi>Gerſons</hi> queſtion, <hi>de auferabilitate Papae</hi> would be next to be debated: For were he of <hi>Chriſts own Inſtitution</hi> (as he is not) it is no more than the Cup in the Lords Supper. Could he but prove an Inſtitution of his Papacy as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, who would not be his Subject? If you ſay, But who ſhould take him down, if it might be done? I anſwer, Kings in their own Kingdoms, and his own General Councils. The Kings of <hi>France, Spain, &amp;c.</hi> may eaſily prove, that they have more power to caſt out the Pope, than he hath to caſt out half Chriſts Sacrament: And they may better forbid their own Subjects to obey a forreign Uſurper, than <hi>he</hi> can forbid all the world to obey Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And for all this, the wit of man can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deviſe <hi>What Reaſon they have to do it?</hi> What point of their Religion? What Intereſt of their own did engage them to it? Unleſs it be their
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63024:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Intereſt to ſhew that they are <hi>Above</hi> Chriſt and the Scripture, I do not yet diſcern their reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And yet they have, with Reſolution and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, perſiſted herein divers hundreds of years, and denyed the requeſts of Emperours, Nobles, and great part of ſeveral Kingdoms in this point.</p>
                  <p>This and the leaving out the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeem to be of purpoſe to ſhew that they are above the Maker of the Ten Commandments and of the Goſpel. How long Lord ſhall Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny oppreſs the Nations of the Earth, and the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Domination</hi> and <hi>Wills</hi> of Rebels, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to tread down Truth and Godlineſs, and keep the notice of thy ſalvation from the ſinful miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world; whileſt yet we daily pray by thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that <hi>Thy Name may be Hallowed, Thy Kingdome come, and Thy Will be done, on Earth as it is done in Heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether the Pope be the Antichriſt meant in the Scripture (by that name) or not, you ſee that my paſſing it by doth ſhew my cautelouſneſs in reſolving (as <hi>Zanchy</hi> and others before me have done), becauſe I am confeſſedly ſo far un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtudyed or ignorant of the ſenſe of the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and ſome other Scripture Prophecies, as that I muſt leave ſuch caſes to ſuch as Biſhop <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name</hi> and others that have deeper inſight into them: Every man ſhould be beſt at that which he hath moſt ſtudyed. But I muſt needs ſay, that though I take it to be indiſpenſible duty, to keep up all due charity to all profeſſed Chriſtians; ſuch inſtances as theſe which I have here opened do ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63024:106"/>
diſable me from confuting that man, who ſhall aſſert that this pretended Vicar of Chriſt, and King or Monarch of the world, (and ſo King of Kings, and Lord of Lords) is an abominable Uſurper, and inſolent Traytor, againſt God, and the true King and Head of the Univerſal Church. How long will Princes and Prelates, Learned and Unlearned be deluded by him, or fear Power? And when ſhall he be reſtrained from hindering Chriſts Goſpel, and the Peace and Concord of the Chriſtian world?</p>
