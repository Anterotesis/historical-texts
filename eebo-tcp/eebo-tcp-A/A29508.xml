            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Brightman</hi> in his Booke of the expoſition on the
Revelations, ſeriouſly conſidering and reſolving
himſelfe, that the 7 Epiſtles S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote to the 7
Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> were alſo written and directed
to the 7 ſucceeding Churches among the Gentiles, of
which thoſe 7 were a type or counterpane (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for brevity what he ſaith, concerning the other 4 Churches)
we preſent you with a briefe of what he more immediatly applies
to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>In generall (he ſaith) That there was a terrible ſtorme to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,<note place="margin">In his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and in chap. 3. ver. 10.</note>
and it would be ſuch an horrible tempeſt, that it would
terribly ſhake the Chriſtian Churches.</p>
            <p>Friſt, for <hi>Germany,</hi> there was the bittereſt ſcourge for it that
ever had fallen upon it, that it was to come ſhortly; <hi>Germany</hi>
ſhould be like a houſe that is robb'd by furious,<note place="margin">Chap. 3. verſe 10.</note> mad &amp; cruell ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
that would have no mercy of neither Sex, nor Age; and the
comming thereof ſhould be ſuddaine and unexpected, like a thiefe
in the night. Which we may ſee he truly foretold, it being fulfilled
in our cares, and the inhabitants thereof having found it by ſad
experience; let <hi>England</hi> take warning, conſidering what (he
ſaid) was the cauſe that would bring all this miſery: Becauſe
(ſaith he) they tooke no care for a full and through Reformation;<note place="margin">Chap. 3. ver. 10. v. 12.</note>
therefore by the juſt judgement of God, they ſhould looſe their
Citizens and Inhabitants; and they, with other Churches, ſhould
come to nothing, and ſhortly it would appeare: he cals <hi>Germany</hi>
by the name of <hi>Sardis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56501:3"/>
Secondly, for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and the other Churches ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to them;<note place="margin">Chap. 3. verſe 7. &amp;c.</note> (typified by godly <hi>Philadelphia)</hi> He ſaith, that
they ſhall ſhut and none ſhall open, and they ſhall open and none
ſhall ſhut: A Virgin Church, chaſt, not ſo defiled with <hi>Rome's</hi>
ſuperſtition as others; And ſpeakes of a <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Society</hi> they
ſhould he joynd in, and bids them, not to be perplexed nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
at what the world ſpitefully prateth of them, as if hee
had heard men in our times call them <hi>Traytors, Rebels, Seditious,</hi>
and bids them not to regard the ſcoffes of the wicked, who will
deſpiſe them, becauſe they are godly, little, lowly and weake in
viſible power, in compariſon of their enemies; For (ſaith he) no
enemy ſhall ſhall be able to prevaile againſt them, and they ſhall
ſet up a token of victory ſhortly; and every one ſhall be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to ſay, That they are dearely beloved of God: they ſhall be ſeen
to proſper ſo exceedingly; and ſo marvellouſly promoted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
beyond all mens expectation: And when that ſtorme and
horrible tempeſt ſhall come upon the Chriſtian Churches;<note place="margin">Chap. 3. 7, 8, 9 ver.</note> theſe
Churches ſhall ſtand faſt like a pillar, and be preſerved from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting;
when the other Churches which did not take care for a
full Reformation (as they did) ſhall by the juſt judgment of God,
come (as it were) to nothing: There ſhall bee (ſaith he) ſuch a
miſerable hutly burly of all things, that there ſhould ſcarce be the
forme of a Church perceived; but only with holy <hi>Philadephia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, for <hi>England,</hi> whoſe counterpane he takes to be <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi>
tearming it, <hi>Lukewarme, vaineglorious Laodicea;</hi> concerning it,
he ſaith: He that gathereth the teares of his children into his bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
knoweth right well; That I could never with dry eyes take a
ſurvey of this <hi>Laodiceas</hi> lamentable condition, but I powred out
teares and ſighs from the bottom of my heart, when I beheld
Chriſts loathing of us, and were it not that out of duty, as a
watchman, I dare not betray the ſalvation of this Chruch, by not
giving warning, I would have held my peace; but my hope is
that thoſe which love the truth will hearken and accept, and
thinke (as the truth is) I envy no mans perſon, honor or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
Yet when I perceived, that theſe ſeven Churches were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
for a tipe of all the Churches among the Gentiles; and
with all, ſaw the order, time, &amp; marveilous agreeing of all things
together, I durſt not perfidiouſly bury the truth in ſilence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56501:3"/>
In that Chriſt ſaith of this Church,<note place="margin">Chap 3. verſe 15.</note> I <hi>know thy works, that thou
art neither hot nor cold;</hi> he obſerveth, that Chriſt maketh mention
of no one good thing that it hath, the worſt of all the ſeven (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there were many faithfull in it) yet not any ſo paſt hope in
regard of the outward forme and government; which comes to
paſſe, not ſo much through its own default, as by meanes of the
faulty government of the <hi>Angels,</hi> who have ſo ordered and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
it, that it was tempered and blended together of ſtrange
contraries. <hi>A Hoch-potch,</hi> not ſo cold that we would be, <hi>all Romiſh,</hi>
and cleaving to ſuperſtiſion altogether; nor yet ſo hot that wee
purſue and admit a full Reformation: And therefore the diſeaſe
of this Church was more difficult and deſperate.</p>
            <p>Therefore from theſe words; <hi>I would thou wert either cold or
bot,</hi> ſaith he, I would thou wert either all <hi>Romiſh,</hi> or admit of a
through Reformation: blaming thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> only, and thoſe
that cleave to them, Prieſts and Laity; who being bewitched
with ambition and covetouſneſſe, do ſcornefully reject this holy
Reformation, not enduring the remedy, but accounting that
worſe than the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore he ſaith in plaine tearmes, That the Biſhops, which
he cals no better than Lord-Begger, becauſe their riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
(for the moſt part) they get by fawning, flattering, brib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
being ambitious to get under great men, and ſo creep into
the Court for preferment. But (ſaith he) both they and their
whole lukewarme Hierarchy, ſhall quite bee overthrowne,<note place="margin">Chap. 3. verſe 14.</note> and
never recover their dignity again: And at their overthrow, they
ſhall endanger the people, by reaſon of their conſenting to them:
Yet the people ſhall eſcape overthrowing, but it is to be feared
the people ſhall feele ſome adverſity; But God will not ſuffer the
Hierarchy to eſcape; for they ſeeking honors and riches, and not
thoſe things which are Chriſts, ſhall have reproachfull Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
few or none ſhall ſigh or ſob for them, but they and their
Prieſts ſhall be vile before the people, and men ſhall read the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
concerning them, with delight: And they ſhall be caſt
out and ſpewed up as vomit out of a corrupted ſtomack, that no
man will be willing to take up againe;<note place="margin">Chaq. 3. ver. 16, 17.</note> from theſe words, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
becauſe thou art lukewarme, and neither hot nor cold: It ſhall
come to paſſe that I will ſpew thee out of my mouth.</hi> For thou ſaiſt, I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56501:4"/>
am rich and increaſed with goods, and have need of nothing,
and knoweſt not how thou artwretched, and miſerable, and poore,
and blind, and naked.</p>
            <p>The whole State of this Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is worthy of ſerious
conſideration, as M. <hi>Brightman</hi> applyes it to <hi>England,</hi> in this and
divers other Chapters, for hee ſpeakes of our times as if hee were
now living.</p>
            <p>And further he ſaith in his Epiſtle and elſewhere in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
that many are the miſeries the Chriſtian Churches muſt
ſuffer, for there will be a long and dolefull Tragedy, which will
overthrow with ſcourges, ſlaughters, death and ruine; and that
the ſword of the Lord ſhall be made drunk in their blood, except
they receive warning and amend.</p>
            <p>But yet (ſaith hee) Bee of good comfort <hi>Germany, France</hi> and
<hi>Brittany,</hi> and all you Chriſtian Churches; This is the laſt Act;
for after this Theater and long Tragedy is paſt, there will ſucceed
in the room thereof happy dayes, with aboundance of peace and
all good things. And it is his Iudgment, (if I may not ſay his
Propheſy) comparing one Scripture with another, and times
with times:<note place="margin">Chap. 19. verſe 4.</note> That before the yeare 1650, that the Iews ſhall be
called; the whore of <hi>Romes</hi> noſe ſhall be ſlit, and ſhe ſtript of all
her glorious garments and attire, her power and ſinews cut, and
the Pope himſelfe ſhall run out of <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Avignion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In his Epi</note> or into
<hi>Bonia,</hi> or thereabout, one of his own Cities; and the City of
<hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be burnt with fire.</p>
            <p>And that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and the King of <hi>Ptolony,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 19. verſe 19.</note> and ſome
other Kings ſhall bewaile her, and would faine help her, but dare
not, becauſe they ſhall be afraid of their own ſafety, leaſt they be
devoured, or ſcorched with the ſame fire.</p>
            <p>And further he ſaith; that the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<hi>Rome,</hi> if he ſet to the worke, it being moſt proper for him;
but if he doth it not, ſome other ſhortly will have the priſe of
that victory:<note place="margin">Chap. 18. verſe 10:</note> Therefore (ſaith he) you godly Princes take the
matter in hand, and ſet to this worke; it ſhall not be a thing of ſo
great trouble as you think for; feare not the huge Armies will
come to help her; if you thinke the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or the <hi>French-man,</hi>
or any other King, will raiſe mighty forces againſt you to defend
her, as being <hi>Romes</hi> friends; theſe are altogether vaine feares,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56501:4"/>
ſcare-Crows,<note place="margin">Chap. 17. verſe 14.</note> Goblins, Bugbeares for ſimple people, for her friends
ſhall ſtand affarre off with waiting (teſtifying their love) ſighing
and ſobbing, but taking no paines, nor ſtriking a ſtroke to deliver
their <hi>Whore,</hi> being now an old withered Harlot, but crying, <hi>Alas
Alas that great City.</hi> And againe he further ſaith;<note place="margin">Chap. 17. verſe 16.</note> and you the reſt
of the Chriſtian Princes, you need do nothing, only be valiant and
of good courage in diſpatching your worke for the Lord, and
matters ſhall proſper as happily as you deſire;<note place="margin">Chap. 18. ver. 10, 11.</note> and underſtand at
length by what way you may procure, as to your ſelves honor and
tranquillity, ſo quietneſſe and joy to the whole Chriſtian world;
Therefore draw your Swords againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> for you ſhall prevaile.</p>
            <p>And ſaith he, within 45 years after <hi>Rome</hi> is deſtroyed;<note place="margin">Chap. 19. verſe 19.</note> The
Pope once more gathering all his friends together to try his laſt

1686,<note place="margin">Chap. 13, verſe 5.</note> which will be the longeſt time he can continue. But <hi>Rome</hi>
being deſtroyed, and the Iewes called, there will be then to the
end, a moſt happy tranquillity, and things very great indeed,<note place="margin">In his Ep.</note> and
to be admired; the Ioy will be ſo much that it will be ſtrange and
unexpected; for in the place of former troubles, there will be
perpetuall peace,<note place="margin">Chap. 20. verſe 24.</note> and then Kings and Queenes will be nurſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and nurſing mothers unto the Chriſtian Churches.</p>
            <p>Then the great Turke ſhall be 40 yeares on the decaying hand,<note place="margin">Chap. 9. verſe 15.</note>
and looſe many Countries; but in the yeare 1696, He alſo ſhall be
utterly overthrowne: And then Chriſt ſhall raigne with his
Ordinances chiefe in the world.</p>
            <p>They that pleaſe to examine theſe quotations in the margent,
by Maſter <hi>Brightmans</hi> Booke on the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which he wrote
above forty yeares agoe, they ſhall finde every noat either in the
ſame words, or to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Yet not to forget that he ſaith further of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
Although Chriſt be angry with us,<note place="margin">Chap. 11. verſe 16.</note> by reaſon we are ſo far from a
perfect reformation; and they which labour to bring in the Popiſh
Ceremonies hated of God, do indanger the overthrow of our
Kingdome; yet he ſaith Chriſt hath begun his Kingdome (at that
time he wrot) which was in the days of bleſſed Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
who happily begun and proceeded in the worke of Reformation,
according to the time and thoſe dayes ſhe lived in; the finiſhing
whereof will be required of this Generation; otherwiſe expect
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56501:5"/>
God hath a ſad controverſie with this Land, but Chriſt hath begun
his Kingdome both in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to raigne evermore;
and the enemies which ſhall endeavour many enterpriſes, yet
they ſhall vaniſh like ſmoke, and they ſhal never prevaile to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
Chriſt his Kingdome begun here;<note place="margin">Chap. 11. verſe 15.</note> for there will never
want Chriſtian Princes to maintaine His Truth begun; which he
ſaith began from the yeare 1558. for the Seventh Angell blew his
trumpet for this time, and ſaith he would raigne evermore,</p>
            <p>And laſtly, he ſaith (for the better underſtanding of what he
meanes) That the City of <hi>Rome</hi> is not limitted to that City, but
extends as far as the Pope hath any dominion;<note place="margin">Chap. 11. verſe 8.</note> So that the City
of <hi>Rome</hi> is in deſtroying, if any of her Dominions be in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
as he interprets the holy Ghoſts meaning: but the Pope is to
be quite and fully overthrowne at the yeare 1686. Therefore by
computation <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be in deſtroying at 1641,<note place="margin">Chap. 19. verſe 19.</note> in ſome of his
Dominions, So I conclude this briefe Relation (of what Maſter
<hi>Brightman</hi> largely iuſiſts upon, ſhewing his grounds in his Book
why hee affirmes theſe things) with Chriſts Counſell to this
Church of <hi>Laodicea.</hi>
