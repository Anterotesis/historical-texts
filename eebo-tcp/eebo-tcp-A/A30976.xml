            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Reverend Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received Yours, wherein you tell me, That some Emissaries have of late earnestly solicited some of your Parish, (and so belonging to your Cure and Charge) to desert the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and turn (as they would be call'd) <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks.</p>
            <p>The Motives (amongst some others) they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally insist upon, (you say) are these Two: <hi>First,</hi> That if they return to their Mother Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they will have (what they say, Protestants neither have, nor pretend to) <hi>a sure and Infallible Guide</hi> to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from all Error and Heresies; which will be a great Blessing and comfort to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They will free themselves from the great and mortal sin of Schism: For the Protestants (they say) neither have, nor can have any just reason to desert the Catholick Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and so their Separation from it, is evidently Schismatical.</p>
            <p>You desire me, to give You some directions, how to Reply to these Pretences, and fortifie your People against them, who are not skilled in such Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies. You should rather have apply'd your self to your Diocesan; for his Abilities, and immediate concern to assist you, being more than mine, I doubt not, but he would willingly have assisted you.</p>
            <p>But seeing you say, you are not particularly known to him, and therefore not willing (by any such Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress) to trouble him; and seeing we are bound to give a <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>reason</hi> of the hope and faith which is in us,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94780:3"/>
for the Confirmation of some, and Conviction of others; I shall (in obedience to your Command) crave leave to say a few things, and leave the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them to your Prudence, according to the several Circumstances of Persons, Times, and Places wherein You may have occasion to make use of any of them. And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the general, I shou'd advise; That when you have occasion to discourse of any of these Points, with the Romish Priests and Emissaries, who endeavour to seduce any of your Parishioners; you remember and observe that good Rule in the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.</note> Gospel—<hi>If any man be overtaken in a fault,</hi> You <hi>who are spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) in the spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> All railing, all bitter and provoking language should be avoided; and then by your good Reasons, and a Christian and Meek urging of them, you may possibly bring your Adversary to see the Errors of his own Church, which he endeavours to propagate in Ours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Infallibility of <hi>their</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, no man before</hi> Gregory <hi>the</hi> 7<hi>th. ever said. He tells us indeed, in his</hi> Dictatus Papae. <hi>Num.</hi> 22. —Quod Romana Ecclesia nunquam erravit, nec (Scriptura Teste) in perpetuum errabit. <hi>Vide</hi> Edmundi Richerii <hi>Historiam Concil. Generalium cap.</hi> 13. <hi>pag.</hi> 197. <hi>Edit. Colon.</hi> 1680.</note> 
               <hi>Church</hi> (of which they continually, and (without any thing like a good reason) so vainly boast of.) I consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That if it did (which neither does, nor even can) really appear, that they had an Infallible Guide, we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are not so irrational as not to follow an Infallible Guide; nor so simple, to take an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> for a real and true fire, and believe they have such a Guide, because (against evident reason) they confidently say so.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94780:3"/>2. They are not yet agreed amongst themselves, who is their Infallible Guide: And can they think it possible for them to perswade us, that they have an Infallible Guide, when they themselves know not who it is? For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many of them place this Infallibility in the Pope, so <hi>Gratian</hi> (and the Canonists who follow him) who tells us: That <note n="(a)" place="margin">Sic omnes Apostolicae se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis Sanctiones accipiendae sunt, tanquàm ipsius divini <hi>Petri</hi> voce fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matae. <hi>Can. Sic omnes</hi> 2 <hi>Dist.</hi> 19.</note> 
               <hi>all the Pope's Sanctions are to be taken as if they had been confirmed by the divine mouth of S.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And the <note n="(b)" place="margin">

And to this purpose, the Jesuits make the Popes as <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successors, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; <hi>not only in matters of Faith, but of Fact too:</hi> as appears by their famous <note n="(g)" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Many place the Infallibility in the Pope and Church, or General Council concurring: So the Clergy <note n="(h)" place="margin">
                  <hi>See the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the French Clergy, Mar.</hi> 23. 1662. <hi>Art.</hi> 4.</note> of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Others in a <hi>General Council</hi> without the Pope: So the Council of <hi>Pisa</hi> and <hi>Constance,</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> in which several Popes are condemn'd as Hereticks, Schismaticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the supream Power to be in the <note n="(i)" place="margin">

            <p>Now is it not unreasonable for them to boast of an Infallible Judge of Controversies, and think to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94780:4"/>
us to believe it; when they themselves know not who that Judge is. If <hi>Sempronius</hi> were very sick, and <hi>Caius</hi> coming to him, and pitying his condition, should tell him, that there was an excellent Physician in that City, but knew not who he was, nor where to find him: <hi>Sempronius</hi> would have little comfort or benefit from such a story. No more can we from them, who tell us (with great confidence, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any just proof or probability) that they have an Infallible Guide in their Church, but can neither tell us who it is, or where to find him.</p>
            <p>But to manifest the exceeding vanity of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to an Infallible Guide; there are certain, and (to all Impartial Judges) evident reasons to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, That neither the Pope, nor Council, nor both together are Infallible.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">

               </note>1. For the Pope, they say, that he is Infallible as S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successor, and (as <hi>Peter</hi> was) Vicar of Christ. But this is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> without any just proof or probability. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Admit S. <hi>Peter</hi> was 25 years (as they say) Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi>; (which is evidently untrue) yet that he left Infallibility to his Successor there, is an Assertion which has no ground in Scripture, or Antiquity; the Popes themselves not so much as pretending to Infallibility, for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years after our Blessed Saviour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apostle, and as Infallible as <hi>Peter,</hi> and planted many Churches in <hi>Asia, Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Achaia, &amp;c.</hi> and left his Successors there: But it is confess'd, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not leave his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to any of his Successors, (not to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> nor <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete</hi>) and therefore,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94780:4"/>
that <hi>Peter</hi> should (which S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not) leave his Infallibility to his Successor, is a Position for which they neither bring, nor can bring any just proof.</p>

            <p n="1">1. That a General Council is never so much as named in Scripture, nor any promise of Infallibility given it. The <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Trent,</hi> and others vainly pretend to it) is an Assertion without all proof or probability.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But there is no necessity of such an Infallible Guide, as a General Council; because Christians for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages, have attain'd Heaven and Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who never had any General Council to be their Guide. For 'tis certain, and on all sides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd, that the first Nicene Council, which was held <hi>An. Christ.</hi> 325. was the first General Council, the Christian Church ever had. Now I desire to know (and you may ask those who endeavour to seduce your Parishioners) whether the Christians in those 325. years, (when there was no General Council) were saved or not? If they were saved, then 'tis evident that a General Council is not necessary to guide us to Heaven; seeing Christians for 325. years obtain'd Salvation, and yet in all that time, there was no General Council to guide them.</p>
            <p>But if it be said, Christians (for want of a General Council to guide them) were not saved in those three Centuries; Then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They contradict the sense of Christendom, and the constant testimony of Fathers and Historians, who universally tell us of thousands, not only of pious Christians, but of many hundred thousands of pious Confessors and Martyrs. Now to say that they were not saved, who laid down their lives for Christ and his Gospel, is such an uncharitable and unchristian Censure, as no sober Christian ever did, or (I believe) ever will be guilty of.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94780:7"/>2. They contradict their own Martyrologies, their Missals and Breviaries, wherein they acknowledge many hundred Saints and Martyrs who lived and dyed in those 3 Centuries, and in their Offices pray to them, as to glorify'd Saints and Martyrs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But to put the case (in short and) beyond dispute, it is certain there never was any truly General Council, or any Synod wherein the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Universal Church did meet and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Controversies. The greatest Council the Christian Church ever had, was only Imperial, of the Roman Empire, not Universal of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; few, if any, out of the Roman Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever call'd, or coming to any of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils we now call General or Oecumenical. 'Tis true, there are several Councils (as the first of <hi>Nice,</hi> that of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon, &amp;c.</hi>) which we commonly call Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or General Councils; but then the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (whence we call a Council Oecumenical) must be taken in that signification it has in <note n="*" place="margin">

               </gap> there, the Roman world on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly must be meant, or the Roman Empire; for <hi>Augustus</hi> had neither intention, nor any Authority to tax any, but his own Subjects. So when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours call'd Councils (as is evident they did call all the first <note n="‖" place="margin">This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd, &amp; learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly proved by a Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> Doctor, <hi>Edmund.

               <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Councils) they had neither Intention, nor any Authority to call those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians which were out of their Empire, and none of their Subjects. Now 'tis evident that when the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94780:7"/>
               <hi>Nicene</hi> Council was call'd, and others after it, a very great part of Christendom was without the bounds of the Roman Empire, whose Bishops as they were never call'd, so they never came, as may appear by the Subscriptions to the Councils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it not irrational for them to boast of the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their General Councils? when their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid Bellarm. de Concil. &amp;c. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6, 7.</note> Writers, and Publishers of their Councils, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculously contradict themselves, and give us this distinction of General Councils. 1. <hi>Generalia Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia approbata.</hi> 2. <hi>Concilia Gen. reprobata.</hi> 3. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia Gen. partim approbata, partim reprobata.</hi> 4. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium Gen. nec approbatum nec reprobatum.</hi> They mean the first of <hi>Pisa,</hi> about the year, 1409 which they will not <note n="‖" place="margin">

They will not approve it, because it condemn'd and depos'd 2 Popes, as Schismaticks and Hereticks, and they dare not condemn it, because it made <hi>Alexander</hi> the 5<hi>th</hi> Pope, whom they reckon in the Series of their true Popes; which he could not be, if that Council had not a just power to make him so.</note> approve nor reject. In short, if General Councils may be reprobate and rejected, then sure they are not Infallible.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It seems your Emissaries (to perswade your People to desert the Church of <hi>England</hi>) tell your Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is in a miserable condition for want of (what they have) an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Guide and Judge of Controversies.</p>
            <p>For hence it is (say they) that our Church is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into so many Sects and Factions, some being Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, some Independents, some Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this you may with great reason and truth reply; That they have in the Roman Church, more Sects and Factions, than we have in <hi>England</hi>; &amp; they differing in things of an higher nature, such as concern the Being of the Papacy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94780:8"/>For, to say nothing of the late great, and hot diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and disputes between the <hi>Jansenists</hi> and <hi>Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and their Adherents on the one side, and the Jesuits and Franciscans on the other: Their Church is divided into great Sects and Factions, which differ in things which concern the foundation of their Church and Papacy.</p>
            <p>For, (to omit others) many in their Church pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly affirm and maintain, 1. That the Pope is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. 2. That he is the Supream Head of their Church above all General Councils, and that no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal lies from him to the Council. 3. That his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy is not only in this Ecclesiastical, but (at least <hi>indirectè</hi>) in temporals too. 4. That he has power to depose Kings, (as for other causes so) for Heresie; 5. and to absolve their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance, and give away their Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And altho' these Opinions pass (with approbation) at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they are all (of them) deny'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the Church of <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>In their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of</hi> March 23. 1662.</note> 
               <hi>France,</hi> and thousands more, who publickly and in Print declare against them as Erroneous and Impious, highly <hi>prejudicial</hi> to the Rights of Kings and temporal Princes, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Peace of Christendom. Now if our Sects in <hi>England,</hi> have risen and continued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have no Infallible Judge to determine the Controversie; Then (by a parity of Reason) seeing their great Sects and differences in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> remain undetermin'd, it must follow, that they want an Infallible Judge to determine those Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies. So that it is (to give it no worse name) a very strange confidence in your Roman Emissaries, to think they can perswade Protestants to desert the Church of <hi>England,</hi> because there are some Sects and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94780:8"/>
Divisions in it; and yet perswade them to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which there are far more and more material Sects, and undetermin'd Divisions: for this were (as the Country Proverb is) to perswade us out of the Frying Pan into the fire, and (instead of bettering it) to put us in a worse condition.</p>
            <p>Let them make it appear, that they are indeed at Unity amongst themselves, and no Sects or Divisions amongst them; then this Argument may have some more shew of Probability; but (as the case now stands) it is not only irrational, but ridiculous. I say, some more shew of Probability, yet no just proof. For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit they were at Unity amongst themselves, yet there are many other gross Errors and Superstitions, which (while retain'd by their Church) makes all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them impossible; but enough of this (if not too much) for nothing can be (to an Intelligent and Impartial Judge) more evident than this; That since the decease of the Apostles, there never was any Man or Congregation or Council of Men, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Infallibility for above a thousand years after our Blessed Saviour.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is so far from having (what she commonly and vainly boasts of) Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that there neither is, nor ever was any Christian Church in the world in such a miserable condition; for the great incertainty of her Faith and Religion; which incertainty arises from her own Principles, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd and receiv'd by the Supream Authority of that Church, and they are two,

            <p n="1">1. That no man in their Church can be certain that he is a Christian, or that there is any one true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in the whole Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For if they be not baptiz'd, then 'tis certain they are no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, nor Members of the Visible Church; and that they are truly Baptiz'd is impossible for man certainly to know. For if the Minister who Baptiz'd him, did not intend it, he is not Baptiz'd; and what the Minister intended, God only (who knows the heart and our Intentions) can certainly know.</p>
            <p>It is true, if I Baptize any Person, I may certainly know my own Intentions, that I did intend to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize him; and so I may be certain he is truly Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd; but whether he who Baptiz'd me, did intend it, is impossible for me certainly to know. So that although I may certainly know that another man is truly Baptiz'd, yet no man in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> can be certain that he is so. All the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance I can have, that I am truly Baptiz'd, and a Member of the Christian Church, is, from the Minister who Baptiz'd me. But he being always Fallible, and (for ought I do or can know) may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94780:9"/>
be false; such a testimony cannot assure me that I am truly Baptiz'd, and indeed a Christian, within the Church; and then seeing—<hi>Extra Ecclesiam non est salus,</hi> it follows, that (for ought I do or can know) I am in a miserable and damnable condition.</p>
            <p>Now suppose a General Council, call'd by the Pope or Emperor, if they are not Christians, I may be sure they are not Infallible Judges; God (as is and must be confess'd) having never promised Infallible assistance to any without the Christian Church: and that they are Christians I can never certainly know, because 'tis impossible for me to be assur'd that they have been truly Baptiz'd, by any Minister really intending it.</p>
            <p>Now admit they were Infallible Judges, yet they cannot be so to me; who can never be sure they are so. For I can have no more Assurance of their Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than I have of their Christianity, of which 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for me to be assur'd, seeing it is impossible for me certainly to know, whether they be Baptiz'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Upon the same Principle it is impossible for any certainly to know, whether there be any one true Priest in the whole Papacy; and consequently that there is any true Bishop, (for it is certain, every true Bishop must be a Priest) now if none can be certain that there is any true Bishop or Priest in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; then (seeing it is certain, that Bishops and Priests, and true Orders are necessary to the Being of a True Church) it evidently follows, that they are so far from being certain, that their Church is Infallible; that they neither are, nor can be certain, that their Church is any True Church at all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Upon the same Principle, (Marriage being with them a Sacrament, and the Intention of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94780:10"/>
who marries any, being necessary to make the Marriage good and valid) all marryed People in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for ought they do, or can know (not knowing the Intention of the Priest who marryed them) may live in perpetual fornication, and their children (if they have any) illegitimate, as begot by Fornication, and not in lawful Marriage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And on the same Principle, none in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> can be certain, that the Bread in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist is truly Consecrate, (because the Priests intention, who Consecrates, cannot possibly be known to them) and if it be not truly Consecrate, it (as is confess'd) remains Bread, and then (as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd too) they in Worshipping it, are most impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Idolaters, worse than they of <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Now let any intelligent and pious Person judge, whether our most wise and gracious God hath left his Church in such a miserable condition, that it shou'd be in the power of wicked Ministers, to make all his People abominable Idolaters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second thing I nam'd, from which the great incertainty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches Religion (tho' they vainly brag of Infallibility) arises, is their deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the certainty of our Senses. For this being deny'd, it will evidently follow, that the Roman Catholicks neither have, nor can have any certainty of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: That this may appear, consider,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94780:10"/>1. That our Blessed Saviour ordain'd his Apostles to <hi>be</hi>

            <p n="2">2. And that they might be sufficient Witnesses, He appear'd several times to them, that they might <note n="‖" place="margin">

               <hi>him</hi>; blames them for not believing those who had seen him after his Resurrection; and S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, that <hi>these</hi>

                  <hi>Act.</hi> 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>were infallible proofs</hi> of his Resurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so thinks S. <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1.</note> 
               <hi>John</hi> too.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks deny this certainty of our Senses, and tell us; that the Bread in the Eucharist after Consecration, is not Bread, but the very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed Body of our Blessed Saviour; (tho' all our Senses assure us, That 'tis Bread still) and tell us that we must not trust our Senses, but believe it to be his Body. Well, ask them how they know it is his Body? they say by Faith; but how came they by that Faith? They say (as the Text saith) by <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.</note> 
               <hi>hearing</hi>: But then 1. Sense (they say) is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Assurer of what we have by it. 2. If all my five Senses may be deceiv'd, in judging the Wafer to be Bread, certainly their Hearing, (which is but one) may be deceiv'd: And then all their Faith, and the certainty of it, depending upon their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (none of the Senses according to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, being to be trusted in matters of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they may deceive us) it manifestly follows, That they are so far from Infallibility, that they neither have, nor can have any (so much as moral) certainty of any thing they Believe. But (if not too much) enough of this. For indeed, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Infallibility are so weak, that they deserve no confutation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:94780:11"/>I come now to the second thing, which you desir'd me to do; that is, to give some Reasons to justifie <hi>our Separation from Rome,</hi> that it may appear, that we are not (what they commonly miscal us) Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. And here it is to be consider'd,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Schism (to pass by all other significations of the word) is a <hi>Criminal or sinful</hi> violation, or a breach of Ecclesiastical or Church-Union, which Union is two fold,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Internal,</hi> consisting in an Union of Judgment, and that mutual Love and Charity which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians ought to have mutually one to another.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>External,</hi> consisting in an outward profession of the same Faith, Communion in the same Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies and Sacred Offices and Sacraments.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Schism, (as now we speak of it) does not consist in a violation or breach of that Internal Union of Judgment and Love (tho' this may, and is call'd Schism <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. where <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the will, (for the word does properly and usually signifie the will) and so, some Learned Papists render the words; <hi>In eadem sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia, &amp; eadem voluntate</hi> So <hi>Hen. Holden,</hi> a Sorbon Dr. on this place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. in his Notes.</note> in Scripture, and is a sin) for such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Divisions, and breach of the Union of Love and Judgment, are not of humane cognizance, nor can the Church know who are, or censure, such Schismaticks.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But Schism (in the sense we now speak of) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in a Violation or breach of the External Church-Union, when men refuse to Communicate with their Fellow-Christians, in the Belief of the same Creed, coming to the same publick Prayers, and receiving the same Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. This Schism must be a Criminal or Sinful Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; when those who separate have no Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94780:11"/>
and firm grounds to justifie their Separation. For if any Church hath Apostatiz'd from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and true Christian Faith, and (as necessary conditions of her Communion) require of her Members, to believe any thing <hi>in fide</hi> erroneous, or to do any thing <hi>in facto</hi> impious; then Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from such a corrupted Church, is so far from being Schismatical and sinful Impiety; that it is a <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>necessary duty.</hi> This is on all <hi>sides</hi>

               <hi>confessed,</hi> that 'tis no Schism to Separate from an erroneous Church; It being evident that no Christian can be bound to Communicate with any Church in Errors or Impieties; and therefore may without any Schism, lawfully Separate from such Churches, whether that Church disbelieve and deny any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Ancient and True Christian Faith, or (which the Pope and his party do) add new ones, inconsistent with it, and the truth of the Gospel, and that Faith which our Blessed Saviour and his Apostles deliver'd to the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>The Premisses concerning the Nature of Schism, consider'd, and (as they are and must be) granted: I say, That the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are so many, and grievous, that they are a just ground to condemn Her, and to justifie our Separation from her. I shall only instance in some few; and the first <note n="*" place="margin">1.

The Apostle commends <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he had <hi>known the Scriptures from a</hi>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94780:13"/>
Apostle) it was a happy and powerful means for the Salvation of it. 3. St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 7.11, 12.</note> preaches the Gospel to the Jews at <hi>Berea</hi>: they had, and daily search'd the Scriptures, whether those things which <hi>Paul</hi> preach'd, were so. The Apostle commends them for it, and shews them the great benefit and blessing they gain'd by doing it. <hi>They daily searched the Scriptures, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (says he) <hi>Many of</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="margin">

               <hi>them believed.</hi> Their having and reading the Scriptures (the Old Testament) in their vulgar Tongue, was a happy and powerful cause and means of their Believing the Gospel, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> preach'd. 4. S. <hi>John</hi> assures us, that the Gospel was by him writ to that very end, <hi>That</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31.</note> 
               <hi>we might believe, and have eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reading and Knowing of the Scriptures was the means God himself had appointed to bring us to true Faith and Salvation: and therefore to forbid all reading or hearing the Scriptures in a vulgar and (to the People) intelligible Language, is to contradict God and his Apostles, and to deprive men of the great and effectual means of their Salvation. 5. S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> writing to the dispersed <hi>Jews</hi> (who by God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment had, and read the Scriptures in their vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tongue) he admonisheth and requires them; <hi>That as new-born babes they should</hi>

               <hi>desire the sincere milk of the word, that they might grow thereby.</hi> As the Mothers milk is a wholesom nourishment for young Children, to preserve and promote a temporal life; so (in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Judgment) the Scriptures are a wholesom nourishment for young Christians to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and promote a Spiritual Life, and therefore he exhorts them to desire the sincere <hi>milk of the word, that they may grow thereby:</hi> And farther, as to take away Milk from new-born Children, were evidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just

in it self, and pernicious to the Children; so to take away the Scriptures from young Children in Christ, would be equally (or rather more) impious in him who should take them away, and more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them from whom they are taken. Because taking away the Mothers milk from Infants, and young Children, is only prejudicial to the Body, and a temporal Life; but to take away the Scriptures from young (or any) Christians, is prejudicial to their Souls and Salvation. 6. But altho' S. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the <hi>Jews</hi> to desire the sincere milk of the Word, that is to read and understand it, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their Souls; for he well knew that they had the Scriptures given by God himself, in their vulgar Tongue, and that there was none then, who would hinder them to read them. And tho' our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <note n="*" place="margin">

But let <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and our Blessed Saviour himself, say what he will for dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently reading and searching the Scriptures in any vulgar, and (to the people) known Tongue; his pretended Vicar, in contradiction to our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apostles, does absolutely condemn all such Reading of Scripture, as dangerous, and (to the people) pernicious.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94780:14"/>Lastly, you may (if you think it convenient, and have an opportunity) propose this case to your Popish Emissary (who ever he be) that endeavours to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your Parishioners from truth, and the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Suppose <hi>Sempronius,</hi> a great and very rich man, make his last Will and Testament, and divide his estate amongst his Children, and give many considerable Legacies to his Friends and Servants; and in his Will particularly expresses what, and to whom, and upon what conditions his Legacies are bequeath'd: now <hi>Sempronius</hi> dyes, and some great man has got his Will into his hand and keeping, and (it being a Will in a Language not understood by the Legatees) will neither let them have the Will, nor a true and attested copy of it, in a Language they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand: So that they cannot be assur'd, nor any way certainly know, either who are (by the Will) Legatees, or what the Legacies are, or upon what conditions they are given; save only, as he who keeps the Will, shall be pleased to signifie to them; who (if he be not an honest man) may cheat and cousin them, and they have no remedy to secure their right, especially, if he who keeps the Will be, or pretend to be a supream Power, from whom lyes no appeal to any superiour Judge, who might examine the cause, and do them justice. In this case, 'tis most evident, that he who keeps the Will is unjust in himself, and injurious to the Legatees, in keeping them from the knowledge of the Testators Will, and so from the knowledg of what he has given them. This being granted, (as of necessity it ought and must) you may desire him (as a like case) to consider,</p>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:94780:15"/>2. That he liv'd and dy'd for his Church, and in his Will, left exceeding great Legacies to his Saints and Servants, with the conditions he required of the Legatees, to make them capable of those Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Gospel was his last Will and Testament, in which, who are Legatees, and upon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions their Legacies become due, are particularly express'd.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His Will was writ in a Language the People do not now understand; and the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> having got it into his hand, and pretending that he (as Vicar of Christ) is the <hi>sole</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>Supream keeper</hi> of it, does abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny the People any copy of it in any vulgar Language, by them understood; and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them of the knowledge of their Blessed Saviour's Will and Testament, of the gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and great Legacies given in it, and of the holy Precepts and conditions required of the People, to give them a right to those Legacies. So that (in contradiction to our Blessed Saviour's express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) they must neither search or read, or have the Gospel (in any vulgar Tongue by them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood) upon pain of Excommunication. They are not permitted to read the Gospel, nor must they trust to their own eyes and understanding, (tho' given them by God for that purpose) but they must believe the Church, and the Pope (or rather an ordinary Priest from him) must tell them, what Legacies are given, and what Duties are requir'd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94780:15"/>
by our Blessed Saviour in the Gospel. Now in the former case, if the keeping <hi>Sempronius</hi> his Will from the Legatees was evidently unjust, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Legatees: much more will the detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Blessed Saviour's Will from his People (the Salvation of whose Souls, are so highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it) be unjust in the Pope and his party; and not only injurious, but pernicious to the People. For in <hi>Sempronius</hi> his Will, the Legacies were only temporal things, and so the loss of them less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable: But in our Blessed Saviour's Will and Testament, the Legacies are Spiritual, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Grace here, and eternal Glory hereafter; and therefore to take away the Gospel from the People in any Language understood by them, so that they cannot certainly know the Promises, or their duties requir'd for the attaining of them; is (as I said) not only injurious but pernicious to the poor people, detain'd from the only means to know those things, which (in order to their Salvation) they are (by the Law of God and the Gospel) bound to know. For 1. Without the knowledge of Christ, and belief in him, there is no possibility of Salvation, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3.) And 2. such knowledge of our Blessed Saviour, whereon we may fiducially, and with certainty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, can no where be had but in Scripture, the only Infallible rule of our Faith. 3. Now the Pope and his party, severely prohibiting the People to read, or have the Scriptures (or any part of them) in any vulgar Language which they understand, do by consequence deprive them of the only sure, and certain means of their Salvation. Which how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming it is, the pretended Successor of S. <hi>Peter</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:94780:16"/>
(who was commanded by our Blessed Saviour, to feed his Sheep, not to famish them, by taking the Scriptures from them) and how pernicious to the poor People, let the Reader judge. 4. And that the Pope (<hi>quantum in se est</hi>) deprives the People of the knowledge of Scripture (besides what is above said) I shall only add a signal passage out of a late Popes Bull, wherein he condemns a French Translation of their own vulgar Latine in these words, <note n="*" rend="inter">
                  <hi>See the Bull of</hi> Clement <hi>the</hi> 9<hi>th. cited a little before, where the Pope says</hi>— Librum Versionis Gallicanae N.

            <p>The Premisses consider'd, I believe that intelligent and impartial Judges, (who love and seek truth) will think, that we had just reason to forsake the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which unjustly (in contradiction to Scripture and the practice of all Christian Churches, (except her self) took the Holy Scriptures from us, and consequently depriv'd us of the happiness which God himself had given us, to be a sure and sufficient ground of our spiritual comfort, and hope of Heaven. For (tho' they are pleas'd to contradict it) the Apostle <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.</note> 
               <hi>assures us, That whatever things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning, that we through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope.</hi> The Scriptures were dictated by the Holy Ghost, and given to the Church (not to be lockt up in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Language, but) for our Learning, and a firm foundation of our comfort and hope of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Gospel was dictated by the Holy Ghost, and given to this very end, that it might be an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and <hi>powerful means to bring us to true Faith, and

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor is the Scripture an imperfect and defective means, or (without Traditions) unable to beget such a Faith, as will bring us to eternal life: For the Apostle (who knew better) expresly tells <hi>Timothy,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>By the Premisses, I think it may and (to impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judges) will appear, That the taking away the Cup from the Laity, is a kind of Sacriledg in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; as being against the <hi>Institution,</hi> and express <hi>command</hi> of our Blessed Saviour: Nor is this all, for it is as much contrary to the practice

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath two signal things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Subject. For writing to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, (and he tells them that he had <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.</note> 
               <hi>received of the Lord,</hi> what he writ to them) he says,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Host (to use their word) was <hi>only Bread,</hi> and not the <hi>very Body and Flesh</hi> of our Blessed Saviour. For in two Chapters to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> he <hi>calls it Bread</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26, 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>five times after Consecration</hi>; and we may be sure, he call'd it what he thought it was; and what both his own, and all their Senses manifestly saw, and judg'd it to be. It is true, the Apostle in the same Chapter says; That the eating of the Bread is the Communion of the <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16</note> 
               <hi>Body</hi> of Christ. Not <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio propria &amp; substantialis,</hi> as if they had really eaten the very substance of our Saviour's flesh; but <hi>Communio typica &amp; Sacramentalis</hi>; they eat his Body in eating the bread which was a Sacramental sign of his Body. So a little before in the same Chapter, he says, that the <hi>Jews</hi> (in <hi>Moses</hi> his time) eat the same <note n="‖" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>spiritual meat,</hi> and drank the same <hi>spiritual drink,</hi> for they drank of the <hi>spiritual Rock, which was Christ.</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:94780:21"/>
Not that they did, or could then, really and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat or drink his Flesh and Blood (for it was above 1400 years before our Blessed Saviour had any flesh or blood) but they eat his flesh, and drank his blood <hi>in signis &amp; typis Sacramentalibus.</hi> They eat our Blessed Saviour's Body in the Manna, which was a type only, and our Saviour himself the <hi>true</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.31, 32.</note> 
               <hi>Manna,</hi> Sacramentally signify'd by it; so he says, the Rock was Christ, that is (the Sign having the Name of the thing signified, as is most usual) a type of Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is evident by the places <note n="‖" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17, 21. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26, 27, 28. <hi>Vide Lyraenum in dictum ver.</hi> 28.</note> cited) that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> (by the Apostles directions) receiv'd the Cup as well as the Bread. But besides our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Institution of the Sacrament in both kinds, and the Apostles directions (which are obligatory and commands) that it should be so receiv'd; there is one thing more which aggravates the error and injustice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in taking away the Cup from the Laity, which they do in contradiction to all other Christian Churches, which (ever since the Apostles time to this day) have approv'd and practis'd the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament in both kinds. Nay in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> itself for above 1200 years after our Saviour, all (both Lay and Clergy) received in both kinds.

            <p n="2">2. That this was a <hi>New thing,</hi> and an <hi>Innovation</hi> brought into the Church by that Pope.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>many believed</hi> it to be a <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate act</hi> of that Pope against the <hi>Judgment of the Holy Fathers.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. And then he tells of the <hi>horrid effects</hi> and <hi>ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences</hi> which follow upon it. However (to say nothing of the Ethiopick or Greek Churches, who never did receive the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church concerning the Celibacy of their Priests) by the Premisses, it is certain, that even in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, for above 1000 years after Christ, Priests were some of them marry'd, and afterwards when they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to marry, it was judged to be (as the Historian tells us) 1.

               <hi>if a Priest keep a Concubine, and commit fornication,</hi> (tho' it be a sin, yet) it is a less sin, than to have a wife of his own; that is (in plain and true En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish) it is a greater sin with them, to disobey the Pope and his party, who disapprove and prohibit Priests Marriages; than to disobey our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apostles, who approve, and in some cases (as to avoid <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2, 9.</note>

            <p n="3">3. And here it will be worth our time and pains di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to consider, what the reason and cause is, why the Pope and his party so severely forbid the Marriages of their Clergy. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot be for Religion, and Reformation of their Clergy, to make them and their lives more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Gospel, and the Laws of the primitive and purer Christianity. For 'tis evident, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel approves the Marriages of the Clergy, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <note n="‖" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5.</note> Apostles themselves were marryed, and so were the Bishops and Priests in the Primitive and purest times of Christianity; as is both in itself evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94780:24"/>
the Jesuites, the most zealous Advocates for the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. So that the disapproving and prohibition of Priests Marriages, is so far from being a matter of True Religion, and Reformation of them and their lives, according to the Gospel, and purest times of Christianity; that 'tis directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor can the Prohibition of Priests Marriages be for this end and reason, to make their Clergy better men and more pious Christians. For (upon our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries own principles) it deprives them of the good means, which God himself has instituted, for their Justification and Salvation. For, First, The <hi>Trent</hi> Fathers tell us; That all <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Per Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta omnis vera justitia vel inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, vel coepta augetur, vel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missa reparatur.</hi> Conc. Trid. Sess 7. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentis in Prooemio, &amp; Can. 6.7.</note> 
               <hi>true justice</hi> is either begun, or increas'd, or repair'd by the Sacraments. Secondly, They say, that Matrimony is a Sacrament instituted by our Blessed Saviour, and <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Si quis dixerit Matrimonium non esse verè Sacramentum à Christo institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, neque gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam conferre, Anathema sit.</hi> Conc. Trid. Sess. 24. de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim. Can. 1.</note> 
               <hi>confers</hi> grace. And therefore the forbidding the Clergy to marry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them of that means, which (by their own confession) our Blessed Saviour instituted to confer Grace; and therefore the Celibate and single Life of the Priests cannot be a means to make them better men, or more pious Christians; seeing it deprives them of the means which our Blessed Saviour institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make them such. If it be said, that Matrimony was not a Sacrament instituted for Priests, as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Orders was not for the Laity. To this I say, First, If Matrimony was (as they say) a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament instituted by our Blessed Saviour to confer Grace, then whoever was legally married, according to the mind of Christ, and the Law of the Gospel, received Grace by it Secondly, Several of the Apostles and Primitive Bishops and Priests were so legally married, and so had the Sacrament of Matrimony,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94780:25"/>
which (in the judgment of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) did really confer Grace to all, <hi>qui non</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sacramenta novae legis gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam quam sig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nificant omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, obicem non ponentibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serunt.</hi> Conc. Trid. Sess. 7. in Decreto de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. Can. 6.</note> 
               <hi>ponebant obicem,</hi> who by their own Impiety did not hinder the gracious effect of that Sacrament. Whence we may evidently conclude; that if the Sacrament of Marriage did (as our Adversaries say it did) confer Grace on all, whose impiety did not hinder the effect of it; then certainly it conferr'd Grace on the Apostles, and the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Bishops and Priests in their time; it being irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and uncharitable to think, that the impiety of those excellent and Divinely inspired Persons, should be so great, as to hinder the effect of that Sacrament. Now if the married Apostles did receive Grace signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and sealed to them by that Sacrament, so might their Successors too, to this very day, had not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by prohibiting Priests to marry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd them of that Sacrament, and so of that Grace and Spiritual Benefit they might have received by it. So that although the Pope and his party might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the pious ends above mention'd, for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of Priests marriages, (as they want not fair pretences for foul Actions) yet 'tis evident, they were but vain pretences, seeing the prohibition of those marriages, is so far from being a means to attain those ends, that it utterly overthrows them both.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But the true reason why at <hi>Trent</hi> they prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the Clergy to marry, was; because the Popes greatness and interest in all Countreys where Popery prevail'd, would be lost, if Priests were permitted to marry; as evidently appears, by the reason given in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, by the greatest Advocates for <hi>Rome,</hi> why the marriage of the Priests was deny'd (tho' the <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>See the Hist. of the Council of Trent. ad An.</hi> 1563.</note> Emperor and the <hi>French</hi> desir'd it) for Father <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> thus expresses it, <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>It is plain</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:94780:25"/>
(say the great Advocates for <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes Authority) <hi>that marryed Priests will turn their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their Wives and Children, and by consequence, to their house and Countrey, so that the strict dependence which the Clergy hath upon the Apostolick See, would cease; and to grant marriage to Priests, would destroy the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, and make the Pope to be Bishop of Rome only.</hi> So that their prohibition of marriages was to make the Clergy faithful <note n="*" place="margin">The Popish Bishops take an oath of absolute Allegiance to the Pope. <hi>Vide Pontif.

And hence came the Papal exemptions of the Clergy from the Jurisdiction of all temporal Princes; so far, that they deny the Clergy to be Subjects to Kings, and therefore cannot be guilty of any Treason against them. They condemn this Proposition as erroneous (if not Heretical) <note n="‖" place="margin">So the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal Indices <hi>Librorum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>By the Premisses it may appear, that the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in disapproving Priests mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages (especially, for such unjust and unworthy ends) is erroneous, and their practice the occasion <note n="*" place="margin">Their own sober Authors sadly complain of the impure lives of their unmarried Clergy; <hi>Hanis.

approved, and his Church in all Ages practised the contrary. And here consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Marriage was instituted by God himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fall, while <hi>Adam</hi> was in Innocence; so that the Institution of Marriage is divine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Prohibition of it, is only humane (as is confess'd) and for unjust and unworthy ends.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Patriarchal Ages before <hi>Moses</hi> and the Law, there were Priests as well as Lay people; and the <hi>Primogenitus,</hi> or First-born (as is known and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd) had <hi>Imperium</hi> and <hi>Sacerdotium,</hi> was both Prince and Priest. So that the Priests (in that interval of time) were certainly married.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Under the Mosaical Law, it is as certain (and confess'd) that the Priests and Levites were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, and the Succession of them continued <hi>per Generationem Naturalem.</hi> For had their Marriages been prohibited, one Tribe had necessarily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the time of the Gospel the Marriage of the Clergy was <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. 4.12. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5, 6.</note> approved by God, and (as is, and must be confess'd) was practised by the <note n="‖" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5.</note> Apostles, and Apostolical Clergy. Nor are such Marriages only <hi>approved,</hi> but to avoid Fornication, expresly <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2, 9.</note> commanded in the Gospel. Continence is <hi>Dei donum,</hi> a gift which he has not <note n="‖" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.</note> given to all, (as is evident and confess'd) and then Marriage is the <note n="‖" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.</note> 
               <hi>Means</hi> appointed by God to preserve Chastity, and where that is forbidden (as in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is) abominable pollutions will be the fatal consequence; seeing nothing can be more irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, than to think, that of so many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands to whom Marriage is forbid in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (men and women in the strength and

flourish of their Age) all should have ability to live Chastly, neglecting the means which God himself has appointed to preserve it.</p>
            <p>To conclude this point, This Prohibition of the Clergy to Marry (had we no other reason) were sufficient to justifie our Separation from the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion; especially, seeing such Prohibition of Marriage is declared to be a mark and indelible <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13.</note>
