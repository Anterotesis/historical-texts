            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

other grievances, provided they wold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to suppress this <hi>Scots</hi> Rebellion: some say the House was inclinable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his Majesties demands, but (as the ill spirit wold have it) that Parliament was suddenly brok up, and I wold they who gave that Counsel had bin then in <hi>Arabia,</hi> or beyond the Line, in their way to <hi>Madagas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> who neverthelesse have got to be in high request with this present Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Among others, old Sir <hi>Harry Vane</hi> was one, who, when the House seem'd willing to give six subsidies, and the King inclinable to take them; The said <hi>Vane</hi> being the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State stood up, and said, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty expected no less then twelve, which words did so incense and discompose the House, that they drew after them that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy dissolution.</p>
                     <p>His Majesty being reduced to these straits, and resenting still the insolence of the <hi>Scot,</hi> proposed the busines to His Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councell, who suddenly made up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable and most noble summe for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent supply, whereunto divers of his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick servants and Officers did contribut. Amongst others who were active herein, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> bestir'd himself nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98493:17"/>
and having got a Parliament to be call'd in <hi>Ireland</hi> he went over, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible celeritie raised 8000. men, who procured money of that Parliament to maintain them, and got over those angry Seas again in the compasse of lesse then six weeks. You may infer hence to what an exact uncontrollable obedience he had reduced that Kingdom, as to bring about so great a work with such a suddennes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie.</p>
                     <p>An armie was also raised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here, which marched to the North, and there fed upon the Kings pay a whole Summer. The <hi>Scot</hi> was not idle all this while; but having pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall intelligence of every thing that passed at Court, as farre as what was debated in the Cabinet Councel, and spoken in the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, (and herein amongst many others, the Scot had infinite advantage of us) He armed also, and preferring to make <hi>England</hi> the stage of the warre, rather then his own countrey, and to invade rather then to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, He got over the <hi>Tweed,</hi> and found the passage open, and as it were made for him all the way till hee came to the <hi>Tine,</hi> and though there was a considerable army of horse and foot at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> yet they never

offered so much as to face him all the while, At <hi>Newburgh</hi> indeed there was a small skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, but the <hi>English</hi> foot would not fight, so <hi>Newcastle</hi> gates flew open to the <hi>Scot</hi> without any resistance at all, where it is thought he had more friends then foes, and who were their friends besides for this invasion, I hope <hi>Time,</hi> and the <hi>Tribunall</hi> of Justice will one day discover.</p>
                     <p>His Majesty being then at <hi>York,</hi> summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all his Nobles to appear, to advise with them in this exigence: Commissioners were appointed on both sides, who met at <hi>Rippon,</hi> and how the hearts and courage of some of the <hi>English</hi> Barons did boil within them, to be brought to so disadvantageous a Treatie with the <hi>Scot,</hi> you may well imagin.

                     <p>It is the practise of some <hi>States</hi> I know, to make sacrifice of some eminent Minister, for <hi>publick mistakes:</hi> but to follow the thred of my Discourse. The Parliament being sate, His Majesty told them, that he was resolved to cast himself wholly upon the affection and fidelity of his people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98493:19"/>
they were the Representative body: Therfore he wished them to go roundly on to close up the ruptures that were made by this infortunat war, and that the two armies, one domestick, the other forrain, which were gnawing the very bowels of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, might be dismissed. Touching grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of any kind (and what State was ther ever so pure, but some corruption might creep into it?) He was very ready to redresse them: concerning the <hi>Ship-money,</hi> he was willing to pass a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ll for the utter abolition of it, and to establish the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the subject; therefore he wished them not to spend too much time about that. And for <hi>Monopolies,</hi> he desired to have a list of them, and he wold damn them all in one Proclamation: Touching ill <hi>Counsellours,</hi> either in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> or <hi>White-Hall,</hi> either in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> he was resolved to protect none, Therefore he wished that all jealousies and misunderstandings might vanish: This, with sundry other strains of Princely grace he delivered unto them, but withall he told them, that they shold be very cautious how they shook the fram of an ancient Government too far, in regard it was like a <hi>Watch, which being put asunder,</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98493:19"/>

                     <p>So ther were great hopes of a calm, after that cold Northern storm had so blustered, and that we shold be suddenly rid of the <hi>Scot,</hi> but that was least intended, untill som designs were brought about. The Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the <hi>Iudges,</hi> and divers <hi>Monopolists</hi> are clapt up, and you know who took a timely <hi>flight</hi> (Lord <hi>Finch</hi>) to the other side of the Sea. And in lieu of these, the <hi>Bishop of Lincoln</hi> is enlarged, <hi>Bastwick, Burton,</hi> and <hi>Prynn</hi> are brought into <hi>London</hi> with a kind of <hi>Hosanna.</hi> His Majesty gave way to all this, and to comply further with them, he took as it were into his bosom, I mean, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Privy Councell those Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Lords, who were held the greatest Zelots amongst them, that they might be witnesses of his secret'st actions, and to one of them (the Lord <hi>Say</hi>) he gave one of the considerablest Offices of the Kingdom, by the resignation of another most deserving <hi>Lord,</hi> upon whom they could never fasten the least misdemeanour; yet this great new <hi>Officer</hi> wold come neither to the same Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Chappell, or Church, to joyn in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98493:20"/>
with his Royall Master, nor communicat with him in any publick exercise of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and may not this be called a tru <hi>Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sancie?</hi> To another he gave one of the prime and most <hi>reposefull Offices</hi> about his own Person at Court (The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>) and thereby he might be said to have given a <hi>Staff</hi> to beat himself. Moreover, partly to give his Subjects an Evidence how firmly he was rooted in his <hi>Religion,</hi> and how much he desired the strenthning of it abroad, The treaty of marriage went on 'twixt his <hi>eldest daughter,</hi> and the young Prince of <hi>Orenge.</hi> Hereunto may be added as a speciall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of compliance and grace, the passing of the Bill for a <hi>Trienniall</hi> Parliament, and lastly (which is the greatest Evidence that possibly can be imagined, of that reall trust and confidence he reposed in them) he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that prodigious Act of <hi>Continuance.</hi>

                     <p>Touching your <hi>Lyturgie,</hi> I have heard it censur'd abroad by the regidest <hi>Calvinists</hi> of <hi>Generva</hi> and <hi>Dort,</hi> yet I never heard any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Character given of it, but that it is a most <hi>Pious, Pathetick,</hi> and perfect peece of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98493:34"/>
devotion, both for the matter and forme of it, which I have been a little curious to observe. It begins with some choise pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of holy Scripture, and a previous Declaration or Monitory to excite us to the worke in hand; The first addresse wee make to God is by an humble and joynt Confession which is appliable to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and comprehends in it all kind of sins. Then followeth a pronuntiation of Gods promises and pronesse to pardon and absolve us; We goe on to the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which having bin dictated by our Saviour himself we often use, and is as <hi>Amber</hi> throwne in amongst our <hi>Frankincense,</hi> to make the Sacrifice more precious and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing unto God; Then we proceed to som choice Psalms, and other portions of holy scripture taken out of the old and new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Then we fall to the <hi>Symbole of faith,</hi> whereof we make a solemn joynt confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in such a posture as shews a readinesse and resolution in us to defend it: and so to the <hi>Letany,</hi> wherein the poor penitent pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant soul may be said to breath out herself into the bosome of her Saviour by tender ejaculations, by panting groans, &amp; eviscerated ingeminations, and there is no sin, no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98493:35"/>
whatsoever that humane frailty is subject unto, but you shall find a deliverance from it there, it is so full of Christian charity, that there is no condition of people, but are remembred and prayed for there. Then wee proceed by holy alternatif interlocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (whereby wee heare our selves speak as well as the Minister) to some effectuall short prayers; because in long prayers the minde is subject to wander, as some Zelots now a dayes use to bring their Hearers into a <hi>Wildernesse</hi> by their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and into a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> by their <hi>Sermons.</hi> Then goe we on to the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and if it be in a <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall,</hi> there is time enough for the Hearer to examine himselfe, while the Musick playes, where and when he broke any of Gods holy Commandements, and ask particular for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse accordingly in the intervall; Then after other choice portions of Scripture, and passages relating to our Redemption, and endearing, unto us the merits of it, with a more particular Confession of our <hi>Faith,</hi> we are dismissed with a <hi>Benediction:</hi> So that this <hi>Liturgy</hi> may be call'd an Instrument of many strings, whereon the sighing soul sends up varions notes unto heaven: It is a posie made up of divers flowers, to make

it the more fragrant in the nostrills of God. Now touching your <hi>Bishops,</hi> I never knew yet any Protestant Church but could be content to have them, had they meanes to maintaine the <hi>Dignitie,</hi> which the Churches of <hi>France</hi> with others have not, in regerd the Reformation beg an first among the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> not at <hi>Court,</hi> as here it did in <hi>Engl.</hi> For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse ther be som Supervisers of Gods house, endowed with eminent authority to check the fond fancies, and quench the false fatuous fires of every private spirit, and unlesse it be such an authority that may draw unto it a holy kind of awe and obedience what can be expected but confusion and <hi>Atheisme?</hi> You know what became of the Israelites when the wonted reverence to the <hi>Ark,</hi> and the <hi>Ephod,</hi> and the <hi>Priest,</hi> began to languish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them: For the braine of man is like a garden, which unlesse it be fenced about with a wall or hedge, is subject you know to be annoyed by all kinde of beasts which will be ready to runne into it; so the braine unlesse it be restrain'd and bounded in holy things by rules of Canonicall authoritie, a thousand wild opinions, and extravagant fancies will hourely rush into it: nor was there ever any field so subject to produce
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98493:36"/>
Cockle and Darnell, as the human brain is rank and ready to bring forth tares of Schism and Heresie of a thousand sorts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse after the first culture the sickle of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority be applyed to grub up all such noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som weeds.</p>

bottom of his designs, that it was far from his thoughts to bring in the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Government; for therby they shold have betrayed their own posterity, and made their children slaves.</p>

                     <speaker>Patricius.</speaker>
                     <p>To my knowledge, these Nobles and Gentlemen are still the very same as they were in former Parliaments, wherin they were so cryed up for the truest lovers of their Country, and best Common-wealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; yet now they are branded, and voted to be <hi>Seducers,</hi> and Traytors, because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their oaths and consciences, they adhere to the King their Master and Liege-Lord, for maintenance of that Religion they were baptized and bred in. Those most Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and painfull Divines, which till this Parliament began were accounted the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest sort of Protestants, are now cryed down for Papists, though they continue still the very same men, both for opinions and preaching, and are no more <hi>Papists</hi> than I am a <hi>Pythagorean.</hi> In fine, a tru English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant is put now in the same scale with a Papist, and made Synonyma's. And truly these unhappy Schismaticks could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise how to cast a greater infamy upon the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98493:40"/>
English Protestant than they have done of late by these monstrous imputations; they wold fasten upon him such opinions which never entred into his thoughts, they wold know ones heart better than himself, and so would be greater <hi>Kardiognosticks</hi> than God Almighty.</p>
                     <p>But to draw to a conclusion; The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Army multiplyed apace in <hi>London,</hi> the Kings but slowly in the North, so that when he displayed his Royal Standard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> his Forces were not any thing considerable, so that if the Parliaments <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall (Essex)</hi> had then advanced towards him from <hi>Northampton,</hi> he had put him to a very great strait; they encreased somthing at <hi>Derby,</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> but when he was come to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> the Welch-men came running down the mountains in such multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, that their example did much animate the English; so that his army in lesse than a month that the Court continued in <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> came to near upon twenty thousand Horse and Foot; not long before, the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew Princes</hi> came over, and the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> had with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Forces was at <hi>Worcester,</hi> where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the flower of their Cavalry, and gave
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98493:40"/>
them a smart blow. At <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty took a resolution to march with His whole Army towards <hi>London,</hi> but after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days march he understood the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Forces were within six miles side-long of him, and so many miles he went out of His road to find them out, and face them: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sunday morning he was himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon Edge-Hill, wher the Enemies Colours plainly appear'd in vale before <hi>Kein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> it was past two in the after-noon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his Infantery could get to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, who upon sight of the Enemies Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours ran as merrily down the Hill, as if they had gone to a Morris dance. So His Majesty himself being <hi>Generalissimo,</hi> gave command the great Ordnance shold flye for a defiance, so the battell began, which lasted above three hours, and as some French and Dutch Commanders (who were engag'd in the Fight) told me, they never remembred to have seen a more furious battail for the time in all the German wars. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued the Enemies Horse like a whirl-wind near upon three miles, and had ther bin day enough, when he came back to the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, in all probability a totall defeat had bin given them: So that the same accident
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98493:41"/>
may be said to fall out here, as happened in that famous battell at <hi>Lewis,</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time, where the Prince of Wales (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Edward</hi> the first) was so eager, and went so far (by excesse of courage) from the body of the Army in pursuance of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> that it was the fatall cause of the losse of that mighty battail. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty (to his deserved and never-dying glory) comported himself like another <hi>Caesar</hi> all the while, by riding about and encouraging the Souldiers, by exposing his person often to the reach of a Musket-bullet, and lying in the field all that bleak night in his Coach. Notwithstanding that many lying Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets were purposely printed here, to make the world believe that he had retir'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self all the time of the fight; what partiall reports were made in the Guild-Hall to the Londoners, and by what persons, (<hi>W.</hi> and <hi>Strode</hi>) I am ashamed to tell you: But that His Majesty was victorious that day (a day which I never thought to have seen in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) ther be many convincing arguments to prove it; for besides the great odds of men which fell on their side, and Cannons they lost, som of their Ordnance were nayl'd by the Kings Troops the next morning after
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98493:41"/>
in the very face of their Army. Moreover, the King advanc'd forward the next day to his former road, and took <hi>Banbury</hi> presently after; but the <hi>Parliamenteers</hi> went backwards, and so from that day to this, His Majesty continueth Master of the field. 'Tis tru, that in som places, as at <hi>Farnham, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> and <hi>Chichester,</hi> they have prevail'd since, but no considerable part of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Army was ther to make opposition; and I blush to tell you, how unworthily the Law of Armes was violated in all those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

which were given to suppresse one rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (in <hi>Ireland</hi>) shold be employed to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain another rebellion (in <hi>England.</hi>) And lastly, methinks, I see <hi>Religion</hi> in torn rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged weeds, and with slubber'd eyes sitting upon <hi>Weeping-Crosse,</hi> and wringing her hands, to see her chiefest Temple (<hi>Pauls Church</hi>) where God Almighty was us'd to be serv'd constantly thrice a day, and was the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz, and as it were the Mother Church, standing open to receive all commers and strangers, to be now shut up, and made only a thorow-fare for Porters; to see those scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds, the expence of so many thousand pounds, to lie rotting; to see her chiefest lights like to be extinguished; to see her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous learned Divines dragg'd to prison, and utterly depriv'd of the benefit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, their inheritance: Methinks, I say, I see <hi>Religion</hi> packing up, and preparing to leave this Island quite, crying out, that this is Countrey fitter for <hi>Atheists</hi> than <hi>Christians</hi> to live in; for God Almighty is here made the greatest <hi>Malignant,</hi> in regard his House is plunder'd more than any: Ther is no Court left to reform heresie, no Court to punish any Church Officer, and to make him attend his Cure, not Court to punish
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98493:50"/>
Fornication, Adultery, or Incest: Methinks I hear <hi>Her</hi> cry out against these her Grand <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> (or <hi>Refiners</hi> rather) that they have put division 'twixt all degrees of persons. They have put division 'twixt husband and wife, 'twixt mother and child: The son seeks his fathers bloud in open field, one brother seeks to cut the others throat; they have put division 'twixt master and servant, 'twixt <hi>Land- Lord</hi> and <hi>Tenant;</hi> nay, they have a long time put a sea of separation 'twixt King and Queen; and they labour more and more to put division 'twixt the Head and the Members, 'twixt His Majesty and his politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Spouse,</hi> his <hi>Kingdom:</hi> And lastly, they have plung'd one of the flourishingst King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Europe</hi> in a war without end; for though a <hi>Peace</hi> may be plaister'd over for the time, I fear it will be but like a fire co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with ashes, which will break out again, as long as these fiery Schismaticks have any strength in this Island; so that all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses considered, if <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Tartar,</hi> or all the infernal spirits and <hi>Cacodaemons</hi> of hel had broken in amongst us, they could not have done poor <hi>England</hi> more mischief.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Sir, you are happily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on this shore; we are now upon firm ground, upon the fair <hi>Continent</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> we are not circumscrib'd, or coopt up within the narrow bounds of a rhumatick <hi>Island;</hi> we have all <hi>Europe</hi> before us. Truly I am not a little glad to have shaken hands with that tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Element the <hi>Sea;</hi> And for <hi>England,</hi> I never intend to see her again in the mind I am in, unlesse it be in a <hi>Map;</hi> nay, <hi>In statu quo nunc,</hi> while this <hi>Faction</hi> reigns, had I
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98493:53"/>
left one eye behind me, I should hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thither to fetch it; therefore if I be missing at any time, never look for me there. There is an old Proverb, <hi>From a blacke Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a white Italian, a red Frenchman,</hi> I may adde one member more, and, <hi>from a Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Englishman, The Lord deliver us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have often Crossed these Seas, and I found my self alwaies pitifully sick, I did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and anon tell what <hi>Wood</hi> the Ship was made of; but in this passage I did not feele the least motion or distemper in my humors: for, indeed I had no time to taink on sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I was so wholly tsken up, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported with such a pleasing conceit, to have left yonder miserable <hi>Island.</hi>

                     <p>Miserable <hi>Island</hi> indeed; for I thinke there was never such a tyrannie exercised in any Christian Countrey under Heaven; a tyrannie that extends not onely to the <hi>body,</hi> but to the <hi>braine</hi> also; not only to mens fortunes and estates, but it reaches to their very soules and consciences, by violented new coercive Oaths and Protestations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by Lay-men, inconsistent with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Christians. Never was there a Nation carried away by such a strong spirit
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98493:53"/>
of delusion; never was there a poor people so purblinded and <hi>Puppified,</hi> if I may say so, as I finde them to be; so that I am at a stand with my selfe, whether I shall <hi>pitie</hi> them more, or <hi>laugh</hi> at them. They not onely kisse the stone that hurts them, but the hands of them that hurle it; they are come to that passive stupidity, that they adore their very persecutors, who from <hi>polling</hi> fall now a <hi>shaving</hi> them, and will <hi>flay</hi> them at last if they continue this popular reigne. I cannot compare <hi>England,</hi> as the case stands with her, more properly, then to a poor beast, sicke of the staggers, who cannot be cur'd without an incision. The Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, I remember, affirme that the <hi>Moone</hi> (which predominates over all humid bodies) hath a more powerfull influence o're your <hi>British</hi> Seas then any other; so that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the observation of some <hi>Nevigators,</hi> they swell at a spring tide in some places, above threescore cubits high: I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that that inconstant humorous <hi>Planet,</hi> hath also an extraordinany dominion over the <hi>braines</hi> of the Inhabitants; for when they attempt any Innovation (whereunto all <hi>Insulary</hi> people are more subject then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Citizens of the world which are fixed

                     <p>And now, noble Sir, give me leave to render you my humble thanks for that true and solid information you pleased to give me in <hi>London</hi> of these commotions.</p>
                     <p>During my short sojourne there, I ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on divers odde Pamphlets upon the <hi>Seamstresses</hi> stalls, whom I wondred to see selling <hi>Paper</hi> sheets in lieu of <hi>Holland:</hi> on the one side I found the most impudent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths (vouch'd by publike authority) the basest scurrilities, and poorest jingles of wit that ever I read in my life; on the other side I met with many pieces that had good stuff in them, but gave mee not (being a stranger) a full satisfaction, they look'd no further then the beginning of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the particular emergences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but <hi>you</hi> have, by your methodicall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so perfectly instructed and rectified my understanding, by bringing me to the very

                     <p>Sir, I deserve not these high expressions of your favourable censure touching that poor piece; but this I will be bold to say, That whosoever doth read it impartially, will discover in the Author the <hi>Genius</hi> of an honest Patriot, and a Gentleman. And now methinks I look on you unfortunate I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland, as if one look upon a Ship toss'd up and down in distresse of wind and weather, by a furious tempest, which the more she
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98493:55"/>
tugs and wrastles with the foamie waves of the angry Ocean, the more the fury of the storme encreaseth, and puts her in danger of shipwrack; and you must needs thinke, Sir, it would move compassion in any heart, to behold a poore Ship in such a desperate case, specially when all his <hi>kindred, friends</hi> and <hi>fortunes;</hi> yea his <hi>Religion,</hi> the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Treasure of all, are aboard of her, and upon point of sinking. Alas I can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute nothing now to my poor countrey but my prayers and teares, that it would please God to allay this tempest, and cast over board those that are the true causers of it, and bring the people to the right use of <hi>Reason</hi> againe. It was well observed by you, Sir, That there is a Nationall kinde of indisposition, and obliquity of mind that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth now amongst our people, and I feare it will be long ere they returne to their old <hi>English</hi> temper. to that rare loyalty and love which they were used to shew to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne: for all the Principles of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie are quite lost amongst us, those ancient and sacret flowers of the <hi>English</hi> Diadem are trampled under foot; nay, matters are come to that horrid confusion, that not onely the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the crown, but the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall

                        <hi>Priviledge</hi> of the free-born subject is utterly overthrowne, by those whose Predecessors were used to be the main sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of it: so that our King is necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put himself in Armes for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation not only of his own Regall rights, but of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it self, which was neuer so invaded and violated in any age, by such causlesse tyrannicall imprisonments, by such unexampled destructive taxes, by stopping the ordinary processes in Law, and awing all the Courts of Justice, by unheard-of forced oaths and Associations, and a thousand other acts, which neither <hi>President, Book-case</hi> or <hi>Statute</hi> can warrant, whereof, if the King had done but the twentieth part, he had been cryed up to be the greatest Tyrant that ever was.</p>

                     <p>Sir, I am an <hi>Alien,</hi> and so can speak with more freedom of your Countrey. The short time that I did eate my bread there, I felt the pulse of the people with as much judgement as I could; and I find, that this very word <hi>Parliament</hi> is become a kind of <hi>Idoll</hi> amongst them, they doe, as it were, pin their salvation upon't; it is held blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to speake against it. The old <hi>English</hi>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:98493:56"/>
Maxime was, <hi>The King can do no wrong;</hi> another Nominative case is now stept in, <hi>That the Parliament can do no wrong,</hi> nor the <hi>King receive any:</hi> And whereas ther was used to be but one Defender of the <hi>Faith,</hi> ther are now started up amongst you, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how many hundreds of them. And as in the sacred profession of <hi>Priest-hood</hi> we hold, or at least wise shold hold, That after the <hi>Imposition</hi> of hands, the Minister is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with the Holy Ghost in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner for the enabling of him to exercise that Divine Function, so the <hi>English</hi> are grown to such a fond conceit of their <hi>Parliament</hi> Members, that as soon as any is chosen by the confus'd cry of the Common people to sit within the walls of that House, an inerring spirit, a spirit of infallibility pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently entereth into him (so that he is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become like the <hi>Pope,</hi> a <hi>Canon animatus</hi>) though som of them may haply be such flat and simple animals, that they are as fit to be Counsellours, as <hi>Caligula's</hi> Horse was to be <hi>Consull,</hi> as the Historian tells us.</p>

                     <p>'Tis tru, I have read of high things that our <hi>Parliament</hi> have done, but 'twas either during the nonage and minority of our Kings, when they were under protectorship, or when they were absent in a forrain war, or in time of confusion, when ther were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors of the bloud-royall for the Crown,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98493:57"/>
and when the number of both Houses was compleat and individed; but I never read of any <hi>Parliament</hi> that did arrogate to it self such a power <hi>Paramount,</hi> such a <hi>Superlative superintendence,</hi> as to check the Prerogative of their Soverain, to question his <hi>negative</hi> voice, to passe things, not only without, but expresly against his advice and royall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: I never heard of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that wold have their King, being come to the <hi>Meridian</hi> of his age, to transmit his intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls, and whole faculty of reason to them. I find som <hi>Parliaments</hi> have bin so modest and moderat (<hi>Now moderation is the Rudder that shold steer the course of all great Councells</hi>) that they have declined the agitation and cognizance of som state affaires, humbly transferring them to their Soverain and his privy Counsell: a <hi>Parliament man</hi> then, held it to be the <hi>adaequat</hi> object of his duty, to study the welfare, to redresse the grievances, and supply the defects of that particular place for which he served; The <hi>Members then</hi> us'd to move in their own (<hi>Inferior</hi>) sphere, and us'd not to be transported by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Eccentric</hi> motions. And so they thought to have complyed with the <hi>Obligation,</hi> and discharged the consciences of honest
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98493:57"/>
Patriots, without soaring above their reach, and roving at random to treat of universals, much lesse to bring Religion to their bar, or prie into the <hi>Arcana Imperti,</hi> the cognizance of the one belonging to the King, and his intern Counsell of State: the other to <hi>Divines,</hi> who, according to the <hi>Etymologie</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> use to be still conversant in the exercise of speculation of holy and heavenly things.</p>

                     <p>I am clearly of your opinion in these two particulars; for, <hi>secrecy being the soul of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,</hi> matters of State shold be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but to few; and touching Religion, I cannot see how it may <hi>quadrat</hi> with the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and be <hi>homogeneous</hi> to the profession of Lay-men, to determine matters of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; who, out of their incapacity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptnesse to the work, being not <hi>pares nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> and being carryed away by a wild kind of <hi>Conscience</hi> without <hi>Science,</hi> like a Ship without a Helm, fall upon dangerous quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands; so that whilest they labour to mend her, they marr her, whilst they think to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle her, they confound her, whilst they plot to prevent the growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> they pave the way to bring it in, by conniving at, and countenancing those monstrous Schismes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98493:58"/>
which I observed to have crept into your Church since the <hi>reign</hi> of this <hi>Parliament:</hi> so that one may justly say, These your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> are but the executioners of the old project of the Jesuits, the main part wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was, and is still, to hurle the ball of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and hatch new opinions still 'twixt the <hi>Protestants,</hi> to make factions and scissures between them, and so render their religion more despicable and ridiculous.</p>
                     <p>But methinks, matters are come to a strange pass with you in <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Iudges</hi> cannot be trusted with the <hi>Law,</hi> nor the <hi>Prelats</hi> with the <hi>Gospell;</hi> whereas from all times, out of their long experience and years, these two degrees of men were used to be reverenced for the chief <hi>Touch-men,</hi> and unquestionable <hi>Expositors</hi> of both, which another power seems now to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to it self, as the inerring <hi>Oracle</hi> of both: but I pray God that these grand <hi>Refiners</hi> of Religion, prove not <hi>Quack-salvers</hi> at last; that these upstart <hi>Polititians</hi> prove not <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors:</hi> for I have heard of some things they have done, that if <hi>Machiavell</hi> himself were alive, he wold be reputed a Saint in comparison of them. The <hi>Roman</hi> ten, and <hi>Athenian</hi> thirty, were Babies to these; nay,

the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition, and the <hi>Bloet-Rade</hi> (that Councell of bloud) which the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> erected in <hi>Flanders,</hi> when he swore, <hi>That he wold drown the Hollanders in their Butter-tubs,</hi> was nothing to this; when I consider the prodigious power they have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to themselves, and do daily exercise over the bodies, the estates and souls of men.</p>

                        </gap>ch this new Faction hath wrought, they have put <hi>division</hi> 'twixt all sorts and sexes, 'twixt all conditious, both of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; one thing more I may say, they have done in this kind: for, they have laboured to put <hi>division</hi> between the <hi>Persons</hi> of the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> by making the first <hi>Person</hi> to be offended at that voluntary <hi>genuflection</hi> and reverence which hath bin from all times practised in the Christian Church to the name of the second <hi>Person;</hi> so that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su worship,</hi> as I have read in some of your profane Pamphlets, is grown now to be a word of reproach amongst you.</p>
                     <p>But to the point; ther is one thing I can never cease to wonder at: that whereas at the beginning of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> ther were
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98493:59"/>
as able and experienced, as stout and well spoken Gentlemen, as any in the whole Kingdom, that sate in the House, and made the far major part, I wonder I say, that they wold suffer this giddy-headed Faction to carry all before them in that violent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they did not crush this <hi>Cocatrice</hi> in the shell.</p>

                     <p>First, Sir, you know ther is nothing so agreeable to the nature of man, as <hi>novelty;</hi> and in the conduct of humane affaires, it is always seen, that when any new design or faction is a foot, the Projectors are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more pragmaticall and sedulous upon the work; they lie centinell to watch all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, the Sand of their brains is always running: This hath caused this upstart Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to stick still close together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue marvellously constant to their ends; they have bin used to tyre and out-fast, to weary and out-watch the moderate and well-minded Gentlemen; sometimes till after midnight, by clancular and nocturnall sittings; so that as His Majesty saies in one of his Declarations, most of their Votes may be said to be nought else, but <hi>Verdicts of a starv'd Iury.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:98493:59"/>Another reason is, That they countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the flocking together of the promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rabble from <hi>London,</hi> notwithstanding the two severall motions the Lords made unto them, that they might be suppressed by Parliamentary Order: This riotous crue awed the wonted freedom of speech in both Houses, cryed up the names, and confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many of their Members: yet these new Polititians not only conniv'd at them, but call'd them their <hi>friends;</hi> and so they might well enough, or rather their <hi>Champions;</hi> for they had ordered the matter so, that they were sure to have them ready at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, at the heaving of a finger: and from this tumultuous <hi>mongrell crue,</hi> they derived their first encouragements to do such high prodigious insolencies they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted since. Adde hereunto, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed exceedingly besides with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councell of the City, they used to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them early and late to knock heads together; and if any new thing was to passe in the House, they wold first wait on <hi>them,</hi> to know their pleasure, and afterwards it shold be propounded and put to <hi>Vote</hi> in the House: And how derogatory it is to the high <hi>Law-making-councell,</hi> to make their

of distempered brains, and the <hi>rotten</hi> hearts of many of his own <hi>meniall</hi> servants, who have proved like the Sons of <hi>Serviah</hi> unto him, ingratefull monsters, yet is he still in his own <hi>Orb,</hi> and will, when this foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's passed, and the aire cleared a little by <hi>thunder,</hi> shine more gloriously and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully then before, it being a <hi>maxime</hi> of State, That <hi>Rebellion suppressed, makes a Prince the stronger;</hi> Now <hi>Rebellion</hi> durst never yet look a Prince long in the face, for the Majesty of Gods anointed, useth to dart such fulgent piercing beams, that dazle the eyes of disloyalty, and strikes her stark blind at last. And truly, as you say, I am also clearly of opinion, that these ingratefull <hi>Londoners,</hi> as they were the <hi>comencers,</hi> so have they been the continuers and <hi>contrivers</hi> of this ugly <hi>Rebellion</hi> ever since; They seem to have utterly forgotten who hath given them the sword, and by, and from whom they hold their <hi>Charter;</hi> Their <hi>Corporations</hi> are now grown body politicks, &amp; so as many petty <hi>Republikes</hi> amongst them, so that they begin to smell rank of a <hi>Hans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town.</hi> Poor simple <hi>Annimals,</hi> how they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their pockets to be pick'd, their purses to be cut; how they part with their <hi>vitall spirits</hi> every week; how desperately they

I fear ther is som formidable judgment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall revenge hangs over that City; for the anger of a King is like the roaring of a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and I never read yet of any City that contested with her Soverain, but she smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed soundly for it at last. The present case of <hi>London</hi> bears a great deal of proportion with that of <hi>Monpellier</hi> here in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Charls</hi> the seventh's time; for when that town had refused the publishing of many of the Kings <hi>Edicts</hi> and <hi>Declarations,</hi> murthered som of his Ministers and Servants, abused the Church, and committed other high acts of insolency; the Duke of <hi>Berry</hi> was sent to reduce the Town to obedience; the Duke pressed them with so hard a siege, that at last the best Citizens came forth in proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, bare-headed, &amp; bare-footed, with white wands in their hands, and halters about their necks to deliver the keys of all the gates to the Duke, but this wold not serve the turn, for two hundred of them were condemned to the gallies, two hundred of them were
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98493:61"/>
hang'd, and two hundred beheaded, the King saying, he offered those as <hi>victimes</hi> for the lives of his servants whom they had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered with the false sword of Justice.</p>
                     <p>But, Sir, I much marvell how your Church-government, which from all times hath been cryed up to be so exact, is so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly tumbled into this confusion? how your Prelates are fallen under so darke a cloud, considering that divers of them were renowned through all the Reform'd Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>Christendome</hi> for their rare learning and pietie? At the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Dort,</hi> you know some of them assisted, and no exception at all taken at their degree and dignity, but took precedence accordingly, how came it to passe, that they are now fallen under this Eclypse, as so be so persecuted, to be push'd out of the House of Peers, and hurried into prison? I pray you be pleased to tell me.</p>

                     <p>Sir, I remember to have read in the <hi>Irish</hi> Story, That when the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> in <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the eighth's time, was brought before the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> for burning <hi>Cassiles</hi> Church, he answered, <hi>My Lord, I would never have burnt the Church, unlesse I had thought the Biship had been in it;</hi> for 'twas not the Church, but the

them; and this popular tumult never ceased, till <hi>Charles le Sage</hi> debell'd it; and it made the Kings of <hi>France</hi> more puissant ever since, for it much increased their <hi>Finances,</hi> in regard that those extraordinary taxes which the people imposed upon themselves for the support of the war, hath continued e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since a firm revenue to the Crown; which makes me think of a facecious speech of the late <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, to them of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans:</hi> for wheras a new imposition was laid upon the Townsmen during the <hi>league</hi> by <hi>Monsieur de la Chastre,</hi> who was a great stickler in those wars; they petitioned <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the fourth, that he wold be pleased to take off that taxe, the King asked them, Who had laid that taxe upon them? they said <hi>Monsieur de la Chastre,</hi> during the time of the <hi>League,</hi> the King replyed, <hi>Puis que Monsieur de la Chatre vous à liguè qu'il vous destigue,</hi> since <hi>Monsieur de la Chastre</hi> hath leagu'd you, let <hi>Monsieur de la Chastre</hi> unleague you, and so the said taxe continueth to this day.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Letter requires no <hi>Apology,</hi> much lesse any <hi>pardon,</hi> but may expect rather a good reception and thanks, when your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath seriously perused the contents, and ruminated well upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it treats of by weighing it in your second and third thoughts which usually carry with them a greater advantage of wisdom: It concerns not your body, or temporall estate, but things reflecting upon the noblest part of you, your <hi>soul,</hi> which being a beam of Immortality, and a Type of the Almighty, is incomparably more precious, and rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all other earthly things to be but bables and transitory trifles. Now, the strongest tye, the solemnest engagement and stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can be betwixt the soul and her Creator, is an <hi>Oath.</hi> I do not understand common tumultuary rash oaths, proceeding from an ill habit, or heat of passion upon
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98493:70"/>
sudden contingencies, for such oaths bind one to nought else but to repentance: No, I mean serious and legall oaths, taken with a calm prepared spirit, either for the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of truth, and conviction of falshood, or for fidelitie in the execution of some Office or binding to civill obedience and Loyaltie, which is one of the essentiall parts of a Christian; Such publick oaths legally made with the Royall assent of the Soveraigne from whom they receive both legalitie and life (else they are invalid and unwarrantable) as they are religious acts in their own nature, so is the taking and observance of them part of Gods honor, and there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more derogatory to the high Majesty and holinesse of his name, nothing more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, destructive and damnable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane souls then the infringment and eluding of them, or omission in the performance of them. Which makes the <hi>Turks,</hi> of whom Christians in this particular may learn a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der peece of humanity, to be so cautious, that they seldom or never administer an oath to Greek, Jew, or any other Nation, and the reason is, that if the Party sworn doth take that Oath upon hopes of some advantage, or for evading of danger and

punishment, and afterwards rescinds it, they think themselves to be involved in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and so accessary to his damnation: Our Civill Law hath a Canon consonant to this, which is, <hi>Mortale peccatum est ei praestare juramentum, quem scio verisimiliter violatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum; 'Tis a mortall sin to administer an Oath to him who I probably know will break it;</hi> To this may allude another wholesome saying, <hi>A false Oath is damnable, a true Oath dangerous, none at all the safest.</hi> How much then have they to answer for, who of late yeares have fram'd such formidable coercive generall Oaths to serve them for engins of State to lay battery to the Consciences and Soules of poor men, and those without the assent of their Soveraign, and opposit point blank to former Oaths they themselves had taken: these kind of Oaths the City of London hath swallowed lately in grosse, and the Country in detaile, which makes me confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that if ever that saying of the holy Prophet, <hi>The Land mournes for Oaths,</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to any part of the habitable earth, it may be now applied to this reprobate Iland.</p>

                  <p>By the Oath of Supremacy you swear <hi>to beare faith and true allegeance to the Kings Highnesse, and to your power to defend all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Your Lordship took an Oath when Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Counsellor, <hi>to be a true and faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant unto Him, and if you knew or understood of any manner of thing to be attempted, done, or</hi> spoken <hi>against His Majesties</hi> Person, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Crown, or Dignity, you swore to let, and withstand the same to the uttermost of your power, and either cause it to be revealed to himself, or to others of His Privy Counsell;</hi> The Oaths

you took when Bedchamber man, and L. Chamberlain bind you as strictly to His <hi>Person.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Lordship may also call to memorie when you were installed Knight of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (whereof you are now the oldest living except K<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Denmark</hi>) you solemnly swore <hi>to defend the Honour and Quarrels, the Rights and Lordship of your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Soveraigne:</hi> Now the Record tells us that the chiefest ground of instituting the said order by that heroick Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Third was, that he might have choice gallant men, who by Oath and Honour should adhere unto him in all dangers, and difficulties, and that by way of reciprocation Hee should protect and defend them, Which made <hi>Alfonso</hi> Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> so much importune <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight to install him one of the Knights of the Garter, that he might engage King <hi>Harry</hi> to protect him against <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, who threatned then the conquest of <hi>Naples.</hi>

shold be the first of your Race who deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Crown,</hi> which one of your Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors said, he would still follow though it were thrown upon an hedg: Had your Princely Brother (<hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrock</hi>) bin living he wold have bin sooner torn by wild horses than have banded against it, or abandoned the King his Master, and fallen to such grosse Idolatry as to worship the <hi>Beast with many heads.</hi> The world also stands astonished that you shold confederate to bring into the bowels of the Land, and make Elogiums in some of your Speeches of that hungry people which have bin from all times so crosse and fatall to the English Nation, and particularly to your own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Many thousands do wonder that your Lordship shold be brought to persecute with so much animosity and hatred that reverend Order in Gods Church (Episcopacy) which is contemporary with Christianity it self, and wherunto you had once designed, and devoted one of your dearest Sons so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly.</p>

will attend poor <hi>England,</hi> as did <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> which was one of the flourishingst King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms upon that part of the earth, which happen'd thus: The Common people ther repind at the Hierarchy and riches of the Church, therupon a Parliament was pack'd where Bishops were abolished, what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? The Nobles and Gentry went down next, and afterwards the Crown it self, and so it became a popular confus'd Anarchicall State, and a Stage of bloud a long time, so that at last, when this Magot had done working in the brains of the foolish peeple, they were glad to have recourse to Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy again after a world of calamities; though it degenerated from a successive Kingdom to an Elective. Methinks, my Lord, under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that those notorious visible judgements which have fallen upon these Refiners of reform'd <hi>Religion</hi> shold unbeguile your Lordship, and open your eyes: For the hand of heaven never appeared so clearly in any humane actions: Your Lordship may well remember what became of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thams,</hi> and Sir <hi>Alexander Cary,</hi> who were the two fatall wretches that began the War first, one in the <hi>North,</hi> the other in the <hi>South, Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Hull.</hi> Your Lordship

Touching <hi>Pym</hi> and <hi>Stroud,</hi> those two worthy Champions of the <hi>Utopian</hi> cause, the first being opened, his stomack and guts were found to be full of pellets of bloud, the other had little or no brain in his skull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, and lesse when he was living: Touching those who carryed the first scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous

the King: Your Lordship cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the sundry clashes that have bin 'twixt the City and their Memberships, and 'twixt their Memberships and their men of War or Military Officers, who have often wav'd and disobeyed their commands: How this tatterdimallian Army hath reduc'd this cow'd City, the cheated Country, and their once all-commanding Masters, to a perfect passe of slavery, to a tru Asinin condition; They crow over all the ancient Nobility and Gentry of the Kindom, though ther be not found amongst them all but two Knights; and 'tis well known ther be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of privat Gentlemen in the Kingdom, the poorest of whom, is able to buy this whole Host with the Generall himself and all the Commanders: But 'tis not the first time, that the Kings and Nobility of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land have bin baffled by petty companions: I have read of <hi>Iack Straw, Wat Tyler,</hi> and <hi>Ket</hi> the Tanner, with divers others that did so, but being suppressed it tended to the advantage of the King at last; and what a world of examples are ther in our story, that those Noblemen who banded against the Crown, the revenge of heaven ever found them out early or late at last.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98493:76"/>
His Children, His Servants, His Liberty, His Chaplains, and of every thing in which there is any comfort; observe well, how neverthelesse, God Almighty works in Him by inspiring Him with equality and calmnesse of mind, with patience, prudence and constancy, How Hee makes His very Crosses to stoop unto Him, when His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will not: Consider the monstrousnesse of the Propositions that are tendred him, wherein no lesse then Crown, Scepter, and Sword, which are things in-alienable from Majesty, are in effect demanded, nay, they would have him transmit, and resign his very intellectuals unto them, not only so, but they would have him make a sacrifice of his soul, by forcing him to violate that solemne sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall Oath hee took at his Coronation when hee was no <hi>Minor,</hi> but come to a full maturity of reason and judgement: make it your own case, My Lord, and that's the best way to judge of His: Think upon the multiplicity of solemne astringing Oathes your Lordship hath taken, most whereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and solely enjoyne faith and loyalty to his Person; oh my Lord! wrong not your soule so much, in comparison of whom your body is but a rag of rottennesse.</p>

                  <p>To conclude, as I presume to give your Lordship these humble cautions and advice in particular, so I offer it to all other of your rank, office, order and Relations, who have souls to save, and who by solemn indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable

                  <p>My Lord, he who presents these humble advertisments to your Lordship, is one who is inclin'd to the Parliament of <hi>Engl.</hi> in as high a

                  <p>UPon a time, The <hi>Flowers</hi> assembled, and met in one generall Counsell, by the authority and summons of the Soveraign <hi>Rose,</hi> their undoubted naturall King, who had taken the <hi>Lilly</hi> for his royall spouse. The dew of heaven fell plentifully upon this happy conjunction, which made them to <hi>Bourgeon,</hi> to propagate and prosper exceedingly, in so much, that the sweet fragrant odor which they did cast, diffused it self over all the earth. To this meeting came the <hi>Violet, Gilliflower,</hi> the <hi>Rosemary,</hi> the <hi>Tulyp, Lavender</hi> and <hi>Thyme,</hi> the <hi>Cinquefoyle</hi> (though of a forren growth) had an<note place="margin">M.

all under the <hi>Rose,</hi> they had priviledge to speak all things with freedome; Complaints were made that much <hi>Cockle</hi> and <hi>Darnell,</hi> with other noxious <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>tares</hi> were crept in amongst them, that the <hi>Poppie</hi> did <hi>pullulat</hi> too much, with divers other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances: The successe of this Senat, this great <hi>Bed</hi> or <hi>Posie</hi> of living <hi>Flowers,</hi> was like to prove very prosperous, but that the <hi>herb Briony, Wormwood, Wolfbane, Rue,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampod</hi> (the emblems of Sedition, <hi>Malice, Feare, Ambition</hi> and <hi>Iealousie</hi>) thrust in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and much distempered their proceedings: These brought in with them the Bur, which exceedingly retarded and<note place="margin">Scot.</note> intangled all businesses; and it was thought that the <hi>Thistle</hi> was too medling amongst them, which made matters grow to that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony and confusion, as if the <hi>herb Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus diaboli</hi> had got in amongst them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many other good-morrows, they propounded to the <hi>Rose,</hi> that he should part with his <hi>prickles,</hi> and transmit his strength that way to be disposed of by them; the Royall Rose liked not this bold request of theirs, though couched in very smooth language, but answered, I have hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to every thing you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,

                  <p>IT fortuned, that the Winds banded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Eolus:</hi> And <hi>Boreas</hi> (the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind) began to bluster first, and wold <hi>blow wher he listed,</hi> he grew so boisterous, that he is call'd <hi>Scopa viarum,</hi> the high-way Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, he seem'd to sweep all before him Southward, insomuch, that uniting all his strength into one body, he made towards <hi>Eolus</hi> in a hostile armed manner, and so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of him what he desired. After his example (and an odde example it was) the West-wind, his fellow subject rose<note place="margin">The Scot. The Irish.</note> up, alledging, that though he blew from the left-side of Heaven, yet he deserved to be as much favoured as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas,</hi> in regard he drove a far richer trade, and blew upon a more fertile Countrey, which brought in much more benefit to the rest of <hi>Eolus</hi> his Dominions; therfore he would have his liberties also assur'd him, which he alledged were altogether as ancient as the others: This made him puff with such an impetuous violence, that his blasts brought with them (God wot) divers showres of bloud, and whole Cataracts of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98493:106"/>
calamities: Now, as it is observed in the course of naturall things, that one mischief seldom marcheth alone, but ushers in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hath alwaies its concomitants, so these North and Western gusts, as one wave useth to drive on another, made all the winds in the compasse, both <hi>collaterall</hi> and <hi>cardinall</hi> to rise up and rebell against <hi>Eolus,</hi> even under that very Clime, and in those Horizons, where he kept his principall resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and royal Court. And this popular wind (for 'twas no other, take it all<note place="margin">England.</note> joyntly in one puff) did rage with that vehemency, that it turn'd every wher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fearful flames of fire (issuing out of a kind of <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> which by its repercussions, and furious arietations, did a world of mischief, as if it had bin that incendiary <hi>Prester wind,</hi> or rather an <hi>Haraucana,</hi> that <hi>Indian</hi> gust, which alwaies brings the Devil along with it as those Savages believe) had blown here, For, <hi>surely God was not in this wind.</hi> Yet som were so simple, to think that this wind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from divine <hi>inspirations;</hi> nay, they came to that height of prophaneness, as to father it upon the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more different to his sweet motions, nothing so directly opposit to his

It was so violent, that it overturn'd all stone Tables that stood East-ward; it blew away all the decent Vests and Ornaments of the Church; the Bishops Mitre (an Order contemporary with Christianity it self) did quake like an Aspen leaf before it; nay, it shrewdly shook the very Imperial Scepter, and Crown which stood on <hi>Eolus</hi> his head, so that he was like to become <hi>Ludibrium Ventorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the highest Deity of Heaven, <hi>He who walketh upon the wings of the wind, and makes weight for them, and gathereth them in his fist when he pleaseth,</hi> hating such an odious rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, rebuked these tumultuous winds, he caused a contagious aire, to rush in and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with them, and infect them with new d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98493:107"/>
So <hi>Eolus</hi> recovered his Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and as they say, ther is no wind but blows som body good; so this turn'd much to the advantage of <hi>Eolus,</hi> for he grew ever after more firm and better establish'd in his regall power, because he put a competent guard in those Climes whence all these boistrous winds burst forth, and so secur'd himself ever after, that they could not blow where they listed.</p>

There are some that in broken peeces have written of all three: but not in one entire discourse, as this is, nor hath any hitherto hit upon those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and inferences that shall be displayed herein.</p>
                  <p>But he who adventures to judge of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires

The late <hi>Cessation</hi> of Armes in <hi>Ireland</hi> was an affaire of this nature; a true Act of State, and of as high a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as could be: Which Cessation is now become the <hi>Common Subject</hi> of every mans discourse, or rather the discourse of every <hi>common Subject</hi> all the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes over: And not onely the subject of their discourse, but of their <hi>censure</hi> also; nor of their censure onely, but of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and obloquy.

such a fond irregular humour reignes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of late yeers amongst the English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now the Designe of this small discourse, though the Subject require a farre greater volume, is, to vindicate His Majesties most pious intentions in condescending to this late suspension of Arms in His Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to make it appeare to any rationall ingenious capacity, (not pre-oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied or purblinded with passion) that there was more of honour and necessity, more of prudence and piety in the said Cessation, than there was either in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification</hi> or <hi>Peace</hi> that was made with the Scot.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed herein the more methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, I will lay downe, first,</p>
                  <p>The reall and true radicall causes of the late two-yeers Irish <hi>Insurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the course His Majesty used to suppresse it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, those indispensable impulsive reasons and invincible necessity which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced His Majesty to condescend to a Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
                  <p>Touching the grounds of the said Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, we may remember when His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty

out of a pious designe (as His <hi>late Majesty</hi> also had) to settle an Uniformitie of serving God in all his three Kingdomes, sent our Liturgie to his Subjects of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> some of that Nation made such an advantage hereof, that though it was a thing only <hi>recommended,</hi> not <hi>commanded</hi> or pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon them, and so cald in suddenly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by a most gracious Proclamation, accompanied with a generall pardon: Yet they would not rest there, but they would take the opportunity hereby to demolish Bishops, and the whole Hierarchy of the Church (which was no grievance at all till then) To which end, they put themselves in actuall Armes, and obtained at last what they listed; which they had not dared to have done, had they not been sure to have as good friends in <hi>England</hi> as they had in <hi>Scotland</hi> (as <hi>Lesly</hi> himself confessed to Sir <hi>William Berkley</hi> at <hi>Newcastle</hi>) for some of the chiefest Inconformists here, had not onely intelligence with them, but had been of their Cabinet-counsels in moulding the Plot: though some would cast this war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the French Cardinall, to vindicate the invasion we made upon his Masters domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Isle of Rets; as also for some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage

                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:98493:114"/>Moreover, the <hi>Irish</hi> entred into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that They also had sundry grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and grounds of complaint, both touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their estates and consciences, which they pretended to be far greater than those of the <hi>Scots.</hi> For they fell to think, that if the Scot was suffered to introduce a <hi>new</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it was reason they shold not be so pinched in the exercise of their <hi>old,</hi> which they glory never to have altered. And for temporall matters (wherin the <hi>Scot</hi> had no grievance at all to speak of) the new plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which had bin lately afoot, to be made in <hi>Conaught</hi> and other places; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed lands and defective titles which were daily found out; the new customs which were imposed, and the incapacity they had to any preferment or Office in Church and State (with other things) they conceived these to be grievances of a far greater na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that deserved redresse much more than any the <hi>Scot</hi> had. To this end, they sent over Commissioners to attend this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>England,</hi> with certain Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but those Commissioners were dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hence with a short and unsavoury an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, which bred worse bloud in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than was formerly gathered; and this,

with that leading case of the <hi>Scot,</hi> may be said to be the first incitements that made them rise.</p>

But these were but confused imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect notions, which began to receive more vigour and form after the death of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who kept them under so exact an obedience, though som censure him to have screwed up the strings of the <hi>Harp</hi> too high; insomuch that the taking off of the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> head, may be said to be the second incitement to the <hi>heads</hi> of that insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to stir.</p>

                  <p>The grounds of this insurrection being thus discovered, let us examine what means His Majesty used for the suppression of it. He made his addresses presently to his great Counsel, the English Parliament then assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors did seldom use to do, but only to their Privy Counsel in such cases, who had the discussing and transacting of all foreign affaires; for in mannaging matters of State, specially those of war, which must be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98493:116"/>
with all the secrecy that may be, <hi>Trop grand nombre, est encombre,</hi> as the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man saith, too great a number of Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours may be an incumber, and expose their results and resolutions to discovery and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disadvantages, wheras in military pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings the work shold be afoot before the Counsels be blazed abroad. Well, His Majesty transmitted this business to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> who totally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking it, and wedding as it were the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel (as I remember they did that of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi> a little before by solemn vote; the like was done by the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> also, by a publick joynt Declaration, which in regard ther came nothing of it, tended lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the honour of either Nation abroad) His Majesty gave his royal assent to any Propositions or acts for raising of men, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and arms to perform the work. But hereby no man is so simple as to think His Majesty shold absolutely give over his own personal care and protection of that his Kingdom, it being a Rule, <hi>That a King can no more desert the protection of his own people, then they their subjection to him.</hi> In all his Declarations ther was nothing that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd and inculcated more often, and with

greater aggravation and earnestness unto them, then the care of his poor Subjects their fellow-Protestants in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Nay, he resented their condition so far, and took the business so to heart, that he offered to passe over in person for their relief: And who can deny but this was a magnanimous and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like resolution? Which the <hi>Scots</hi> by publick act of Counsel, did highly approve of, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be an argument of care and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in his Majesty. And questionless it had done infinite good in the opinion of them that have felt the pulse of the Irish people, who are daily ore-heard to groan, how they have bin any time these 400. years under the English Crown, and yet never saw but two of their Kings all the while upon <hi>Irish</hi> ground, though ther be but a <hi>salt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

taking into his Princely thoughts those wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full complainrs and cryes of his poore Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, condescended at last to appoint some persons of honour to heare what the Irish could say for themselves, as they had often petitioned; and God forbid but the King of <hi>Ireland</hi> should receive his Subjects petitions, as well as the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But His Majesty being unsatisfied with what they propounded then, the Lord Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> marched with considerable Forces against them, and though he came off with honour, yet no reliefe at all comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for many moneths after from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament here, who had undertaken the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and had received all the summes and subsidies, with other unknown contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions to that end, matters grew daily worse and worse. To sum up all, His Majesty receiving express and positive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from his Lord Justices and Counsell of State ther, that the whole Kingdom was upon point of utter perdition, which was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intimated the same time to the Parliament here, by a special letter to the <hi>Speaker;</hi> I say His Majesty finding that he had neither pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of himself, it being transmitted to others; and that those Trustees did misapply that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98493:119"/>
power and trust he had invested in them (for the time) to make good their undertaking for preservation of that his fruitfull King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; being impelled by all these forcible reasons, His Majesty sent a commission to the Lord Marquesse of <hi>Ormond</hi> his Lievtenant Generall (a most known sincere Protestant) to hearken to a <hi>treaty</hi> according to their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; and if any thing was amisse in that <hi>treaty</hi> in poynt of honour (as it shall appeare by comparing it with others, there was none) we know <hi>whom</hi> to thank. For out of these premises also, doth result this second conclusion, That they who <hi>misapplied those moneys, and mis imployed those men</hi> which were levyed with His Majesties royall assent for the reduction of <hi>Ireland:</hi> They who set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot that most sanguinary design of extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating, at least of <hi>enslaving</hi> a whole ancient Nation, who were planted there by the hand of Providence from the beginning: They who hindred His Majesties <hi>transfretation</hi> thither to take cognizance of his own affairs, and expose the countenance of his own roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all person for composing of things: They, They may be said to be the true causes of that unavoydable necessity and as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poetsings, <hi>The Gods, themselvs cannot resist</hi>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:98493:120"/>
                     <hi>Necessity</hi>) which enforced His Majesty to capitulat with the Irish, and assent to a <hi>Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the saying of one of the bravest Roman Emperours, and it was often used by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Her Majesties Father, <hi>That he had rather save the life of one loyall Subject then kill a hundred Enemies:</hi> It may well be thought that one of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valentst inducements that moved His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty (besides those formerly mentioned) to condescend to this Irish Cessation, was a sense he had of the effusion of his own poor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects blood, the hazard of the utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Protestants there, and a totall irrecoverable losse of that Kingdome, as was advertised both in the petition of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants themselves, the relation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee imployd thither to that purpose, and the expresse letters of the Lords Justices and Counsell there.</p>
                  <p>To prove now, that this Cessation of arms in <hi>Ireland</hi> was more honourable and fuller of Piety, Prudence and Necessity, then either the Pacification or Peace with the <hi>Scot.</hi> I hope, these few ensuing arguments (above divers others which cannot be inserted here, in regard of the force inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98493:120"/>
brevity of this Discourse) will serve the turne.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>In primis,</hi> When the <hi>Pacification</hi> was made with <hi>Scotland</hi> His Majesty was there personally present, attended on by the floure of His English Nobility, Gentry and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and the enemy was hard by ready to face Him. At the concluding of the Irish Cessation, His Majesty was not there perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally present, but it was agitated and agreed on by his <hi>Commissioner,</hi> and it hath been held alwaies less dishonourable for a King to capitulate in this kind with his own Subjects by his Deputy, then in his own person, for the further off he is, the lesse reflects upon him.</p>
                  <p>2. Upon the Pacification and Peace with Scotland, there was an Amnestia, a generall pardon, and an abolition of all by-passed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences published, there were honours and offices conferred upon the chiefest sticklers in the War. At the Cessation in <hi>Ireland</hi> there was no such thing.</p>
                  <p>3. When the Pacification and Peace was made with the <hi>Scots,</hi> there was mony given unto <hi>Them,</hi> as it is too well knowne. But upon the setling of this <hi>Cessation,</hi> the Irish received none but <hi>gave</hi> His Majesty a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98493:121"/>
summe as an argument of their submission and gratitude, besides the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of some of his Garrisons in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim; and so much partly in point of honour.</p>
                  <p>4. At the concluding of the Pacification and Peace with <hi>Scotland,</hi> there was a vigorous, fresh, unfoiled English Army a foot, and in perfect equipage; there wanted neither Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, Armes, Money, Cloaths, Victuals or any thing that might put heart into the Souldier and elevat his spirits. But the Protestant Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> had not any of all these in any competent proportion, but were ready to perish, though there had been no other enemy then hunger and cold: And this implies a farre greater necessity for the said Cessation.</p>
                  <p>5. In <hi>Ireland</hi> there was imminent danger of an instant losse of the whole Kingdome, and consequently, the utter subversion of the Protestant Religion there, as was certified both to King and Parliament by sundry let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and petitions which stand upon record: There was no such danger in the affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> either in respect of Religion or Kingdome; therefore there was more piety shown in preserving the one, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98493:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prudence in preserving the other in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by plucking both (as it were) out of the very jawes of destruction by the said Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>We know that <hi>in the Medley of mundane casualties, of two evils, the least is to be chosen,</hi> and a small inconvenience is to be born withall, to prevent a greater.</p>
                  <p>If one make research into the French Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he will find, that many kinds of Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Suspensions of Armes were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted 'twixt that King and som of his Subjects, trenching far more upon regall dignity then this in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Spaniard was forced to declare the Hollanders <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,</hi> before they could be brought to treat of a truce: And now the <hi>Catalans</hi> scrue him up almost to as high conditions. But what need I rove abroad so far? It is well known, nor is it out of the memory of man (in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raign) that in <hi>Ireland</hi> it self ther have bin Cessations, all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances well weighed, more prejudiciall to Majesty then this.</p>
                  <p>But that which I hear murmured at most as the effect of this Cessation, is the transport of som of those Souldiers to <hi>England</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruting His Majesties Armies, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98493:122"/>
that the greatest number of them be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and rigid Protestants, and were those whom our Parliament it self imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Irish. But put case they were all <hi>Papists,</hi> must His Majesty therfore be held a Favourer of Popery? The late King of <hi>France</hi> might have bin said as well to have bin a Favourer of <hi>Hugonotts,</hi> because in all his wars he imployed Them most of any in places of greatest trust against the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> wheras all the World knows, that he perfectly hated them in the generall, and one of the reaches of policy he had, was to spend and waste them in the wars. Was it ever known but a Soveraign Prince might use the bodies and strength of his own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall-born Subjects, and Liege men for his own defence? When His person hath been sought and aimed at in open field by small and great shot, and all other Engines of hostility and violence: When he is in danger to be surprized or besieg'd in that place wher he keeps his Court: When all the flowers of his Crown his royal prerogatives which are descended upon him from so many suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive progenitors) are like to be plucked off and trampled under foot: When ther is a visible plot to alter and overturn that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

                  <p>Now, in a Successive hereditary King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as <hi>England</hi> is known, and <hi>acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to be by all Parties now in opposition, There are three things which are inalienable from the Person of the <hi>King:</hi> They are,</p>

them: and the two first are but bables without the last, as was formerly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                  <p>1. Touching the <hi>Crown</hi> or royal Diadem of <hi>England,</hi> ther is none, whether <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Independent, Protestant,</hi> or others now in action, but confess that it descends by a right hereditary Line, (though through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Races, and som of them Conquerours) upon the Head of <hi>Charles</hi> the first now Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: 'tis His own by inherent birth-right and nature, by Gods Law, and the Law of the Land, and these Parliament-men at their first sitting did agnize subjection unto Him accordingly, and recognize Him for their Soveraign Liege Lord: Nay, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick</hi> denies not this, for though there were <hi>Bulls</hi> sent to dispense with the English Subjects for their allegiance to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> yet the Pope did this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Her as he took Her for a <hi>Heretick,</hi> not an <hi>Usurpresse,</hi> though he knew well enough that She had bin declared Illegitimate by the Act of an English Parliament.</p>
                  <p>This Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deckd with many fair Flowers, which are called, royal Prerogatives; and they are of such a transcendent nature, that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98493:132"/>
they are unforfeitable, individual, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>transferrable to any other: The King can only summon and dissolve Parliaments: The King can only Pardon (for when He is Crowned, He is sworn to rule in Mercy as well as in Justice:) The King can only Coyn Money, and enhance or decry the value of it: The power of electing Officers of State, of Justices of Peace and Assize is in the King; He can only grant soveraign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions: The King can only wage War, and make Out-landish Leagues: The King may make all the Courts of Justice ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory with His Person, as they were used of old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis tru, the Court of <hi>Common Pleas</hi> must be sedentary in som certain place for such a time; but that expired, 'tis remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at His pleasure: The King can only employ Ambassadours and Treat with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign States, &amp;c. These, with other royal Prerogatives which I shall touch hereafter, are those rare and wholsom flowers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is embellished, nor can they stick any where else but in the Crown, and all confess the Crown is as much the King's, as any private man's Cap is his own.</p>
                  <p>2. The second regall Instrument is the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98493:132"/>
                     <hi>Scepter,</hi> which may be called <hi>an inseparable companion,</hi> or <hi>a necessary appendix to the Crown;</hi> this invests the <hi>King</hi> with the sole Authority of making Lawes, for before His confirmation all results and determinations of Parliament are but Bills or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> they are but abortive things, and meer Embryos; nay, they have no life at all in them till the <hi>King</hi> puts breath and vigour into them: and the ancient custome was for the <hi>King</hi> to touch them with His <hi>Scepter,</hi> then they are Lawes, and have a vertue in them to impose an obligation of universall obedience upon all sorts of people, It being an undeniable maxime, That <hi>nothing can be generally binding without the King's royall assent,</hi> nor doth the Law of <hi>England</hi> take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing without it: This being done they are ever after styl'd <hi>the Kings Lawes,</hi> and the Judges are said to deliver the King's judgments, which agrees with the holy text, <hi>The King by judgment shall stablish the Land:</hi> nay, the Law presumes the <hi>King</hi> to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the sole Judge Paramount, and Lord chief Justice of <hi>England,</hi> for he whom He pleaseth to depute for His chiefest Justice, is but styl'd <hi>Lord chief Iustice of the Rings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ench,</hi> not Lord chief Justice of <hi>England,</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:98493:133"/>
which title is peculiar to the <hi>King</hi> Himself, and observable it is, that whereas He grants Commissions and Patents to the Lord Chancellour (who is no other then <hi>Keeper of His Conscience</hi>) and to all other Judges, He names the Chief Justice of his own Bench by a short Writ only containing two or three lines: which run thus, <hi>Regina Iohanni Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham militi salutem, Sciatis quod constitutmus vos justiciarium nostrum Capitalem ad placita coram nobis terminandum durante beneplacito nostro; Teste</hi> &amp;c. Now, though the <hi>King</hi> be liable to the Laws, and is contented to be within their verge, because they are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly His own productions, yet He is still their Protector, Moderator, and Soveraigne, which attributes are incommunicable to any other conjunctly or separately.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>King</hi> with His <hi>Scepter,</hi> and by the mature advice of His two Houses of Parl. which are His highest Councel and Court, hath the sole power of making Laws; other Courts of judicature doe but expound them and distribute them by His appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they have but <hi>Iuris dati dictionem</hi> or <hi>declarationem,</hi> and herein, I meane for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Lawes <hi>the twelve Iudges</hi> are to be <hi>believed before the whole Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</hi>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:98493:133"/>
They are as the Areopagites in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> the chief Presidents in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> in an extraordinary <hi>Iunta,</hi> as the <hi>Cape-Syndiques</hi> in the <hi>Rota's</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique of <hi>Venice,</hi> whose judgments in point of interpreting Lawes are incontroulable, and preferred before the opinion of the whole Senate whence they received their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and who hath still power to repeal them, though not to expound them. In <hi>France</hi> they have a Law maxime, <hi>Arrest donné en Rebbe rouge est irrevocable,</hi> which is, <hi>a Scarlet Sentence is irrevocable,</hi> meaning when all the Judges are met in their Robes, and the Client against whom the Cause goes, may chafe and chomp upon the bit, and say what he will for the space of twenty foure howers against his Judges, but if ever after he traduces them, he is punishable: It is no otherwise here where every ignorant peevish Client, every puny Barister, specially if he become a Member of the House will be ready to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and vie knowledge with all the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Judges in the Land, whose judgement in points of Law shold be onely tripodicall and sterling: so that he may be truly call'd a just King, and to rule according to Law, who rules according to the opinion of his
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98493:134"/>
Judges; therefore, under favour, I do not see how his Majesty for his part could be call'd injust when he leavied the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, considering he had the Judges for it.</p>
                  <p>I now take the <hi>Sword</hi> in hand, which is the third Instrument of a King, (and which this short discours chiefly <hi>points</hi> at) it is as well as the two first incommunicable and inalie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable from his Person; nothing concernes his honor more both at home and abroad; the <hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>Scepter</hi> are but unweildy and impotent naked indefensible things without it. There's none so simple as to think there's meant hereby an ordinary sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle sword, such as ev'ry one carrieth by his side, or som imaginary thing or chymera of a sword; No, 'tis the polemicall publique sword of the whole Kingdom, 'tis an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregative compound sword, and 'tis moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of bell-metall; for 'tis made up of all the ammunition and armes small and great, of all the military strengths both by Land and Sea, of all the Forts, Castles and tenable places within and round about the whole Ile: The Kings of Engl. have had this sword by vertue of their royall signory from all times, the Laws have girded it to their sides, they
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98493:134"/>
have employed it for repeling all foren force, for revenging all forren wrongs or affronts, for quelling all intestine tumults, and for protecting the weal of the whole body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke at home: The peeple were never ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this sword, the fundamentall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of this Kingdom deny it them; 'tis all one to put the sword in a mad mans hand, as in the peeples; or for them to have a disposing power in whose hands it shall be. Such was the case once of the French sword, in that notorious insurrection call'd to this day <hi>La Iaqueris de Beauvoisin,</hi> when the Pesants and Mechanicks had a design to wrest it out of the Kings hand, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse all the Peers and Gentry of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and the businesse had gone so far that the peasans might have prevail'd, had not the <hi>Prelats</hi> stuck close to the Nobility; But afterwards poor hare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>brain'd things they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the King upon bended knees to take it againe; Such popular puffs have blowen often in <hi>Poland, Naples</hi> and other places, where while they sought and fought for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by retrenching the regall power, they fool'd themselfs into a slavery unawares, and found the rule right, that <hi>excesse of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom turns to thraldom,</hi> and ushers in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:98493:135"/>
If one shold go back to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the world, when Governers and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers began first, one will find the peeple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd to live under Kings for their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that they might be restrain'd from wild exorbitant liberty, and kept in unity; Now unity is as requisit for the wel-being of all naturall things, as entity is for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and 'tis a receiv'd maxime in policy, that nothing preserves Unity more exactly then Royal Government: besides, 'tis known to be the noblest sort of sway; In so much that by the Law of Nations, if Subjects of equal degrees, and under differing Princes shold meet, the Subjects of a King shold take pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of those under any Republique.</p>
                  <p>But to take up the Sword again. I say that the Sword of public Power and Authority is fit only to hang at the Kings side, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed shold the <hi>Great Seal</hi> hang only at his girdle, because 'tis the Key of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: which makes me think of what I read of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> how he had the imperial Seal emboss'd alwaies upon the pommell of his Sword, and his reason was, that he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to maintain whatsoever he signed, and sealed.</p>
                  <p>The Civilians, who are not in all points so
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98493:135"/>
great friends to Monarchy as the Common Law of England is, say, there are six <hi>Iura Regalia,</hi> six Regal Rights, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Potestas Iudicatoria,</hi> 2. <hi>Potestas vitae &amp; necis,</hi> 3. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamenta,</hi> 4. <hi>Bona adespota,</hi> 5. <hi>Census,</hi> 6. <hi>Monetarum valor:</hi> to wit, <hi>Power of Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Power of Life and Death, all kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, masterless goods, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>issements, and the value of money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among these <hi>Regalia's,</hi> we find that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> which in effect is nought else but the Kings Sword, is among the chiefest; and 'tis as proper and peculiar to his person, as either Crown or Scepter. By these two he drawes a loose voluntary love and opinion only from his Subjects, but by the Sword he draws reverence and awe, which are the chiefest ingredients of allegiance, it being a maxime, <hi>That the best mixture of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made of fear and love.</hi> With this Sword he conferrs honor, he dubbs Knights, he creates Magistrates, the Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> with all other Corporations have their Swords from him, and when he entereth any place cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, we know the first thing that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him is the Sword: With this Sword he shields and preserves all his people that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98493:136"/>
every one may sit quietly under his own Vine, sleep securely in his own House, and enjoy sweetly the fruits of his labours.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth the point of this Sword reach only to every corner of his own dominions, but it extends beyond the seas to gard his Subjects from oppression, and denial of justice, as well as to vindicate the publick wrongs, make good the interests of his Crown, and to assist his confederates; This is the Sword that <hi>Edward</hi> the third tied the <hi>Flower deluces</hi> unto (which stick still unto it,) when having sent to <hi>France</hi> to demand that Crown by maternal right, the Counsell ther sent him word that the <hi>Crown of France was not tied to a distaff,</hi> to which <hi>scoffing</hi> answer he replied, <hi>that then he wold tie it to his sword,</hi> and he was as good as his word. Nor is this publick sword concredited or intrusted by the <hi>peeple</hi> in a fiduciary conditionall way to the King, but it is properly and peculiarly belonging unto him, as an inseparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant, perpetual Usher and attendant to his Crown. The King, we know, useth to maintain all garrisons upon his own charge, not the peeples; he fortifies upon his own charge, not the peeples: And though I will not averr, that the King may impresse any
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98493:136"/>
of his Subjects, unlesse it be upon an actuall vasion by Sea, or a sudden irruption into his Kingdom by Land, as the Scots have often done, yet at any time the King may raise Volunteers, and those who have received his money, the Law makes it <hi>felony,</hi> if they forsake his service.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see there's nothing that condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth more to the glory, and indeed the very essence of a King then the Sword, which is the Armes and Military strength of his Kingdom; wherfore under favour, ther can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a greater point of dishonour to a King then to be disarmed, then to have his Sword taken from him, or dispos'd of and intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any but those whom he shall appoint; for as <hi>à minori ad majus</hi> the Argument often holds, if a private Gentleman chance to be disarm'd upon a quarrell, 'tis held the utmost of disgraces, much greater and more public is the dishonor that falls upon a King, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter som traverses of difference 'twixt him and his Subjects, they shold offer to disarm him, or demand his Sword of him: when the Eagle parted with his talons, and the Lion with his teeth and ongles, the Apolog tells us how contemptible afterwards the one grew to be among Birds, the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:98493:137"/>
Birds, the other among Beasts. For a King to part with the Sword politic is to render himself such a ridiculous King, as that logg of wood was which <hi>Iupiter</hi> let down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the froggs for their King at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of their croaking; 'tis to make him a King of clouts, or as the Spaniard hath it, <hi>Rey de Havas,</hi> a Bean King, such as we use to choose in sport at Twelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</p>
                  <p>But my hopes are, that the two present Houses of Parliament (for now they may be call'd so, because they begin to <hi>parley</hi> with their King,) will be more tender of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Soveraign Liege Lord, which, together with all his Rights and Dignities, by severall solemn Oaths, aud by their own binding instruments of <hi>Protestation and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> (not yet revok'd) they are sworne to maintaine, and that they will demand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him which may favour of <hi>Aspertè</hi> or force, but what may hold water hereafter: But now, touching the <hi>Militia</hi> or Sword of the Kingdom, I think, under favour, the King cannot transfer it to any other; for that were to desert the protection of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is point blank against his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Oath and his Office: What forren
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98493:137"/>
Prince or State will send either <hi>Ambassador, Resident</hi> or <hi>Agent</hi> to him, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his Sword is taken from him? What reformed forein Church will acknowledg Him <hi>Defendor of the Faith,</hi> when they hear of this? Nay, they who wish England no good will, will go near to paint him out, as not long since another King was, with a fair velvet Scabbard, a specious golden hilt and chape, but the blade within was of wood. I hope that they who sway now, will make better use of their successes: Many of them know 'tis as <hi>difficult a thing to use a victory well, as to get one;</hi> ther is as much prudence requir'd in the one, as prowesse in the other; they will be wiser sure then turn it to the dishonor of their King: it being a certain rule, that the glory of a Nation all the world over depends upon the glory of their King, and if he be any way obscur'd, the whole Kingdom is under an eclipse.</p>
                  <p>I have observed, that among other cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of gallantry, which forein Writers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriat to the English Nation, one is, that they use to be most zealous to preserve the Honor of their King; I trust that they who are now up will return to the steps of their Progenitors, both in this particular and divers

other; that their successes may serve to sweeten and moderat things, and suppress the popular Sword which still rages; And it had bin heartily wished that a suspension of Arms had preceded this Treaty, which useth to be the ordinary fore-runner, and a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary antecedent to all Treaties; for while acts of hostility continue, som ill-favour'd newes may intervene which may imbitter and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

                  <p>To deduce matters from their Originall, Your Eminency may please to understand, that this King at his accesse to the Crown had
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98493:142"/>
deep debts to pay, both of His Fathers, and his own, he was left ingaged in a fresh warre with <hi>Spain;</hi> and had another present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after which <hi>France,</hi> and both at one time, but he came off well enough of those: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards never any Countrey flourished in that envied happinesse, and wanton kind of prosperity; This City of <hi>London</hi> was grown to be the greatest Mart, and mistress of trade, of any in the world; Insomuch, as I have been certainly inform'd, the King might have spent meerly upon His customes 4000 crowns a day: Moreover, she had a vast bank of money being made the <hi>scale</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the King of <hi>Spains</hi> treasure to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> Insomuch that in a few yeers she had above ten millions of his moneys brought hither, which she might have remitted in specie or in marchandize, and for which this King had five in the hundred for coynage: Yet could he not get beforehand with the world, having a sister with so many Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews and neeces, having a Queen with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse children of His own, (at least 16 of the Blood-Royall) to maintaine, with divers profuse Courtiers besides, which made Him more parsimonious then ordinary. The Warres then growing more active 'twixt

                     <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as also 'twixt <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> both by Land and Sea, and divers great Fleets of Men of War as well <hi>French</hi> (who were growne powerfull that way) as <hi>Dunkerkers, Spaniards Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers,</hi> appearing daily in His narrow Seas, and sayling close by His <hi>Chambers,</hi> the world wondred this King had no greater strength at Sea, in case that any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Nations should doe him an affront, as some of them had already done, by denying to dash their Colours to his Ships: Insomuch that in <hi>Holland</hi> and other places he was pasquill'd at, and pourtrayed lying in his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle lullaby'd and rock'd asleep by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard: Hereupon being by advertisements from his Agents abroad, and frequent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of His Privie Councell at home, made sensible of the danger, and a kind of dishon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our he was faln into, and having intelligence that the French Cardinall began to question his title to the <hi>Dominion of the narrow Seas,</hi> considering He employed no visible power to preserve it, He began to consult of meanes to set forth a royall Fleet: but in regard the Purse of the Crowne was lightly ballasted, and that he had no mind to summon the three Estates, because of some indignities
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98493:143"/>
he had received in former Parliaments by the <hi>Puritan</hi> party (a race of people averse to all Kingly Government, unlesse they may pare it as they please) his then Atturney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall (<hi>Noy</hi>) a great cryed-up-Lawyer, put it in his Head to impose an old Tax called <hi>Ship-mony</hi> upon the Subject, which the said Lawyer did warrant upon his life to be Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, for he could produce divers Records how many of his Progenitors had done the like: The King not satisfied with his single o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, refer'd it to his learn'd Council, &amp; they unanimously averred it to be agreeable to the Law of the Land; yet this would not fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the King, but He would have the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of His twelve Judges, and they also affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by their <hi>single</hi> vouches the said Tax to be warrantable; Hereupon it was imposed and leavied, but some refusing to pay it, there was a suite commenc'd, during which all the Judges were to re-deliver their opinions joyntly, and the businesse being maturely debated and canvased in open Court divers months, and all arguments produc'd <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> nine of the said twelve Judges conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it legal. Thereupon the King continued the imposition of the said Tax, and never was mony imployed so much for the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and advantage of a Countrey, for he sent
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:98493:144"/>
out every Summer a royall fleet to scowre and secure the Seas; he caused a Galeon to be built, the greatest and gallantest that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver spread saile: Nor did he purse up, and dispose of one peny of this money to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use, but added much of his own Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues yeerly thereunto: So the world abroad cried up the King of <hi>England</hi> to be awake againe; <hi>Trade</hi> did wonderfully encrease, both Domestic and forrein in all the three Kingdomes; <hi>Ireland</hi> was reduced to an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Settlement, the Arrears of the Crown payed, and a considerable Revenue came thence cleerly to the Exchequer of <hi>England</hi> every year, the salaries of all Officers, with the pay of the standing Army <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>here, and all other Charges being defrayed by <hi>Ireland</hi> her self, which was never done before. Yet for all this height of pappinesse, and the glorious fruites of the said Ship-money, (which was but a kind of petty insensible Tax, &amp; a thing of nothing to what hath hapened since) there were some foolish peeple in this Land which murmured at it, and cryed nothing else but a Parliament, a Parliament; and they have had a Parliament since with a vengeance.</p>
                  <p>But before this occasion, it was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the seeds of disobedience, and a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:98493:144"/>
spirit of insurrection was a long time engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in the hearts of som of this peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pampred People, which is conceived to proceed from their conversation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with three sorts of men, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> the <hi>Hollander</hi> and the <hi>French Huguenot.</hi> Now an advantage happened that much condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to necessitate the convoking of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was an ill-favoured traverse that fell out in <hi>Scotland;</hi> For the King inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an Uniformity of Divine worship in all His three Kingdoms, sent thither the <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> of this Church, but it found cold and course entertainment ther, for the whole Nation, men, women and children rise up a gainst them: Here upon the King absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revoked it by Proclamation, wherein He declared 'twas never His purpose to press the practise therof upon the Consciences of any; therfore commanded that all things shold be in <hi>statu quo prius,</hi> but this wold not serve the turn, the <hi>Scot</hi> took advantge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to destroy <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and pull down the Bishops to get their demeans: To which purpose they came with an Army in open Field against their own <hi>Native</hi> King, who not disgesting this indignity, Mustred ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>English</hi> Army; which being upon the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:98493:145"/>
confines of both Kingdoms, a kind of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification</hi> was plaistred over for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                  <p>The King returning to <hi>London,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting His second thoughts, resented that insolency of the <hi>Scots</hi> more then formerly: Hereupon He summons a Parliament, and desires aid to Vindicat that Affront of the <hi>Scot.</hi> The <hi>Scot</hi> had strong Intelligence with the Puritan Faction in the <hi>English</hi> Parliament, who seemed to abet his quarrel, rather then to be sensible of any national dishonour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him; which caused that short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived Parliament to dissolve in discontent, and the King was forced to find other means to raise and support an Army by privat Loanes of His nobler sort of Subjects and Servants: The <hi>Scot</hi> having punctual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements of every thing that passed; yea, in the Kings Cabinet Councel was not idle all this while, but rallies what was left of the former Army (which by the Articles of Pacification (a little before) should have bin absolutely <hi>dismissed</hi>) and boldly invades <hi>England,</hi> which he durst never have done, if he had not well known that this Puritan party which was now grown very powerful here, and indeed had <hi>invited</hi> him to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98493:145"/>
wold stand to him. This forein Army being by the pernicious close machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of som mongrel <hi>Englishmen</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, entred into the Bowels of the Country, the King was forced to call this present Parliament, with whom he comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every thing, so far as to sacrifice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them both <hi>Iudge, Bishop, Councellor</hi> and <hi>Courtier;</hi> yea, He yielded to the tumbling down of many tribunals of Justice, which were an advantage to his Prerogative; He assented that the Prelates, who were the most Ancient and Prime Members of the upper House, and had priority of all others, since the first constitution of Parliament in the enrollment of all Acts, He assented I say that these, who were the greatest prop of His Crown shold be quite outed from among the Peers; He granted them also a <hi>Trienniall</hi> Parliament, and after that, this <hi>Perpetuall;</hi> which words, to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of any rational man, carry with them a grosse absurdity in the very sense of the thing: And touching this last Grant, I had it from a good hand, that the Queen was a friend to this Parliament, and your Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence knows how they have requited Her since, but the main open Councellor to this fatall Act was a <hi>Scot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:98493:146"/>Now the reason which they alledged for this everlasting Parliament was one of the baldest that ever I heard of, it was, that they might have time enough to pay the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, wheras in one morning they might have dispatched that, by passing so many Subsidies for that use, and upon the credit of those, they might have raised what money they wold.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament finding the King so ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and His pulse to beat so gently, like ill-natur'd men they fall from inches to ells in seeking their advantages: They grew so peremptory as to demand all the Military strength of the Kingdom, the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> with the whole Royal Navy, which they found in an excellent equipage, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy ship-money; so that the benefit of ship-money, which they so clamoured at, turned most to their advantage of any thing afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scot</hi> being Fidler-like returned to his Country with meat, drink, and money, the King went a while after to keep a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ther, wherein he filled every blank, they did but ask and have, for He granted them what possibly they could propound, both for their Kirk and State, many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:98493:146"/>
Honour, and they divided Bishops Lands amongst them: for all which unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Concessions of Princely grace, they caused an Act already in force to be publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> that it shold be damnable Treason in the highest degree that could be, for any of the Scots Nation conjunctly or singly to levy armes, or any Military Forces, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretext whatsoever, without His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties royal Commission; and this they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be don by way of gratitude, but how they perform'd it afterwards the world knowes too well.</p>
                  <p>The King returning to <hi>London,</hi> in lieu of a welcom to his two Houses of Parliament (to whom also before his departure he had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed more Acts of Grace then all his Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, take them all in a lump) they had patch'd up a kind of <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> which was voted in dead of the night, wherein they expos'd to the world the least moat in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer government, and aggravated to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry height every grievance, notwithstanding that the King had redressed all before; and this <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> which breath'd nothing but a base kind of malice, they presented as a nosegay to their Soveraign Prince, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulat his safe return from a forein Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:98493:147"/>
which <hi>Remonstrance</hi> they caus'd to be printed and publish'd before he could give any answer thereunto. The King finding such a virulent spirit still raign in the House, and knowing who were chiefly possess'd with it (<hi>viz.</hi> Those whom he had impeach'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but saw he could get no justice against them) in such an extremity, he did an act like a generous Prince, for taking the <hi>Pals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> with him, he took the first Coach he met withall at his Court-gate, and went to his House of Commons in person, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>five Members,</hi> which he wold prove to be Traitors in the highest degree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to be the Authors of all these distempers, protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the word of a King, that they shold have as fair &amp; legal a tryal as ever men had; in the interim he only desir'd that their persons might be secur'd. The walls of both Houses, and the very stones in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> street did seem to ring of this high ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Kings, and the sound went thence to the Country, whence the silly Plebeians came presently in whole herds to this City, who strutting up and down the streets, had nothing in their mouths, but that the <hi>Priviledg of Parlement, the priviledg of Parlement was broken,</hi> though it be the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:98493:147"/>
known clear Law of the Land, that the Parlement cannot supersede or shelter any Treason.</p>
                  <p>The King finding how violently the pulse of the grosly seduced people did beat, and ther having bin formerly divers riotous crues of base Mechaniques and Mariners, who had affronted both his own Court, and the two Houses besides, which the Commons, to their eternal reproach, conniv'd at, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that divers motions were made by the Lords to suppresse them, the King also having privat intelligence that ther was a mischievous plot to surprize his person, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd his Court to the Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The King departing, or rather being <hi>dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> away thus from his two Houses, by this mutinous City, he might well at his going away have ubraided her in the same words as <hi>H.</hi> the 3. did upbraid <hi>Paris,</hi> who being by such another tumultuous rabble driven out of her in the time of the <hi>Ligue,</hi> as he was lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing sight of her, he turn'd his face back, and said, <hi>Farewel ingratefull City, I will never see thee again till I make my way into thee through thy Walls:</hi> Yet though the King absented himself in person thus from the two Houses, he sent them frequent messages, that they
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98493:148"/>
wold draw into Acts what he had already assented unto, and if any thing was left yet undon by him, he wold do it; therfore he will'd them to leave off those groundless feares and jealousies wherwith they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus'd both City and Country; and he was ready to return at all times to his Palace in Westminster, provided that his person might be secur'd from the former barbarisms and outrages: But in lieu of a dutiful compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with their Prince, the thoughts of the two Houses ran upon nothing but war: The King then retiring into the North, and thinking with a few of his servants only to go visit a Town of his (<hi>Hull</hi>) he was denyed entrance by a fatal unlucky wretch (<hi>Hotham</hi>) who afterwards was shamefully executed with his Eldest Son, by command of his new Masters of the Parlement: The King being thus shut out of his own Town (which open'd the first dore to a bloudy war) put forth a Declaration, wherin he warn'd all his people that they shold look to their proprieties, for if <hi>He</hi> was thus barr'd of his own, how could any privat Subject be sure to be Master of any thing he had, and herein he was as much <hi>Prophet</hi> as <hi>Prince;</hi> For the Parlement-men afterwards made themselfs Land-Lords of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98493:148"/>
the whole Kingdom, it hath bin usual for them to thrust any out of his freehold, to take his bed from under him, and his shirt from off his very back. The King being kept thus out of one of his Townes, might suspect that he might be driven out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therfore 'twas time for him to look to the preservation of his Person, and the Country came in voluntarily unto him by thousands to that purpose, but he made choice of a few only to be his gard, as the Parlementeers had done a good while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for themselfs: But now they went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to work, for they fell a levying, listing and arming men by whole Regiments and Brigades till they had a very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army afoot, before the King had one Musqueteer or Trooper on his side; yet these men are so notoriously impudent, as to make the King the first Aggressor of the war, and to lay upon Him all the bloud that was split to this day, wherein the Devil himself cannot be more shamelesse. The Parliamenteers having an army of foot and horse thus in perfect Equipage, 'twas high time for the King to look to himself, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was forced to display his royal Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, and draw his sword quite out: Thus a
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:98493:149"/>
cruel and most cruentous civil war began which lasted near upon four years without intermission, wherein there happen'd more batta les, sieges and skirmishes, then passed in the Nether-lands in fourscore years, and herein the Englishmen may be said to get som credit abroad in the world, that they have the same bloud running in their veines (though not the same braines in their sculls) which their Ancestors had, who were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be the activest people in the field, impatient of delay, and most desirous of battaile then any Nation.</p>
                  <p>But it was one of the greatest miracles that ever happen'd in this Land, how the King was able to subsist so long against the Parlamenteers, considering the multiplicity of infinite advantages they had of him by water and land: for they had the <hi>Scot,</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> and the <hi>City</hi> on their side; touching the first, he rushed in as an Auxiliary with above 20000. Horse and Foot compleatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d both with small and great ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Arms, well cloth'd and money'd: For the second, they had all the Kings ships well appointed, which are held to be the greatest security of the Island both for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and offence, for every one of them
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:98493:149"/>
is accounted one of the moving Castles of the Kingdom: besides, they had all the other standing stone-Castles, Forts, and tenable places to boot: Concerning the last, (<hi>viz.</hi> the City) therein they had all the wealth, bravery, and prime ammunition of <hi>England,</hi> this being the only Magazin of men and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: Now if the K. had had but one of these on his side, he had in all probability crush'd them to nothing: yet did he bear up strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against them a long time, and might have done longer, had he kept the campane, and not spent the spirits of his men before Townes; had he not made a disadvantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous election of som Commanders in chief, and lastly, had he not had close <hi>Traitors</hi> within dores, as well as open <hi>Rebels</hi> without; for his very Cabinet Councel, and Bed-Chamber were not free of such vermin, and herein the Parlementeers spent unknown sums and were very prodigal of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms money.</p>
                  <p>The King, after many traverses of war, being reduced to a great strait by crosse suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses and Counsels, rather then to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Parlementeers, withdrew himself in a Serving-mans disguise to the Scots army, as his last randevous, and this
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98493:150"/>
plot was manag'd by the French Agent then residing here; A man wold think that that Nation wold have deem'd it an eternal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto them to have their own King and Countrey-man throw himself thus into their armes, and to repose such a singular trust in them upon such an Extremity: but they corresponded not so well with him as he expected, for though at first when the Parlamenteers sollicited their <hi>dear Brethren</hi> for a delivery of the Kings person unto them, their note was then, if any forein petty Prince had so put himself upon them, they could not with honour deliver him, much less their own native King; yet they made a sacrifice of him at last for 800000.

that nothing almost could tend more to the advantage of that K. then these commotions in England, considering that he was embark'd in an actuall war with the House of <hi>Austria</hi> and that this Iland did do <hi>Spain</hi> some good offices; among other, by transport of his treasure to Dunkerk in English bottomes, whereunto this King gave way, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in his own Galeons, which sav'd the Spaniard neer upon 20. in the hundred, then if he had sent it by way of Genoa; so that som think, though France made semblance to resent the sad condition of her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and thereupon sent the Prince of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,</hi> and the foresaid Monsieur <hi>Bellieure</hi> to compose matters, yet she never really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, as being against her present inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and engagements: yet the world thinks it much that she shold publiquely receive an Agent from these Parlamenteeres, and that the French Nobility who were us'd to be the gallantest men in the world to vindicate the quarrels of distressed Ladies, are not more sensible of the outrages that have bin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd a <hi>daughter of France,</hi> specially of <hi>Henry the greats.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to resume the threed of my Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the King (and with him, one may say,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:98493:151"/>
England also) being thus bought and sold, the Parlamenteers insteed of bringing him to Westminster, which had put a Period to all distempers, toss'd him up and downe to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houses, and kept the former Army still afoot: And truly I think there was never Prince so abus'd, or poor peeple so baffled, and no peeple but a purblind besotted pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wold have suffred themselves to be so baffled: for notwithstanding that no Enemy appeer'd in any corner of the Kingdome, yet above 20000. Tagaroones have bin kept together ever since to grind the faces of the poor, and exhaust the very vitall spirits of town and Countrey, and keep them all in a perfect slavery: Had the Parlament-men, when the Scots were gone, brought their King in a generous and frank way (as had well becom'd Englishmen) to sit among them, and trusted to him (which of necessity they must do at last) as they had gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d more honor far in the world abroad, so they had gain'd more upon his affections then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve they will ever do hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, the King having bin a good while prisoner to the Parlement, the Army snatch'd him away from them, and som of the chiefest Commanders having
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98493:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pawn'd their soules unto him to restore him speedily, in lieu thereof they tumbled him up and down to sundry places, till they jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled him at last to that small Ile where now he is surrounded with a gard of strange faces; and if happly he beginns to take delight in any of those faces, he is quickly taken out of his sight. These harsh usages hath made him become all gray and oregrown with hair so that he lookes rather like som Silvan Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr then a Soverain Prince: And truly my Lord the meanest slave in St. <hi>Marks</hi> gallies or the abjects Captif in <hi>Algier</hi> bannier is not so miserable as he in divers kinds, for <hi>they</hi> have the comfort of their wifes, children and frends, they can convey and receive Letters, send Messengers upon their errands, and have privat discours with any; all which is denied to the King of great Britain, nay the young Princes his children are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as much as to ask him blessing in a letter. In so much that if he were not a great King of his passions, and had a heart cast in on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Mould, these pressures and those base aspersions that have bin publiquely cast upon him by the Parlement it self, had bin enough to have sent him out of the world e're this, and indeed 'tis the main thing they
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98493:152"/>
drive at, to torture his braine, and tear his very heart strings if they could: so that whereas this foolish ignorant peeple speak such horrid things of our <hi>Inquisition,</hi> truly my Lord 'tis a most gentle way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding being compar'd to this Kings perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.</p>
                  <p>As the King himselfe is thus in quality of a captif, so are all his Subjects becom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect slaves, they have fool'd themselfs into a worse slavery then <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> under the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> for they know the bottom of their servitude by paying so many Sultanesses for every head; but here, people are put to endless, unknown, tyrannical Taxes, besides <hi>plundering</hi> and <hi>Accize,</hi> which two words, and the practise of them (with <hi>storming</hi> of Towns) they have learnt of their pure Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Holland:</hi> and for <hi>plundrings,</hi> these Parliamenteer-Saints think they may robb any that adheres not to them as lawfully as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> 'Tis an unsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable masse of money these Reformers have squandred in few years, whereof they have often promis'd and solemnly voted a publick account to satisfie the Kingdom: but as in a hundred things more, so in this precious particular they have dispens'd with
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:98493:152"/>
their Votes: they have consumed more treasure with pretence to <hi>purge</hi> one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, then might have served to have <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd</hi> two; more (as I am credibly told) then all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> spent of the public stock since the <hi>Saxon</hi> Conquest: Thus have they not only begger'd the whole Island, but they have hurld it into the most fearfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>st Chaos of confusion that ever poor Countrey was in; they have torn in pieces the reines of all Government, trampled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Lawes of heaven and earth, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the very Dictamens of nature, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Mothers to betray their Sons, and the Sons their Fathers, but specially that Great <hi>Charter,</hi> which is the <hi>Pandect</hi> of all the Laws and Liberties of the free-born Subject, which at their admission to the House they are solemnly sworn to maintain, is torn in flitters: besides those severall Oaths they forg'd themselfs, as the <hi>Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> where they voluntarily swear to maintain the Kings Honour and Rights, together with the established Laws of the Land, &amp;c. Now I am told, that all Acts of Parlement here are Lawes, and they carry that Majesty with them, that no power can suspend or repeal them, but the same
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:98493:153"/>
power that made them, which is the King sitting in full Parlement; these mongrell Polititians have bin so notoriously impudent as to make an inferiour <hi>Ordinance</hi> of theirs to do it, which is point-blanck against the very fundamentals of this Government, and their own Oaths, which makes me think that there was never such a perjur'd pack of wretches upon earth, never such Monsters of mankind.</p>
                  <p>Yet this simple infatuated peeple have a Saint-like opinion of these Monsters, this foolish Citie gards them daily with Horse and Foot, whereby she may be sayd to kisse the very stones that are thrown at her, and the hand whence they came, which a dogg would not do: But she falls to recollect her self now that shee begins to be pinch'd in Trade, and that her Mint is starv'd, yet the leading'st men in her Common-Councell care not much for it, in regard most of them have left traffiquing abroad, finding it a more easie and gainefull way of trading at home, by purchasing <hi>Crown</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> lands, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd goods, and debts upon the <hi>Publick Faith,</hi> with <hi>Soldiers debenters;</hi> thus the Saints of this Iland <hi>turne godlinesse into gaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly my Lord, I give the English for a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:98493:153"/>
lost Nation, if they continue long <hi>thus,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ther a more palpable oblaesion of the brain, and a more visible decay of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> in any race of men: It is a sore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from heaven, that a people shold not be more sensible how they are become slaves to <hi>Rebells,</hi> and <hi>those,</hi> most of them the scumm of the Nation, which is the <hi>basest</hi> of miseries: how they suffer them to tyrannize by a meer arbitrary extrajudicial power o're their very souls and bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> o're their very lifs and livelihoods; how their former free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is turn'd to fetters, Molehills into Mountains of grievances, <hi>Ship-money</hi> into <hi>Accize,</hi> Justice into Tyranny: For nothing hath bin and is daily so common amongst them as imprisonment without charge, and a charge without an accuser, condemnation without apparance, and forfeitures without conviction.</p>
                  <p>To speak a little more of the King, if all the infernal fiends had ligu'd against him, they could not have design'd or disgorged more malice: They wold have laid to his charge his Fathers death, as arrand a lie as ever was forg'd in hell: they wold make him fore-know the insurrection in <hi>Ireland,</hi> wheras the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador here, and his

Confessor who is a very reverend Irish-man, told me, that he knew no more of it then the grand <hi>Mogor</hi> did: they charge him with all the bloud of this civil war, wheras they and their instruments were the first kindlers of it, and that first prohibited trade and shut him out of his own Town: They have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and printed his privat Letters to his Queen, and Hers to him, (Oh barbarous basenesse!) but therin they did him a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, though the intent was malitious, their aim in all things being to envenom the hearts of his people towards him; and this was to render him a glorious and <hi>well-belov'd Prince,</hi> as likewise for making him rich, (all which they had vow'd to do upon passing the Act of <hi>Continuance,</hi>) But now they have made him poorer then the meanest of all his vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, they have made him to have no <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi> in house, goods, or Lands, or as one may say, in his wife and children: 'Twas u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual for the father to hunt in his Park while the son hunted for his life in the field, for the wife <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Touching those few Peers that sit now voting in the upper House, they may be said to be but meer Cyphers, they are grown so degenerat as to suffer the <hi>Commons</hi> to give them the Law, to ride upon their backs, and do most things without them: Ther be many thousand Petitions that have bin recommended by these Lords to the lower House, which are scornfully thrown into corners and never read; their Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have us'd to dance attendance divers hours and days before they were vouchsafed to be let in or heard, to the eternal dishonour of those Peers, and yet poor spirited things they resent it not: The <hi>Commons</hi> now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all, and though, as I am inform'd, they are summon'd thither by the Kings Original Writ but to <hi>consent</hi> to what the King and his

Touching the second of the three aforesaid (I mean <hi>Bishops</hi>) they are grown so odious (principally for their large demeanes) among

this peeple, as the <hi>Templers</hi> were of old, and one may say it is a just judgment fallen upon them, for they were most busy in demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Convents</hi> and <hi>Monasteries,</hi> as these are in destroying <hi>Cathedralls</hi> and <hi>Ministers;</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, it hath bin observ'd that this peeple hath bin a long time rotten-hearted towards the splendor of the Court, the glory of their King, and the old establish'd Government of the land: 'Tis true there were a few small leakes sprung in the great vessel of the St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Yet, for all their disobedience and grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings against their Liege Lord the <hi>King,</hi> this peeple are exactly obedient to their new <hi>Masters</hi> of the House of Commons, though they sit there but as their <hi>Servants</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title themselfs so; and also though in lieu of the small scratches which England might happily have receiv'd before (all which the King had cur'd) these new masters have made such deep gashes in her, and given her such deadly wounds that I believe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I find by my researches, that there are two great Idolls in this Kingdom, the greatest that ever were, they are the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> and the <hi>Pulpit;</hi> tis held High treson to speak against the one, and the whole body of <hi>Religion</hi> is nailed unto the other, for there
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98493:157"/>
is no devotion here at all but <hi>preaching,</hi> which God wot is little better then prating. The abuse of these two hath bin the source of all the distempers which now raign: touching the latter, it hath serv'd as a subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient Engin to prop up the power and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity of the first; these malicious Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men breath out nothing thence but either sedition, schisme or blasphemy: poor shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low brain'd Sciolists, they wold question many things in the old Testament, and find Apocrypha in the New: And such is the violence wherewith the minds of men and women are transported towards these Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and no other part of devotion besides, that in all probability they will in time take a surfet of them: so that give this giddy pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple line enough ther will be no need of <hi>Catholique</hi> Arms to reduce them to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Church, they will in time pave the way to it themselves, and be glad to return to <hi>Rome</hi> to find out a Religion again.</p>
                  <p>There was here before, as I am informed, a kind of a face of a Church, there were some solemnities, venerations and decencies us'd that a man might discover som piety in this peeple; there was a publick Lyturgie that in pithy Pathetical prayers reach'd all
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:98493:158"/>
occasions; the Sacraments were administred with som reverence, their Churches were kept neat and comly; but this nasty race of miscreants have nothing at all of sweetnesse, of piety and devotion in them; 'tis all turn'd to a fatuous kind of zeal after more <hi>learning,</hi> as if Christianity had no sobriety, consistence or end of knowledg at all: These silly things, to imitat the Apostles time, wold have the same form of discipline to govern whole Nations, as it did a chamberfull of men in the infancy of the Church, they wold make the same coat serve our Savious at 30. yeers, which fitted him at three: 'Tis incredible how many ugly sorts of heresies they daily hatch, but they are most of them old ones newly furbish'd; they all relate to <hi>Aerius,</hi> a perfect hater of Bishops, because he could not be one himself. The two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries which sway most, are the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> is a spawn of a <hi>Puritan,</hi> and the <hi>Independent</hi> a spawn of the <hi>Presbyterian:</hi> there's but one hop 'twixt the first and a <hi>Iew,</hi> and but half a hop 'twixt the other and an <hi>Infidell;</hi> they are both opposit to Monarchy and Hierarchy; and the latter wold have no Government at all, but a parity and promiscuous confusion, a race of creatures fit only to inhabit Hell:
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98493:158"/>
and one of the fruits of this blessed Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of these two Sectaries is, that they have made more Jewes and Athiests then I think there is in all Europe besides; but truly, my Lord, I think the judgments of Heaven were never so visible in any part of the Earth, as they are now here, for there is Rebell against Rebell, House a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst House, Cittie against Army, Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against Scot, but these two Sectaries, I mean the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> who were the fire-brands that put this poor I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land first in a flame, are now in most deadly feud one against the other, though they both concur in this to destroy government: And if the King had time enough to look only upon them, they would quickly hang, draw, and destroy one another.</p>
                  <p>But indeed all Christian Princes shold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the motions and successes of these two unlucky Incendiaries, for if they shold ligue together again, (as they have often plaid fast and loose one with another) and prevail here, this Iland wold not terminat their designs, they wold puzzle all the world besides. Their Preachmen ordinarily cry out in the Pulpit, ther is a great work to be done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, for the reforming all mankind, and They are appointed by Heaven to be the

chief Instruments of bringing it about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They have already bin so busie abroad, that (with vast sommes of money) they brought the <hi>Swed</hi> upon the <hi>Dane,</hi> and the very Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon the English Cavaliers in <hi>Virginia;</hi> and could they confederat with <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Tartar,</hi> or Hell it self against them, they wold do it: they are monstrously puff'd up with pride, that they stick not to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs <hi>Conquerors,</hi> and one of the chief ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders of them, an ignorant home bred kind of <hi>Brewer,</hi> was not ashamed to vant it publiquely in the Commons House, that if he had but 20000. men, he wold undertake to march to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and pull the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Emperour out of the <hi>Seralio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the other grand Idoll the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement,</hi> 'tis true that the primitive constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parlement in this Iland was a wholesom piece of policy, because it kept a good correspondence, and clos'd all ruptures 'twixt the King and his peeple, but this thing they call Parlement now, may rather be term'd a cantle of one, or indeed a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle</hi> of Schismatiques, rather than a great Counsell; 'tis like a kind of headless Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or som estropiated carkas; for ther is neither King nor Prelat, nor scarce the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth

part of Peers and Commons, no not the twelfth part fairly elected; nevertheless they draw the peeple, specially this City, like so many stupid animalls, to adore them.</p>
                  <p>Yet though this institution of Parlement be a wholsom thing in it self, there is in my judgment a great incongruity in one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and I believe it hath bin the cause of most distempers; it is, That the <hi>Burgesses</hi> are more in number than the <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Shires;</hi> for the <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Shires</hi> are commonly Gentlemen well born, and bred, and vers'd in the Laws of the Land, as well as forren Governments, (divers of them) but the <hi>Burgesses</hi> of Towns are commonly Tradesmen, and being bred in Corporations they are most of them inclining to Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, and consequently to popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; These <hi>Burgesses</hi> exceeding the <hi>Knights</hi> in number, carry all before them by plurality of Voices, and so puzzle all: And now that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have mentioned <hi>Corporations,</hi> I must tell your Lordship, that the greatest soloecism in the policy of this Kingdom, is the number of them; especially this monstrous City, which is compos'd of nothing els but of <hi>Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and the greatest errors that this King,

                  <p>To draw to a conclusion, This Nation is in a most sad and desperat condition, that they deserve to be pittied, and preserved from sinking, and having cast the present state of things and all interests into an equal balance, I find, my Lord, ther be three ways to do it, one good, and two bad.</p>
                  <p>1. The first of the bad ones is the <hi>Sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>2. The second bad one is the <hi>Treaty,</hi> which they now offer the King in that small Island wher he hath bin kept Captif so long, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:98493:160"/>3. The good way is, in a free confiding brave way (Englishmen-like) to send for their King to <hi>London,</hi> where City and Country shold Petition him to summon a new and free full Parlement, which he may do as justly as ever he did thing in his life, these men having infring'd as well all the essentiall Priviledges of Parlement, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry puntillio of it, for they have often risen up in a confusion without adjournment, they had two Speakers at once, they have most perjuriously and beyond all imagination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the trust both King and Country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in them, subverted the very sunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of all Law, and plung'd the whole Kingdom in this bottomless gulf of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: another Parlement may haply do som good to this languishing Island, and cure her convulsions, but for these men that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogat to themselfs the name of Parlement (by a local puntillio only because they never stir'd from the place where they have bin kept together by meer force) I find them by their actions to be so pervers, so irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and refractory, so far given over to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat sense, so fraught with rancor, with an irreconcileable malice and thirst of bloud, that <hi>England</hi> may well despaire to be heal'd
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98493:161"/>

                  <p>Touching the King he comports himself with an admired temper'd equanimity, he invades and o're-masters them more and more in all his answers by strength of reson, though he have no soul breathing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult withall, but his own Genius: he gains wonderfully upon the hearts and opinion of his peeple, and as the Sun useth to appear bigger in winter, and at his declension in regard of the interposition of certain mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors 'twixt the eye of the beholder and the object, so this King being thus o're-cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and declined, shines far more glorious in the eyes of his people; and certainly these high morall vertues of constancy, courage and wisdom come from above; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for Kings as they are elevated above all other peeple and stand upon higher ground, they sooner receive the inspirations of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;

                  <p>But to give an account of the strange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse my soul made that night; the first Country she lighted on was a very low flat Country, and it was such an odde amphibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Country, being so indented up and down with Rivers and arms of the sea, that I made a question whether I shold call it Water or Land; yet though the <hi>Sea</hi> be invited and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher'd in into som places, he is churlistly pen'd out in som other, so that though he foam and swell, and appear as high Walls hard-by, yet they keep him out, maugre all his roaring and swelling.</p>
                  <p>As I wandred up and down in this Watry Region, I might behold from a streight long Dike wheron I stood, a strange kind of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, for the trees mov'd up and down; they look'd afar off as if they had bin blasted by thunder; for they had no leafs at all; but making a nearer approach unto them, I found they were a nomberlesse company of Ship-Masts, and before them appear'd a great Town (<hi>Amsterdam</hi>) incorporated up and down with Water; As I mus'd with my self upon the sight of all this, I concluded, that the Inhabitants of that Country were notable industrious people, who could give Law so

                  <p>From this <hi>Maiden</hi> City, mee thought, I was in a trice carried over a long gulf, and so through a Midland Sea, into another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>(Spain)</hi> where I felt the Clime hotter by some Degrees; a rough-hew'n soile, for the most part, it was full of craggy barren hills; but where there were valleys and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough, the country was extraordinarily fruitful, whereby nature (it seems) made her a compensation for the sterility of the rest.

Ther hath bin also a long deadly feud 'twixt the next tramontan Kingdom <hi>(France)</hi> and him, though the <hi>Q.</hi> that rules there be his own sister, an unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall odious thing: But it seems God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath a quarrel of late yeers with all earthly Potentats; for in so short a time

ther never happen'd such strange shocks and revolutions: The great Emperour of <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia</hi> hath bin outed, he and all his children by a petty companion: The King of <hi>China,</hi> a greater Emperour than he, hath lost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all that huge Monarchy by the incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Tartar,</hi> who broke ore the wall upon him: The grand <hi>Turk</hi> hath bin stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, with 30. of his Concubines; The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Muscovy</hi> hath bin content to beg his life of his own vassals, and to see before his face divers of his chief Officers hack'd to pieces, and their heads cut off and steep'd in strong water, to make them burn more bright in the market place.

of Beads from under his cloak, he began to ask me of my Religion; I told him I had a long journy to go, so that I could not stay to wait on him longer; so we parted, and me thought I was very glad to be rid of him so well.</p>
                  <p>My soul then made another flight over an Assembly of hideous high hills, <hi>(Pyreneys)</hi> and lighted under another Clime, on a rich and copious Country <hi>(France)</hi> resembling the form of a Lozenge, but me thought, I never saw so many poor peeple in my life; I encountred a Pesan, and asked him what the reason was, that ther shold be so much <hi>poverly</hi> in a Country wher ther was so much <hi>plenty:</hi> Sir, they keep the Commonalty poor in pure policy here, for being a peeple, as the world observes us to be, that are more humerous than others, and that love variety and change, if we were suffered to be pamper'd with wealth, we wold ever and anon rise up in tumults, and so this Kingdom shold ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quiet, but subject to intestine broils, and so to the hazard of any invasion: But ther was of late a devillish <hi>Cardinal,</hi> whose <hi>humour</hi> being as sanguin as his <hi>habit,</hi> and working upon the weaknes of his Master, hath made us not only poor, but stark beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,

and we are like to continue so by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal war, wherein he hath plung'd this poor Kingdom, which war must be maintained with our very vital spirits: but as dejected and indigent as we are, yet upon the death of that ambitious Cardinal, we had risen up against <hi>This,</hi> who hath the Vogue now, (with whom he hath left his principles) had not the fearful example of our next transmarin Western neighbours (the <hi>English</hi>) and the knowledg we have of a worse kind of slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of those endles arbitrary taxes, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid confusions they have fool'd themselfs lately into, utterly deterr'd us, though <hi>we</hi> have twenty times more reason to rise then ever <hi>they</hi> had: yet our great City (<hi>Paris</hi>) hath shew'd her teeth, and gnash'd them ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favouredly of late, but we find she hath drawn water only for her own Mill, we fare little the better, yet we hope it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to peace, which hath bin so long in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation.</p>
                  <p>I cannot remember how I parted with that Peasan, but in an instant I was landed upon a large Island, and methought, 'twas the temperat'st Region I had bin in all the while (<hi>England;</hi>) the <hi>heat</hi> of the Sun ther is as harmless as his <hi>light,</hi> the evening <hi>serene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

which was complained of as a stalking horse to draw on our miseries at first, is now only in practice, which is meer <hi>arbitrary</hi> rule; for now both <hi>Law, Religion</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> are here arbitrary: Touching the last, 'tis quite lost, 'tis permitted that any may prate, preach or print what they will in derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their annointed King: which word <hi>King</hi> was once a Monosyllable of som weight in this Ile, but 'tis as little regarded now as the word <hi>Pope</hi> (among som) which was also a mighty Monosyllable once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: the rule of the Law is, that the King can <hi>do</hi> no wrong, ther is a contrary rule now crept in, that the King can <hi>receive</hi> no wrong; and truly Sir, 'tis a great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both upon <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>peeple;</hi> upon the <hi>one,</hi> that the love of so many of his vassals shold be so alienated from him; upon the <hi>other,</hi> that their hearts shold be so poyson'd, and certainly 'tis the effect of an ill spirit; both the one and the other in all probability tend to the ruine of this Kingdom.</p>

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:98493:173"/>
so I will descend now to a particular cause of them; it was a Northern Nation (<hi>Scot</hi>) that brought these cataracts of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs upon us; and you know the old say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
                  <lg>

                  <p>Far be it from me to charge the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herewith; no, but onely som pernicious Instruments that had insinuated themselfs, and incorporated among us, and sway'd both in our Court and Counsels: They had a hand in every Monopoly; they had out of our Exchequer, and Customs near upon 400000. Crowns in yearly Pensions, <hi>viis &amp; modis;</hi> yet they could not be content, but they must puzzle the peace and policy of this Church and State: and though they are a peeple of a differing <hi>Genius,</hi> differing Laws, Customs, and Manners unto us, yet for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conscience they wold bring our necks into their yoak, as if they had a greater ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of reason, and clearer illuminations, as if they understood Scripture better, and were better acquainted with God Almighty then <hi>we,</hi> who brought them first from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme to <hi>Christianity,</hi> and also to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>Christians:</hi> but it seems, matters

have little thriven with them; nay the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hand of heaven hath bin heavily upon them divers waies since they did lift <hi>their</hi> hands against their <hi>native King;</hi> For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the vast summs they had hence, yet is the generality of them as beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly as ever they were; besides, the Civil Sword hath rag'd ther as furiously as here, and did as much execution among them. Moreover the <hi>Pestilence</hi> hath bin more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and sweeping in their chief Town (<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi>) then ever it was since they were a peeple. And now lately ther's the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest dishonour befaln them that possibly could light upon a Nation, in that 7000. of ours shold upon even ground encounter, kill, slay, rout and utterly discomfit thrice as many of theirs, though as well appointed and arm'd as men could be: And truly Sir, the advantages that accrue to this Nation are not a few by that exploit; For of late years that Nation was cryed up abroad to be a more Martial peeple then we, and to have baffled us in open field in divers traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: besides, I hope a small matter will pay now their Arrerages here, and elsewhere; but principally, I hope they will not be so busie hereafter in our Court and Counsel, as they have bin formerly.</p>

                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:98493:174"/>Another cause of our calamity is a strange race of peeple (the <hi>Puritans</hi>) sprung up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our selfs, who were confederat with those of the North; they wold make Gods House cleane, and by putting out the candle of all ancient learning and knowledge, they would sweep it only by the light of an <hi>Ignis fatuus:</hi> but 'tis visibly found that they have brought much more rubbage into it, and wheras in reforming this house, they shold rather find out the <hi>groat</hi> that is lost, they go about to take away the <hi>mite</hi> that's left, and so put <hi>Christs</hi> Spouse to live on meer almes: True it is, there is a kind of <hi>zeal</hi> that burns in them, (and I could wish there were so much <hi>piety</hi>) but this <hi>zeal</hi> burns with too much violence and presumption, which is no good symptom of <hi>spirituall</hi> health, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rule, that as the naturall heat, so the spirituall shold be moderat, els it commonly turns to a frenzy, and that is the thing which causeth such a giddinesse and distraction in their braines; This (proceeding from the suggestions of an ill spirit) puffs them up with so much spirituall pride; for the Devill is so cunning a Wrastler, that he oftentimes lifts men up to give them the greater fall: they think they have an inerring spirit, and

that their <hi>Diall</hi> must needs go tru, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Sun goes: they wold make the <hi>Gospell,</hi> as the <hi>Caddies</hi> make the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> to decide all civill temporall matters under the large notion of <hi>slander,</hi> whereof <hi>they</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth to be the Judges, and so in time to hook in all things to their <hi>Classis:</hi> I believe if these men were dissected when they are dead, they would be a great deale of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver found in their braines.</p>

                  <p>With this, the grave Venerable Bishop giving me his benediction, fetcht such a sigh, that would have rended a rock asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and suddenly vanish'd (methought) out

                  <p>Insomuch that some Dreams oftentimes
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:98493:177"/>
prove tru; as S. <hi>Austin</hi> makes mention of a rich Merchant in <hi>Milan,</hi> who being dead, one of his Creditors comes to his son to demand such a sum of money which he had lent his father; the son was confident 'twas paid, but not finding the Creditors Receipt, he was impleaded and like to be cast in the Sute, had not his fathers Ghost appeared to him, and directed him to the place where the Acquittance was, which he found the next day accordingly. <hi>Galen</hi> speaks of one that dreamt he had a wooden leg, and the next day he was taken with a dead Palsie in one whole side. Such a Dream was that of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> when he thought he had felt a cold gust passing through his bowels; and the next day he was slain in the guts, by the glance of an arrow, in new Forrest, a place where he and his Father had committed so many Sacrileges. I have read in <hi>Artime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> of a woman that dreamt she had seen the pictures of three faces in the Moone like her self, and she was brought to bed of three daughters a little after, who all died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compas of a moneth. Another dreamt, that <hi>Xanthus</hi> water ran red, and the next day he fell a spitting of blood.</p>
                  <p>To this I will add another fore-telling
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:98493:178"/>
Dream, whereof I have read, which was thus: two young Gentlemen being travelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in strange Countreyes, and being come to a great towne, the one lay far in the Citie, the other in an Hostry without the wall in the Suburbs: he in the City did dream in the dead of night, that his friend which he had left in the Suburbs rush'd into his chamber panting and blowing, being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by others; he dreamt so againe, and the third time he might see his friends Ghost appearing at his beds side with bloud trickling down his throat, and a Poyniard in his brest, telling him, Dear friend, I am come now to take my last farewell of thee, and if thou rise betimes, thou shalt meet me in the way going to be buryed; the next morning his friend going with his Host to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Inn in the Suburbs wher he left his friend, they met with a Cart laden with dung in the way, which being staid and search'd, the dead body was found naked in the dung.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude with a notable Dream that <hi>Osman</hi> the Great Turk had not many years since, a few days before he was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by his Janizaries, 1623. He dreamt, that being mounted upon a huge Camel, he
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98493:178"/>
could not make him go, though he switch'd and spur'd him never so much; at last the Camel overthrew him, and being upon the ground, only the bridle was left in his hand, but the body of the Camel was vanished: the <hi>Mufti</hi> not being illuminated enough to interpret this Dream, a <hi>Santon</hi> who was a kind of Idiot, told him, the Camel represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> which he not being able to govern, he shold be o'rethrown, which two dayes after proved tru.</p>
                  <p>By these, and a cloud of examples more, we may conclude, that Dreams are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impertinent, but somthing may be gathered out of them; though the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and meaning of them be denyed to man, unless by special illumination.</p>

                     <p>There are Records above a thousand years old of these <hi>Parlements</hi> in the Reigns of King <hi>Ina, Offa, Ethelbert,</hi> and the rest of the seven Kings during the <hi>Heptarchy:</hi> The <hi>British</hi> Kings also, who retain'd a great while some part of the Isle unconquered, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made Laws by a kind of Parlemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary way; witnesse the famous Laws of Prince <hi>Howell,</hi> called <hi>Howell Dha,</hi> (the good Prince <hi>Howell</hi>) whereof there are yet extant some British Records: <hi>Parlements</hi> were also used after the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> by King <hi>Kenulphus, Alphred,</hi> and others; witnesse that renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Parliament held at <hi>Grately</hi> by King <hi>Athelstan.</hi>

and they govern'd also by such generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, (as they do to this day) witnesse that great and so much celebrated Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment held by that mighty Monarch <hi>Canutus,</hi> who was King of <hi>England, Denmark, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and other Regions 150 years before the compiling of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> and this the learned in the Laws do hold to be one of the specialst, and most authentick peeces of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity we have extant. <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor made all his Laws thus, (and he was a great <hi>Legis-lator,</hi>) which the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour (who liking none of his sons, made <hi>God Almighty</hi> his <hi>heir</hi> by bequeathing unto him this Island for a <hi>legacy</hi>) did ratifie and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish, and digested them into one entire methodicall Systeme, which being violated by <hi>Rufus,</hi> (who came to such a disastrous end as to be shot to death in lieu of a <hi>Buck</hi> for his sacriledges) were restor'd by <hi>Henry</hi> the first, and so they continued in force till King <hi>Iohn;</hi> whose Reign is renowned for first confirming <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Liberties ever since: which may be compar'd to divers <hi>outlandish graffes set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one English stock; or to a posie of sundry fragrant flowers;</hi> for the choicest of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,</hi> the <hi>Roman, Saxon, Danish,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi>

                     <p>Nor are the Lawes of <hi>this Island</hi> only, and the freedome of the Subject conserved by <hi>Parlement,</hi> but all the best policed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Europe</hi> have the like.

of the Kingdom; That power which formerly was inhaerent in the <hi>Parlementary Assembly,</hi> of making Laws, of assessing the Subject with Taxes, subsidiary levies, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impositions, was transmitted to the <hi>King</hi> during the war; which continueth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, that entrusted power by length of time grew as it were habitual in him, and could never after be re-assumed and taken from him; so that ever since, his <hi>Edicts</hi> countervaile <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parlement.</hi> And that which made the businesse more feasable for the <hi>King,</hi> was, that the burthen fell most upon the <hi>Communalty</hi> (the Clergy and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility not feeling the weight of it) who were willing to see the <hi>Peasan</hi> pull'd down a little, because not many years before, in that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Rebellion, call'd <hi>la jaquerie de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voisin,</hi> which was suppressed by <hi>Charles the wise,</hi> the Common people put themselves boldly in Arms against the Nobility and Gentry, to lessen their power.

how infinitly necessary the <hi>Parlement</hi> is to assert, to prop up and preserve the publick liberty, and national rights of a peeple, with the incolumity and well-fare of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth the <hi>Subject</hi> only reap benefit thus by <hi>Parlement,</hi> but the <hi>Prince,</hi> (if it be well consider'd) hath equal advantage ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; It rendreth him a King of <hi>free</hi> and <hi>able</hi> men, which is far more glorious than to be a King of <hi>Cowards, Beggars,</hi> and <hi>Bankrupts;</hi> Men that by their freedom, and competency of wealth, are kept still in heart to do him service against any forrain force. And it is a tru maxime in all States, that 'tis lesse dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and dishonour for the Prince to be poor, than his people: Rich Subjects can make their King rich when they please, if he gain their hearts, he will quickly get their purses. <hi>Parlement</hi> encreaseth love and good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence 'twixt him and his peeple, it acquaints him with the reality of things, and with the tru state and diseases of his Kingdom, it brings him to the knowledg of his better sort of Subjects, and of their abilities, which he may employ accordingly upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; It provides for his Royal Issue, pays his debts, finds means to fill his Coffers:
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:98493:187"/>
and it is no ill observation, That Parlement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneys (the great Aid) have prospered best with the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> It exceedingly raiseth his repute abroad, and enableth him to keep his <hi>foes in fear, his Subjects in awe, his Neighbours and Confederates in security,</hi> the three main things which go to aggrandize a Prince, and render him glorious. In summe, it is the <hi>Parlement</hi> that supports, and bears up the honour of his Crown, and settles his Throne in safety, which is the chief end of all their consultations: For whosoever is entrusted to be a Member of this High Court, carryeth with him a double capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; he sits ther as a <hi>Patriot,</hi> and as a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:</hi> as he is the one, the <hi>Country</hi> is his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, his duty being to vindicat the publick liberty, to make wholsom Lawes, to put his hand to the pump, and stop the leaks of the great vessel of the State, to pry into, and punish corruption and oppression, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and advance trade, to have the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the <hi>place</hi> he serves for redressed, and cast about how to find somthing that may tend to the advantage of it.</p>

King of Spains Ministers (because His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty would have as little to do as might be with <hi>Rome</hi>) Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth, who died a little after, sent His Majesty a Letter, which was delivered by the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> whereof an answer was sent a while after: Which Letters were imprinted and exposed to the view of the world, because His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty would not have people whisper, that the businesse was carried in a clandestine manner.

                     </p>
                     <p>But as the Author of the <hi>Vocall Forrest</hi> thinks he hath done, neither his <hi>Countrey,</hi> nor the <hi>Common wealth</hi> of <hi>Learning</hi> any prejudice therby (That <hi>maiden fancy</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received so good entertainment and respect abroad, as to be translated into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Languages, and to gain the publick approbation of som famous Universities) So he makes this humble protest unto all the World, that though the designe of that Discourse was partly <hi>Satyricall</hi> (which peradventure induc'd the Author to shrowd it of purpose under the shadowes of <hi>trees,</hi> and where should Satyres be but amongst Trees?) yet it never entred into his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to let fall from him the least thing that might give any offence to the High and Honourable Court of <hi>Parlement,</hi> whereof he had the honour to be once a <hi>Member,</hi> and hopes he may be thought worthy again:
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:98493:195"/>
And were he guilty of such an offence, or <hi>piacle</hi> rather, he thinks he shold never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give himself, though he were appointed his own Judge. If ther occur any passages ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that may admit a hard construction, let the Reader observe, That the Author doth not positively assert, or passe a <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> on any thing in that Discourse, which consists principally of concise, cursory nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the choisest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Occurrences and Criticismes of State, according as the pulse of time did beat then: And matters of State, as all other sublunary things, are subject to alterations, contingencies and change, which makes the opinions and minds of men vary accordingly.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, His Majesty passed this grant, but with this weighty consideration as it had reference to two ends.</p>
                  <p>First, to smoothen and facilitate things thereby to open a passage, and pave the way to a happy peace, which this poor Iland did so thirst after, having bin so long glutted with civil blood.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it might conduce to the further security, and the indemnifying of the two Houses of Parlement, with all their instruments, assistants, and adherents, and so rid them of all jealousies, and fear of future dangers which still lodg'd within them. Now touching the expressions and words of this <hi>Grant,</hi> they were not his own, nor did he give order for the dictating or penning thereof; the King was not the <hi>Author</hi> of them, but an <hi>Assentor</hi> only unto them: nor was He or <hi>his</hi> Party accus'd, or as much as mentioned in any of them, to draw the least guilt upon themselves. Besides, He pass'd them as he doth all Lawes and Acts of Parlement, which in case of absence another may do for him in his <hi>politic</hi> capacity, therfore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prejudice his <hi>person</hi> any way. I am loth
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:98493:198"/>
to say that he condescended to this Grant,</p>
                  <q>—Cum strict a novacula supra,</q>
                  <p>When the razor was as it were at his throat, when ther was an Army of about thirty thousand effectif Horse and Foot that were in motion against him, when his Person had continued under a black long lingring restraint, and dangerous menacing Petitions and Papers daily ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ruded against him. Moreover, His Majesty pass'd this <hi>Concession</hi> with these two provisos and reservations,</p>
                  <p>First, that it should be of no vertu or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity at all, till the whole Treaty were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely consummated;</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he might when he pleas'd inlarge and cleer the truth with the <hi>reserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of his meaning herein, by public De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration: Now the Treaty being confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly huddled up, without discussing, or as much as receiving any Proposition from himself as was capitulated, (and reciprocall <hi>proposalls are of the essence of all Treaties</hi>) it could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bind him, or turne any way to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage: Therfore under favour, ther was too much hast us'd by the Parlement, to draw that hipothetick or provisional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the form of an <hi>Act</hi> so suddenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:98493:198"/>
in the very heat of the Treaty, without His Majesties <hi>knowledg,</hi> or the least intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Add hereunto, that this <hi>Grant</hi> was but a meer preambular Proposition, 'twas not of the essence of the Treaty it self: And as the Philosophers and Schoolemen tell us, there is <hi>no valid proof can be drawn out of Proemes, Introductions</hi> or <hi>Corollaries</hi> in any science, but out of the positive assertions and body of the Text, which is only argument-proof; so in the Constitutions and Laws of England, as also in all accusations and charges, forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prefaces &amp; preambles (which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>weak</hi> causes want most) are not pleadable: and though they use to be first in place, like gentlemen-Ushers, yet are they last in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as also in framing, nor had they ever the force of Laws, but may be term'd their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants to make way for them.</p>
                  <p>Besides, ther's not a syllable in this preface which repeals or connives at any former Law of the Land, therefore those Laws <hi>that so strictly inhibit English Subjects to raise armes against their Liege Lord the King,</hi> and those Lawes <hi>è contrario</hi> which <hi>exempt from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, penalties or molestation, any Subject that adheres to the person of the King in any cause or</hi>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:98493:199"/>
                     <hi>buarrell whatsoever,</hi> are still in force.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, this <hi>introductory</hi> Concession of the Kings, wherein he is contented to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That the two Houses were necessitated to take Armes for their defence, may be said to have relation to the <hi>necessity, à parte pòst,</hi> not <hi>à parte antè: self-defence</hi> is the universall Law of Nature, and it extends to all other cretures, as well as to the Rationall: As the fluent Roman Orator in that sentence of his, which is accounted among the Critiques the excellentest that ever drop'd from <hi>Cicero; Est enim haec non scripta, sed nata Lex quam non didicimus, accepimus, legimus, verum ex natura ipsa arripuimus, hausimus, expressimus, ad quam non docti, sed facti, non instituti, sed imbuti sum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>s, ut si vita nostra in</hi> &amp;c. For this (meaning self-defence) is not a written, but a Law born with us; A Law which we have not learnt, receiv'd or read, but that which we have suck'd, drawn forth, and wrung out of the very brests of Nature her self; A Law to which we are not taught, but made unto, wherwith we are not instructed, but indued withall, that if our lifes be in jeopardy, &amp;c. we may repel force by force. Therfore when the House of Parliament had drawn upon them a necessity of self defence (And I could

have wish'd it had bin against any other but their own <hi>Soverain Prince</hi>) His Majesty was contented to acknowledge that necessity. As for example: A man of war meets with a Marchant man at Sea, he makes towards him, and assaults him; The Marchant man having a good stout vessell under him, and resolute, generous Seamen, bears up against him, gives him a whole broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and shoots him 'twixt wind and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; so there happens a furious fight betwixt them, which being ended, the Marchant cannot deny but that the man of war, though the first Assailant, was necessitated to fight, and that justly in his own defence, which necessity he drew upon himself, and so was excusable, <hi>à posteriori,</hi> not <hi>à priori;</hi> As the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians speak of a clandestine marriage, <hi>Fieri non debuit, sed factum valet;</hi> It ought not to have been, but being done 'tis valid: wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to relates another saying, <hi>Multa sunt quae non nisi per acta approbantur.</hi> Ther are many things which are not allowable til they are pass'd.</p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>France</hi> have had sundry ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil wars, They have had many bloudy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters and clashes with their Subjects, specially the last King <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, which turn'd all at last to his advantage; Among other Treaties in that of <hi>Loudun,</hi> he
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:98493:200"/>

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:98493:200"/>
milk: And I have observed that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of such Treaties in France, both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wold hugg and mutually embrace one another in a gallant way of national huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; all rancor, all plundrings, sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and imprisonment wold cease, nor wold any be prosecuted, much lesse made away afterwards in cold bloud.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Comencer of this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous war of ours, the world knows too well, that the first man of bloud was <hi>Blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap,</hi> who shew'd Subjects the way, how to present their King with Petitions upon the <hi>Pikes</hi> point, and what visible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have fallen upon him since, by such confusions of discord and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence at home, and irreparable dishonour abroad, let the world judge. The Irish took his rise from him: and wheras it hath bin often suggested, that His Majesty had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge therof, among a world of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing arguments which may clear him in this particular, the Lord <hi>Maguair</hi> upon the ladder, and another upon the Scaffold, when they were ready to breath their last, and to appear before the Tribunall of heaven, did absolutely acquit the King, and that <hi>spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneously</hi> of their own accord, being unsought
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:98493:201"/>
unto, but only out of a love to <hi>truth,</hi> and discharge of a good conscience: but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those cruentous <hi>Irish</hi> wars, in regard ther was nothing wherof more advantage was made against His late Majesty, to imbitter and poyson the hearts of his Subjects against him then that Rebellion, I will take leave to wind up the main causes of them upon a small bottom as was spoken elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>1. They who kept intelligence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with the <hi>Scot,</hi> in his first and second insurrection.</p>
                  <p>2. They who dismiss'd the first Irish Commissioners (who came of purpose to attend our Parlement with som grievances) with such a short unpolitic harsh answer.</p>
                  <p>3. They who took off <hi>Straffords</hi> head, (which had it stood on, that Rebellion had never been) and afterwards retarded the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> from going over to be Lord-Lievtenant.</p>
                  <p>4. Lastly, they, who hindred part of that disbanded Army of 8000 men rais'd there by the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> which His Majesty, in regard they were souldiers of fortune, and loose casheer'd men, to prevent the mischiefs that might befall that Kingdome, by their insolencies, had promised the two Spanish
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:98493:201"/>
Ambassadors, the Marquesses of <hi>Veloda</hi> and <hi>Malvezzi,</hi> then resident in this Court; which souldiers rise up first of any, and put fire to the tumult to find somthing to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They,</hi> I say, who did all this, may be justly said to have bin the tru causes of that horrid Insurrection in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and consequently 'tis easie to judge upon the account of whose souls must be laid the bloud of those hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and odd thousand poor Christians who perished in that war<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had it bin possible to have brought o're their bodies unputrified to <hi>England,</hi> and to have cast them at the lower House door, and in the presence of som Members, which are now either seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or gone to give an account in another world, I believe their noses wold have gush'd out with bloud for discovery of the tru mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</p>
                  <p>Touching this last fire-brand of war, which was thrown into <hi>England,</hi> who they were that kindled it first, the consciences of those indifferent and unbiassed men are sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to be judges, who have bin curious to observe with impartial eyes, the carriage of things from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>I confesse, 'twas a fatal unfortunat thing,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:98493:202"/>
that the King shold put such a distance 'twixt his Person and his Parlement, but a more fatal and barbarous thing it was, that he should be <hi>driven</hi> away from it, that there should be a desperate designe to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize His Person, that <hi>Ven</hi> with his <hi>Myrmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> and <hi>Bourges</hi> with his Bandogs, (for so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they calld the riffraff of the City they brought along with them) should rabble him away, with above four parts in five of the Lords, and near upon two parts in three of the Commons: Yet 'tis fit it should be remembred, what reiterated Messages His Majesty sent from time to time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, That he was alwaies ready to return, provided there might be a course taken to secure his Person, with those Peers and other who were rioted away from the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, 'Tis fit it should be remembred, that there was not the least motion of war at all, till <hi>Hotham</hi> kept His Majesty out of His own Town <hi>Kingston</hi> upon Hull, (for the Name whereof shew'd whose Town it was) where being attended by a few of His meniall Servants, he came onely to visit her, having peaceably sent the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the day before) which act of <hi>Hotham</hi>'s

'Tis also to be observed, that the same Army which was rais'd to bring him to his Parliament, was continued to a clean contrary end two years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to keep him from his Parliament. 'Tis fit it should be remembred, who <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted Trade</hi> first, and brought in <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners</hi> to help them, and whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions of War were neere upon two moneths date before the Kings.

'Tis fit to remember how a Noble Lord (The Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi>) at that time told the Parliaments Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners in His Majesties Name, at the most unhappy rupture of the said Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>That when he was at the highest he would be ready to treat with them, and fight them when he was at the lowest:</hi> 'Tis fit the present Army should remember how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten both in their Proposalls, and publick

Declarations they have inform'd the world, and deeply protested that their principall aime was to restore His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to honour, freedom and safety, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they were formerly bound, both by their own Protestation and Covenant, that the <hi>two Commanders</hi> in chief pawn'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him their soules thereupon. Let them remember, that since he was first snatch'd away to the custody of the Army by <hi>Cromwells</hi> plot, who said, <hi>that if they had the Person of the King in their power, they had the Parliament in their pockets.</hi> I say being kept by the <hi>Army,</hi> He never displeas'd them in the least particular, but in all his Overtures for Peace, and in all his Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had regard still <hi>that the Army should be satisfied:</hi> let it be remembred, that to settle a blessed Peace, to preserve his Subjects from rapine and ruine, and to give contentment to his Parliament, He did in effect freely part with His Sword, Scepter, and Crown, and ev'ry thing that was proprietary to him: Let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with what an admired temper, with what prudence and constancy, with what moderation and mansuetude he compor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himself since his deep afflictions, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:98493:204"/>
that those Commissioners and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who resorted unto him, and had had their hearts so averse unto him before, return'd his Converts, crying him up to be one of the sanctifiedst persons upon earth: and will not the bloud of such a Prince cry loud for vengeance?</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Bloud is a crying sin,</hi> but that of <hi>Kings</hi>
                     </l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>Let it be remembred, that though there be some Precedents of deposing Kings in his Kingdom, and elsewhere, when there was a competition for the right Title to the Crown by some other of the <hi>bloud Royall,</hi> yet 'tis a thing not onely unsampled, but unheard of in any age, that a King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> whose Title was without the least scruple, should be summon'd and arraign'd, tryed, condemned, and executed in His own Kingdom, by His own Subjects, and by the name of their own King, to whom they had sworn Alleagiance.</p>
                  <p>The meanest Student that hath but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the Laws of the Land can tell you, that it is an unquestionable fundamentall Maxime, <hi>The King can do no wrong,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he acts by the mediation of his Agents and Ministers, he heares with
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:98493:204"/>
other mens eares, he sees with other mens eyes, he consults with other mens braines, he executes with other mens hands, and judges with other mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; therefore his Officers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors or favorites are punishable, not <hi>He:</hi> and I know not one yet whom he hath spar'd, but sacrificed to Justice. The Crown of England is of so coruscant and pure a mettall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it cannot receive the least taint or blemish; and if there were any before in the person of the Prince, it takes them all away and makes him to be <hi>Rectus in curia.</hi> This as in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be exemplified in <hi>Henry the Seventh,</hi> and the late <hi>Queen Elizabeth:</hi> when she first came to the Crown 'twas mention'd in Parlement, that the <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> might be taken off him, under which he lay all the time he liv'd an Exile in France; it was then by the whole house of Parlement resolv'd upon the question, that it was unnecessary, because the Crown purg'd all. So likewise when <hi>Queen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> was brought as it were from the <hi>Scaffold</hi> to the <hi>Throne;</hi> though she was under a former attainder, yet 'twas thought superfluous to take it off, for the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:98493:205"/>
Crown washeth away all spots, and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth such a brightnesse, such resplendent beams of Majesty, that quite dispell all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer clouds: so that put case King <hi>Iames</hi> died a violent death, and his Son had been accessary to it, (which is as base a lie as ever the devil belch'd out) yet his accesse to the Crown had purged all. This businesse about the playster which was applyed to King <hi>Iames,</hi> was sifted and winnow'd as narrowly as possibly a thing could be in former Parlements, yet when it was exhibited as an Article against the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> 'twas term'd but a <hi>presumption</hi> or <hi>misdemeanure</hi> of a high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And 'tis strange that these new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers shold make that a <hi>parricide</hi> in the King, which was found but a presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in the Duke, who in case it had been so, must needs have been the chiefest Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <p>And as the ancient Crown and Royall Diadem of England is made of such pure allay, and cast in so dainty a mould, that it can receive no taint, or contract the least speck of enormity and foulenesse in it self, so it doth endow the person of the Prince that weares it with such high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives;
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:98493:205"/>
that it exempts him from all sorts of publique blemishes; from all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainders, Empeachments, Summons, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignments and Tryalls; nor is there or ever was any Law or Precedent in this Land, to lay any Crime or capitall charge against him, though touching civill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: touching propertie of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> he may be impleaded by the meanest vassall that hath sworn fealty to him; as the Subjects of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Kings, though never so absolute Monarchs.</p>
                  <p>In the Constitutions of England, there are two incontroulable Maximes, whereof the meanest mootman that hath but salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Littleton</hi> cannot be ignorant: the first is, <hi>Rex in suis Dominiis neque habet parem, nec superiorem.</hi> The King in his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions hath neither Peer, or Superior. The other is <hi>Satis habet Rex ad poenam quod Deum expectet ultorem:</hi> 'tis punishment enough for a King that God will take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of him: Therefore if it be the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Constitution of the Land, that all just Tryalls must be by <hi>Teers,</hi> and that the Law proclaimes the King to have no <hi>peer</hi> in his own Dominions, I leave the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:98493:206"/>
world to judg, what capacity or power those men had to arraign their late King, to be in effect his <hi>Accusers</hi> and <hi>Iudges;</hi> and that an exorbitant unsampled Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall should be erected, with power and purpose to condemn All to cleer none, and that sentence of death should passe without conviction or Law upon <hi>Him</hi> that was the heard and <hi>protector</hi> of all the Lawes. Lastly, that <hi>They</hi> who by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession represent but the Common <hi>people,</hi> should assume power to cut off <hi>Him</hi> who immediately represented <hi>God,</hi>

                  <p>When I was employed by this State in <hi>Paris</hi> not many years agoe, I had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to make my addresse to your young King, and when I observed His Physiognomy, and the Lineaments of his face, I seemed to discern in it something extraordinary above vulgar countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that he carryed a Majesty in His very looks, and noting besides the goodly procerity, and constitution of His body, he seemed to be cut out for a King.</p>
                  <p>Now, in point of extraction, and line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, it cannot be denyed but he is one of the greatest born Princes that ever was in the world; for whereas His Grand-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:98493:211"/>
and Father were allyed onely if you regard Forraigne Consanguinity, to the House of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the <hi>Guyses,</hi> this King bears in his veines not onely that bloud, but also the blouds of all the great Princes of Christendom, being nearly linked to the House of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and consequently to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> as also to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and our Grand-Duke: Moreover he is nearly allyed to all the greatest Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> as the <hi>Saxe, Brandenburg, Bavaria,</hi> the <hi>Palsgrave,</hi> and to the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> who descends in the directest line from <hi>Charlemain;</hi> Adde hereunto that the young Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> is his Nephew, and which is considerable he is a pure <hi>Englishman</hi> born, whereas your two former Kings were Forreigners.

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:98493:212"/>
of <hi>Great</hi> Britain, which Title and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is indelible, and must die with Her.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto may be adjoyn'd, that this young King is now mounted to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of his Age, and maturity of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to govern, and doubtlesse hee is like to make a rare Governour, having this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of all other Soverain Princes in the world to have been bredd up in the Schoole of Affliction so long, to have Travelled so many strange Countreys and observed the humors of so many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the Cardinall point of our Communication, after divers debates, and alterations how <hi>England</hi> might be brought to a stable condition of tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perfect peace, to her former lustre, and glory, the finall result of all, ended in this, that there was no other imaginable meanes to do it then for you to make a timely and fitting humble addresse unto your own King, and without question it is in his power to grant you such an absolute pardon, such an abolition of all things pass'd, such a gracious Amnestia, such Royall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions

that may extend to the security of every person for the future that was engaged in these your revolutions, both touching his life and fortunes; Unlesse their guilt of Conscience be such that like <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Iudas</hi> they thinke their Sinne is greater then can be forgiven them.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>mode</hi> of your application to <hi>Him</hi> may avail much, for if you chopp Logique with him too farr, and stand upon Puntillios, and too rigid termes, if you shew your selfs full of feares, jealousies, and distrusts, it will intangle, and quite marr the businesse, for in a Soveraign Prince ther must be an <hi>Implicit,</hi> unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able necessary trust repos'd by his peeple, which all the Laws that mans brain can possibly invent cannot provide against; Therefore if you proceed in a frank, and confident tru English way you may work upon his affections more powerfully, and overcome him sooner so, then by any outward Arms, This way will make such tender impressions, upon that he will grant more then you can possibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
