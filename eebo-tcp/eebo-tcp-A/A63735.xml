            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IN this confused and miserable time of warre, while truth suffereth exile with peace, and all sinewes of humane societie are dissolved, you are more wise then to judge of your old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance by the report of <hi>Mercurius.</hi> I have inquired from those that were present, what did passe betwixt Master <hi>Henderson,</hi> and the Doctor, And have learned that the Doctor did begin indeed with much civility, saluting him, presenting him with a book, and speaking more of his reputation then he could willingly heare; But without the smallest provocation, did sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly grow to such procacitie, that as he boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of his new arguments in his booke, which had not been heard of before, so spared he not to say, that our best Arguments were swords and gunnes; that Master <hi>Henderson</hi> had given proofe at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> how much might be said in an evill cause. To which nothing was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered but that it beseemed him who was a young man to speake more modestly of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Kirk, and a nationall Cause; He replyed, that he was a Presbyter, as he told before, that he was a Doctor of Divinitie, which could not be knowne by his booke, although printed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64682:4"/>
in the yeare 1642. The other who is called a Batchelour of Divinitie added, Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise thy youth; which speech had it been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Doctor, had not been non-sense.</p>
               <p>It is true, he came to Master <hi>Henderson</hi> on the 19 of <hi>Feb.</hi> in the morning, but <hi>Mercurius</hi> telleth not that this 19. of <hi>Feb.</hi> was the Lords day, a circumstance so considerable, that it made those who were present for the time, thinking it no Iudaisme to keepe the Sabbath, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring themselves after a long Iourney for the Kirk, weary of his discourse, in so much, that at last it was told the Doctor, that it was the Sabbath. But the Doctor was so pregnant and confident, that he was readie to argue, that he was about a worke of the Sabbath: it may be, because it is not unlawfull to fight on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</p>
               <p>Had the Doctor come in the termes of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius,</hi> desiring Master <hi>Henderson</hi> to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son either of his faith, or hope, or demands; or had an <hi>amica collatio</hi> been his desire, he might have obtained all that he desired, and possibly more. But coming with <hi>faenum in cornu,</hi> and no word in his mouth, but <hi>Dispute, dispute, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, concertation,</hi> such a way as was more suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64682:4"/>
for schoole-boyes, then great Divines. And wherewith Mr. <hi>Henderson,</hi> although the most part of his life conversant with Vniversity men, had never been acquainted. It was told him, that in the Synode which was expected, he and others might have disputing their fill, or if that failed, there were many learned men in <hi>England</hi> to answer his Book, or if it pleased him to send to <hi>Scotland,</hi> it would finde an answer there. But that Master <hi>Henderson</hi> was come to supplicate the Kings Majestie, not to answer Bookes, nor to dispute Propositions in the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversitie. Whether this humour in the Doctor proceedeth from the condition of the times or some individuall cause, I dispute not. This I know, that a Scripturient Engine, may finde matter enough for exercise in <hi>Gerson, Bucerus, Altare Damascenum,</hi> the learned <hi>Salmasius,</hi> and other moderne Authors, which yet lye unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, but I confesse it is a more easie worke <hi>ferram contentionis reciprocare,</hi> by writing a new booke.</p>
               <p>Had the Doctor perused the paper exhibited in the late Treatie, or the Declaration of the Nationall Assembly of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for unitie of Religion, and uniformitie of Kirk go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64682:5"/>
with the reformed Kirks, he would not have challenged us of any obtrusion or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richristian usurpation, nor would he have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared our Christian way of charitie, not of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, of supplication, not of usurpation, with the obtruding of the Service-Booke, so full of Popery upon the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but this he and his fellow did retractate.</p>
               <p>Not onely Master <hi>Henderson</hi> and many bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he, but the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all the reformed Kirks at their first reformation, were resolved upon the Question, that Antichristian doctrine, worship, and government, should all downe together. And we wish that the Kirk and Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> were resolved also. But beside the will of God that scandalls must be; and beside the judgement of God upon peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the abuse of the Gospel; the avarice and ambition of the corrupt Clergie is a maine hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of the resolution which could it be as easily satisfied, as their Arguments answered, it would be quickly resolved upon the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>It is right that Episcopacie goe downe, because it standeth not by divine right.</hi>
