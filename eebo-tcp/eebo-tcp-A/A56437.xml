            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his iniquity, &amp; all this will not profit you any thing, neither can your fore-Fathers excuse you before the Lord; for in the beginning it was so, that <hi>Evah</hi> could not justifie <hi>Adam,</hi> neither could be any excuse, but rather condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, because he hearkened to the voice of the woman &amp; disobeyed the Lord; so <hi>Adam</hi> suffered for his own sin &amp; so did <hi>Eve</hi> for hers. And so this will be no excuse for you, in the day of account, to say you followed your fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; did as they did before you; but then will the Lord say, because you followed the traditions &amp; fashions, and customs, and inventions of man, &amp; have hearkened to the voice of the Serpent, and have disobeyed my voice, &amp; my command, and slighted my counsel, and would none of my reproof, but cast my Law behind your backs, &amp; tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled my mercy under foot, &amp; have turned my grace into wantonness, &amp; have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter, and have spent my creatures upon your lusts, &amp; stoned, stocked, buffeted &amp; imprisoned, and shamefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated my messengers which I sent unto you to forewarn you of your iniquity, &amp; have killed my Son, therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ye workers of iniquity, I know you not, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting torment prepared for the Devil and his Angels; to see now how vain your hope is, and how unsteadfast your faith is, when you have more assurance of your damnation then your salvation; for the Lord saith, no unrighteous person must enter into his Kingdom, nor no unholy nor unclean thing. Therefore all you who desire salvation to your souls, try and prove your faith and hope which thou dost trust to, and take heed of trusting to a broken reed, lest it deceive you. Experience hath taught you, that if a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a building be decayed, and wasted &amp; naught, the building will fall when a storm comes: so let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall; so every one whose desire is after righteousness, hearken to that in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which raises up desires after righteousness, and which shews you the vainness of your lives, &amp; checks you when you do amiss, and troubles you, and torments you in conscience when you have been drunk, or have done

some evil act; be willing to be guided by that, &amp; that will lead you to repentance and a newness of life, to forsake those things which it discovers to be contrary to the will of God: and if you be willing to follow this, and be guided by it, you shall finde a teacher continually present, check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the conscience for vain thoughts, and for vain and idle, and needless words and actions, and so will crucifie the lust which is the ground of those things, and which will lead you out of the paths of death, into the way of life, our of the traditions and customs, and fashions and opinions of the world, into the assurance of the eternal Truth; and thou that art willing to follow this, and be guided by this, shalt need no man to teach thee, but it will be a teacher unto thee, teaching and directing in righteousness, purity and holiness; and if thou beest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, keeping thy mind within, with an ear open to the pure voice, thou shalt find it present with thee wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou art, in the fields, in thy bed, in Markets, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or wheresoever thou art, when thy outward Priest or Teacher is absent, it may be in the Ale-house, or at his pleasures and delights, or far off, it will be present with thee, and will check thee, and condemn thee, for that which no outward eye can see, and will cleanse thy heart from lust and deceit, and uncleanness, and will purifie thy heart, and will make it a fit Temple for purity to dwell in, and then thy sacrifices will be pure, which comes from a pure heart: the Lord will accept them, for <hi>Abels</hi> sacrifices he receives, but <hi>Cains</hi> he denies; but if thou wouldest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this, thou must be willing to deny thy lusts, thy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, thy delights, or whatsoever hath been thy life; for he that will save his life, shall lose it, and he that will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it: So there is no obtaining of life but through death, nor no obtaining the Crown, but through the Crosse: so thou must deny thy self, and take up thy Crosse daily and follow Christ, if thou wouldest be his Disciple, and give up thy self wholly to be guided by the will of God, that all which is contrary to the will of God may be crucified, though it be never so
