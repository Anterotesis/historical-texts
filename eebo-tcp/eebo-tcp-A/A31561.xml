            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Honourable, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, in PARLIAMENT Aſſembled. PROPOSALS <hi>Humbly offered, for Paſſing an Act to prevent Clipping and Counterfeiting of Mony.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEREAS Mony is the Principal Supporter, both in times of Peace and War and the only Riches, on which depends all Commerce and Trade. It hath therefore been the care of all Countries to keep their Coyn as free<note place="margin">The Minters have been a great cauſe of Clipping and falſe Coyning.</note> from defects as poſſible. Now <hi>England</hi> hath been more grieved with Clip'd and Counterfeit Mony than any other Country, for want of proper Laws to prevent the ſame, and by the abuſe of the Minters of our Mony, who have made the Coyn with ſo little Art and Ingenuity, that any may Clip or Counterfeit Mony without much difficulty.</p>
            <p>That it may be preſumed, the old Mony in this Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is now worth two thirds<note place="margin">The Value of the old Mony</note> of the Intrinſick value; taking the large and ſmall together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if there be not a ſtop put to Clipping of Mony, it will in a few Years be ſo Diminiſhed and Counterfeited, that it will not be worth half the value it was Coyn'd for.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to prevent Clipping and falſe Coyning for the future,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is Humbly Propoſed,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſince it may be preſumed, the old Mony is worth two thirds of the Intrinſick,<note place="margin">What value the Mony ſhould be when Recoyn'd.</note> it ſhould be all called in, and Melted down, and new Coyn'd into Mill'd Mony of the ſame value it is now of, one with another, <hi>viz.</hi> Every piece ſo to be new Coyn'd, to be only two thirds of the Intrinſick worth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be Objected,</hi> That to call in the Money and new Coyn it, will be ſo great a trouble and charge to the King and Subjects, that it muſt not be done at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is Humbly Anſwered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there ſhall be a moveable Mint that ſhall be placed in the middle of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">How the Mony ſhall be called in.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſhall give notice to all the Pariſhes in the ſaid County, to bring their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by ſuch a day, to be changed for new Coyn'd Mony; ſo having done in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Mint ſhall move into the middle of the next, to change and Coyn their Mony as aforeſaid, and ſo through the Kingdom, until all the old Mony ſhall be Coyn'd into Mill'd Mony.</p>
            <p>That the Mint ſhall firſt go into <hi>Cornwall, Devonſhire,</hi> &amp;c. or where the largeſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">How the Mint ſtall have a Stock.</note> is to be found, by which means the Mint will have a Stock to change the Mony as faſt as it is brought to them.</p>
            <p>That by this Method, the Poor and Rich may change their Mony with very little ttouble or charge, or fear of being Robb'd, for it may be preſumed that many will go together to the Mint, and will take the Poor's Mony with them. And further,<note place="margin">The mony Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyned with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little trouble or charge.</note> That many will make it their Imployment to fetch Mony from the Mint, and carry it to the adjacent Towns to change their Mony, and will do it for ſmall profit; ſo that the Mony in the Country will be changed with very little trouble and charge, and in <hi>London</hi> with much leſs, for all the old Mony may be thus Recoyned for 10000 l. Extraordinary Charge to the Mint, which is no great Expence in regard it will remove the greateſt Grievances this Kingdom is afflicted with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be further Objected,</hi> That to Coyn our Mony leſs than the Intrinſick value will be a great Abuſe to the Subject and a Diſhonour to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is Humbly Anſwered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it ſhall not be any abuſe to the Subject, for as ſoon as the Mony is Recoyned, by which it will be known how much the Mony wants of the Intrinſick (and Silver<note place="margin">When the mony ſhall be Coyned the Intrinſick worth.</note> Cheap, which now is very dear) the Mony ſhall be called in and Coyned up to the Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick: This Recoyning being done, ouly at preſent to ſtop the Currant of Clipping and falſe Coyning, which is now ſo much Practiſed, that it is probable they Clip and Coyn 500000 l. <hi>per ann.</hi> So that if an Act ſhould be made to call in the Mony, and Coyn it up to the Intrinſick worth, it would be ſo long about, that the Kingdom would loſe<note place="margin">The Kingdom will loſe greatly by any other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod but this.</note> at leaſt two Million of Mony by Clipping and falſe Coyning of mony before it could be done; Whereas, what is here Propoſed, may be done in one Year, and then there
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48819:2"/>
may be a ſmall Tax afterwards laid for calling the Mony in, to Coyn it up to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick,<note place="margin">The Mony may be called in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with little trouble.</note> which may be done by degrees; ſo that it will be no trouble to the Subject at all, after this firſt calling in of the Mony.</p>
            <p>That it cannot be any Diſhonour to the Kingdom, to Coyn our Money leſs then the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>This methed no diſhonour to</hi> England.</note> Intrinſick, ſince we do not do it for profit, but to prevent a Treaſonable Practice crept in amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be yet Objected,</hi> That to Coyn our Mony leſs then the Intrinſick worth, will be a hindrance to Trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that all Merchants are obliged to pay the Intrinſick worth for their Goods they Buy beyond Sea, and ſo they will want Intrinſick Mony for that uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is Humbly Anſwered,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it doth not appear in <hi>Holland, France, Portugal,</hi> &amp;c. That their Mony, altho' it<note place="margin">Mony ſo Coyn'd will be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to Trade</note> be leſs then the Intrinſick, is any hindrance to Trade, nor hath there been any ſuch Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect here in <hi>England,</hi> ſince our Mony hath been reduced ſo invaluable by Clipping, and it is directly againſt the Law to Tranſport our Mony; beſides it is the conſtitution of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> that all Debts ſhall be paid in Currant and Lawful Mony of <hi>England,</hi> and any Mony is Lawful that the King and Parliament pleaſe to make ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be Objected,</hi> That the Maſters of the Mint will Coyn <hi>Bullion</hi> into this Mony, and ſo abuſe the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is Hambly Anſwered,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it may be made High-Treaſon to Coyn and <hi>Bullion,</hi> but ſuch only as is old<note place="margin">The Minters cannot Coyn more then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Law.</note> Mony melted down, and the Office may be ſo Ordered, that it ſhall be impoſſible for the Minters to act the ſame Cheat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be Objected,</hi> That if Mony be Coyned leſs then the Intrinſick worth, they will Coyn Mony beyond Sea and ſend it here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is Humbly Anſwered,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That no Foreign State or Government will allow of Counterfeiting our Mony, and<note place="margin">They cannot Counterfeit our Mony beyond Sea.</note> if it be Coyned as ſhall hereafter be Propoſed, it will be impoſſible for any private Perſon to do it, without being diſcovered; Beſides, it is High-Treaſon to bring any Counterfeit Mony into <hi>England,</hi> and we have not obſerved any have done it lately, altho' there would be great profit in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be Objected,</hi> That if Mony be Coyned leſs then the Intrinſick worth, it will be much Counterfeited, for that they may make it of good Silver, and get great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is Humbly Anſwered,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That all Coyning is done by Caſting or Stamping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To prevent Conterfeiting of Mony by Caſting it.</hi> The Mony ſhould be thicker and narrower than now it is made, and it ſhould be Mill'd with a Hollow or Grove, and then it would be impoſſible to Counterfeit it by Caſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To prevent Counterfeiting of Mony by Stamping it.</hi> The Heads, Letters, and Arms, ſhould not be Grav'd, but cut upon Counter-Punches, and ſo Curiouſly done, that there ſhould be but few in the Kingdom could do it ſo well, and riſe up ſo high, that the Mony could not be Stamped, but with an Engine, and other Tools that muſt weigh<note place="margin">Impoſſible for a private Perſon to Counterfeit Mony.</note> near a Tun weight, and then it would be impoſſible for any private Perſon to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Mony without being diſcovered; but now the Mony, being ſuch bad Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, every <hi>Smith, Clock-maker, Braſier, Goldſmith,</hi> &amp;c. can Grave Stamps, and the Work being ſo flat and irregular, they can Stamp Mony with a Hammer of three pound weight, which is a great grievance to the Kingdom, to have our Mony Coyned ſo diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly, that it may be Counterfeited with ſo much eaſe and privacy.</p>
            <p>That if this Honourable Houſe will be pleaſed to Order the Propoſer hereof to attend your Honours, he will bring ſome Exemplary Pieces, by which he preſumes he can De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate<note place="margin">Examples to prove that mony cannot be Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited.</note> that Mony may be Coyn'd ſo, that it ſhall be impoſſible for any private Perſon to Counterfeit it; and will Humbly inform your Honours more at large of the defects of the late Mony, and how in the Coyning of it anew, it may be prevented.</p>

                  <hi>REASONS</hi> Humbly offered, to prove that Coyning our Mony the Intrinſick worth, is a great charge to the King, a grievance to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and an impoveriſhment to the Nation.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Standard of our Coyn is 11 ounces 2 penny weight fine Silver or Gold, and<note place="margin">The Standard of our mony.</note> 18 penny weight of Allay.</p>
