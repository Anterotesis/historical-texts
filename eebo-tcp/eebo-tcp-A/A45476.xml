            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which is lately publiſhed by ſome, who
intitle themſelves the <hi>Provinciall Aſſembly</hi>

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96486:6"/>
againſt D. <hi>Blondell</hi> and others, I have thought my ſelfe
obliged to examine whether there be any thing objected by
them in relation to thoſe <hi>Diſſertations,</hi> which may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
move me to <hi>retract</hi> what was there either with <hi>diffidence</hi>
propoſed, or more <hi>confidently</hi> aſſerted by me.</p>
               <p>2. And having diligently ſurveyed the whole <hi>Booke,</hi> that I
might omit no paſſage, wherein my intereſts might be in the
leaſt concern'd &amp; being truly able to affirme from that view,
that it hath yielded me no one ſyllable of uſefull <hi>Exhortation,</hi>
no motive to <hi>retract</hi> any period, or alter any expreſſion in
thoſe <hi>Diſſertations</hi> (but as farre, as I doe perſwade my ſelfe
that this <hi>Provinciall Synod</hi> containes in it Men of <hi>judgement</hi>
and <hi>abilities</hi> to maintaine the truth and <hi>convince gaine-ſayers,</hi>
ſo farre I am forced to aſſume, that what I have written is
teſtified to be <hi>Truth,</hi> and by that priviledge competently

the <hi>Authority</hi> of a <hi>Provinciall Synod,</hi> are yet diſabled to be
ſo juſt as to examine them by comparing them with the <hi>latine
Diſſertations,</hi> and that we are fallen upon thoſe times wherein
whatſoever is not anſwered, is cried up as unanſwerable (an
humour, of which, if I might be permitted to receive the
<hi>fruits.</hi> I ſhould have no temptation to complaine, there
being ſo much a greater part of thoſe <hi>Diſſertations,</hi> which was
never attempted to be <hi>anſwered.</hi>) I continue ſtill under ſome
ſeeming obligation to give an exact account of the whole
matter as it lies in conteſt betweene this <hi>Provinciall Synod</hi> and
thoſe <hi>Diſſertations,</hi> and I ſhall haſten to doe it, when I have

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96486:6"/>
4. Firſt, the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the <hi>Controverſy,</hi> as it generally lies
between us, which is this; whether the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
when they planted <hi>Churches</hi> in each City, left them in the
hands of <hi>many</hi> to be governed by the <hi>Common Councell</hi> of
thoſe <hi>many,</hi> erecting an <hi>equality</hi> or <hi>parity</hi> of ſeverall <hi>Rulers</hi>
in every City, to whom all others were ſubjected, and they
to none: or whether they placed the <hi>Superiour</hi> power and
<hi>Authority</hi> in ſome <hi>one,</hi> and ſubjected all others to him. Other
conſequent differences there are ariſing from hence, (and
thoſe of ſuch <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>concernment</hi> to thoſe with whom I
now diſpute, in caſe the <hi>Truth</hi> be not on their ſides, as will
make this <hi>returne</hi> to their <hi>Objections,</hi> no leſſe than a duty of
<hi>Charity,</hi> as to <hi>Brethren,</hi> if by the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> they ſhall
judge it <hi>reaſonable</hi> to make that uſe of it) but this is the one
<hi>Baſis</hi> of all, whether the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> planted <hi>parity</hi> or <hi>imparity</hi>
in the <hi>Church, many</hi> equall <hi>Governours</hi> in one City, or but
<hi>one</hi> in each; The former is the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> intereſt to defend,
the latter the <hi>Prelatiſts;</hi> And ſo the controverſy ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them to be debated and evinced by ſuch evidences as
a matter of <hi>Fact</hi> is capable of, (the <hi>Right</hi> being by both ſides
acknowledged to follow that <hi>Fact) i. e.</hi> by the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of
thoſe who are fit to be credited in this matter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>briefe heads</hi> of the Plea, by which I have
undertaken to maintaine the <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> aſſertion, 1. By
<hi>Scripture,</hi> 2. By the <hi>Records</hi> of the firſt times, the <hi>Writings</hi> of
thoſe who were neereſt the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and either affirme what
was done by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or how it ſtood practiced in the
<hi>Churches,</hi> all the World over, which were planted by them.
As for the <hi>third</hi> way of arguing from the <hi>univerſall</hi> conſent
and practice of all <hi>Churches</hi> for about 1400. yeares together,
<hi>i. e.</hi> from about the yeare 140. till the <hi>Reformation,</hi> this I doe
not inſiſt on, as I might with all evidence, becauſe it is knowne
and <hi>confeſt</hi> by the <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> and all that is by them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
is, that <hi>parity</hi> and <hi>equality</hi> being preſcribed and
practiced by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſoone after their death, and quite
<hi>contrary</hi> to their plat-forme, <hi>Prelacy</hi> was introduced into all
<hi>Churches;</hi> It being their deſire and demand now (a little
different from what M. <hi>Calvin</hi> at firſt propoſed to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96486:7"/>
                  <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Helvetia</hi>) that all may be <hi>reformed</hi> and reduced to
the ſtate wherein the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> left it.</p>
               <p>6. In the managing the proofes propoſed by mee, I have
uſed this method, which ſeemed to mee moſt convincing.
1. To inſiſt on ſome <hi>few Teſtimonies</hi> under each head, which
are ſufficient to conclude the matter on the <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> ſide;
and then to propoſe ſome obſervations, which may accord
all other places both of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>antient</hi> writers, with
thoſe <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> and that concluſion.</p>
               <p>7. The ſpeciall proofes of <hi>Scripture</hi> are taken, <hi>Firſt,</hi> from
the <hi>power</hi> derived (as from <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo)
from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> not as to a <hi>Common councell</hi> of
<hi>ſociall Rulers,</hi> but as ſo many <hi>ſeverall planters</hi> and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> each having all power committed to him,
and depending on no conjunction of any one or more <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
for the exerciſe of it; And this is largely and clearly deduced
<hi>Diſſert. 3. c.</hi> 1. 2. 3. 4. And this <hi>power</hi> being by them derived
to <hi>Biſhops</hi> in each <hi>City,</hi> in the ſame manner as they uſed it
themſelves (which is alſo farther evidenced and vindicated,
c. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) this was deemed a firſt competent proofe of this
matter, and as a <hi>confirmation</hi> of it, it was obſervable, that
the firſt <hi>Biſhops</hi> made by them, were in the very <hi>Scripture</hi>
called <hi>Apoſtles, James</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Diſſ.</hi>
4. c. 3.</p>
               <p>8. A <hi>ſecond principall</hi> proofe of <hi>Scripture</hi> is taken from
the ſeverall mentions of the ſo many <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and
the ſo many Angels aſſigned to them, one to each, as a
<hi>ſingular Governour</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of theſe wee have found great evidence of the fact to
authorize us to <hi>improve</hi> the concluſion a little higher, than
was <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the defence of the maine cauſe; <hi>viz.</hi> to affirme
of theſe Angels, that each of them was an <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan,</hi>
and having done ſo to diſcerne upon undeniable
grounds that there were many other ſuch, mentioned in the
<hi>Scripture</hi> (though not under that title) as <hi>James</hi> the <hi>brother</hi>
of the <hi>Lord, Metropolitan</hi> of all <hi>Judea, Titus</hi> of all <hi>Crete,</hi> with
an <hi>hundred</hi> Cities in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. And the wayes of according all other <hi>Scriptures</hi> with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96486:7"/>
theſe have been briefly theſe. 1. By obſerving this difference
betwixt Cities and Metropoles, as the true cauſe and occaſion
of the mentions of many <hi>Biſhops</hi> in (not of) one City, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereby the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of all the Cities under that <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi>
as <hi>Phil. 1. 1. Act. 20. 17. Secondly,</hi> by examining the
Nature of all the words, which I conceived to be uſed in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
for <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as (beſide <hi>Apoſtle</hi> and <hi>Angel</hi> forementioned)

And this is done <hi>Diſſert. 4. c.</hi> 7. and ſo to the end of that <hi>Diſſ.
Thirdly,</hi> by obſerving the <hi>paucity</hi> of believers in many Cities

ſhould by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> be ordeined any more than a <hi>Biſhop</hi>

being <hi>Martyr'd</hi> in the 10. of <hi>Trajan,</hi> to whoſe <hi>Reigne</hi> S. <hi>John</hi>

named by him, and of one <hi>Biſhop</hi> the <hi>Presbyters</hi> under him,
that if that one Authors Teſtimonies be attended to, there is
an abſolute deciſion of the whole matter on the <hi>Prelatiſts</hi>

of them under this title of honour and dignity. In the preſence of

For as to that which from the one word [yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>] in the plural. <hi>c.</hi> 4.
24. I finde objected by ſome againſt ſo many ſingle mentions of
the <hi>Angels</hi> (one in every <hi>Church</hi>) that will immediately
vaniſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Theſe words thus intirely ſet downe have a face very
diſtant from that ſo much <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>cenſoriouſneſſe</hi> that
I am here charged with by the <hi>Provinciall Synod.</hi> For 1. For
the <hi>concluſion</hi> deduced from the mention of theſe <hi>Angels,</hi> 'tis
not the <hi>Divine Right of Prelacy</hi> (which phraſe might yet
have beene reconciled with rules of Sobriety and Modeſty, as
well as the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Presbytery) but Chriſts appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
and confirmation of this <hi>dignity</hi> and power of Biſhops,
which concluſion hath evident grounds in thoſe Texts which
mention <hi>Chriſt's holding them in his Hand,</hi> and his addreſſing
an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to them, ſuppoſing onely, what is undertaken to be
evidenced by other <hi>mediums,</hi> that theſe Angels were <hi>ſingle</hi>
perſons in each <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Secondly, that which is by me ſo confidently affirmed,
is not, as this learned <hi>Aſſembly</hi> is pleaſed to ſuggeſt, that
theſe Angels were Metropolitans or Archbiſops. That they
were ſuch, is afterwards as a diſtinct matter in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
propoſed in a much more <hi>moderate ſtyle, ſtatim credibile
fiet, it will ſtraitwayes become credible,</hi> and with no more ſhew
of confidence then the premiſes which are there at large ſet
down, will Authorize.</p>
                  <p>7. Theſe be <hi>two</hi> competent eſſayes to begin with, by which
we may proportion our expectations; But there is yet a
<hi>third</hi> which hath ſomewhat more of <hi>injuſtice</hi> in it, to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my ſo much <hi>confidence</hi> in <hi>aſſerting,</hi> but never to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the grounds produced, whereon this confidence (as
farre as it extends) is built, the want of which is ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the one thing, which renders <hi>confidence</hi> unſeaſonable or
blameable, that it is not in the power of any man to have
apprehended grounds as proper to induce a <hi>concluſion,</hi> and to
ſuſpend the <hi>beliefe</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> of the truth of that <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96486:11"/>
which is ſo inferred. The <hi>injuſtice,</hi> I ſay, is there not
taking notice of the <hi>mediums,</hi> whereon the <hi>confidence</hi> is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
very competent to inferre a concluſion in that ſtile,
wherein it was there inferred, if they had been pleaſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe
their Readers of it.</p>
                  <p>8. The inference lies thus; The <hi>Angel</hi> of each Church of
<hi>Aſia</hi> was a <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon, therefore not a <hi>Colledge</hi> or <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi>
of Presbyters, and the ſingularity of the perſon is there

<hi>ipſum vel aliquem ei ſuccedaneum hunc ipſum Angelum
fuiſſe, quem</hi> c. 2. 1. <hi>Christus alloquitur. By which it appeares</hi>
(having formerly ſet down my <hi>grounds</hi> to induce this <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that either</hi> Timothy <hi>himſelf, or ſome body that ſucceeded
him, was that very Angel to whom Chriſt addreſt his speech,</hi>
c. 2. 1. But that is not to affirme it of <hi>Timothy,</hi> but purpoſely
to abſteine from affirming any thing that could be denyed or
doubted, and onely to affirme it <hi>either</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> or ſome
<hi>ſucceſſor</hi> of his, which evidently and infallibly it muſt be, if
there be truth in the premiſe from which it was inferred, the
words of the <hi>Councell,</hi> and the <hi>Father,</hi> that after <hi>Timothy,</hi> the

<hi>in the times of Claudius Caeſar;</hi> Then ſecondly, that
as it is by <hi>Chronologers</hi> ſet downe to be in the 13. of <hi>Claudius,</hi>
that <hi>Timothy</hi> was left by <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when hee went

that agreeable enough with his age, who appeares to be <hi>young</hi>
when <hi>Paul</hi> firſt placed him <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> If theſe grounds
have truth in them, then <hi>Timothy</hi> cannot be doubted to be

is produced by me <hi>Diſſert.</hi> 2. c. 25. Sect. 9) I ſhall here
freely give them my opinion alſo of that matter.</p>
                  <p>6. Firſt, that there is little ground of <hi>queſtion,</hi> but that
one of that name, <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> was <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in the
tenth yeare of <hi>Trajan,</hi> wherein <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote that
<hi>Epiſtle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Secondly, that by one indication there is ſome ſmall
reaſon to gueſs, that this <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was then lately come to that
dignity; I meane <hi>Ignatius</hi> his words of gratulation to that
<hi>Church,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> had <hi>given them the favour to obtaine or have
ſuch a Biſhop;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>8. Thirdly, that according to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his ſetting down
the time of <hi>John's</hi> baniſhment and <hi>viſions,</hi> in the dayes of
<hi>Claudius,</hi> there muſt be above 50 yeares diſtance between
the <hi>date</hi> of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and
conſequently that it is not ſo likely that <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> that was
their <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the later, ſhould be that very <hi>Angel</hi> in the
former.</p>
                  <p>9. Fourthly, that as I can have no cauſe to conſent with
<hi>Ado (in lib. de Feſt. Apoſt. ad 14. Cal. Mart.</hi>) that this <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus</hi>
in <hi>Ignatius</hi> was hee that is mentioned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to
<hi>Philemon,</hi> ſo nor to adhere to the <hi>Roman Martyrologie,</hi> that
he whom <hi>Paul</hi> mentions, was conſtituted <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi>
after <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. And therefore <hi>fiftly,</hi> it muſt be remembred, that both
the <hi>Greeke Menologies,</hi> and <hi>Simeon Metaphraſtes</hi> (who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96486:14"/>
celebrate his memory on <hi>March</hi> 13.) acknowledge not that
<hi>Oneſimus</hi> to have been at all <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and that others
alſo of the <hi>antients</hi> make him to have been <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Beraea,</hi>
and <hi>martyr'd</hi> in <hi>Domitian's</hi> Reigne: and <hi>Dorotheas</hi> in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopſi</hi>
expreſly affirmeth that <hi>Gaius</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Timothy</hi> in
<hi>Epheſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. From all which it followes, that <hi>Oneſimus</hi> mentioned
by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> was ſome later <hi>Biſhop</hi> of that City, who bare
that very <hi>Ordinary Greeke</hi> name, and ſo that his being <hi>Biſhop</hi>
of <hi>Epheſus</hi> no way belongs to that time of the <hi>Angel</hi> in the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> not interferes with their opinion, who thinke
<hi>Timothy</hi> to have beene that <hi>Angel;</hi> The appearing incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility
whereof was it, I ſpppoſe, that brought in here the
mention of <hi>Oneſimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. This was here ſeaſonable enough to be confronted to
their words in this place, and will be of uſe to be remembred
in the <hi>proceſſe</hi> of their <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. Thirdly, for <hi>Polycarp's</hi> being <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> as
there is left no place for the doubting of that (if either <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi>
that lived in his time and <hi>ſaw</hi> him, or if <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who
lived not long after, and was a curious <hi>Antiquary,</hi> may be
believed in their joynt affirmations of a knowne matter of
<hi>Fact</hi>) ſo it is againe no where affirmed by me, that hee was
the <hi>very</hi> man, to whom that <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Smyrna</hi>
was ſent, and if that were their meaning, they have againe
<hi>miſreported</hi> my words.</p>
                  <p>14. All that I had ſaid, I thinke was proved irrefragably;
that in two of thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Apocalyps;
Timothy</hi> and <hi>Poylcarpe</hi> are by <hi>Anthentick teſtimonies</hi> affirmed
to be conſtituted <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the one by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the other by
St. <hi>John,</hi> and that is a competent argument added to others, to
inferre that the <hi>Angel</hi> of each of thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> was a <hi>ſingle</hi>
perſon, and ſo a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the <hi>Prelatiſts,</hi> not in the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
notion of the word, an aſſertion which I need not feare
will yeild any advantage to the <hi>adverſaries,</hi> and ſo I as briefly
commit it to them.</p>

                  <p>IN the next place by way of <hi>anſwer</hi> to this plea of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Num. 1."/>
we are referred to three writings of their party,
<hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> the <hi>Vindication of Smectymnuus,</hi> the <hi>Humble
Addreſſes of the Divines at the Iſle of</hi> Wight, wherein, ſay they,
<hi>theſe things are fully, clearely, and ſatisfactorily handled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. But it being certaine that every one of theſe three was
publiſht ſome yeares before the <hi>Diſſertations,</hi> I ſhould thinke
it ſtrange that the particulars there inſiſted on by me, ſhould
by <hi>divination</hi> be thus <hi>anſwered</hi> before their <hi>conception,</hi> being
able truly to profeſſe, that though I am not unwilling to make
uſe of any mans aid for defending truth, yet none of thoſe
writings, to which any of thoſe three were given in <hi>anſwer,</hi>
were by me made uſe of in thoſe <hi>compoſitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. But we are ſuperſeded the trouble of examining any of
theſe three, by the <hi>leave</hi> that is <hi>craved</hi> to <hi>borrow</hi> from them
what may be <hi>uſefull</hi> for the turne, and then in like manner I
ſhall more willingly receive from theſe, what ſhall appeare
to anſwer, or prejudge our plea, than undertake new troubles
in farther unneceſſary ſearch of it.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Firſt, then they deſire it may be</hi> conſidered, that S. <hi>John,</hi>
the Penman of the Revelation doth neither in it, nor in any of his
other writings ſo much as upon the (by; <hi>I ſuppoſe, for the Printer
failes me)</hi> name <hi>Biſhop.</hi> Hee names the name <hi>Presbyter</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in the Revelation, yea, when he would ſet out the office
of thoſe who are neereſt the throne of Chriſt in his Church, <hi>Rev.</hi>
4. he calls himſelfe a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> Ep. 2. And whereas in S. <hi>John</hi>'s
dayes ſome new expreſſions were uſed in the Christian Church,
which were not in Scripture, as the Chriſtian Sabbath began
to be called the Lords day, and Chriſt himſelfe the Word, now
both theſe are found in the writings of St <hi>John;</hi> And it is
ſtrange to us that the Apoſtle ſhould mention a new phraſe, and
not mention a new Office erected by this time (as our Brethren
ſay) in the Church, especially if wee conſider that <hi>Polycarpe</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:96486:15"/>
(as it related) was made Biſhop by him; And no doubt if hee had
been made Biſhop in a prelaticall ſenſe, we ſhould have found the
name Biſhop in ſome of his writings, who lived ſo long as to ſee Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy
ſetled in the Church, as our Adverſaries would make us
believe.</p>
                  <p>5. We are now to conſider what degree of <hi>conviction,</hi> or
Argument, to the <hi>prejudice</hi> of our <hi>pretenſions,</hi> can be fetcht
from this large <hi>conſideration.</hi> And firſt it is moſt evident and
notorious among all Artiſts, that an argument from <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
cannot conclude <hi>negatively</hi> that there were no Biſhops in
St <hi>John's</hi> time, becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> doth not mention Biſhops. It
is the ſame way of arguing, as if they ſhould conclude that
there was no <hi>God</hi> in the time of writing the <hi>Canonicall Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
of <hi>Heſter,</hi> becauſe God is not found once mentioned in
thoſe <hi>Chapters.</hi> And yet of this <hi>inartificiall</hi> kinde is the whole
diſcourſe of this <hi>Paragraph,</hi> the premiſſes barely <hi>negative</hi>
throughout all the <hi>conſideration;</hi> And ſo nothing is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
from it to the <hi>prejudice</hi> of us, or <hi>benefit</hi> of our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
                  <p>6. Secondly, all that this <hi>conſideration</hi> pretends to, is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
in the bare name of <hi>Biſhop,</hi> that is it which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
is not to be found in St. <hi>John.</hi> But 1. They knew that the
word <hi>Angel</hi> is oft in St <hi>John,</hi> and by us conteſted, by the
<hi>ſingularity</hi> of the perſon one <hi>Angel</hi> in each <hi>Church</hi> (and other
Characters) to conclude the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Biſhop</hi> as irrefragably,
as if the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> were there ſpecified. Nay of this wee
have a competent experience, that if the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> had been
found there, it would by <hi>Presbyterians</hi> be as readily expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to ſignifie a Presbyter, or <hi>colledge</hi> of ſuch (for ſo certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they have done in other places) and truly with as much
<hi>reaſon</hi> and ſatisfaction to any <hi>impartiall</hi> judge, as they have
affirmed the word <hi>Angel</hi> in each <hi>Church</hi> to denote ſuch. And
therefore</p>
                  <p>7. Thirdly, I ſhall demand, would the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> St. <hi>John's</hi>
uſing the name <hi>Biſhop,</hi> be at all uſefull to the <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tereſts,
to conclude that there was ſuch an <hi>Office</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi>
in his time, or would it not? If not, then ſure it is not to our
<hi>prejudice,</hi> that hee hath not mentioned that name, and then
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96486:15"/>
this whole <hi>conſideration</hi> is perfectly to no purpoſe. If it would,
then ſure St. <hi>Pauls</hi> and St. <hi>Lukes</hi> frequent mentions of them
(I may adde St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo) will ſupply St. <hi>John's</hi> omiſſions, and
conclude there were <hi>Biſhops</hi> in their time, and that was long
before <hi>St. Johns</hi> death, if it had been conſidered.</p>
                  <p>8. Fourthly, when it is ſaid that St. <hi>John</hi> frequently names
the name <hi>Presbyter</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> 'tis not imaginable
that they ſhould thinke the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Diſſertations</hi> could
receive any prejudice from thence, when hee hath avowed to
believe that thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Elders,</hi> mentioned in thoſe ſo
many places of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> were the 24. <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Judaea</hi>
ſitting in <hi>Councell</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> their <hi>Metropolis,</hi> encompaſſing
<hi>James</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi> there together with the <hi>foure living creatures,</hi>
denoting the foure <hi>Apoſtles</hi> that were joyned with them in the
<hi>councell,</hi> and the 7. Lamps, the emblemes of the 7. <hi>Deacons</hi>
attending; Of which matter till they have diſproved what is
commodiouſly deduced <hi>Diſſert.</hi> 4. c. 20. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. I ſhall have
no need farther to inlarge, it being perfectly uſeleſſe to our
preſent inquiry, that either the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Elder</hi> ſhould
be uſed by S. <hi>John,</hi> for a ſingle <hi>Prefect</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi>
ſuppoſing (as now we do in the <hi>Objection,</hi> and tis but a begging
of the <hi>queſtion</hi> in the <hi>respondent</hi> to ſuppoſe the <hi>contrary</hi>) that
the word <hi>Angel</hi> is a notation of it.</p>
                  <p>9. By this it appeares fiftly, how little wee incommodated
by the <hi>poſition</hi> of theſe <hi>Elders</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> placed neereſt
to the <hi>throne</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Church, for ſuppoſing, as I doe,
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is by way of <hi>viſion</hi> repreſented there under the
perſon of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſitting in <hi>councell,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
(on each ſide) with a <hi>Semicircle</hi> of <hi>Thrones,</hi> on
which ſat the 24 <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> I can well allow theſe 24.
(call them <hi>Elders,</hi> or what you pleaſe) to be neereſt to that
<hi>middle throne,</hi> whereon <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſeated. And truely if it ſhould
be otherwiſe interpreted of Presbyters in the <hi>moderne</hi> notion
of the word, it would be hard to make the other parts of the
<hi>viſion</hi> to beare proportion with that phanſy; For I muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
according to St. <hi>John's</hi> words, that in the <hi>viſion</hi> theſe
<hi>thrones</hi> were ſet up in <hi>Heaven;</hi> And then I ſhall demand, was
that a <hi>repreſentation</hi> of any <hi>councell</hi> or <hi>Judicature</hi> on <hi>Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96486:16"/>
or not? If it were not, then nothing can be inferred thence
in favour of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> more than of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> for of both
theſe we ſpeake, as of <hi>Officers</hi> on Earth; But if it were, then
applying it to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> it muſt follow, that in the <hi>midſt</hi>
of them there is ſome other (invironed on each ſide by
them) <gap reason="foreign">

and the leaſt that can be ſignified hereby, will be <hi>ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority</hi>
of <hi>dignity</hi> in him that ſits on that <hi>middle throne</hi> above
all the 24. <hi>Elders,</hi> which will be deemed to exceede the caſe

That there is not any the leaſt intimation in all S. <hi>John</hi>'s

onely where he names and chides <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> as one ambitiouſly
affecting ſuch a Primacy.</p>
                  <p>2. A <hi>conſideration</hi> of the ſame unhappy conſtitution with
the former, 1. <hi>a teſtimonio negativè</hi> againe, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had
no occaſion to mention it, therefore there was in his time no

ſuch thing, and 2. in reſpect of the matter juſt the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
put only in other words, there 'twas, [No mention

of one <hi>Presbyter</hi> over another in all Saint <hi>John</hi>'s writings.]
And ſo it can adde no accumulation of weight to the former.</p>
                  <p>3. But then 2. (bating againe thoſe two infirmities in
diſcourſe) what if it were granted that at the time of
Saint <hi>John</hi>'s writing, there were not in the <hi>whole Church</hi>
of <hi>Christ</hi> any one <hi>Presbyter,</hi> ſuperior to another <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
what hath the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Diſſert:</hi> loſt, or they

it as his opinion probably inferred, and not eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed

any <hi>Presbyters</hi> in our <hi>Moderne</hi> notion of them, created in the

                  <p>5. <hi>Secondly, Diotrophes</hi> was not (as farre as appeares, or we

But if it be ſaid he did, then I demand, Why is not <hi>Diotrophes</hi>

St. <hi>John</hi> himſelfe ſat many yeares Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and was
the Metropolitan of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> which (ſay they) is an evident
demonstration to us, that theſe Authors did not uſe the word
Biſhop in a Prelaticall ſenſe. For it is certaine that the Apoſtles
cannot be properly called Biſhops; For though they doe eminently
containe the Epiſcopall Office, yet they were not formally Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.
For this were to degrade the Apoſtle, and to make their
Office Ordinary and perpetuall, this were to exalt the Biſhop
above his degree, and make him an Apoſtles, and to make the
Apoſtle a Biſhop. It doth not much differ from madneſſe, to ſay
that <hi>Peter</hi> or any one of the Apoſtles were properly Biſhops, as

                  <p>5. But then ſecondly, when they take this for an <hi>evident
demonſtration,</hi> that theſe <hi>Authors</hi> did not uſe the word <hi>Biſhop</hi>
in a <hi>Prelaticall</hi> ſenſe, this is very farre diſtant from a <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi>
having not arrived to the loweſt degree of <hi>probability</hi>
or <hi>credibility.</hi> For what is a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the <hi>Prelaticall</hi> ſenſe,
but a <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon <hi>governing</hi> in <hi>chiefe</hi> in a <hi>City</hi> or wider cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit?
And ſuch certainly was St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> at
<hi>Epheſus,</hi> &amp;c. As long as they continued to execute that <hi>power</hi>
of the <hi>Keyes</hi> (the donation of which inſtituted them
<gap reason="foreign">

in this or that <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Region,</hi> and ordained other <hi>Biſhops</hi>
there.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, therefore when 'tis added, that it is certaine that
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> cannot be properly called <hi>Biſhops,</hi> I reply that it
is moſt certaine they may, not onely becauſe theſe ſo many
<hi>antient Writers,</hi> through ſeverall ages have called them ſo,
and may not, with any <hi>juſtice</hi> from us, be accuſed of <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,</hi>
but becauſe the <hi>donation</hi> of the <hi>Keyes</hi> did as properly
make them <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to goe <hi>preach</hi> to all
Nations, being added to it, made them <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> To which
purpoſe let theſe few things be conſidered, 1. That it is here
by the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> acknowledged, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
conteine the <hi>Epiſcopall Office,</hi> which though it be a
little haſtily expreſſed, and ſhould be, I ſuppoſe, that the
<hi>Apoſtolicall Office</hi> did <hi>eminently</hi> containe the <hi>Epiſcopall,</hi> yet
there is no doubt, but this is the meaning of it, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi>
had all the <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> power in their hands, and over
and above, ſomething more, and if they had <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> power,
then ſure in reſpect of that, they may as properly be called
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96486:21"/>
                     <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as in reſpect of their <hi>Apoſtolicall Commiſſion,</hi> which
they had alſo, they may be properly called <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Thus we
know that they that have firſt the power of <hi>Deacons</hi> beſtowed
on them, and after of Presbyters, are queſtionleſſe <hi>Deacons</hi>
ſtill, though they be alſo Presbyters, and they which from the
<hi>Office</hi> of Presbyters are advanced to <hi>Biſhops,</hi> are certainly
Presbyters ſtill, though they be alſo <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and doe not loſe
the <hi>former</hi> power by being advanced to the <hi>latter,</hi> are not
<hi>leſſened</hi> by this <hi>increaſe</hi> of their <hi>dignity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Secondly, that when an <hi>Apostle</hi> is differenced from a
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> it is either by his extraordinary power granted him for
the <hi>planting</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> or by the <hi>Vniverſality</hi> of his
<hi>Dioceſe,</hi> the [<hi>all the World</hi>] to which his <hi>Commiſſion</hi> exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
whereas the ordinary <hi>Biſhop's</hi> power and <hi>Dioceſe</hi> are
more limited. But then theſe differences are of no force in this
matter, they onely conclude that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is more than a
<hi>Biſhop</hi> in thoſe two reſpects, not that in other ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
he is not a <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Thirdly, when the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had each of them (not onely all
together in a <hi>conſiſtory</hi>) that unlimited power, in reſpect of the
<hi>extent</hi> to all the World, given to them by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wee know
that after his <hi>aſcent</hi> they parted and diſtributed this <hi>Province</hi>
among them, aſſigned every one <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> his
<hi>proper place</hi> or <hi>lot,</hi> to which he ſhould betake himſelfe for the
<hi>planting</hi> of the <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> And then there will be no
doubt but that hee, who according to his <hi>line</hi> (in St. <hi>Paul's</hi>
phraſe) had <hi>planted</hi> the <hi>faith</hi> in ſuch a <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Province,</hi> and
ſat downe, and <hi>confirmed,</hi> and farther <hi>inſtituted</hi> (which is the
meaning of <hi>labouring in the Doctrine,</hi> as well as in the <hi>word</hi>)
and <hi>govern'd</hi> them, and exerciſed all <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> acts among
them, might in ſo doing be ſtiled a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in that <hi>City</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi>
and that as truely and as <hi>properl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> as he that could doe

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erning</hi> and <hi>inſtructing,</hi> where another had <hi>plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
the <hi>faith</hi> might be ſaid to be.</p>
                  <p>9. Nay fourthly, we know, that although by <hi>Canons</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> there is proviſion made, upon prudentiall <hi>conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
that no man ſhall be made a Biſhop <hi>ſine titulo, without
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96486:21"/>
a title</hi> or particular See, to which hee is aſſigned, yet before
thoſe <hi>Canons</hi> forbad it, ſuch <hi>Biſhops</hi> there were, and thoſe
never doubted to be properly <hi>Biſhops,</hi> though they were not
affixt to any <hi>Dioceſe;</hi> And then nothing can hinder but that
the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> who had each the <hi>whole World</hi> for his <hi>Title,</hi>
though hee were never affixed to any particular <hi>Dioceſe</hi> or
<hi>Province,</hi> might be moſt properly ſtyled a <hi>Biſhop</hi> for all that.
But this is <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> more than is needfull to our preſent
praetentions of St. <hi>John,</hi> who, we know, was after his returne
from <hi>baniſhment affixt</hi> to <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>ſeated</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> the
chiefe <hi>Metropolis</hi> there, to <hi>ſuperintend</hi> in the Jewiſh part
of the <hi>Aſian Church</hi> over all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Metropolitans</hi>
there.</p>
                  <p>10. To this I might adde fiftly, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> in every
<hi>City</hi> were <hi>ſucceſſors</hi> of the Apoſtles, as is largely <hi>deduced
Diſſ.</hi> 3. c. 3. Sect. 14. &amp;c. which they could not truly be, if the
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> whom they <hi>ſucceeded,</hi> were not in veſted with that
<hi>power,</hi> wherein they <hi>ſucceeded</hi> them, <hi>i. e.</hi> were not firſt <hi>Biſhops</hi>
before them. But I ſhall not inlarge of this, having no need of
more evidences in this matter.</p>
                  <p>11. Fourthly therefore, when it is added, that if the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi>
be affirmed to be properly Biſhops, this <hi>were to degrade
the</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>and to make their office ordinary and perpetuall.</hi>
This is but a ſhortneſſe of diſcourſe, of which a very few words
will ſuffice to admoniſh any, for there is no more ſtrength in
that <hi>conſequence,</hi> than there would be in <hi>affirming</hi> that ſuch an
one is a <hi>Man,</hi> therefore he is not a <hi>living Creature,</hi> or that
he that ſaith he is a <hi>living Creature,</hi> degrades him from being
a <hi>man;</hi> For as to that of [<hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>perpetuall</hi>] 'tis no
way inconvenient, that the Apoſtles, who had ſomewhat
<hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> for the <hi>firſt planting</hi> of Churches
(in reſpect of which eſpecially they were called Apoſtles)
might alſo have ſomewhat, which was of <hi>ordinary perpetuall</hi>
uſe in the <hi>Church,</hi> wherein others might and ſhould ſucceed
them, and that is it unqueſtionably which wee meane by the
word Biſhops, when we aſcribe it to them or any of them, or
to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, the ſource and <hi>originall</hi> Copy of that <hi>power</hi>
in the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:96486:22"/>
12. Fiftly, when another inconvenience is accumulated on

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Numb. 1."/> That the word Angel (which is
the title given to thoſe ſuppoſed <hi>Biſhops</hi>) doth not import any
peculiar juriſdiction, or praeeminence, but is a common name to
all <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and ſo is uſed in <hi>Scripture.</hi> For all <hi>Miniſters</hi> are
Gods <hi>Meſſengers</hi> and <hi>Embaſſadours</hi> ſent for the good of the elect,
and therefore the name being common to all <hi>Miniſters,</hi> why ſhould

that doth not belong to all? The ſame may be ſaid of the word
<hi>Starre</hi> (which is alſo a title given to thoſe ſuppoſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans)
It is evident that all faithfull <hi>Miniſters</hi> are called
<hi>Starres</hi> in Scripture, whoſe duty is to ſhine as lights unto the

There is nothing in theſe titles that argue theſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> to
be <hi>Biſhops</hi> in our brethrens ſenſe: Inſomuch as had they not been
called <hi>Biſhops</hi> by ſome authors that ſucceeded them, (who spake

                     </gap>o this <hi>conſideration</hi> I might, if it were needfull, reply,
1. That the word <hi>Angel</hi> is no where uſed for any other <hi>Officer</hi>

                  <p>3. Secondly, that, as to the words <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> and <hi>Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
there is in ordinary ſpeech ſome conſiderable difference
betweene them, the latter having in it a connotation of <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
ſuſtaining the perſon of the <hi>King,</hi> from whom he is ſent

                     <hi>to be ſent</hi>) ſignifies
alſo without any conſiderable difference, but yet is never

                  <p>5. But that which wholly fruſtrates the deſigne of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,</hi>
is this, that the <hi>ſingularity</hi> of the <hi>perſon, (one
Angel</hi> in each of the ſeven <hi>Churches</hi>) is all that wee argue
from, in this matter; For as to the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> in
each <hi>Church,</hi> That is certainly pretended to (and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd)
by the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> as well as the <hi>Prelatiſt,</hi> the onely
<hi>Queſtion</hi> is, whether it be placed in <hi>one</hi> over the reſt, or in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96486:23"/>
                     <hi>more</hi> than one, <hi>ruling</hi> together in <hi>common,</hi> and from the ſtyle
of <hi>Chriſts Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
and the like in each of the <hi>ſeven,</hi> wee thinke we conclude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly,
that it was <hi>one,</hi> it being certaine that the <hi>ſingular</hi>
number is not the <hi>duall</hi> or <hi>plurall,</hi> and that [<hi>Angel</hi>] is a
<hi>perſon,</hi> not an <hi>aggregate</hi> body or <hi>multitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. And to the ſame purpoſe againe wee conclude not from
the mention of the <hi>Starres,</hi> not from their <hi>light</hi> or <hi>ſhining,</hi>
but from their <hi>number,</hi> but <hi>ſeven</hi> in all, no more than there are
<hi>Churches,</hi> i. e. <hi>one</hi> onely in each <hi>Church;</hi> And we know there
is difference betweene a <hi>Star</hi> and an <hi>Aſteriſme</hi> or <hi>conſtellation,</hi>

Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> that is reſolved not to finde this truth in

                  <p>4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whereas it is ſuggeſted, that this which we

my perſwaſion and aſſurance (the truth of which muſt
be in the proceſſe of this diſcourſe <hi>conteſted</hi>) that there is no

<hi>practice,</hi> and <hi>writings</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the
ſucceeding through all the world, agree directly with what
I conclude from the <hi>ſingularity</hi> of the <hi>Angel;</hi> And when in
the following words the <hi>teſtimonies</hi> are expreſſed to be thoſe
which make <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Preſbyters</hi> to be one and the ſame,
This alſo will immediately vaniſh, when it is remembred, what
is largely deduced in the <hi>Diſſertations,</hi> that the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> in
the <hi>Scripture</hi> is never uſed for a <hi>Presbyter</hi> in our <hi>Moderne</hi>
notion of the word, but conſtantly for the one <hi>ſingle Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
in a <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>City,</hi> and that if there be any truth in that
which is here affirmed, <hi>Presbyters</hi> muſt be taken in a notion

                  </p>
                  <p>2. In this propoſall of our <hi>Objection,</hi> I ſhall not need to
inquire who this <hi>high Prelatiſt</hi> is; The former intimations
and directions have perſwaded me that I am lookt on as this
<hi>Objector,</hi> though it be ſufficiently knowne that the moſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Armagh, Lord Primate</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath

to the view of the <hi>ſolid and every way ſufficient anſwers,</hi>
which are ſaid to be given to this <hi>Objection,</hi> which though
they be, it ſeemes to be fetcht out of <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> &amp;c. yet it
happens well, that we ſhall (without need of conſulting thoſe
larger <hi>volumes</hi>) find them here with more eaſe, reduced to
<hi>two heads,</hi> One, <hi>that the word Angel ſignifies not a ſingular
perſon,</hi> the ſecond, <hi>that if it did, it will not at all advantage the
Epiſcopal cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Theſe two, I confeſſe, if either of them be ſolidly proved,
will utterly drive us from our hold: The onely <hi>queſtion</hi> at
preſent is, whether in either part the <hi>proofes</hi> be <hi>ſolid,</hi> and
of this we muſt now inquire, and firſt of the <hi>former</hi> of
them.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>This they thus propoſe,</hi> That the word Angel is not to
be taken <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not individually, but colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96486:26"/>
for all the Paſtors and Miniſters of the respective
Churches.</p>
                  <p>6. But before their proofes for ſuch an aſſertion (that
the <hi>Angel</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Church,</hi> which is certainly an <hi>individual,</hi>
as much as the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Dioceſe,</hi> is not yet to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>individually</hi>) they firſt adde their <hi>confeſſion</hi> that this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is <hi>called a poore ſhift, a vaine conceipt, &amp;c.</hi> but promiſe
ſuch <hi>reaſons for the juſtification of it, which cannot be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. To the view of theſe <hi>unanſwerable Reaſons</hi> therefore we
ſhall now haſten; And the firſt <hi>reaſon</hi> is, becauſe our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
ſpeakes to the <hi>Angel</hi> often in the <hi>plural</hi> number, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.
21. <hi>But unto you I ſay, and the reſt of Thyatira,</hi> and ſo <hi>Rev.</hi>
2. 10. and 13. <hi>By which,</hi> ſay they, <hi>it is evident, that by the
word Angel is not meant one ſingular perſon, but the collective
body of Rulers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. To this firſt reaſon I ſhall anſwer, by ſeparating that
one text of <hi>Thyatira</hi> from the other two, and all that are of
the ſame nature with them, and ſpeake firſt of theſe two, and
remind them 1. that in an <hi>Epiſtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> unqueſtionably addreſt to
a <hi>particular perſon,</hi> others under his care and charge may be,
and are <hi>occaſionally</hi> mentioned, ſo in that to <hi>Titus, Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi>
owne <hi>Sonne,</hi> i. e. under the particular <hi>character</hi> of the <hi>beloved</hi>
perſon converted by him; in the concluſion we finde theſe
words, <hi>Grace be with you all,</hi> i. e. not with him as he muſt
ſignifie a whole <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> but all the <hi>ſincere lovers</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and Saint <hi>Paul, they that love us in the faith,</hi> in the former
part of the <hi>verſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that though the <hi>one Angel</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
be the perſon to whom each part of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> is addreſt, yet
in it are ſet downe the <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>fate</hi> of the <hi>whole Church,,</hi> i. e.
of all the <hi>believers</hi> in it; Thus when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or
<hi>Judah</hi> were fallen into foule ſins and provocations againſt
<hi>God,</hi> it was ordinary for <hi>God</hi> to ſend a <hi>Prophet</hi> to the <hi>King</hi>
of either of them, and admoniſh him what <hi>reformations</hi> were
to be wrought, and what <hi>judgements</hi> were a comming in caſe
of neglect. In which kind of meſſages of the <hi>Prophet</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the <hi>King,</hi> 'tis certaine that the whole people were
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96486:26"/>
concerned, and ſo without queſtion was it here, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10.
the <hi>Devill ſhall caſt ſome of you,</hi> i. e. ſome <hi>Members</hi> of that
<hi>Church, into priſon,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo ver. 13. <hi>among you,</hi> i. e. among
you of that <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. And indeed if each of thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> had been governed
by a <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> of <hi>co-equal Preſbyters,</hi> and thoſe (as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by our <hi>adverſaries</hi>) ſignified by the <hi>Angel,</hi> yet there
would be as little reaſon to doubt, but the ſins of the people,
as well as the <hi>Clergy</hi> were here reprehended by <hi>Christ,</hi> and
the judgement threatned to one as well as to the other, And
to this can be no reaſon to inferre the <hi>Angel</hi> to be no <hi>ſingular</hi>
perſon, the <hi>Church</hi> ruled by <hi>one,</hi> making up a <hi>multitude,</hi> as
well as if it were ruled by a <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. As for the place, cap. 2. 24. concerning <hi>Thyatira,</hi> that
hath a different appearance, For the <hi>Greek copie</hi> ordinarily
reading it [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>But I ſay
unto you</hi> (in the <hi>plural and to the reſt which are in Thyatira</hi>]
the [<hi>you</hi>] in the <hi>plural,</hi> is by the <hi>Objectors</hi> thought neceſſarily
to belong to the <hi>Angel</hi> of that <hi>City,</hi> as [<hi>the reſt</hi>] to the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity</hi>
of the people. To this place therefore we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
anſwered, that the reading in the <hi>Antient Manuſcripts,</hi>
particularly in that belonging to the <hi>Kings Library</hi> at Saint
<hi>James</hi>'s, leaves out the [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>and</hi>] and reads thus, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
<hi>But to you I ſay the reſt which are in Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi>]
And this takes away all force from the <hi>objection,</hi> for
the former part of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> belonging to the <hi>Angel,</hi> who
permitted <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and to them that <hi>committed fornication with
her,</hi> the [<hi>But</hi>] in the <hi>front</hi> ſeparates the [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>you
the reſt</hi>] from the <hi>Angel,</hi> and thoſe <hi>other</hi> formerly ſpoken to,
and therefore the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>you,</hi> cannot poſſibly be the <hi>Angel,</hi>
wherein all the ſtrength of the <hi>Objection</hi> conſiſts.</p>
                  <p>12. <hi>But this Anſwer, though taken notice of, is diſliked:</hi>

in the concluſion of the verſe, I will put upon you no other burthen,
will confeſſe that the old copies are better than that which is ſaid
to be <hi>Tecla</hi>'s Manuſcript.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:96486:27"/>
13. And here I ſhall deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to beare me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in obeying their <hi>directions,</hi> and obſerve what the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents</hi>
and <hi>Conſequents</hi> can afford to the prejudice of that
<hi>Antient</hi> copy. 'Tis moſt true, that <hi>v.</hi> 23. we read, <hi>I will give
to every one of you,</hi> and that then it followes <hi>v. 24. But I ſay
unto you,</hi> and in the concluſion of the verſe, <hi>I will put upon
you—</hi> But I demand, what will they conclude from hence?
That by the word [<hi>you</hi>] in all theſe places the <hi>ſame</hi> perſons
are to be underſtood, and that thoſe perſons are the <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
of the <hi>Angel</hi> v. 18? Theſe two things they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
or elſe they will faile in their deſigne, which is to ſhew
that by the word <hi>Angel</hi> the <hi>collective</hi> body of <hi>Rulers</hi> is meant.
But the firſt of theſe is evidently falſe, whatſoever reading be
retained, for beſides that the [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>But</hi>] doth clearly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the ſecond [<hi>you</hi>] from the firſt, and makes them <hi>diſtinct</hi>
perſons, The very matter of the ſpeeches will convince it:
For in the 23. <hi>v.</hi> the [<hi>you</hi>] are thoſe that were <hi>corrupted by
Iezabel v.</hi> 20. 22. who are now to be exemplarily <hi>puniſht</hi> and
<hi>destroyed, I will kill her</hi> (i. e. <hi>Iezebels) children with death</hi>
(as alſo thoſe that had <hi>committed Fornication with her</hi> v. 22.)
<hi>and all the Churches ſhall know that I am the ſearcher of hearts,
and I will give to every of you according to your workes;</hi> But
the ſecond [<hi>you</hi>] and ſo alſo the <hi>third,</hi> are the <hi>quite</hi> contrary to
theſe, <hi>As many as have not this Doctrine, and who have not
knowne theſe depths of Satan,</hi> and conſequently, who are
<hi>not</hi> to be <hi>puniſhed,</hi> nor ſo much as admoniſhed, but onely

already.</hi>
                  </p>

the <hi>Antecedent</hi> and <hi>Conſequent</hi> ſhould favour their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>15. This matter is ſo evident (the contrary conditions

if the ordinary reading were to be retained [<gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>is this, becauſe</hi> it is certaine that the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
was a collective body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that there were many <hi>Presbyters</hi>
to whom St. <hi>Paul,</hi> at his finall departure from them, committed the
charge of that Church. And theſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> are called <hi>Biſhops,</hi>
and were all of them <hi>Stars</hi> of the ſame magnitude, and <hi>Angels</hi>
of the ſame order without a difference or diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>2. But this is a way of proving a thing which is <hi>denyed,</hi> by
another which they know is equally <hi>denyed</hi> by him, againſt
whom they diſpute, and therefore that <hi>argument</hi> can be of no
force with us.</p>

3. 'Tis moſt true indeed, what they begin with, that the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was a <hi>collective</hi> body, for ſo 'tis certaine
every <hi>Church</hi> is, whether governed by one or more <hi>Rulers;</hi>
But the <hi>Church</hi> is not the <hi>Angel,</hi> any more than the <hi>candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtickes</hi>

<hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 20. But this I ſuppoſe was a miſtake haſtily fallen from
them, and I ſhall not purſue it any farther.</p>
                  <p>4. Their argument, I conceive, depends upon the <hi>plurality</hi>
of <hi>Elders</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Paul</hi> takes his leave of them, and calls them <hi>Biſhops.</hi> But to
this they know I have anſwered clearly, that as in other
places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſo in that, the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Biſhops,</hi> denote (not the many
<hi>Preſbyters</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> City of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> but) the many <hi>Biſhops</hi>
of that and other Cities of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which at that time by S. <hi>Paul's</hi>
ſummons ſent to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the chiefe <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> were
called and met together at <hi>Miletus.</hi>

                  <p>5. To this purpoſe<note n="*" place="margin">L. 3. c. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Irenaeus</hi> is a witneſſe beyond exception,
who ſpeaking of theſe <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> addes, <hi>ab Epheſo &amp;
proximis civitatibus convocatos eſſe, that they were aſſembled
from</hi> Epheſus <hi>and the next Cities,</hi> in which as the <hi>faith</hi> was
planted, as well as in <hi>Epheſus</hi> (even in all <hi>Aſia</hi>) ſo there is
no reaſon to doubt but there were <hi>Biſhops</hi> in them, as well as
in <hi>Epheſus</hi> (ſeven ſuch <hi>Churches</hi> we know are here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Revelation</hi>) and that <hi>Paul</hi> was as carefull to take his
leave of them (as many as could conveniently come to <hi>Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
in his haſty progreſſe) as of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> hee is
juſtly deemed to have been.</p>
                  <p>6. Other <hi>arguments</hi> and <hi>authorities</hi> I need not here accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
for this notion of <hi>Elders</hi> Act. 20. becauſe here is no
appearance of reaſon offered to prove their, or impugne our
<hi>Aſſertion.</hi> This perhaps will be afterward attempted, and
then I ſhall, as occaſion requires, farther enlarge: In the
meane it ſufficeth that it yet no way appeares, that <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
was governed by <hi>many Presbyters,</hi> and not by <hi>one Biſhop,</hi>
and therefore this ſecond offer of <hi>reaſon</hi> is as deficient as the

ſaid that <hi>John</hi> ſaw ſeven <hi>Angels</hi> which ſtood before God. By
theſe ſeven Candleſticks (<hi>I ſuppoſe it ſhould be</hi> ſeven <hi>Angels</hi>)
Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> doth not underſtand ſeven individuall <hi>Angels</hi>

but all the <hi>Angels;</hi> For there are no ſeven individuall <hi>Angels</hi>
that ſtand before God, but all doe, <hi>Dan</hi> 7. there are many more
inſtances brought in the Bookes forementioned.</p>
                  <p>2. To this <hi>third Reaſon</hi> I have no obligation or notice to
give credit, any farther than the <hi>evidences</hi> perſwade, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of which, though we are referred to <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> &amp;c. yet
having received promiſe from theſe, that they would bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a <hi>few things</hi> from thoſe others; I ſhall with reaſon hope
that what they have upon <hi>choiſe borrowed, leaving,</hi> as they
ſay, <hi>much more behind,</hi> is the moſt <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> and <hi>ſolid</hi> of any
thing by them produced; and conſequently if there be no
force in theſe inſtances to oppugne our <hi>concluſion,</hi> we ſhall not
expect to finde more <hi>convincing</hi> ones by travailing farther,
and gathering up out of thoſe <hi>disperſions,</hi> what they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to take up and offer to us.</p>
                  <p>3. The thing they would prove is, that <hi>'tis uſuall with the
Holy Ghoſt in this (as in other myſterious prophetick Bookes)
to expreſſe a number of things or perſons by ſingulars.</hi> Their
proofes are but three, and the firſt is of no force, becauſe the
word <hi>Church</hi> denotes a <hi>ſingular</hi> thing, as well as <hi>Candleſtick</hi>
that repreſents it; for though a <hi>thouſand</hi> men make up one
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96486:29"/>
                     <hi>Church,</hi> yet <hi>one Church</hi> is but <hi>one</hi> thing, conſidered as a
<hi>Church,</hi> and proportionably as <hi>one Candleſtick</hi> in the <hi>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
is ſet to denote each <hi>Church,</hi> ſo there are <hi>ſeven Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi>
to repreſent the <hi>ſeven Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. As for the ſecond, that of the <hi>Angels,</hi> that that ſignifies
<hi>many Ministers,</hi> that cannot be offered as a <hi>proofe,</hi> being it
ſelfe the matter of the <hi>queſtion.</hi> And indeed though <hi>Church</hi>
be a <hi>collective</hi> body, and ſo one <hi>Church</hi> is knowne to conſiſt of
<hi>many men,</hi> yet <hi>Angel</hi> is not of that nature, <hi>one Angel</hi> neither
ſignifies <hi>many</hi> men, nor <hi>many Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. And whereas the <hi>parallel</hi> is ſet betwixt the word <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,</hi>
and the word <hi>Angel,</hi> that they (each) are <hi>ſingular</hi>
words, by which <hi>multitudes</hi> are repreſented, that is a miſtake,
for the <hi>parallel</hi> lyes betwixt <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Angel</hi> (and on the
other ſide betwixt <hi>Candleſtick</hi> and <hi>Starre,</hi> as appeares <hi>Rev.</hi>
1. 20.) and both theſe are <hi>individual</hi> things, the <hi>Church</hi> an
<hi>individual Church,</hi> and there be ſeven ſuch <hi>individual Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
and the <hi>Angel</hi> an <hi>individual Angel,</hi> and there be ſeven
ſuch <hi>individual Angels,</hi> and there can be no more pretenſe
that one <hi>Angel</hi> ſhould ſignifie <hi>many Miniſters,</hi> than that one
<hi>Church</hi> ſhould ſignifie <hi>many Congregations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Laſtly, for the third proofe, that of ſeven <hi>Angels, Rev.</hi> 8. 2.
if that were granted to Doctor <hi>Reynold</hi>'s authority, that the
[<hi>ſeven Angels</hi>] there ſignifies <hi>all the Angels,</hi> yet would it
not at all contribute to the proofe of the point in hand, which
is, that <hi>many</hi> ſhall be ſignified by a <hi>ſingular,</hi> for we know that
<hi>ſeven</hi> are not a <hi>ſingular,</hi> but the cuſtome indeed being
ordinary to uſe a <hi>certaine definite</hi> number, for an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine</hi>
or <hi>indefinite,</hi> and the <hi>ſeptenary</hi> being a <hi>perfect</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and ſo fitteſt for the turne, 'tis more tolerable that the
number of <hi>ſeven</hi> may repreſent ſome greater number, one
<hi>plural</hi> a larger <hi>plural,</hi> than that a <hi>ſingular</hi> one ſhould doe ſo.</p>
                  <p>7. And yet ſecondly, there is no great reaſon to doubt, but
that the <hi>ſeven Angels</hi> are indeed very <hi>ſeven Angels,</hi> and no
more; This I collect, 1. from the <hi>ſeven Trumpets</hi> that were
given them, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and the ſpecifying them by that <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
the ſeven Angels, which had the ſeven Trumpets,</hi> ver. 6.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> by the ſeverall employments aſſigned them in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96486:29"/>
ſubſequent parts of the <hi>viſion</hi> which brings them upon the
<hi>ſcene</hi> one after another, the <hi>firſt Angel,</hi> ver. 7. the <hi>ſecond An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi>
ver. 8. and ſo to the <hi>ſeventh.</hi> Thirdly, by the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that is evidently made between thoſe <hi>ſeven Angels</hi> and
<hi>another Angel,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>And another came and ſtood at the Altar:</hi>
which makes it certaine that the former <hi>ſeven</hi> did not ſignifie
<hi>all the Angels,</hi> unleſſe after <hi>all,</hi> there could yet be <hi>one</hi> more.
Fourthly, from the mention of the <hi>ſeven Spirits,</hi> cap. 1. 4. which
are ſaid to be <hi>before Gods throne,</hi> that ſure is all one with
<hi>ſtanding before</hi> him here, and it being certaine that <hi>Angels</hi>
are <hi>Spirits,</hi> I have no reaſon to doubt but that theſe <hi>ſeven
Angels</hi> are thoſe <hi>ſeven ſpirits,</hi> and ſo ſtill a <hi>definite</hi> number
of <hi>ſeven,</hi> and no more. Fifthly, from the mention of the
<hi>ſeven Eyes, Zach.</hi> 4. 10. which ſeeme to be interpreted to

                  </p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> from the mention of the <hi>ſeven Lamps, Rev.</hi> 4. 5.

promiſcuouſly, and agreeably thoſe expreſſions, which are
uſed in the <hi>ſingular</hi> number, doe not all belong to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi>
but to the <hi>Church</hi> wherein he <hi>praeſides:</hi> But certainly this is
farre from inferring that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> are all one, or
that the word <hi>Angel</hi> ſignifies the <hi>collective</hi> body of the
<hi>Church,</hi> for, beſides that the <hi>Text</hi> is expreſſe in making a

the <hi>Angels</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> (and the <hi>Aſſemblers</hi> are here
forced to confeſſe that the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Candleſticks</hi> are not
the ſame) the confounding them will be as diſadvantageous
to them as to us, and I ſhall as regularly be able to conclude
that the word <hi>Angel</hi> ſignifies not the <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> but the
whole <hi>diffuſive</hi> body of the <hi>Church,</hi> as they can pretend to
doe upon their owne <hi>poſtulatum,</hi> that the <hi>Angel</hi> denotes not

weariſome a walke, to examine the ſeverall <hi>comments</hi> here
named (and but named) give him more ſhortly my <hi>conjecture</hi>
what truth may be in them.</p>
                  <p>4. Maſter <hi>Brightman,</hi> I know (and ſome others 'tis poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
may have interpreted the <hi>Angel</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>whole
College</hi> of <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and truly I ſhould much ſooner take up
an <hi>Interpretation</hi> upon the bare word of theſe <hi>Aſſemblers,</hi> than
I would upon no better evidence from M. <hi>Brightman;</hi> He was
<hi>one learned</hi> man, long knowne to be unkinde to our <hi>Pralates,</hi>
and here are many, for ought I know, as <hi>learned,</hi> though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame <hi>praejudices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Some others here cited, I cannot believe are brought to
teſtifie this, but onely that what is ſaid to the <hi>Angel</hi> in each
part of the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> was ſaid to the <hi>whole Church,</hi> and not
onely to the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> and if that be all they ſay, it is that which
we cannot doubt to affirme with them, and have oft confeſt
to underſtand <hi>Chriſt's Epiſtle</hi> ſo, without any incommodity
to our praetenſions.</p>
                  <p>6. If I miſtake in theſe <hi>conjectures,</hi> I deſire pardon, and ſhall
hope to give a better account, when I reade the <hi>teſtimonies</hi>
in the <hi>Authors</hi> from whence they are cited. For in theſe <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivations</hi>
of <hi>teſtimonies,</hi> the <hi>Aſſemblers</hi> citing them from
<hi>Smectymnuus, Smectymnuus</hi> from Maſter <hi>Foxe,</hi> Maſter <hi>Foxe</hi>
from <hi>Primaſius,</hi> &amp;c. there is great poſſibility of miſtake, and
therefore I ſhall follow the example before me, <hi>forbeare</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any more of this matter.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>In the next place they are pleaſed to take notice as of an</hi>
objection <hi>againſt their</hi> interpretation, <hi>that</hi> ſome Authors ſay,
<hi>Timothy</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> when our Saviour wrote this
Epiſtle, others that <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was Biſhop, others that <hi>Polycarp</hi>
was Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> at that time, and therefore theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
muſt needs be taken individually for ſo many ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>8. Of this <hi>Objection,</hi> which they have thus formed for us,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96486:31"/>
there is onely thus much of truth, that out of <hi>authentique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi>
we bring undeniable evidences for <hi>Timothies</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
by St. <hi>Paul</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for <hi>Oneſimus</hi> being
placed in that <hi>See</hi> at the time of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s writing to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
that <hi>Polycarpe</hi> was conſtituted <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Smyrna</hi> by
S. <hi>John,</hi> of all which we have ſpoken enough already.</p>
                  <p>9. But of all or any of theſe being <hi>Biſhops</hi> in thoſe <hi>Cities</hi>
at the very time of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> addreſſing this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the
<hi>Angels</hi> of each, this had no where been our affirmation, nor
would it have beene uſefull to us in any conſiderable degree,
if we had grounds poſitively to affirme it. All that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to us is this, that by the <hi>Antient</hi> Records, which evidence
them to have been ſo early <hi>Biſhops</hi> in two of thoſe <hi>Churches,</hi>
to which <hi>Chriſt's Epiſtle</hi> was ſent, and <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the notion
wherein we now uſe the word, we are ſecured of the truth
of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>collections,</hi> when from the mention of the <hi>ſeven Angels</hi> of
the 7. <hi>Churches,</hi> we aſſert the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> power in the hands
of a <hi>ſingle Biſhop</hi> in each <hi>Church</hi> to be owned and confirmed
by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> And ſuppoſing ſome other perſons, and none of
theſe three to have beene thoſe very <hi>numericall Angels</hi> to
whom thoſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> were written, this <hi>concluſion</hi> of ours
ſtands yet as firme, as if we could <hi>demonſtrate</hi> it of thoſe very
<hi>numericall</hi> perſons, there being no reaſon to doubt but the
ſame manner of <hi>Government</hi> continued all the <hi>Scripture</hi> times;
and to <hi>Timothies ſucceſſour</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus</hi>'s <hi>predeceſſor,</hi> being as
certainly <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as either <hi>Oneſimus</hi> or <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelfe;
when withall we have already produced mentions from the
<hi>Antients</hi> of the <hi>Catalogues</hi> of thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> which ſucce dede
<hi>Timothy</hi> in that <hi>See.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. Having thus ſet right the <hi>Objection</hi> for them, ſo as it is
owned by us to be an <hi>Objection</hi> againſt them, it will now ſoone
appeare what force there is in their <hi>anſwers</hi> to it, and thoſe are
three.</p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that they that ſay that <hi>Timothy</hi> was then Biſhop,
offer no little injury to him, for they thereby charge him to be
guilty of Apoſtacy, and of loſing his firſt love, and ſo out of a
blind zeale to Epiſcopacy they make that glorious Saint to ſtand
charged as an Apoſtate. The like injury is offered by Objections
to <hi>Oneſim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

12. But firſt you ſee whatever our <hi>opinion</hi> is expreſt to be
we have not <hi>affirmed</hi> either of theſe, as to the <hi>perſon</hi> either of
<hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> but left it uncertaine who the <hi>Angel</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was, whether either or neither of theſe,
but ſome <hi>ſucceſſor</hi> of the one, and <hi>predeceſſor</hi> of the other, and
ſo what charge ſoever falls on that <hi>Angel,</hi> it falls not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
on <hi>either</hi> of theſe.</p>
                  <p>13. Secondly it is already agreed betwixt the parties, affirmed
by them, and acknowledged by me, that the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt
to the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>diffuſive</hi> body,
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in it, were concerned in the <hi>contents</hi> of it; And
then whatſoever charge be found in the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> of how heavy
a nature ſoever, even of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> it ſelfe, yet there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
the <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſhould be <hi>perſonally</hi> guilty of it,
and ſo whoſoever the <hi>Biſhop</hi> was, though <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelfe,
our <hi>zeale</hi> to <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> hath not beene ſo <hi>blind</hi> or tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as to put us on any <hi>uncharitable cenſure,</hi> to affix any <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome</hi>
character upon ſo <hi>glorious</hi> a <hi>Saint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. Laſtly, to remove this anſwer yet one degree farther
from being ſatisfactory, it no where appeares that <hi>apoſtacy</hi>
is in that <hi>Epiſtle</hi> laid to the charge, whether of the <hi>Church</hi>
or <hi>Angel;</hi> The firſt part is all in <hi>commendati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſuggeſted) <hi>loſing</hi> their <hi>firſt love,</hi> but <hi>remitting</hi> it; Their <hi>love</hi>
to <hi>Chriſt</hi> had formerly been <hi>ſtrong as death,</hi> pure and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuch as had <hi>caſt out</hi> all <hi>feare</hi> of dangers, and evidenced
it ſelfe in couragious <hi>confeſſion,</hi> but now, though it were not

                  <p>2. To this I reply, 1. That <hi>Timothies</hi> being an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi>
no way prejudgeth his being a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

and <hi>governe</hi> a <hi>Church</hi> already planted. And what hinders
but that he that hath beene employed in the former capacity
to <hi>plant,</hi> may elſewhere or in the ſame place be appointed to
<hi>Governe,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> be a <hi>Biſhop?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Whatſoever <hi>Objections</hi> can be brought againſt this, I
ſhall not doubt will be eaſily <hi>anſwered,</hi> but there is no offer of
any here, and therefore it will not be pertinent farther to treat
it in this place.</p>
                  <p>4. Secondly, it muſt againe be remembred, that what is
here ſaid of <hi>Timothy</hi> is proper to his <hi>perſon,</hi> both from <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus</hi>
and <hi>Polycarpe,</hi> and all other <hi>Angels,</hi> whether ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Timothy</hi> in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or <hi>praeſiding</hi> in the other 7. <hi>Aſian

were rendred uncapable (which yet he was not) of
being the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in our ſenſe, yet thoſe other <hi>ſeven

                  <p>5. Thirdly, I ſhall demand upon the <hi>Aſſemblers</hi> principles,
who allow a <hi>Primus Presbyter,</hi> a <hi>Prolocutor</hi> in their <hi>conſistory</hi>

                     <hi>that</hi> it will
not follow becauſe <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in
St. <hi>John's</hi> dayes, that therefore he was the onely perſon to whom
Chriſt wrote his Epiſtle; For St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us there were many
Biſhops at <hi>Epheſus</hi> (beſides the ſuppoſed <hi>Oneſimus</hi>) and Chriſt
may very well write to him, and to all the reſt as well as him.
The like may be ſaid concerning <hi>Polycarpe,</hi> for our Saviour
speakes to the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> in the plurall
number, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. And therefore hee may truly be ſaid to
write to all the other <hi>Angels</hi> that were at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> as well as
to one.</p>
                  <p>2. Here is nothing in this branch but what hath beene
diſtinctly foreſtall'd, and ſpoken to largely already, it will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
that we repeat the heads, and leave the Reader to view
the places, where they are more explicitly handled. And 1.
though St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould tell us that there were <hi>many Biſhops</hi> at
<hi>Epheſus,</hi> as there might be from other <hi>Cities</hi> occaſionally met
there, yet it would not follow that there were more than one
<hi>Biſhop</hi> of that <hi>City,</hi> or conſequently that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a peculiar
addreſſe to the <hi>Angel</hi> of that <hi>City</hi> could write to more <hi>Biſhops</hi>
there.</p>
                  <p>3. But then ſecondly, the whole truth is this, that S. <hi>Luke</hi>
(and not St <hi>Paul</hi>) tells, that upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſummons ſent to
<hi>Epheſus,</hi> many <hi>Biſhops</hi> met him at <hi>Miletus; Epheſus</hi> being

certainly neither can nor ought to be from hence concluded. Nay,
not ſo much as the Office of a perpetuall Preſident ſhould be of
neceſſity as the thence ariſing Oligarchical tyranny (whoſe head
is the Antichriſtian beaſt) now at length with the moſt certaine

By which quotation it is evident, that though <hi>Beza</hi> held

                  <p>2. To this I reply, 1. that Mr. <hi>Beza's</hi> interpretation, as

The truth of it, as farre as any <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> perſon I know,

of the <hi>ſeven Aſian Churches,</hi> that they were <hi>Biſhops,</hi> which is

and that very pertinent to be urged in this matter of the <hi>Aſian

it as an <hi>Objection</hi> of ours againſt the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> having no

                  <p>7. And for the <hi>Argument</hi> to make it <hi>improbable,</hi> drawn
from the <hi>ſituation</hi> of the <hi>Cities,</hi> that is as <hi>infirme;</hi> for this,
as all other controverſies of <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>fact,</hi> muſt be waged
by <hi>authorities</hi> of thoſe which were likely to <hi>know</hi> the truth,
and to teſtifie aright, and to thoſe we have all reaſon to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here,</hi>
and not to be moved by <hi>arguments</hi> that ſeeme probable
to thoſe that live 1600. yeares after, and are not perhaps ſo
perfect <hi>Masters</hi> of the <hi>Geographie</hi> of the place as duly
to be able to judge even what is in that reſpect moſt <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Nay for the diſtances of theſe <hi>Cities,</hi> though I have not
now Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> by me, yet my notes out of him tell me,
that in his ſcale of <hi>furlongs, Pergamus</hi> was diſtant from <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
540. furlongs, <hi>i. e.</hi> about 68. <hi>Engliſh miles,</hi> and <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
from <hi>Smyrna</hi> 320. i. e. about 40. miles, and <hi>Thyatira</hi> from
<hi>Pergamus 80. Engliſh</hi> miles, which is a diſtance very recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
with their being <hi>Metropoles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. <hi>But they are content to</hi> ſuppoſe <hi>this was true, and then
have</hi> anſwers <hi>ready another way,</hi> 1. That it is no good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the greatneſſe of the <hi>Cities</hi> to inferre the greatneſſe of
the <hi>Churches,</hi> for though the <hi>Cities</hi> were great, yet the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
were but ſmall, and the number of believers very few in
compariſon of the reſt of the people.</p>
                  <p>10. To this I reply, 1. by <hi>conceſſion,</hi> that in all places and
times the greatneſſe of the <hi>Church</hi> cannot abſolutely be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> becauſe it is poſſible
that a <hi>great City</hi> may have utterly <hi>reſiſted</hi> the <hi>faith,</hi> and a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96486:37"/>
                     <hi>leſſer</hi> City <hi>received</hi> it; or againe a <hi>greater City,</hi> that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the <hi>Faith</hi> in ſome of the Members, may yet have <hi>fewer</hi>
believers in it, than another City, which is not ſo great. This
therefore is not our way of concluding, from the bare <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
of the <hi>Cities,</hi> to infer the great number of <hi>believers</hi> in
them.</p>
                  <p>11. Our way of <hi>concluding</hi> is this; <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpent <hi>three
yeares, Act.</hi> 20. 31. in this <hi>Lydian</hi> or <hi>Proconſular Aſia,</hi> ver. 18.
In this time he had purſued his worke very <hi>diligently</hi> and
<hi>zealouſly,</hi> not <hi>ceaſing to warne every one night and day with
teares,</hi> and herein his <hi>harvest</hi> was proportionable to his <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;</hi>
After <hi>two years</hi> ſpace and upwards ſpent at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> it
is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. that by the continuance of his <hi>preaching</hi> and
gathering <hi>Diſciples, all they that dwelt in</hi> Aſia, <hi>heard the
word of the Lord both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Greeks, and though many
were <hi>hardned</hi> and <hi>believed not,</hi> and <hi>spake evil of that way,</hi>
ver. 9. yet ver. 17. by ſome <hi>extraordinary</hi> workes of his, which
were made <hi>knowne to all the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Greeks <hi>dwelling at</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,
<hi>feare fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jeſus
was magnified,</hi> a converſion in a manner <hi>general,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it followes, <hi>and many that believed</hi>—ver. 18. and <hi>ſo
mightily grew the word of God and prevailed,</hi> ver. 20. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe ſpeaking of theſe ſucceſſes, calls it a
<hi>great dore and an effectual, 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 9. which at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> v. 8.
was <hi>opened</hi> unto him.</p>
                  <p>12. From hence we conclude, and ſure ſafely may, 1. that in
<hi>Aſia</hi> generally, and eſpecially in <hi>Epheſus</hi> there was a great
number of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> before this time of <hi>Christs Epistle,</hi>
(which is not a concluding it barely from the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of
that or any other <hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi>) Secondly from hence, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with <hi>Epheſus</hi>'s being in the <hi>ſecular account</hi> (the
<hi>Notitiae Imperiales</hi>) a <hi>Metropolis,</hi> where the <hi>Aſſizes</hi> were
kept, we conclude that <hi>Epheſus</hi> was in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> account
alſo a <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and the <hi>chiefe</hi> of all <hi>Aſia;</hi> and this I
hope is not ſo <hi>improbable</hi> infirme a way of <hi>concluding,</hi> as the
other impoſed on us ſeemed to be.</p>
                  <p>13. Thirdly, from hence, and from other exemplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it (as that <hi>Trallis</hi> and <hi>Magneſia,</hi> which appeare to be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96486:38"/>
under the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> are by <hi>Ignatius</hi> written to as
all <hi>Epiſcopal Sees,</hi> in our preſent notion of the word <hi>Biſhop</hi>)
we conclude that <hi>other</hi> Cities of <hi>Aſia</hi> beſide theſe <hi>ſeven,</hi> had
received the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith, and were certainely taken care
for by <hi>Paul,</hi> which had planted it among them, and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
had <hi>Rulers</hi> ſetled in them, i. e. <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſubordinate to the
<hi>Metropolitans.</hi> And all theſe inferences I doubt not will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
regular enough, and I ſhould farther <hi>enlarge</hi> on them,
if there were any thing in the <hi>anſwer,</hi> which could render
it <hi>needful</hi> or <hi>ſeaſonable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. As for the <hi>paucity</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in thoſe times in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon</hi>
of the reſt of the people, that cannot be pertinently
oppoſed to our pretenſions, becauſe ſtill the number of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
in a <hi>great</hi> City might beare the ſame <hi>proportion</hi> to the
number of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>ſmaller</hi> Cities, that the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
in the one did to the <hi>people</hi> in the other, <hi>one thouſand</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſame <hi>proportion</hi> to <hi>one hundred,</hi> that an <hi>hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi>
doth to <hi>ten thouſand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. And it being the affirmation of <hi>Clemens,</hi> that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi>
in <hi>each City,</hi> where they received any <hi>proſelytes,</hi> though
never ſo <hi>few,</hi> before their parting conſtituted a <hi>Biſhop</hi> (with
his <hi>Deacon</hi>) who was to be <hi>governor</hi>

                     </gap>,
<hi>of thoſe that ſhould after believe,</hi> it followes unqueſtionably
from thence, that in the <hi>Cities</hi> which had but <hi>few Chriſtians,
Biſhops</hi> might be and were <hi>conſtituted,</hi> and thoſe very regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
depending on the <hi>greater</hi> (their <hi>Metropolitical</hi>) Cities,
from whence the <hi>faith</hi> was derived to them, (as from <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
where <hi>Paul</hi> chiefly reſided, to the Cities about it) and all
this without any need of <hi>ballancing</hi> the <hi>parties,</hi> or conſidering
what <hi>compariſon</hi> the number of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in one, or the
other, bore to the number of the <hi>unbelievers</hi> in either <hi>City.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Numb. 1."/> we doe not believe that ever it can
be proved that the Apoſtles did modell the Government of
the Church, according to the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtate.
This was the after policy of Chriſtian Emperours and Biſhops,
but no part of Apoſtolicall policy; And therefore it doth not
follow, that becauſe there were divers Cities under the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe 7. Cities, that therefore there ſhould be divers Churches
ſubordinate to the 7. <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches.</p>
                  <p>2. That the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which deſigned to plant a <hi>Church</hi> in
the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, ſhould doe it in that manner as would
be moſt <hi>advantagious</hi> to their <hi>end,</hi> will not I hope be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>ſtrange.</hi> This generally was by betaking themſelves to the
<hi>Cities,</hi> rather than the <hi>villages,</hi> and firſt to the <hi>greater Cities,</hi>
unto which was the moſt <hi>frequent reſort,</hi> that by that meanes
the <hi>faith</hi> might be moſt <hi>compendiouſly</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſefully</hi> propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.
If a <hi>greater City</hi> reſiſted their <hi>preaching,</hi> or fewer
<hi>Saints</hi> were gathered there, I do not then pretend to prove,
or to believe that that was conſtituted a <hi>Metropolitan Church</hi>
with <hi>ſuperiority</hi> over others of greater <hi>antiquity,</hi> or larger
<hi>growth</hi> in the <hi>faith</hi> whatſoever the <hi>dignity</hi> of it were in the

but on the other ſide that all ſhould remaine as it did
(in that reſpect) before the coming of <hi>Chriſtianity?</hi> And
therefore ſuppoſing 1. That this <hi>Nation</hi> were governed by
a <hi>King</hi> of its own; is it not certain that this <hi>nationall Church</hi>
ſhould follow the boundaries of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and ſo be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deld
according to the <hi>government</hi> of the (formerly <hi>Heathen</hi>)

<hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. with <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5.) that a <hi>Biſhop</hi> were conſtituted in

with <hi>heatheniſme,</hi> or <hi>conformity</hi> with the <hi>World,</hi> nay, though

of theſe <hi>diſtributions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. But then ſecondly, it is already cleared in the <hi>Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
that this <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> diviſion of <hi>Cities</hi> into <hi>Mothers</hi>

cannot be proved.</hi> Nay, although ſome <hi>inconvenience</hi> were
producible, which would preſſe our <hi>aſſertion</hi> yet the old rule
would require it's place, <hi>incommodum non ſolvit argumentum,</hi>
the mention of an <hi>inconvenience</hi> inſuing, doth not take off the
force of an <hi>argument.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. But we need not that warineſſe here; the reaſon which
is here annext to prove that <hi>it cannot be proved,</hi> is of no force
againſt us, For 1. as Congregations and Pariſhes are <hi>ſynoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>
in their ſtyle, ſo I yeild that Believers in great Cities
were not at firſt divided into Pariſhes, while the number of
the Chriſtians in a City was ſo ſmall, that they might well
<hi>aſſemble</hi> in the <hi>ſame place,</hi> and ſo needed no <hi>partitions</hi> or
diviſions.</p>
                  <p>5. But what diſadvantage is this to us, who affirme that
one <hi>Biſhop,</hi> not a College of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> preſided in this one
Congregation, and that the Believers in the Region and
Villages about, did belong to the care of that <hi>ſingle-Biſhop</hi> of
the <hi>City-church?</hi> May not theſe be ruled by a <hi>Biſhop</hi> as well
before, as after the diviſion into Pariſhes? Or is this diviſion
more neceſſary to the <hi>Government</hi> by one <hi>Biſhop</hi> in each City,
than to the Government of more <hi>Preſbyters</hi> in every City?
In all reaſon the diviſion of this one into ſeverall Pariſhes
ſhould make <hi>Preſbyters</hi> more neceſſary after than before ſuch
diviſion, that each Pariſh might have one <hi>Presbyter,</hi> to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96486:43"/>
among them in things of daily uſe; and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
I ſuppoſe it was, that when the number of Believers
was ſo farre increaſed, that all the Chriſtians of a City could
not meet commodiouſly in one place, and when the Regions
and Villages ſo abounded with <hi>Proſelytes</hi> that in reſpect of
them alſo it was neceſſary, then the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of each City
thought fit to conſt tute <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in our moderne notion
of them, many in every City, and many in every Region, one
in every Village, though as yet the word Pariſh, in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
ſenſe, was not come into the World.</p>
                  <p>6. And ſo this is farre from being <hi>Argumentative</hi> againſt
us, it is rather uſefull to confirme what is aſſerted by us, that
it is againſt the whole <hi>Scheme</hi> which the Scriptures or firſt
writers give us of Churches, to imagine that in every City
there was by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> a <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi> conſtituted,
when as they agree to aſſure us a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and his <hi>Deacon</hi> were
ſufficient at the firſt (ſo thin) Plantations.</p>
                  <p>7. So againe when they take it for granted that Pariſhes
were <hi>not united into Dioceſes till 260. yeares after Chriſt;</hi> I
ſhall aske 1. whether they were ſooner <hi>divided</hi> into <hi>Claſſes,</hi>
&amp;c. and if not, what they have gained to their <hi>Jus Divinum</hi>
by this obſervation?</p>
                  <p>8. But then ſecondly, 'tis cleare that there might be <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes</hi>
before this diviſion into <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> in our moderne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
For what is a <hi>Dioceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> but a <hi>Church</hi> in a <hi>City</hi> with the
<hi>Suburbs</hi> and <hi>Territorie</hi> or <hi>Region</hi> belonging to it? And this
certainly might be, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emaine under the <hi>Government</hi> of a
<hi>ſingle Biſhop,</hi> as well <hi>before,</hi> as <hi>after</hi> any more minute diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
into ſuch, as we now call <hi>Pariſhes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. For it is one thing for the <hi>Church</hi> of this City to be
divided from the <hi>Church</hi> of every other City, another thing
for the ſame <hi>Church</hi> to be divided into <hi>many Aſſembles;</hi>
The firſt is it which is required for the ſetting up of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and of any ſuch <hi>Church</hi> ſo bounded there may be a

                  </p>
                  <p>10. And therefore when they adde, that <hi>there could not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96486:44"/>
be</hi> Dioceſan Churches <hi>and</hi> Biſhops <hi>formerly ſo called in the</hi>
Apoſtles <hi>dayes,</hi> unleſſe they have ſome little <hi>aequivocation</hi> in
the word <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> It is moſt certaine they have no reaſon
on which to found their <hi>confidence,</hi> For that there was a <hi>Church</hi>
in each City, and it's <hi>territory</hi> (howſoever <hi>governed</hi> by <hi>one</hi> or
<hi>more</hi>) is moſt certaine, and equally affirmed by them and us,
and equally their intereſt and ours, that it be affirmed. As
for the uſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">

about <hi>words,</hi> when the matter is ſufficiently agreed on among
us, and the words ſufficiently explained to expreſſe that
matter.</p>
                  <p>11. And therefore when they adde theſe <hi>Angels</hi> were <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall,</hi>
not <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> the reply is obvious, they were
every of them <hi>Angels</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> in a <hi>City,</hi> having <hi>authority</hi>
over the <hi>Region</hi> adjacent, and pertaining to that <hi>City,</hi> and ſo
as <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Congregation</hi> are all one (as in ordinary uſe
in all languages they are) they were <hi>Congregationall</hi> and
<hi>Dioceſan</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>12. What followes of the <hi>paucity</hi> of <hi>believers</hi> in the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi>
Cities, and their <hi>meeting in one place,</hi> as alſo of a <hi>Church</hi>
and City being all one, is willingly granted by us, and hath not
the leaſt appearance of being <hi>uſefull</hi> to their pretentions, or
<hi>hurtfull</hi> to ours, and therefore I have no temptation to make
any the leſt <hi>Reply</hi> to it.</p>
                  <p>13. That which next followes, though it concerne us not to
<hi>examine</hi> it, our intereſt being equally ſecured, be it true or falſe,
yet I cannot but take ſome notice of it in paſſing, becauſe it
is a little <hi>extraordinary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. Afterwards, <hi>ſay they,</hi> we conceive that believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo numerous in theſe great <hi>Cities,</hi> as that they could
not conveniently meet in one place; Thus it was in the Church
of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 2. 41. and 4. 4. and 5. 14. and thus poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
it might be in moſt of theſe <hi>Aſian Churches</hi> in St. <hi>John's</hi>
time.</p>
                  <p>15. Here certainly the word <hi>[Afterwards]</hi> is relative, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96486:44"/>
referrs to the <hi>Antecedent</hi> in the former Paragraph, and that
is, <hi>[In the beginning of Chriſtianity]</hi> Hereupon I demand,
what time is that which they call <hi>[the beginning of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity?]</hi>
Is it that wherein Chriſt continued on the Earth?
If ſo, they will eaſily believe us, that we doe not think, that
<hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops were placed in the Church, within that
<hi>period</hi> If it be the time immediately following the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when the Apoſtles began to preach and
propagate the Faith, then how come they to divide that time,
which is ſpoken of <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. from that time of the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> by this word <hi>[Afterward]</hi> for tis certain
what is there ſtoried of the 3000. Converts, is the effect of
the <hi>firſt Sermon</hi> preached by any of the Apoſtles immediately
upon the deſcent of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> upon them, and the <hi>gift
of Tongues,</hi> the wonderment whereof brought thoſe ſo many
Auditors together.</p>
                  <p>16. So ſecondly when they ſay of this point of time, <hi>Act.</hi>

of that Church, ſo it matters not much at what <hi>point</hi> of time
that was done, whether at the very <hi>beginning</hi> or <hi>afterwards,</hi>
much leſſe how ſoone it was that that Church was diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
into ſeverall divided <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> the Creation of the
<hi>Biſhop</hi> not at all depending on that, as hath formerly been
ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>17. Hence will it appeare to how very little purpoſe are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96486:45"/>
thoſe <hi>cautions</hi> added, and <hi>obſervations</hi> made in the remaining
part of this ſixt Chapter.</p>
                  <p>18. Thus, <hi>ſay they,</hi> poſſibly it might be (<hi>i.e. the</hi> believers <hi>be
ſo</hi> numerous <hi>in great</hi> Cities, <hi>that they could not</hi> conveniently
meet in one place) in moſt of theſe <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches in St. <hi>John's</hi>
time. But yet notwithstanding all this, there are three things
diligently to be obſerved; Firſt, that theſe meeting places were
frequented promiſcuouſly and indiſtinctly, and that believers were
not divided into ſet and fixed Churches or Congregations in the
Apoſtles dayes.</p>
                  <p>19. But firſt I demand, Is there any truth in this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
was not the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Apoſtles dayes
a ſet and fixed Church, ſo as to be perfectly ſevered from
the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Epheſus?</hi> Was not <hi>James</hi>
the Brother of the Lord <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the one, and not of the
other?</p>
                  <p>20. Secondly, why was this for the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> intereſt to
be ſo <hi>diligently obſerved?</hi> If one of theſe Churches were not
thus <hi>divided</hi> and ſevered from others, how could it be <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
by a <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> as they pretend it was? Muſt it not be a
<hi>determinate fixed</hi> body that is governed by any, whether <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>
or <hi>Presbyters?</hi> I profeſſe not to be able to diſcerne by my
moſt <hi>diligent obſervation,</hi> why this was ſo neceſſary to be ſo
<hi>diligently obſerved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. Secondly, (ſay they, it muſt be as <hi>diligently obſerved)
that notwithſtanding theſe different meeting places, yet the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
of one</hi> City <hi>made but one</hi> Church <hi>in the Apoſtles dayes,
as is evident in the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which is called a</hi>
Church <hi>not</hi> Churches, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 1. &amp; 15. 6. &amp; 22. 16. <hi>And ſo likewiſe
it is called the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Epheſus, <hi>and the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Thyatira,
<hi>&amp;c. not</hi> Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. This <hi>Obſervation</hi> I acknowledge to have perfect <hi>truth</hi>
in it, and not to be confutable in any part (ſave onely that
the two latter <hi>Texts</hi> are certainly <hi>miſquoted,</hi> and not rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Errata</hi>) and therefore inſtead of rejecting, I ſhall
imbrace it, and from thence <hi>conclude,</hi> that there is no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>incongruity</hi> in aſſigning of one <hi>Biſhop</hi> to one <hi>Church,</hi>
and ſo one <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe it is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96486:45"/>
a <hi>Church</hi> not <hi>Churches,</hi> being forced to acknowledge that
where there were <hi>more Churches</hi> there were <hi>more Biſhops,</hi> and
ſo likewiſe <hi>one Angel</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> &amp;c. This
I ſuppoſe was not the thing they meant to inferre from hence,
nor indeed doe I conceive it neceſſarily inferred from (onely
very agreeable to) the <hi>oneneſſe</hi> of each <hi>Church,</hi> without other
<hi>arguments</hi> to joyne with it. But I am ſtill to ſeek, and emand
what advantage accrues to their cauſe, or diſadvantage to ours
by this <hi>obſervation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>23. But then thirdly they adde, that <hi>this</hi> Church <hi>in the</hi>
City <hi>was governed in the Apoſtles dayes by the common councell
of</hi> Presbyters <hi>or</hi> Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>24. This indeed were worth their <hi>diligent obſerving,</hi> if it
could be deſcried, and would abundantly recompence them
for the no-profit their <hi>two</hi> former <hi>obſervations</hi> brought
them in, if it could be obtained by all their <hi>diligence.</hi> But
this being the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the <hi>onely</hi> thing in <hi>queſtion</hi> betwixt
us, whether the <hi>Church</hi> in each <hi>City</hi> was in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>

<hi>Biſhops,</hi> or by one <hi>ſingle Biſhop,</hi> called ſometimes <gap reason="foreign">

being the onely <hi>queſtion</hi> in debate betweene us, it muſt not
be any farther yeilded to them, than their <hi>proofes</hi> and eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will enforce it; And theſe of what virtue they are, muſt
now appeare by the <hi>view</hi> of them. And the firſt they produce
is this.</p>
                  <p>25. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> went about ordeining <hi>Presbyters</hi> in every
<hi>Church,</hi> Act. 14. 23.</p>
                  <p>26. But ſurely this is an <hi>infirme</hi> argument. <hi>Every Church</hi>
ſignifies without queſtion <hi>more Churches</hi> than one, <hi>viz. Derbe,
Lyſtra, Iconium, Antioch, v.</hi> 20. 21. And if in <hi>each</hi> of thoſe

                     <hi>Elders</hi> in the <hi>plurall,</hi> viz. <hi>foure Elders</hi> in thoſe

                     </gap> is in the <hi>ſingular
number,</hi> they therefore thinke that thoſe <hi>plurall Elders</hi> muſt
be <hi>ordeined</hi> in <hi>each</hi> of thoſe <hi>Churches.</hi> This is too groſſe a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96486:46"/>
miſtake for <hi>Scholers</hi> to be guilty of, it being certaine that that
is not the <hi>importance</hi> of the phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, any
more than of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> [<hi>Church by Church</hi>] or [<hi>in

<hi>one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27. <hi>Their next</hi> proofe <hi>is from</hi> Act. 20. 17. <hi>Paul</hi> called for
the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> (one of theſe ſeven
Churches) and calls them Biſhops, and commits the whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church to them; The like may be ſaid of the
other ſix <hi>Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. What may be ſaid of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> I grant may be ſaid of
the <hi>other ſix Churches,</hi> but the <hi>Text</hi> no where affirmes it of
<hi>Epheſus,</hi> and ſo the <hi>analogy</hi> will no way prove it of the <hi>rest.</hi>
All that the <hi>Text</hi> ſaith, is this, <hi>And from</hi> Miletus he ſent to

                  </p>
                  <p>39. Yet becauſe in the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> where this place of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96486:48"/>
the Acts is viewed againe, one argument I ſee produced in
favour of their <hi>pretenſions,</hi> which they found in an <hi>obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of mine, I ſhall thinke my ſelfe concern'd to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it.</p>
                  <p>40. <hi>It is this, Pag.</hi> 85. If the Apoſtle by the Elders of the
Church had meant the Biſhops of the Church of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> he
would have ſaid, not the Elders of the Church, but of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
It is an obſervation made uſe of by one of thoſe that
makes uſe of this anſwer we are now confuting, That when
the Scripture speakes of Churches in Cities it alwayes uſeth
the ſingular number, as the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Church
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. but when it speakes of provinces where there
are many Cities, then it uſes the plurall number, as the
Churches of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> Rev. 1. 11. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this obſervation, if the Apoſtle had meant of the
Biſhops of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> he would have ſaid the Elders of the
Churches, whereas he calls them Elders of the Church, v. 17. and
ſo muſt meane the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and ſo meere
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> not <hi>Biſhops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>41. But herein is a manifeſt <hi>miſtake;</hi> For the <hi>obſervation</hi> is
not made as is here ſuggeſted, of Churches in Cities and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
that the former of them are <hi>conſtantly</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
where there is mention of a Church in the <hi>ſingular</hi>
number (without any name of <hi>particular</hi> City added to it) and
that when a Province is mention'd, 'tis alwayes done by
Churches in the <hi>plurall</hi> number; This is the ſenſe on which
their <hi>argument</hi> is founded. But if the <hi>Reader</hi> conſult the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertations</hi>
p. 190. He ſhall finde there is no ſuch thing, 'tis
onely this, That in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> there is mention made
of Churches in the <hi>plurall</hi> number, the Churches of <hi>Judaea,</hi> of
<hi>Samaria,</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> whereas in other places there was as frequent
mention of a Church in the <hi>ſingular,</hi> the Church in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
in <hi>Antioch,</hi> in <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> in <hi>Corinth,</hi> of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> of <hi>Sardis,</hi> of
<hi>Laodicaea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>42. The cauſe of that difference is there ſaid to be this,
that <hi>Judaea,</hi> &amp;c, was the name of a Province, in which there
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96486:48"/>
being many Cities, there were conſequently many Churches
and Biſhops in them, whereas one City with the <hi>territory</hi>
adjoyning to it being ruled by one <hi>ſingle Biſhop,</hi> was to be
called a <hi>ſingular Church,</hi> and therefore that which is ſaid to be
done in <hi>every Church,</hi> Acts 14. 13. is ſaid to be done in <hi>every</hi>
City. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. The ſum of which obſervation is onely this, that
one City, with the <hi>territory</hi> adjoyning to it never makes above
one Church in the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſtyle, whereas a <hi>Province</hi> or <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
or <hi>Nation</hi> conſiſts of <hi>many Cities,</hi> and ſo of many Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopall
<hi>Sees</hi> or Churches.</p>
                  <p>43. This was all that was ſaid in that place, or that was
uſefull to be ſaid in order to the end (to ſhew the <hi>Originall</hi>
of <hi>Metropolitanes</hi>) there. And what a wreſting of a plaine
obvious obſervation is it, to conclude it from hence to be my
<hi>aſſertion,</hi> that <hi>when</hi> (that muſt be, <hi>whenſoever,</hi> or elſe the
<hi>concluſion</hi> cannot be deducible from it) <hi>the Scripture ſpeakes
of a Province, it is in the plurall number?</hi> It doth ſometimes
do ſo, and that was all that was uſefull to me. If it had done
ſo but once, though twenty times it had done the contrary,
it had been ſufficient (for ſome reaſonable account there
muſt be for the doing it <hi>once,</hi> and what could that be, but
the <hi>number</hi> of the Cities and ſo of Churches in each <hi>Province</hi>
or <hi>Nation</hi>) much more when there were ſo <hi>many</hi> examples
of it.</p>
                  <p>44. But this is not to <hi>affirme</hi> that it alwayes doth ſo, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when being left at large without any reſtraint, not
the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or the like, but <hi>indofini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ely</hi> the Church,
it is very capable of another <hi>interpretation.</hi> For ſure when I
wrote that, I had not forgotten my <hi>Creede,</hi> or in it the name
<hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>ſingular</hi> number, which by the adjunct of
<hi>Catholike</hi> muſt needs be more than the <hi>Church</hi> of one <hi>City.</hi>
And having read <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. where the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
is called <hi>my Church</hi> in the <hi>ſingular,</hi> a like phraſe to that of

<hi>It is manifeſt that</hi> Timothy <hi>had a

<hi>Iſland</hi> with an <hi>hundred</hi> Cities in it (in each of which <hi>Titus</hi>

<hi>the Church of Crete,</hi> and the <hi>ſubſcription</hi> never
queſtioned upon that ſcore by any, that it ſpake <hi>improperly</hi>
herein.</p>
                  <p>46. And conſequently there can be no harſhneſſe in this
interpretation, Paul <hi>ſent to</hi> Epheſus <hi>and call'd the Elders of
the Church</hi> to come to him to <hi>Miletus,</hi> and in his <hi>Oration</hi>
addreſt to them called them <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the <hi>flock</hi> and of the
<hi>Church of God,</hi> meaning them <hi>ſingular praefects</hi> of ſeverall
Cities of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> eſpecially of thoſe which
were neereſt <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the chiefe <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the whole

                  <p>47. And ſo much in anſwer to that Objection, in defence
of their argument from the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as they call
them.</p>
                  <p>48. <hi>Another</hi> proofe <hi>of the ſame is there added</hi> Pag. 85.
<hi>Thus,</hi> The Syriack tranſlation reads it, he ſent to <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:96486:49"/>

                  <p>49. What authority St <hi>Hierome</hi>'s teſtimony is to carry with
us in this matter, hath been elſewhere largely ſhewed, and
we may hereafter have farther occaſion to declare it, and
our <hi>reaſons</hi> of it. At the preſent it is willingly confeſt that
St. <hi>Hierome</hi> on <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. doth indeavour to prove that in
<hi>Scripture, Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> is the ſame, and from him
<hi>Iſidore Hispalenſis de officiis Eccl.</hi> l. 2. hath the ſame, and
both have according to that <hi>prolepſis</hi> changed the words of
the <hi>Text</hi> in the Acts, and inſtead of what there we reade,
<hi>ſent to</hi> Epheſus <hi>and called the</hi> Elders <hi>of the Church, they</hi> read,
<hi>ſent to</hi> Epheſus <hi>and called the</hi> Elders <hi>of the ſame Church,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing

the <hi>councell</hi> of <hi>Aken (Aquiſgranenſe</hi>) having tranſcribed
<hi>nine Chapters</hi> from <hi>Iſidore verbatim,</hi> conſequently doe the
like. So that the authority of <hi>Iſidore</hi> and that <hi>councell</hi> being
as great as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> can make it, from whom evidently it
proceeds, may yet be allowed to yeild to the farre greater
authority of <hi>Polycarp</hi>'s <hi>auditor Irenaeus,</hi> who hath ſufficiently
cleared it to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>50. As for the <hi>Syriack</hi> tanſlation, it is not here recited
exactly accordingly to the truth, For in that, thus the words lie:

                     <hi>And from</hi> Miletus <hi>he ſent and called for the</hi> Elders
<hi>of the Church of</hi> Epheſus, where is but <hi>one</hi> mention of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi>
not <hi>two,</hi> as is here ſuggeſted from the <hi>tranſlation,</hi> that
it reades, <hi>he ſent to</hi> Epheſus <hi>and called the</hi> Elders <hi>of the
Church of Epheſus.</hi> The ſhort of it is, <hi>Epheſus</hi> being but

and this being the <hi>Originall</hi> muſt certainly over-rule all
<hi>tranſlations,</hi> and accordingly all <hi>tranſlations</hi> but one to read
it, onely the <hi>Syriack</hi> hath miſ-placed the word <hi>Epheſus,</hi> put
it in the <hi>later</hi> part of the period, quite againſt all <hi>Syntaxis,</hi>
and for doing ſo, are here cited, and their <hi>teſtimony</hi> made

                     <hi>Originall,</hi> and by all other <hi>tranſlations</hi> acknowledged, would not
allow them any the leaſt <hi>advantage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>51. After they had produced theſe two arguments, to prove
that the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> was <hi>governed</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
days by a <hi>Common-councell</hi> of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> the Reader would
hardly expect that which now next followes in theſe
words.</p>
                  <p>From all this we gather, that the <hi>Aſian</hi> Angels were not Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Biſhops, but congregationall <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ſeated each of them
in one Church, not any of them in more than one.</p>
                  <p>52. This <hi>concluſion,</hi> as the words lie, conſiſts of two parts,
1. That <hi>each</hi> of theſe <hi>Aſian Angels,</hi> under the title of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall
Presbyters,</hi> was <hi>ſeated in one Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> This, if it
were meant, as the words ſound, were the granting to us all
that we contend, and would hardly be reconciled with the
<hi>third obſervation,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> was governed
by the <hi>common councell</hi> of <hi>Presbyters;</hi> For ſure <hi>each</hi> of thoſe
<hi>Presbyters</hi> is not a <hi>common councell;</hi> But I rather believe
they have not ſo ſoone diſclaimed their <hi>praemiſſes,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that it is more reaſonable to interpret their <hi>words</hi> by
their <hi>principles,</hi> than their <hi>meaning</hi> by their <hi>words,</hi> and ſo
that by <hi>congregationall Presbyters</hi> they meant ſo many <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges</hi>
of ſuch <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ſeated <hi>each</hi> of them, <hi>i. e.</hi> each of thoſe
<hi>Colleges</hi> in <hi>one Church;</hi> And if that be their <hi>concluſion,</hi> I
muſt acknowledge it to accord perfectly with their <hi>praemiſſes,</hi>
which being already <hi>anſwered,</hi> there remaines no force in the
<hi>concluſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>53. And for the ſecond part, that <hi>not any of them was ſeated
in more than one,</hi> underſtanding it againe as the words ſound,
it is no way <hi>contrary</hi> to our <hi>pretenſions,</hi> for we doe not thinke
that the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was ſeated in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> or in any
<hi>Church</hi> but that of <hi>Epheſios,</hi> and the <hi>territory</hi> thereof; and
although as that was a <hi>Metropolis,</hi> other <hi>Cities</hi> were under
it, and ſo other <hi>Biſhops ſubordinate</hi> to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
yet was not any other <hi>City</hi> the <hi>Seat</hi> of that <hi>Metropolitane,</hi>
but onely <hi>Epheſus,</hi> whereof he takes his denomination, as
although <hi>Rocheſter</hi> be under the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
yet the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is not ſeated at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:96486:50"/>
but ſome other <hi>Biſhop</hi> affixt to that <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Dioceſe.</hi> As for
any other meaning of it, proportionable to that which we
were faine to affixe to the former, I confeſſe my ſelfe ignorant
what it can tend to, For it is as if they ſhould ſay, not any
<hi>councell</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi> was ſeated in more <hi>Churches</hi> than one.
Which is as if they ſhould ſay, no <hi>one body</hi> is in <hi>ſeverall</hi>
places. And I know no <hi>Prelatiſt</hi> that either <hi>directly</hi> or by
<hi>conſequence</hi> hath affirmed it is.</p>
                  <p>54. What remaines in the laſt <hi>Paragraph</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi>
is onely to ſtate the <hi>Queſtion</hi> betwixt us, which is all the
while no more but this, whether <hi>Tertullian and</hi> Irenaeus <hi>that
call</hi> Polycarpe <hi>and</hi> Oneſymus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Smyrna <hi>and</hi> Epheſus,
<hi>meane Biſhops,</hi>

                     <hi>in a peculiar ſenſe, or in a generall
phraſe, as all</hi> Presbyters <hi>are called Biſhops.</hi> And this I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be the <hi>onely queſtion</hi> between us, and if Biſhops
doe ſignifie Biſhops, I cannot doubt but the cauſe is by them
adjudged on <hi>our ſide;</hi> And why it ſhould not, they have, to
conclude, onely this offer of <hi>argument,</hi> that <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
had all one name in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> dayes, and long after in
<hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s time.</p>

therefore I ſhall bring the matter to this ſhort iſſue. This

this againe gives the cauſe to us from them. And upon

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> That in a late Booke of his hath undertaken to make

ſenſe. 2. That whereſoever the word Presbyter is uſed
in the New Teſtament, it is to be underſtood, not of a mere
<hi>Presbyter,</hi> but of a Biſhop properly ſo called. And whereas we
ſay that the Scripture-Biſhop is nothing elſe but a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and
that there was no <hi>Biſhops</hi> diſtinct from <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

may be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>There is ſo much of the ſenſe of ſome paſſages in the

believe, that I am the <hi>Author</hi> here charged for theſe two
<hi>Paradoxes.</hi> That they are ſo ſtyled by thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

                     <hi>Elder</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> doth denote moſt
<hi>properly,</hi> and ſignifie moſt <hi>conſtantly</hi> (as in all <hi>Languages</hi>
the word is found vulgarly to doe) a <hi>Ruler</hi> or <hi>Governour.</hi> This
is ſo largely deduced and demonſtrated in the <hi>Annotation</hi>

                  <p>Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that as in ſome places of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> the

                  <p>Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that if any one or more places ſhall be thought
by any man to belong to <hi>Presbyters</hi> in our moderne ſenſe, as
that of <hi>Jam</hi> 5. 14. or the like, I ſhall onely deſire, that he
will bring any convincing proofe or <hi>authentick Teſtimony,</hi> that
in that or thoſe places it ſo ſignifies, and I ſhall moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grant it to him, and be ſo farre from thinking it, in the
leaſt degree, diſadvantagious to our pretenſions, that I ſhall
not doubt to evidence it a <hi>demonſtrative</hi> argument to confirm
them, but ſhall not need to inſiſt on that, till ſuch proofe be
offered.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that by this it is already moſt evident, that my
<hi>aſſertion</hi> was not truely cited p. 92. in theſe words, that <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the word</hi> Presbyter <hi>is uſed in the New Teſtament, it
is to be underſtood not of a meere</hi> Presbyter, <hi>but of a</hi> Biſhop <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

be ſo much at leiſure from <hi>excuſing</hi> themſelves, to <hi>accuſe</hi>

Laſtly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that if they <hi>doe not thinke it neceſſary to take a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſurvey of all that is ſaid in juſtification of theſe</hi> (which

my <hi>aſſertions,</hi> nor is here one word added to prove it is, to

of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Macedonia, Biſhops</hi>
of <hi>Judaea,</hi> &amp;c. (and render my reaſons of doing ſo) and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
affirme them to be the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of divers (ſure that is

                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond inconvenience is,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that I muſt be forced to grant
that there were no <hi>Biſhops</hi> over <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days,
for if there were no <hi>Presbyters,</hi> there could be no <hi>Biſhops</hi> over
<hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is an evident miſtake,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> for I no where ſay, that there
were no <hi>Preſbyters</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> dayes, but onely that in
the <hi>Apoſtles writings</hi> the word [<hi>Biſhops</hi>] alwayes ſignifies <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi>
and the word [<hi>Elders</hi>] either never, or but rarely,
<hi>Presbyters;</hi> Now beſides that it is poſſible for thoſe to be in
the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> writing, which yet for want of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
are not mentioned in thoſe writings (and I that love
not negative arguments <hi>à teſtimonio,</hi> ſhould never have
thought fit to conclude there were no <hi>Preſbyters</hi> within the
time wherein the ſeverall Bookes of Scripture were written,
upon that one argument, becauſe I could not find them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
there) beſides this, I ſay, Tis certaine that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
times are ſomewhat a larger period than the time
of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> writings, and therefore that what is ſpoken
onely of the later, was not meant to be extended to the
former.</p>
                  <p>For 1.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> continued alive ſome time after writing
their <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and ſecondly, ſome of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſurvived

                  <p>That this was his condition,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hath been ſhewed already, And
for the <hi>inconveniences</hi> that it is preſt with, they will prove very

either <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> or <hi>Fathers,</hi> but give the diſputers example to
pay them all <hi>reverence,</hi> being very well able to diſcerne the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>

ſtyling <hi>Michael</hi> an <hi>Archangel</hi> was denying him to be an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</hi>
He certainly was an <hi>Angel,</hi> and that of an <hi>higher</hi> degree,
or elſe could never have been juſtly called an <hi>Archangell;</hi> and
'tis juſt ſo with <hi>Titus,</hi> if I had not thought him a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> I
could never have affirmed him an <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> and they that
in common ſpeech give him the title of <hi>Biſhop,</hi> doe no way
intimate their thoughts to be <hi>contrary</hi> to mine, for every
<hi>Archbiſhop</hi> is certainly a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> though every <hi>Biſhop</hi> be not an
<hi>Archbiſhop.</hi>

And therefore if all the danger of my <hi>aſſertions</hi> falling to

it is diſtinct from <hi>Presbyteriall,</hi> and that therefore there was

                  <p>I doe not conceive that they have ſaid any thing of any

But in a farre larger ſtyle I think it were no inſolence
to ſay, that againſt all that was ever imagined by any to be
producible out of <hi>Antiquity</hi> in behalfe of <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> the bare
teſtimonies of this one <hi>Apoſtolicall Martyr, Ignatius,</hi> will
be abundantly ſufficient, being put in the other Scale, to

ſuch direct <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> ſo (every where) inculcated, and ſo

                  <p>In anſwer to this we muſt intreat the Reader to take notice
that in the Primitive Times there were abundance of spacious

<hi>Primitive,</hi> be taken in a very great <hi>Latitude,</hi> I had thought
that it had been in <hi>after</hi> times, when <hi>errors</hi> were gotten in,
and ſought <hi>patronage</hi> and covert from the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi>
that theſe <hi>ſpurious brats</hi> were borne, and affixt to great

                  <p>To this I moſt willingly yeild,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that the Epiſtles under
<hi>Ignatius</hi>'s name to the <hi>bleſſed Virgin</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> may very
probably be deemed none of his, and ſo they are generally
rejected by thoſe who mainteine <hi>ours,</hi> as well as <hi>their</hi> intereſts.
I ſhall onely adde that there is no one word in them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Biſhops,</hi> nor were they ever produced by any <hi>Prelatiſt</hi>
in defence of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next then,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                     <hi>ſay they,</hi> As for his other twelve <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> five
of them are by invincible arguments, as we conceive, proved by
<hi>Vedelius</hi> to be written by a <hi>Pſeudo-Ignatius. Euſebius</hi> and
<hi>Hierome</hi> make mention but of ſeven.</p>
                  <p>Here alſo will eaſily be granted by us whatſoever is deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
For though <hi>Vedelius</hi> a <hi>Divine</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> ſince the
caſting out of their <hi>Biſhop</hi> and ſetting up of the <hi>new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
might well be lookt on as a <hi>partiall</hi> arguer or <hi>Judge</hi>

formerly acknowleged that <hi>Euſebius</hi> and St. <hi>Hierome</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but ſeven Epiſtles of his, I ſhall alſo be ready to yeild to
the utmoſt that <hi>Vedelius</hi> contended, that there be no more
then <hi>ſeven Genuine Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> not that every of
the other <hi>five</hi> can be proved to be <hi>ſuppoſitious,</hi> but becauſe
the antient teſtifications of the <hi>Church</hi> doe not make it ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that thoſe other <hi>five</hi> are all his, as of the other <hi>ſeven</hi>
they doe.</p>
                  <p>According to this conceſſion it is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that in the <hi>Diſſertations</hi>
all the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> which are produced in defence of <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi>
are taken out of thoſe ſeven Epiſtles which St. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and onely truſted friend of the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi>
doth acknowledge to be his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But of theſe</hi> ſeven <hi>alſo they have ſomewhat to ſay,</hi>

they are ſo much adulterated and corrupted, that no man can
ground any ſolid Aſſertion about Epiſcopacy from <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s

                  <p>I hope I ſhall not now be lookt on,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> as an <hi>intemperate aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This being the ſumme of their charge on me in this place,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
that having <hi>anſwer'd</hi> all the Arguments of <hi>Blondell</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius</hi>

                  <p>And 1. For <hi>Rivet,</hi>

                  <p>But then <hi>Vedelius</hi> having called this <hi>volume</hi> to a very ſtrict

purged, cannot be ſtill lyable to his and the like <hi>exceptions,</hi>
which before were made againſt the former <hi>Copies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Salmaſius</hi> and <hi>Blondell,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> their exceptions have, as is
here confeſt, been already examined, and I need ſay no more

which here they are not, but inſtead of it, I am cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to anſwer the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Armagh</hi> his Arguments.
Laſtly, therefore for the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Armagh;</hi> It is firſt
ſomewhat unexpected, that what he had ſaid, as the <hi>ground</hi>
and <hi>occaſion</hi> of making a new <hi>Edition,</hi> ſetting out this very

me to be anſwered, who uſe that very <hi>Copy,</hi> which that <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop</hi>
ſet out, and acknowledge it was formerly as <hi>corruptly</hi> ſet
forth, as he conceived it to be.</p>
                  <p>Is it not viſible that the <hi>Archbiſhop's</hi> whole deſigne in two
impreſſions of thoſe Epiſtles,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> was to ſet them out free from
all corruptions and mixtures, and interpolations, which they
had before been under: And that all his diſcourſes in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena,</hi>
were to prove the <hi>former</hi> editions to have been <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,</hi>
and ſo that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e was great need of ſeeking out <hi>better</hi>
Copies, and that he verily thought he had now found ſuch?
And then what can be required of me to <hi>anſwer</hi> in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
who am directly of his <hi>opinion</hi> in all the <hi>ſubſtantiall</hi> parts
of the whole matter?</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>leſſer</hi> doubts,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> as whether that one to <hi>Polycarpe</hi> be
among the <hi>genuine</hi> or no, though with <hi>Euſebius</hi> and St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
I believe it is, and have given the reaſons of my opinion,
yet I need not <hi>controvert</hi> this with any, becauſe the other <hi>ſix</hi>

that the <hi>Reader</hi> may know the <hi>unqueſtionable</hi> opinion

                  <p>Joannes Jordanus <hi>was of opinion that</hi>

the firſt rudiments there,</hi> and, as it followes in <hi>Demſter,
tyrocinia fidei fecit, laid the grounds of Chriſtianity</hi> among
them; And that might be done, and ſoone moulder away
againe, and never come to ſo much <hi>maturity,</hi> as either to
have <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> conſtituted among them. And
ſecondly, though <hi>Bede</hi> ſay that <hi>Palladius</hi> was ſent to them

other affirmes that they were formerly ruled by a <hi>Preſbytery,</hi>
or ſo much as that they had any <hi>Preſbyter</hi> among them. Nay
thirdly, <hi>Demſter</hi> reports it from <hi>Jordanus</hi> but ſlightly, <hi>Joh.
Jordanus putavit, it was the conceit</hi> or <hi>opinion</hi> of that <hi>author.</hi>
And that which<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 8. de ſignis Eccl. c. 1.</note>

of time he thought it was done, but leaves us to <hi>collect</hi> both
from ſome few <hi>circumſtances;</hi> as 1. that it was after <hi>Schiſmes</hi>
entred into the <hi>Church,</hi> and one ſaid <hi>I am Paul, I of Apollos,</hi>
&amp;c. And if it were <hi>immediately</hi> after that, then the <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
will gaine but little by this <hi>Patron:</hi> For his whole mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
will be, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> firſt put the <hi>Government</hi> of
<hi>each Church</hi> into the hands of <hi>many,</hi> but ſoon ſaw the <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience</hi>
of doing ſo, and the <hi>Schiſme</hi> and <hi>ruptures</hi> conſequent
to it, and changed it <hi>themſelves,</hi> and ſetled one <hi>ſingular
Biſhop</hi> in the whole power of <hi>Government</hi> in every <hi>Church,</hi> to
which very fitly <hi>coheres</hi> what <hi>Clement</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>leſt new
contentions ſhould ariſe about this ſingular dignity and authority</hi>
who ſhould <hi>ſucceed</hi> to it, they made a <hi>roll</hi> or <hi>Catalogue</hi> of
thoſe, which in <hi>vacancies</hi> ſhould <hi>ſucceed</hi> in each <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this was not,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in <hi>Hierome</hi>'s opinion, done thus early in
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time, the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> think they may conclude
from what he ſaith on <hi>Tit. 1. Epiſcopi noverint ſe magis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudine

Majores, Let Biſhops know that their greatneſſe and ſuperiority
over Preſbyters is held rather by cuſtome, than by Chriſts ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſpoſed it ſo.</hi> But it is very poſſible that this may not
prove the <hi>concluſion,</hi> which is thought to be inferred by it,
For here <hi>Conſuetudo, Cuſtome,</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>Chriſts dispoſition,</hi>
may well ſignifie the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>later</hi> part of
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, and ever ſince to S. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s days, and that
may well be ſevered from all <hi>command,</hi> or <hi>inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Chriſts,</hi>
&amp; ſo <hi>Jerom</hi>'s opinion may well be this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not <hi>ordain</hi>
this <hi>ſuperiority</hi> of one <hi>above</hi> another, but left all in <hi>common</hi> in
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> hands, who within awhile, to avoid <hi>Schiſm,</hi> put the
power in each <hi>Church</hi> in the hands of ſome <hi>one ſingular perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that this was <hi>Hierome</hi>'s meaning,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> I thought my ſelfe,
in <hi>charity</hi> to him, obliged to thinke, both becauſe in this ſenſe
his words would better agree with the <hi>univerſal affirmation</hi> of
all <hi>Orthodoxe Chriſtians,</hi> that before him (and after him too,
unleſſe thoſe <hi>few</hi> that took it on his <hi>credit</hi>) ſpeake of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and alſo, becauſe if this be not his ſenſe, he muſt needs be
found to <hi>contradict</hi> himſelfe, having elſewhere affirmed that
the <hi>three degrees</hi> of <hi>Biſhops, Preſbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> in the

                     <hi>Church</hi> were of <hi>Apoſtolicall tradition, i. e.</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
themſelves <hi>delivered</hi> to the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now before I proceed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> I deſire the <hi>ingenuous Reader,</hi>
who is <hi>contrary</hi> minded, to conſider, what he can <hi>object</hi> to
this <hi>concluſion</hi> of mine thus inferr'd concerning S. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s
<hi>opinion,</hi> and conſequently what probability there is, that the

of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> ſuppoſing what I am next to demonſtrate, that
the <hi>three orders</hi> are by him acknowledged to be <hi>delivered</hi> from
the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is evident in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Euagrius,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> where having

<hi>we have this inſtance, that what</hi> Aaron <hi>and his</hi> Sonnes <hi>and the</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>On occaſion therefore of inquiring into <hi>Hierome</hi>'s meaning
(and becauſe this place ſo readily offered it ſelfe to expedite
it) it was ſure very <hi>reaſonable</hi> to examine,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> and obſerve, what
they which made moſt advantage of <hi>Hierome</hi>'s <hi>authority,</hi>
ſhould be found to ſay to this <hi>teſtimony</hi> of his, for the <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical

words, but deferr'd their obſervations on them, till ſome
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96486:92"/>
                     <hi>fitter ſeaſon;</hi> D. <hi>Blondell</hi> put it off to his <hi>ſixt Section,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
upon examination he hath but <hi>three</hi> in his whole <hi>booke,</hi> and
ſo is certainly never likely to ſpeake of it, nor can be juſtly
believed to have, in earneſt deſigned any ſuch thing: The
other ſaith, he <hi>expects more and better notes on it from</hi> Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius
(i.e. from himſelfe) <hi>in another booke,</hi> viz. <hi>De Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtico
Ordine,</hi> and after a great <hi>volume</hi> come out of that <hi>ſubject</hi>
8. or 9. yeares after, he yet never takes this place, or his own
<hi>promiſe</hi> into conſideration.</p>
                  <p>This was all that my ſearch produced,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> and the taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of theſe <hi>plaine</hi> matters of <hi>fact,</hi> the behaviours of theſe men
in that, which ſo much concern'd the whole <hi>cauſe</hi> to be taken
notice of, and laid to <hi>heart,</hi> is all that was done by me, and
which is ſtyled by theſe a <hi>triumphing over</hi> thoſe <hi>learned Men.</hi>
And I hope there was little of <hi>hard</hi> meaſure, and as little of
<hi>inſolence</hi> in this.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe what theſe <hi>learned</hi> Men thus averted the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
is yet here ſaid to be done by <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> and that <hi>if
I had caſt an eye on the vindication—I ſhould there have found
that place of</hi> Hierome's <hi>anſwered,</hi> I am now in the laſt place to
obey their directions, and conſider the <hi>anſwer,</hi> which from
<hi>Smectymnuus</hi> they have ſet down for me.</p>
                  <p>And it is <hi>twofold,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> the firſt is a <hi>civill denyall</hi> that there is
any <hi>truth</hi> in the words, <hi>For,</hi> ſay they, <hi>It is hard to conceive
how this imparity can be properly called an Apoſtolicall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
when</hi> Jerome, <hi>having mentioned</hi> John <hi>the laſt of the</hi>
Apoſtles, <hi>ſaith it was</hi> poſtea, <hi>that one was ſet over the reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But is this the way of <hi>anſwering</hi> the place,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> or ſalving the
<hi>difficulty? Hierome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Biſhops, Preſbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> in
the <hi>Church</hi> (that ſure is this <hi>imparity</hi>) are an <hi>Apostolicall
Tradition;</hi> and they <hi>anſwer, It is hard to conceive how it can
be properly ſo called.</hi> What is this but to make <hi>Hierom</hi>'s
words (as ſoone as ever he ſaith any thing which accords not
with their <hi>intereſt</hi>) as <hi>unreconcileable</hi> with truth, as with his
<hi>own</hi> former <hi>words,</hi> which they had cited from him? And
then how much kinder to <hi>Hierome</hi> was I than they, who
thought it neceſſary to affix a <hi>commodious</hi> meaning to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
words, and <hi>interpret confuetudo</hi>] the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96486:92"/>
                     <hi>Church</hi> begun in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> dayes, that ſo in thus ſaying, he
might be <hi>reconcileable</hi> with himſelf, when he called <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>
a <hi>tradition Apoſtolicall?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>reaſon,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> which makes this ſo <hi>hard</hi> for them to
<hi>conceive</hi> from <hi>Hierome's</hi> words, I believe it hath no <hi>force</hi> in
it; For though after the mention of S. <hi>John's</hi> words in his
ſecond and third Epiſtle, he ſaith that [<hi>poſtea, afterwards</hi>]
this <hi>imparity</hi> was introduced, yet this proves not his opnion
to be, that it was not <hi>Apoſtolicall tradition;</hi> It might be
done <hi>after</hi> the <hi>writing</hi> of thoſe Epiſtles, and yet in St. <hi>John's</hi>
time, <hi>i. e.</hi> before his <hi>death.</hi> And though I believe St. <hi>Hierome</hi>
was miſtaken, in thinking there were no <hi>Biſhops</hi> till then
(it would have had more <hi>truth</hi> in it, if he had ſaid there were
no <hi>Presbyters</hi> till then) yet for all that, I cannot doubt but
this was his <hi>opnion,</hi> becauſe as he no where ſaith any thing
which is <hi>contrary</hi> to this, ſo here be ſaith <hi>expreſly</hi> that it was
<hi>Apostolicall tradition,</hi> which in his <hi>opinion</hi> it could not be,
if it were not in the <hi>Church,</hi> in his <hi>opinion,</hi> before St. <hi>John's</hi>
death. And ſo there is but little appearance of <hi>validity</hi> in their
firſt <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And for their</hi> ſecond,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> 
                     <hi>that is ſomewhat like the former,</hi> viz.
<hi>that</hi> with <hi>Hierome</hi> Apoſtolicall tradition and Eccleſiaſticall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
are the ſame.</p>
                  <p>If this be true,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> then certainly I did not amiſſe in thinking
that when <hi>Hierome</hi> uſed <hi>conſuetudo custome</hi> in oppoſition to
<hi>Dominica dispoſitio,</hi> Chriſt's <hi>appointment</hi> or <hi>inſtitution,</hi> I
ought to interpret <hi>cuſtome</hi> in that place, by <hi>Apoſtolicall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
in the other. For how <hi>Eccleſiaſticall cuſtome</hi> with him,
and <hi>Apoſtolicall Tradition</hi> ſhould be the ſame, and yet <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
cuſtome</hi> may not be interpreted by <hi>Apostolicall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
eſpecially when the ſame man <hi>affirmes</hi> them both of the
ſame thing, I confeſſe I cannot apprehend.</p>
                  <p>But then ſecondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> becauſe I muſt ſuppoſe, that by making
them the <hi>ſame, they</hi> muſt meane to bring downe <hi>Apoſtolicall
tradition</hi> to ſignifie <hi>Eccleſiaſticall cuſtome,</hi> not to advance
<hi>cuſtome</hi> to ſignify <hi>Apoſtolicall tradition</hi> (in the ſame manner
as when they make <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Elder</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

down <hi>Biſhop</hi> to ſignifie <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> but will not allow <hi>Elder</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:96486:93"/>
to ſignifie <hi>Biſhop</hi>) that alſo will be worth <hi>examining</hi> a while.</p>
                  <p>And 1. Can there be any reaſon to imagine,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> that <hi>Hierome</hi>
or any man ſhould ſet down that for an <hi>inſtance</hi> of <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
tradition,</hi> which the ſame perſon doth not believe to be
<hi>delivered</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but to be of a <hi>latter</hi> date? That
which is <hi>delivered</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>received,</hi> and <hi>practiced</hi>
by the <hi>Church,</hi> may fitly be called a <hi>cuſtome of the Church,</hi>
without adding or ſpecifying, that we meane the <hi>Apoſtolicall
Church,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> while they lived, were a <hi>part</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the following age was a <hi>part</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> alſo. But can it be truly ſaid, that that was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which was onely <hi>accuſtomed</hi> in the
<hi>ſubſequent Church,</hi> and not ſo much as introduced under the
<hi>Apoſtles?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This certainly is another ſtrange way of <hi>interpreting</hi> words
or phraſes quite contrary to all <hi>Lexicons,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> or to the <hi>uſe</hi> of
ſuch <hi>words</hi> or <hi>phraſes,</hi> which unleſſe they be <hi>changed,</hi> it is as
much as to ſay, he that ſaid <hi>Tradition Apoſtolicall,</hi> did not
meane <hi>Tradition Apoſtolicall;</hi> And this ſure will bring little
credit to St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> on whoſe <hi>authority</hi> they ſo much depend
in this matter.</p>
                  <p>As for their <hi>proofe</hi> of what they ſay,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> viz. becauſe <hi>the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Lent, which he ſaith,</hi> ad Marcellum, <hi>is</hi> Apoſtolica
traditio, <hi>is</hi> contra Luciferianos, <hi>ſaid by him to be</hi> Eccleſiae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudo,]
that ſure is not of <hi>force</hi> to conclude what they would
have it, for it may be (or by him be deemed to be) both, an
<hi>Apoſtolicall tradition</hi> and a <hi>cuſtome</hi> of the <hi>hurch</hi> too, it being
very <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>reaſonable,</hi> that what the <hi>Apoſtles delivered,</hi>
the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould alſo <hi>accuſtome,</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi> But could
<hi>both</hi> theſe be ſaid by him of that which he thought were but
<hi>one</hi> of theſe? That is againe to make him <hi>teſtifie</hi> againſt his
<hi>conſcience,</hi> to ſay <hi>Lent</hi> was an <hi>Apoſtolicall tradition,</hi> and to
<hi>believe</hi> it was not an <hi>Apoſtolicall tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I ſhall not need <hi>debate</hi> whether the <hi>obſervation</hi> of <hi>Lent</hi>
were <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> or no; All that is neceſſary to inſiſt on, is,

of Ordination.</p>
                  <p>To this I ſhall briefly reply,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 1. That it is ſure enough, &amp; gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the moſt <hi>eminent Presbyterians,</hi> that theſe two Books,
whence theſe <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> are cited, were not written either
by <hi>Ambroſe</hi> or <hi>Auſtine,</hi> but by ſome other <hi>(Hilarius Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>

and then the authority of ſuch <hi>ſuppoſititious</hi> pieces will not be
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:96486:99"/>
great to over-rule any <hi>practice</hi> otherwiſe <hi>acknowledged</hi> in the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that the miſtakes of <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the meaning of the former of theſe places, were ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
diſcovered by the <hi>ſecond</hi> of them (the <hi>conſignant</hi> in
the one, interpreted by <hi>conſecrat</hi> in the other) that I conceived
it ſufficient, but to name them, For can there be any thing
more <hi>unqueſtionable</hi> than this, that <hi>conſecrare</hi> in <hi>antient</hi>
writers ſignifies the <hi>Conſecration</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt?</hi> And then
if <hi>conſignare</hi> be a more <hi>obſcure</hi> phraſe is there any doubt,
but it muſt be <hi>interpreted</hi> by that which is ſo much more
<hi>vulgar</hi> and <hi>plaine?</hi> and all the <hi>circumſtances</hi> beſides being
exactly the ſame in both places, what doubt can there be,
but in both, the words are to be underſtood of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet becauſe ſome advantage was by this their miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
ſought to the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> cauſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> they now reſolve;

pretend not to produce any <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> where <hi>conſecrare</hi> is

                     <hi>Salmaſius</hi> were yet more <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine,</hi>
