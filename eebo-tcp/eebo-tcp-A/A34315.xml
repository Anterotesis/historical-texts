            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable, <hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> of <hi>Lanesborough,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is with a great deal of Pleasure, that I lay hold on this first Occasion, which, the Accidents of my Life have given me of writing to your Lordship: For since at the same time I write to all the World, it will be a means of publishing, (what I would have every Body know) the Respect and Duty which I owe and pay to you. I have so much Inclination to be yours, that I need no other Engagement: But the particular Ties, by which I am bound to your Lordship and Family, have put it out of my power to make you any Complement; since all Offers of my self, will amount to no more than an honest Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and only shew a willingness in me to be grateful.</p>
            <p>I am very near wishing, That it were not so much my Interest to be your Lordships Servant, that it might be more my Merit; not that I would avoid being obliged to you, but I would have my own Choice to run me into the Debt; that I might have it to boast, I had distinguished a Man, to whom I would be glad to be obliged, even without the hopes of having it in my Power, ever to make him a return.</p>
            <p>It is impossible for me to come near your Lordship, in any kind, and not to receive some Favour; and while in appearance I am on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly making an Acknowledgment (with the usual underhand deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the World) I am at the same time, insinuating my own Interest. I cannot give your Lordship your due, without tacking a Bill of my own Priviledges. 'Tis true, if a Man never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Folly, he would never stand in need of a Protection: But then Power would have nothing to do, and good Nature no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to shew it self; and where those Vertues are, 'tis pity they should want Objects to shine upon. I must confess this is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why a Man should do an idle thing, nor indeed any good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for it, when done; yet it reconciles the uses of such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Goodness, to the necessities of our Follies; and is a sort of Poetical Logick, which, at this time I would make use of, to argue your Lordship into a Protection of this Play. It is the first
<pb facs="tcp:98291:3"/>
Offence I have committed in this kind, or indeed, in any kind of Poetry, tho' not the first made publick; and, therefore, I hope will the more easily be pardoned: But had it been Acted, when it was first written, more might have been said in its behalf; Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Town and Stage, would then, have been Excuses in a young Writer, which now, almost four Years experience, will scarce allow of. Yet I must declare my self sensible of the good Nature of the Town, in receiving this Play so kindly, with all its Faults, which I must own were, for the most part, very industriously covered by the care of the Players; for, I think, scarce a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter but receiv'd all the Advantage it would admit of, from the justness of Action.</p>
            <p>As for the Criticks, my Lord, I have nothing to say, to, or against any of them of any kind; from those who make just Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, to those who find fault in the wrong place. I will only make this general Answer in behalf of my Play (an Answer, which <hi>Epictetus</hi> advises every Man to make for himself, to his Censurers) viz. <hi>That if they who find some Faults in it were as intimate with it as I am, they would find a great many more.</hi> This is a Confession, which I need not to have made; but however, I can draw this use from it, to my own Advantage, that I think there are no Faults in it, but what I do know; which, as I take it, is the first step to an amendment.</p>
            <p>Thus I may live in hopes (sometime or other) of making the Town amends; but you, my Lord, I never can, tho' I am ever</p>

            <l>WHEN Vertue in pursuit of Fame appears,</l>
            <l>And forward shoots the growth beyond the Years:</l>
            <l>We timely court the rising Hero's Cause;</l>
            <l>And on his side, the Poet wisely draws;</l>
            <l>Bespeaking him hereafter, by Applause.</l>
            <l>The days will come, when we shall all receive,</l>
            <l>Returning Interest from what now we give:</l>
            <l>Instructed, and supported by that Praise,</l>
            <l>And Reputation, which we strive to raise.</l>
            <l>Nature so coy, so hardly to be Woo'd</l>
            <l>Flies, like a Mistress, but to be pursu'd.</l>

            <l>She looks behind, and wants thy strong Embrace:</l>
            <l>She yields, she yields, surrenders all her Charms,</l>
            <l>Do you but force her gently to your Arms:</l>
            <l>Such Nerves, such Graces, in your Lines appear,</l>
            <l>As you were made to be her Ravisher.</l>
            <l>DRYDEN has long extended his Command,</l>

            <l>Those Provinces, which he alone could gain.</l>
            <l>His eldest <hi>Wicherly,</hi> in wise Retreat,</l>

            <l>May'st thou live long in thy great Masters smiles,</l>
            <l>And growing under him, adorn these Isles:</l>
            <l>But whenâ€”when part of him (be that but late)</l>
            <l>His Body yielding must submit to Fate,</l>
            <l>Leaving his deathless Works, and thee behind,</l>
            <l>(The natural Successor of his Mind)</l>
            <l>Then may'st thou finish what he has begun:</l>
            <l>Heir to his Merit, be in Fame his Son.</l>
            <l>What thou hast done, shews all is in thy Power;</l>
            <l>And to Write better, only must Write more.</l>
            <l>'Tis something to be willing to commend;</l>

            <l>MOST Authors on the Stage at first appear</l>
            <l>Like Widows-Bridegrooms, full of doubt and fear:</l>
            <l>They judge from the experience of the Dame,</l>
            <l>How hard a Task it is to quench her Flame:</l>
            <l>And who falls short of furnishing a course,</l>
            <l>Up to his brawny Predecessors force;</l>
            <l>With utmost rage from her Embraces thrown,</l>
            <l>Remains convicted, as an empty Drone.</l>
            <l>Thus often, to his Shame, a pert Beginner</l>
            <l>Proves in the end, a miserable Sinner.</l>
            <l>As for our Youngster, I am apt to doubt him,</l>
            <l>With all the vigour of his Youth about him:</l>
            <l>But he, more Sanguine, trusts in one and twenty,</l>
            <l>And impudently hopes he shall content you:</l>
            <l>For tho' his Batchelour be worn and cold:</l>
            <l>He thinks the Young may club to help the Old:</l>
            <l>And what alone can be atchieved by neither,</l>
            <l>Is often brought about by both together.</l>
            <l>The briskest of you all have felt Allarms,</l>
            <l>Finding the fair One prostitute her Charms</l>
            <l>With broken Sighs, in her old Fumblers Arms.</l>
            <l>But for our Spark, he Swears he'll ne're be jealous</l>
            <l>Of any Rivals, but young lusty Fellows.</l>
            <l>Faith let him try his Chance, and if the Slave,</l>
            <l>After his bragging, prove a washy Knave;</l>
            <l>May he be banish'd to some lonely Den,</l>
            <l>And never more have leave to dip his Pen:</l>
            <l>But if he be the Champion he pretends,</l>
            <l>Both Sexes sure will join to be his Friends;</l>
            <l>For all agree, where all can have their ends.</l>
            <l>And you must own him for a Man of Might,</l>
            <l>If he holds out to please you the third Night.</l>

            </stage>
            <l>HOW this vile World is chang'd! In former days,</l>
            <l>Prologues, were serious Speeches, before Plays;</l>
            <l>Grave solemn Things, as Graces are to Feasts;</l>
            <l>Where, Poets beg'd a Blessing, from their Guests.</l>
            <l>But now, no more like Suppliants, we come;</l>
            <l>A Play makes War, and Prologue is the Drum:</l>
            <l>Arm'd with keen Satyr, and with pointed Wit,</l>
            <l>We threaten you who do for Iudges sit,</l>
            <l>To save our Plays, or else we'll damn your Pit.</l>
            <l>But for your Comfort, it falls out to day,</l>
            <l>We've a young Author and his first born Play;</l>
            <l>So, standing only on his good Behaviour,</l>
            <l>He's very civil, and entreats your Favour.</l>
            <l>Not but the Man has Malice, would he show it,</l>
            <l>But on my Conscience he's a bashful Poet;</l>
            <l>You think that strangeâ€”no matter, he'll out grow it.</l>
            <l>Well, I'm his Advocateâ€”by me he prays you,</l>
            <l>(I don't know whether I shall speak to please you)</l>
            <l>He praysâ€”O bless me! what shall I do now!</l>
            <l>Hang me if I know what he prays, or how!</l>
            <l>And 'twas the prettiest Prologue, as he wrote it!</l>
            <l>Well, the Deuce take me, if I hau'e forgot it.</l>
            <l>O Lord, for Heavens sake excuse the Play,</l>
            <l>Because, you know, if it be damn'd to day,</l>
            <l>I shall be hang'd for wanting what to say.</l>
            <l>How my sake thenâ€”but I'm in such Confusion,</l>
            <l>I cannot stay to hear your Resolution.</l>
            <p>Runs off.</p>

                     <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
                     <p>Why faith I think it will do well enoughâ€”If the Husband be out of the way, for the Wife to shew her Fondness and Impatience of his Absence, by choosing a Lover as like him as she can, and what is unlike she may help out with her own Fancy.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Vain.</speaker>
                     <p>But is it not an Abuse to the Lover to be made a Blind of? For she only stalks under him to take aim at her Husband.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
                     <p>As you say the Abuse is to the Lover, not the Husband: For 'tis an Argument of her great Zeal towards him, that she will enjoy him in Essigie.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Vain.</speaker>
                     <p>It must be a very superstitious Country, where such Zeal passes for true Devotion. I doubt it will be damn'd by all our Protestant Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands for slat Idolatryâ€”But if you can make Alderman <hi>Fondlewife</hi> of your Perswasion, this Letter will be needless.</p>

Lying, Child, is indeed the Art of Love; and Men are generally Masters in it: But I'm so newly entred, you cannot distruit me of any skill in the treacherous Mysteryâ€”Now by my Soul, I cannot lie, though it were to serve a Friend or gain a Mistress.</p>

                     <p>But Love, they say, is a tender thing, that will smooth Frowns, and make calm an angry Face; will soften a rugged Temper, and make ill-humoured People good: You look ready to fright one, and talk as if your Passion were not Love, but Anger.</p>

            <l>To tell you, he already does repent:</l>
            <l>Would you were all as forward, to keep Lent.</l>
            <l>Now the Deed's done, the Giddy-thing has leasure</l>
            <l>'<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>o think oth' Sting, that's in the tail of Pleasure.</l>
            <l>Methinks I hear him in Consideration!</l>
            <l>What will the World say? Where's my Reputation?</l>
            <l>Now that's at stakesâ€”No fool, 'tis out o'fashion.</l>
            <l>If loss of that should follow want of Wit,</l>
            <l>How many Vndone Men were in the Pit!</l>
            <l>Why that's some Comfort, to an Author's fears,</l>
            <l>If he's an Ass, he will be Try'd by's Peers.</l>
            <l>But holdâ€”I am exceeding my Commission;</l>
            <l>My Business here, was humbly to petition:</l>
            <l>But we're so us'd to Rail on these Occasions,</l>
            <l>I could not help one tryal of your Patience:</l>
            <l>For 'tis our way (you know) for fear o'th' worst,</l>
            <l>To be before-hand still, and cry Fool first.</l>
            <l>How say you, Sparks? How do you stand affected?</l>
            <l>I swear, young <hi>Bays</hi> within, is so dejected.</l>
            <l>I would grieve your hearts to see him; shall I call him?</l>
            <l>But then you cruel Criticks would so maul him!</l>
            <l>Yet, may be, you'll encourage a beginner;</l>
            <l>But how?â€”Iust as the Devil does a Sinner.</l>
            <l>Women and Wits, are used e'en much at one;</l>
            <l>You gain your Ends, and damn 'em when you've done.</l>
