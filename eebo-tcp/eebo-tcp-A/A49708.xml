            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Preface.</head>
            <p>THere needs no more to recommend this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual</hi> to the <hi>pious Reader,</hi> than the Name of its <hi>great Author,</hi> who was both so excellent a <hi>Judge</hi> of the Matter and Language of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> and so lively an <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of its use, as made him in all parts qualified and furnished to direct others.</p>
            <p>Yet most probably this <hi>H. Prelate</hi> designed them at first to
<pb facs="tcp:102404:4"/>
serve onely for himself in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements:</hi> But however, that they are exceedingly well fitted for all sorts of persons (excepting here and there some peculiarities, which may soon be noted and past over) any one may discern, that will but take the pains of a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory perusal. And the World has pretty well witnessed it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken off <hi>three Editions</hi> (or more) so entirely, that 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly difficult to meet with one <hi>single Copy</hi> of either; though none of them were printed to the <hi>Advantage</hi> of the <hi>Writer,</hi> nor well contrived for the <hi>Benefit</hi> of the <hi>devout Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first that came abroad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained onely the <hi>Officium Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianum</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102404:4"/>
or <hi>Daily Office,</hi> with the addition of some few short <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects;</hi> and wanted the richest part of this noble Treasure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> was printed at <hi>Oxford</hi> by Dr. <hi>Bayly</hi> from the <hi>Bishop's own hand-writing;</hi> but it might have been wisht, for the publick good, that other <hi>measures</hi> had been taken, both in regard of the <hi>Price,</hi> and the <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of the Book.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Character</hi> being large and fair, made a fine shew indeed, but perhaps hindered the speedy spreading of it, by enhancing the purchase, and making it too bulkie.</p>
            <p>And many <hi>Prayers</hi> of most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and incomparable use being altogether in <hi>Latine,</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb facs="tcp:102404:5"/>
unserviceable to the <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of such who had learnt to <hi>pray</hi> onely in their <hi>Mother-Tongue,</hi> and were Strangers to all others.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Method</hi> no doubt was the same which he found in the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal;</hi> but the whole being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed at several times on different Motives, the Order could not be very natural, nor very apposite for the ready finding of ordinary persons; though the Bishops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant practice might have made it so familiar to himself, that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly he could with ease, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, dip on what place he pleased.</p>
            <p>What other <hi>Editions</hi> of it are extant, were printed after this
<pb facs="tcp:102404:5"/>
Copy; but seem to be stoln out in haste for filthy Lucre's sake, most intolerably faulty, and upon very bad Paper.</p>
            <p>But none of all these being to be had, care has been taken to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige the World with a <hi>new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> and at the same time to remedy all those Inconveniencies.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The Book therefore (now compleat and perfect) is brought into such a compass, as to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded at a very easie rate, though the <hi>Paper</hi> be good, and the <hi>Letter</hi> handsome.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The <hi>Latine part,</hi> which is very considerable (especially the <hi>Paraphrases</hi> on the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> and <hi>Creed,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Offices for the Sick</hi>) are here faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb facs="tcp:102404:6"/>
rendered into <hi>English,</hi> with much plainness, and, as nigh as could be, in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> Language; so that the meanest capacity may enjoy with good success, what the most refin'd and searching have so justly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired. That you may know the <hi>Translations,</hi> each is markt (thus*) with a small <hi>Asterisk</hi> at the beginning.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Some perhaps, on sudden thoughts, may judge it too bold an attempt to change the <hi>Order</hi> of the Book; and indeed it would have been so, if the <hi>Author</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had publisht it as a perfect Work. But considering what was said before, that 'twas intended onely for himself in private, and
<pb facs="tcp:102404:6"/>
gathered occasionally in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or meditated with regard to emerging circumstances, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod could not be exact or accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and therefore to alter it, will be no injury to the Memory of this great and learned Man, who in all likelihood would himself have done as much, if he had liv'd and resolv'd to communicate it to the World. So that the useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Vndertaking in this behalf, must certainly outweigh the presumption of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore immediately after the <hi>Daily Office,</hi> we have set the <hi>Daily Examination of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which is the proper place; and then follow the other short <hi>Collects</hi> (more naturally rankt
<pb facs="tcp:102404:7"/>
lation and Method, is, as to its usefulness, become almost a new Work.</p>
            <p>We concluded it to be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to acquaint the good <hi>Reader</hi> with this modest Account of our Care and Pains; and having done so, 'tis pity to detain him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer. May his honest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours be successful in the practice of what we recommend to him, as our own in the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>

            <head>An Advertisement CONCERNING The Division of the Hours of PRAYER.</head>
            <p>IT appeareth, both by the Histories of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and by plain Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations out of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that the space of the Day from the <hi>Morning</hi> to the <hi>Evening</hi> was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly divided into <hi>four</hi> equal parts, which they called <hi>Hours,</hi> [to wit] the <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi> and the <hi>Ninth.</hi> The <hi>First Hour</hi> comprehended the whole space from the Sun being risen, about <hi>six</hi> of the clock in the <hi>Morning</hi> after our account, till <hi>Nine,</hi> or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts. The <hi>Third Hour</hi> began from thence, and lasted till <hi>High-noon</hi> with us. The <hi>Sixth,</hi> from thence to our <hi>three</hi> of the clock after Noon. The <hi>Ninth,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102404:12"/>
from that hour, to the Vespers, or <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>song,</hi> about <hi>six</hi> in the evening, or Sun-set. And what was done in any part of these <hi>four</hi> spaces, was indifferently taken and said to be done in that <hi>Hour,</hi> whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every space of time was allotted. In which respect St. <hi>Mark,</hi> chap. <hi>15. 25.</hi> saith, <hi>It was the Third Hour when they crucified Christ:</hi> and yet St. <hi>John,</hi> chap. <hi>19. 14.</hi> saith, <hi>It was about the Sixth Hour</hi> before he was yet cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Nor is there any contradiction at all between these two Evangelists; St. <hi>Mark</hi> understanding the last part of the <hi>Third</hi> Hour, which was now at the very end; and St. <hi>John</hi> meaning that it was now near upon the beginning of the <hi>Sixth</hi> Hour, which was immediately to follow; the ending of the <hi>Third,</hi> and the beginning of the <hi>Sixth,</hi> being both one and the same point of time.</p>

Gracious Father, the life of man is a warfare upon earth, and the dangers which assault us are diversly pointed against us. I humbly beseech thee, be present with me in all the course and passages of my life, but especially in the services of my Calling. Suffer no malice to be able to hurt me, no cunning to circumvent me, no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to oppress me, no falshood to betray me. That which I cannot foresee, I beseech thee prevent: That which I cannot withstand, I beseech thee master: That which I do not fear, I beseech thee unmask and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; that being delivered from all danger both of soul and bodie, I may praise thee the deliverer, and see how happie a thing it is to make the Lord of Hosts my helper in the day of fear and trouble.

               <p>THis is an uncomfortable time to preach; yet I shall begin with a Text of Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Let us run with patience that race which is set before us: Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith, who for the joy that was set before him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been long in my Race, and how I have looked unto Jesus the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finisher of my Faith, he best knows. I am now come to the end of my Race, and here I find the Cross, a death of shame. But the shame
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102404:132"/>
must be despised, or no coming to the right hand of God. Jesus despised the shame for me, and God forbid that I should not despise the shame for Him.</p>
               <p>I am going apace (as you see) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Red Sea, and my feet are upon the very brink of it: An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (I hope) that God is bringing me into the Land of Promise; for that was the way through which he led his People.</p>
               <p>But before they came to it, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted a Passeover for them. A Lamb it was, but it must be eaten with sowre herbs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8. I shall obey, and labour to digest the sowre herbs, as well as the Lamb: And I shall remember it is the Lords Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over. I shall not think of the herbs, nor be angry with the hands that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them; but look up onely to him who instituted that, and governs these. For men can have no more power over me than what is given them from above, S. <hi>John</hi> 19.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:102404:133"/>
I am not in love with this passage through the Red Sea, for I have the weakness and infirmity of flesh and bloud plentifully in me. And I have prayed with my Saviour, <hi>Vt transiret calix iste,</hi> that this Cup of red Wine might pass from me, S. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.42. But if not, Gods will, not mine, be done. And I shall most willingly drink of this Cup as deep as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and enter into this Sea, yea, and pass through it in the way that he shall lead me.</p>
               <p>But I would have it remembred (good People) that when Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were in this boisterous Sea, and <hi>Aaron</hi> among them, the Egyptians which persecuted them, and did in a manner drive them into that Sea, were drowned in the same waters, while they were in pursuit of them.</p>
               <p>I know my God, whom I serve, is as able to deliver me from this Sea of bloud, as he was to deliver the three Children from the Furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. And (I most humbly thank my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:102404:133"/>
for it) my resolution is as theirs was: They would not worship the Image which the King had set up, nor will I the Imaginations which the People are setting up. Nor will I forsake the Temple and the Truth of God, to follow the bleating of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam's</hi> Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and in <hi>Bethel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for this People, they are at this day miserably misled: God of his mercie open their eyes, that they may see the right way. For at this day the blind lead the blind; and if they go on, both will certainly into the ditch, S. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 39.</p>
               <p>For my self, I am (and I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it in all humility) a most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous sinner many ways, by thought, word, and deed: And yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but that God hath mercy in store for me a poor penitent, as well as for other sinners. I have now upon this sad occasion ransacked eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner of my heart; and yet I thank God I have not found among the many, any one sin which deserves
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102404:134"/>
death by any known Law of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And yet hereby I charge nothing upon my Judges: for if they proceed upon proof by valuable Witnesses, I or any other Innocent may be justly condemned. And I thank God, though the weight of the Sentence lie heavie upon me, I am as quiet within as ever I was in my life.</p>
               <p>And though I am not onely the first Archbishop, but the first man that ever died by an Ordinance in Parliament, yet some of my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors have gone this way, though not by this means. For <hi>Elphegus</hi> was hurried away and lost his head by the <hi>Danes; Simon Sudbury</hi> in the fury of <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and his fellows. Before these, S. <hi>John</hi> Baptist had his head dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced off by a lewd woman: And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his head to a persecuting sword. Many examples great and good; and they teach me patience. For I hope my Cause in Heaven will look of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:102404:134"/>
dye, than the colour that is put upon it here.</p>
               <p>And some comfort it is to me, not onely that I go the way of these great men in their several Generations, but also that my Charge, as soul as it is made, looks like that of the Jews a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst S. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 25. 8. for he was accused for the Law and the Temple, <hi>i. e.</hi> Religion. And like that of St. <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 6. 14. for breaking the Ordinances which <hi>Moses</hi> gave, <hi>i. e.</hi> Law and Religion, the Holy Place and the Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>But you will say, Do I then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my self with the integrity of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen?</hi> No, far be that from me. I onely raise a comfort to my self, that these great Saints and Servants of God were laid at in their times as I am now. And it is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who helped on this Accusation against St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> did after fall under the very same him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>Yea, but here's a great clamour
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102404:135"/>
that I would have brought in Popery. I shall answer that more fully by and by. In the mean time you know what the Pharisees laid against Christ himself, St. <hi>John</hi> 11. 48. <hi>If we let him alone, all men will believe on him:</hi> Et venient Romani, <hi>and the Romans will come, and take away both our Place and the Nation.</hi> Here was a causeless cry against Christ, that the <hi>Romans</hi> would come. And see how just the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God was. They crucified Christ for fear lest the <hi>Romans</hi> should come; and his death was it which brought in the <hi>Romans</hi> upon them; God punishing them with that which they most feared. And I pray God this clamour of <hi>Venient Romani,</hi> of which I have given no cause, help not to bring them in. For the Pope never had such a Harvest in <hi>England</hi> since the Reformation, as he hath now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sects and Divisions that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us. In the mean time, <hi>by honour and dishonour, by good report and evil report, as a deceiver and yet true,</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:102404:135"/>
am I passing through this world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
               <p>Some particulars also I think it not amiss to speak of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first, this I shall be bold to speak of the King our gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: He hath been much traduced also for bringing in of Popery. But on my Conscience (of which I shall give God a present account) I know him to be as free from this Charge as any man living: And I hold him to be as sound a Protestant according to the Religion by Law established, as any man in his Kingdom; and that he will venture his life as far and as freely for it. And I think I do or should know both his affection to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and his grounds for it, as fully as any man in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The second particular is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this great and populous City (which God bless.) Here hath been of late a fashion taken up to gather hands, and then go to the great Court of the Kingdom, the Parliament, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102404:136"/>
clamour for Justice; as if that great and wise Court, before whom the Causes come which are unknown to the Many, could not or would not do Justice but at their appointment: a way which may endanger many an innocent man, and pluck his bloud upon their own heads, and perhaps upon the Cities also.</p>
               <p>And this hath been lately practised against my self: the Magistrates stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding still and suffering them openly to proceed from Parish to Parish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out check. God forgive the setters of this, with all my heart I beg it; but many well-meaning people are caught by it.</p>
               <p>In St. <hi>Stephen's</hi> case, when nothing else would serve, they stirred up the people against him, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 12. And <hi>Herod</hi> went the same way; when he had killed St. <hi>James,</hi> yet he would not venture upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> till he found how the other pleased the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 3.</p>
               <p>But take heed of having your hands
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102404:136"/>
full of bloud, <hi>Esai.</hi> 1. 15. for there is a time best known to himself, when God above other sins makes Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for bloud. And when that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition is on foot, the Psalmist tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 12. that God remembers; but that's not all, he remembers, and forgets not the complaint of the poor, <hi>i. e.</hi> whose bloud is shed by Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Take heed of this: <hi>'Tis a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> Heb. 12. but then especially, when he is making Inquisition for bloud.</p>
               <p>And with my Prayers to avert it, I do heartily desire this City to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Prophecy that is expressed <hi>Jer.</hi> 26. 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third particular is the poor Church of <hi>England.</hi> It hath flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and been a shelter to other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Churches, when storms have driven upon them: but alas now it is in a storm it self, and God onely knows whether or how it shall get out. And
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102404:137"/>
which is worse than a storm from without, it is become like an Oak cleft to shivers with wedges made out of its own body; and at every cleft profaneness and irreligion is entering in; <hi>While</hi> (as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de vitae contempt. cap. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Prosper</hi> speaks) <hi>men that intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce prophaneness are cloaked over with the name</hi> Religionis Imaginariae, <hi>of Imaginary Religion:</hi> for we have lost the Substance, and dwell too much in Opinion. And that Church, which all the Jesuits Machinations could not ruine, is fallen into danger by her own.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The last particular (for I am not willing to be too long) is my self. I was born and baptized in the bosome of the Church of <hi>E gland</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished by Law. In that Pr fession I have ever since lived, and in that I come now to die.</p>
               <p>What clamours and slanders I have endured for labouring to keep an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity in the external Service of God, according to the Doctrine and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102404:137"/>
Discipline of this Church, all men know, and I have abundantly felt. Now at last I am accused of High-Treason in Parliament, a Crime which my soul ever abhorred. This Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was charged to consist of two parts: An endeavour to subvert the Laws of the Land; and a like endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to overthrow the true Protestant Religion established by Law.</p>
               <p>Besides my Answers to the several Charges, I protested mine innocency in both Houses. It was said Prisoners Protestations at the Bar must not be taken. I must therefore come now to it upon my death, being instantly to give God an account for the truth of it.</p>
               <p>I do therefore here in the presence of God and his holy Angels, take it upon my death, that I never endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Subversion either of Law or Religion. And I desire you all to remember this Protest of mine for my innocency in this, and from all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:102404:138"/>
I have been accused likewise as an Enemy to Parliaments: No, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them, and the benefit that comes by them, too well to be so: But I did dislike the misgovernments of some Parliaments many ways, and I had good reason for it; for <hi>Corruptio optimi est pessima.</hi> And that being the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Court, over which no other hath jurisdiction, when 'tis misinformed or misgoverned, the Subject is left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all remedy.</p>
               <p>But I have done. I forgive all the world, all and every of those bitter Enemies which have persecuted me; and humbly desire to be forgiven of God first, and then of every man.</p>
               <p>And so I heartily desire you to joyn in prayer with me.</p>
               <p>O Eternal God and merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, look down upon me in mercy, in the riches and fulness of all thy mercies. Look upon me, but not till thou hast nailed my sins to the Cross of Christ, not till thou hast
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102404:138"/>
bathed me in the bloud of Christ, not till I have hid my self in the wounds of Christ; that so the punishment due unto my sins may pass over me. And since thou art pleased to try me to the uttermost, I most humbly beseech thee, give me now in this great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, full patience, proportionable comfort, and a heart ready to die for thine honour, the Kings happiness, and this Churches preservation. And my zeal to these (far from arrogancy be it spoken) is all the sin (humane frailty excepted, and all incidents thereto) which is yet known to me in this particular, for which I come now to suffer: I say in this particular of Treason. But otherwise my sins are many and great; Lord, pardon them all, and those especially (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are) which have drawn down this present Judgment upon me. And when thou hast given me strength to bear it, do with me as seems best in thine own eyes. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:102404:139"/>
And that there may be a stop of this issue of bloud in this more than miserable Kingdom, O Lord, I beseech thee give grace of repentance to all Bloud-thirsty people. But if they will not repent, O Lord confound all their devices, defeat and frustrate all their designes and endeavours upon them, which are or shall be contrary to the glory of thy great Name, the truth and sincerity of Religion, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment of the King and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity after him in their just Rights and Priviledges, the honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Parliaments in their just power, the preservation of this poor Church in her Truth, Peace, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and the settlement of this distracted and distressed People under their ancient Laws, and in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Liberties. And when thou hast done all this in meer mercy for them, O Lord, sill their hearts with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and with religious dutiful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to thee and thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments all their days. So, <hi>Amen,</hi> Lord
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102404:139"/>
Jesus, <hi>Amen.</hi> And receive my soul into thy bosom. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Father which art in heaven, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Lord Archbishop's Prayer as he kneeled by the Block.</p>
               <p>LOrd, I am coming as fast as I can. I know I must pass through the shadow of death, before I can come to see thee. But it is but <hi>Vmbra mortis,</hi> a meer shadow of death, a little dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon Nature: but thou by thy Merits and Passion hast broke through the jaws of death. So, Lord receive my soul, and have mercy upon me: and bless this Kingdom with peace and plenty, and with brotherly love and charity, that there may not be this effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christian bloud amongst them, for Jesus Christ his sake, if it be thy will.</p>
               <p>Then he laid his head upon the Block, and after he had prayed to himself, said aloud, <hi>Lord receive my soul;</hi> which was the signal given to the Executioner.</p>
