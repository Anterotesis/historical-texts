            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
Boſome opened
TO THE
JEWES:
Holding forth to others
<hi>Some Reaſons for our receiving of them into our Nation.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O me the receiving of them is acceptable, and my ſpirit embraces them with gladneſſe, for they
are to me beloved for the Fathers ſakes, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Joſeph, Moſes, Joſhua,
Samuel, David, Daniel,</hi> and all the Worthyes, and righteous men, and Prophets of the
Lord, which have ſprung up among them; whoſe breaſts, ſome of them, we ſuck to this day;
and who ſtand as worthy enſamples to us, upon whom the ends of the world are come: of
whom alſo our Lord came, that hath brought life and immortality to light to us Gentiles;
who hath taken down the partition wall, that was between the Jewes and us Gentiles, ſo to
take away the enmity, and of twain to make one. Though they yet ſee not this, yet my heart
is enlarged towards them to place them in its love; and not mine onely, but many others.</p>
            <p>Againe, We look that they ſhall come in and believe, and that the time of their reſtoring is very nigh: Why ſhould
we not then deſire to have them with us, that when God opens their eyes <hi>to ſee him whom they have pierced,</hi> they and
we may rejoyce together, after the mourning, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Againe, Why ſhould we not be deſirous of their comming in (if there be any love in us towards them) that ſo if
it be poſſible we may become inſtruments of their Converſion; holding forth before them a Heavenly converſation
to convince them; and that they may come to ſee that Chriſt Jeſus hath followers that are innocent and blameleſſe in
the world; for this Nation doth afford ſuch. And ſo that great ſtumbling block of the wickedneſſe of the lives of
ſeeming Chriſtians, who have got the name; and that other great ſtumbling block of the ſuperſtition and Idolatry
of their worſhips, may be taken out of their way: for God hath among us ſuch as bear teſtimony againſt both theſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, They are to obtaine mercy thorow our mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 31. If then our mercy be ſhut up againſt them,
how ſhall they obtaine mercy thorow ours? what manner of ſpirit is this, that ſhuts them out from mercy, or hardens
their hearts, by ſhutting up their own bowels of mercy againſt them, thorow which their mercy is to ſpring: as on
the contrary, our mercy ſprang up to us thorow their unbeliefe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 30. How unthankfull, how unkinde is
ſuch a ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Againe, Its ſaid, <hi>Rom. 11. 12. If their fall be the riches of the world, and their diminiſhing be the riches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
how much more their fulneſſe;</hi> now we looking for this, why ſhould we not deſire the furtherance of their con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verſion,
even for our own ſakes.</p>
            <p>Againe, It is agreeable to the Spirit and precepts of Jeſus Chriſt, to <hi>give to him that askes,</hi> and not to be forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>to entertaine ſtrangers:</hi> Now why ſhould we not put in practice theſe precepts towards the Jewes, ſeeing they
are ſtrangers, ſcattered in the Earth, and peaceably ask and entreat for a habitation among us: except we can ſhew
reaſon why they are to be excluded in this caſe, and not comprehended in thoſe precepts.</p>
            <p>Againe, laſtly, The Jewes being ſcattered from their Country, and lying under the ſeverity of the Lord; this is a
time for us to ſhew mercy, and not to help forward the affliction, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I am moved to publiſh, as out of love to the Nation of the Jewes; ſo alſo out of love to my owne
Country, which I would not have to be found a rejecter of them being ſtrangers in the time of their calamity,
they ſeeking to come in and live peaceably among us. But chiefly, that they may not returne and ſay, <hi>They have
prayed for us but they will not receive us;</hi> and ſo the name of Chriſt be blaſphemed and evill reported of by them.
Let that lying-prayer lye upon the heads of thoſe onely, in whom all other lying-prayers are found; that the name
of Chriſt may not be blaſphemed with it abroad; as it is with all the reſt of their abominations: For there are many
in this Nation whoſe bowels are as well enlarged to receive them, as they have been to pray for them.</p>
