            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO His Honest Friend Mr. <hi>WILLIAM PATE,</hi> Of <hi>London</hi> Woollen-draper.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Know no occasion wherein all sorts of people have taken greater liberty, than in their Dedications, both in regard of the persons to whom the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement is made, and of the things that are usually said in them. All Authors pretend to disclaim flattery upon these subjects, and yet were Historians to draw Great Men according as they are represented in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, abundance of Persons would pass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity for men of wit, who never made a jest in their lives, and for honest Patriots, who were only mere <hi>Fripons</hi> at the bottom; but tho most Authors are agreed to wheedle and flatter in their Dedications, yet I see they are not so well agreed in the choice of their Patron; some have chose whole Corporations, or Societies for this Office, and indeed this conduct would be politick enough, if the Parties, who are concerned in the Dedication were obliged to espouse the Author's quarrel; others have gone a step fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:52224:3"/>
and dedicated their Books to the respective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they live; and lastly, some of a more Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Spirit, have offered them to the whole World in general, without any restrictions or limitations, as it consists of the four known parts, <hi>Europe, Asia, Africk</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> and comprehends persons of all sorts and characters, those that can read as well as those that cannot, and those that have a Religion as well as those that have none at all. But the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Writers decline this course of Dedication, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Bodies Politick, and Countries, and the World it self, as large as it is, seldom reward the Author, for, as we say, what is every mans business, is no mans business, and therefore they generally make choice of particular persons, and those for the greatest part of the best Estates and Fortunes; not because an Illustrious name gives any better protection to a Book than a Meaner would do, altho this is always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but because such persons are best able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward an Author, and consider him for his incense. As I never knew a bad Book sell a farthing the better for having a gaudy Title prefixed to it, so a good one never fared the worse because it appeared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fine <hi>Fiocco</hi>: For in short, if the world has a mind to be censorious, a Person of Quality's name is as feeble an Amulet against the Criticks, as a Silver Horseshoe nailed upon a threshold would be against Witchery and Possession; for I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that an Horseshoe made of Iron is full as powerful a preservative as the other. Now I had two reasons, Mr. <hi>Pate,</hi> to address the following Translation to your self, the first is because you are my Friend, with whose entertaining learned Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation I have been often diverted, and the next is,
<pb facs="tcp:52224:3"/>
because I can approach you without any of that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony and Fineness, which uses to embarras a young Author so much, when he addresses himself to Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, where, as he is obliged to say several things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Conscience, so he cannot assume that fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity and openness, which makes all sorts of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses agreeable. However I would not have you think, that I am so unreasonable as to desire you to stand Surety, or (what in a few years will become a scandalous word with us) Godfather to my Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, because I am sensible there are several faults in it; nor yet to defend the little Poetry in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I understand <hi>Spanish</hi> no more than I do <hi>Arabic,</hi> and consequently was forced to copy after the <hi>French</hi> Paraphrase; nor lastly to stand up for the Author of this Epistle, for then you must resolve to combat all comers and goers: All I require of you is that if any of your acquaintance should enquire either after the Book or the Translator, you would only tell them that the Book gives a good account of a certain Prince's Court, who at this present wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is one of our Allies and Confederates, and that the Translator is a very honest fellow, who between a little <hi>French</hi> and less <hi>Latin</hi> makes a shift to get a sorry livelihood.</p>
            <p>I have been often reproached, and particularly by your self for fitting idle a whole year, and writing nothing of my own; now th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I must confess a certain party amongst us has given us almost daily provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to encounter them, yet I find they are a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that are never to be edified by Satyr, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all wholesome advice is effectually lost upon them. Suppose you or I should tell honest Mr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> yonder of <hi>Covent-garden,</hi> that it was not
<pb facs="tcp:52224:4"/>
civily done of him to leave the thirtieth of <hi>January, Good Friday,</hi> and the twenty ninth of <hi>May</hi> all at a clap out of his Almanack, and that <hi>John Gadbury</hi> and he may now shake hands together, like a couple of bigotted Rascals as they are, perhaps next year, (as who knows how far a turbulent Reformer's zeal may carry him) he will leave us never an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the Calender, to the utter confusion of the poor people in the Country, who make no other use of the Apostles, but only to direct them to the next Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race or Fair. To say the truth, we have too many ridiculous follies, and divisions amongst us ever to be cured by writing, which puts me in mind of what Mr. <hi>Burgess,</hi> who has made all the Town merry with his Preaching said lately upon this Argument. <hi>We</hi> Englishmen, crys he, <hi>have been famous in all ages for our wars and jars, and strife and life, and so forth: Why, what do you think</hi> Virgil <hi>said of you sixteen hundred years ago? Even</hi> peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus toto divisos orbe Britannos, i.e. <hi>the</hi> Britains <hi>are the most divided people in the whole world.</hi> Thus you see, Mr. <hi>Pate,</hi> what little encouragement a man has to write, since it is so unlikely that he should ever cure any of those distempers that are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate in our Climate, but I haue a more particular reason still behind, which obliges me to sit a specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and purely respects my self; for as I have had the ill luck to displease the Moderate Party by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacquing the merits of the Comprehension in my last Dialogue, so I have fallen under the indignation of the Criticks by being too profuse and lavish of my similes. As for the first I have nothing to say to them, because they are a sort of Gentlemen, to whom I never designed to make my Court, and as for the
<pb facs="tcp:52224:4"/>
last, before I go about to justifie my self, I will tell you a short Story. I happened some years ago to make a visit to an honest decayed old Captain in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and his Chamber was a perfect Wilderness: Pipes and Napkins, and ends of Candles, and old Cloaks were jumbled all together, but what was most remarkable a Loaf and a Cheese lay upon his Close-stool. I asked him the reason of it, and the Captain honestly told me that he did it only for want of room. And this Mr. <hi>Pate</hi> was my own Case exactly, for there were several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the world for whom I had a kindness, and these for want of a better convenience I was often forced to throw into a simile, and to say the truth some, of them were such sad wretches that they did not deserve to have a Paragraph bestowed upon them.</p>
            <p>But now to speak a word or two in behalf of these Memoirs, I am in good hopes they will be favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably received, both because they were written origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by a Lady, which will go a great way you know with the Ladies, and admirers of Ladies, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they give us a true Idea of the Spanish Court, with which the generality of men amongst us, are utterly unacquainted, and lastly because they provide an agreeable entertainment to all sorts of people: For here is Rain and Sunshine, and Earthquakes and Shows, and Masquerades, and Processions, and the Lord knows how much History in Sippits to divert the zealous Admirers of <hi>Stow</hi> and <hi>Hollenshead</hi>: And then for Persons of better Palats here are abundance of political reflexions, and judicious observations, with the true reasons how this vast Monarchy, which in the last Century made so considerable a figure in the world, is in this become so feeble and Paralytic; so
<pb facs="tcp:52224:5"/>
that not to flatter the Work, I should scarce believe it was written by one of the fair Sex, but that several <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen here about the Town have fully satisfied me of the truth of it. I will only take notice of one Instance among the rest to give you a true taste of this Lady's ingenuity. Don <hi>Juan,</hi> while the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of affairs was lodged in his hands removed a poor Dominican from <hi>Salamanca</hi> (which place you know a certain Doctor who pretends he has received more stripes on his back than St. <hi>Paul</hi> and all his Brethren did, has made remarkable in Story by the Chimerical Degree he took there) and made him the King's Confessor. He thought by this means to have secured the Monk for ever to his own Interests, and to have had a trusty Confident upon all occasions near his Majesties person: But he found himself mightily mistaken in his expectation, for this beast of a Religious, soon abandoned his Patron's party, and herded amongst his profest Enemies. <hi>Some People,</hi> says this Lady, <hi>pretend that he did it out of a Principle of Conscience, but as for my self I am of another opinion, <q>il est impossible que l' ingratitude puisse jamais avoir de bons Principes</q>.</hi> It is impossible that ingratitude should ever flow from any good Principle. I am sorry that this honest Doctrin is not in better Reputation with some People amongst us, for I am satisfied that no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatever can atone for so black and ungenerous a Sin as Ingratitude is.</p>
            <p>I should here, according to the laudable Custom of all Authors, take occasion to say something in your prai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, but besides that I will not offer that Violence to your Modesty, I cannot handsomely commend you, for so
<pb facs="tcp:52224:5"/>
great a variety of Learning in so much Youth, but but at the expence of the City, and you know I have too great a respect for our honourable Metropolis to do any any thing of that nature, or indeed without a reproach to our selves, who cannot pretend such excuses, as the perpetual distractions of Trade and Business. Indeed if your good fortune in the world prove answerable to your merits, you may for all I know dye a richer man than <hi>Gresham</hi> or <hi>Sutton</hi>: But I must tell you, my dear Friend, that good Fortune and Merit are two as different things as any are in the world. I knew a Gentleman who made a pleasant remark upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. I have, said he, in my time laid out for two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Preferment and a Red Nose, with as much zeal and application as any man in Town. To attain the last I have dutifully drank my Gallon of Claret eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night, and a dull sober Sot, a Neighbour of mine, with his single penurious Pint has arrived to it before me: and as for the former I have wearied out my Patience in waiting at Court, and at Noblemens Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vees, and yet could never stumble upon any; and so he concluded that several men come by Preferment and Red Noses, who never deserved either of them.</p>
            <p>After all, Mr. <hi>Pate,</hi> if my wishes will do you any good, I wish you store of Customers, but never a Poet, or Courtier, or disbanded Captain, or Player amongst them all. May I be so fortunate as to behold you advanced to the highest Pinacle of honour in the City, to furnish new matter for <hi>Elkanah Settle</hi>'s Triumphs of <hi>London,</hi> to sentence light Butter and Bread on Horseback, to terrify Sabbath-breakers, and those that forget to hang out their Lights, to appear in the next Edition of <hi>Baker</hi> or <hi>Stow,</hi> and arrive to
<pb facs="tcp:52224:6"/>
the Priviledge of sleeping in your Gold Chain at <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> Chappel. In short, may you be the wealthiest, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest man within the Bills of Mortality, and may you ever continue to love</p>

            <p>WE must not expect to find in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral History those particular relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things, that generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Reader better than the History it self: but when any person is once acquainted with them, he often reflects upon them with a great deal of pleasure. I imagine I may without any flattery pretend my self to be capable of writing several secret passages, that happened at <hi>Madrid</hi> from the year 1679, to the year 1681. However I think it not amiss to begin these Memoirs from the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the IV. in order to render the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52224:7"/>
following discourse more intelligible, and to give the Reader a better Idea of the Genius of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his Queen, being dead, he espoused <hi>Mary Ann</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> Daughter of the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and Sister of him that reigns at present. She was young, of a fair flaxen complexion, her humour was lively and pleasant, and she was no less agreeable than witty.</p>
            <p>She departed from <hi>Vienna,</hi> in order to go to <hi>Spain</hi>

               </gap>9. She loved the Arch-Duke her Brother very affectionately, and as both of them were weeping when they took their leave of one another, she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him what it lay in her power to do for his service: My dear Sister, says he, it lies in your powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to have an Infanta there, which you may give to me in marriage. This acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is so much the more observable, because the Arch-Duke having at that time an Elder Brother, who died afterwards King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and being himself designed for the Ecclesiastic State, there was little probability that he should ever arrive to the Empire, and marry, as it since fell out, the Eldest Daughter of the Queen his Sister.</p>
            <p>Amongst several other persons, whom the Emperor gave the Queen his Daughter to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her into <hi>Spain,</hi> he chose Father <hi>Iohn Evrard Nitard,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Jesuit, to be her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor. His extraction was mean and obscure, and he employed almost all his thoughts in the advancing of his fortune. He was of a supple
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52224:7"/>
complaisant temper, he exactly studied the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective characters of those persons to whom he belonged, and took care never to differ much from them as to matters of opinion. He finished his Studies in the Jesuits College at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and there took upon him the Habit of his Order, and afterwards was sent to govern one of their Seminaries, in which office he acquitted himself very well. When he came back again to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> he began to make himself known in the world, and several Ladies of the Court desired him to be their Spiritual Director: they omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no opportunity to do him all the good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices they could with the Emperor; and in fine, spoke in such advantagious terms of him, that he was well enough contented to let the Queen take him along with her.</p>
            <p>This Princess was extreamly surprized at all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Customs, which those who came to wait upon her from the King, caused her to observe in the first days of her Voyage. I have have been told that as she arrived to a certain City under the dominion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> where the principal Commodities of the place consisted in Frocks, Wastcoats and Silk Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; they made her a present of a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them, of different colours; But her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Domo</hi> Mayor who religiously observed the <hi>Spanish</hi> gravity, despised the present, and so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a bundle of Silk Stockins, threw them at the heads of the Deputies of the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aveis de Saber,</hi> says he to them in a very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tone, <hi>que las Reynas de Espagna no teinen piernas,</hi> that is to say,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52224:8"/>
               <hi>I would have you to know that the Queens of</hi> Spain <hi>have no Legs</hi>; meaning, that they are so far ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above others by vertue of their rank, that they have no Feet to touch the ground like the rest of their Sex. However it was, the young Queen, who was not as yet acquainted with the niceties of the Spanish Language, took it in the literal sense, and began to weep, saying <q>that she was fully determined to go back to <hi>Vienna</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if she had known before her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from thence that they design'd to cut off her legs, she would rather have died, than stirred a foot.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was no difficult matter to assure her of the contrary, and she continued her Voyage.</p>
            <p>When she came to <hi>Madrid</hi> they told the King of this innocent simplicity of his Queen, he was so mightily pleased at the story, that he vouchsafed to laugh a little at it, and this was the most extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary thing in the world for him to do, for whether it proceeded from affectation, or was the effect of his constitution, it was observed of him that he never laugh'd above thrice in all his Life.</p>
            <p>The King show'd a great respect for Father <hi>Nitard</hi> because he was the Queen's Confessor, who reposed an intire confidence in him, but whatever desires she had to see him advanced, he left him peaceably in his post, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring any other Dignities upon him, and he had unquestionably continued a long time in the same condition, if the King had not hapned to die.</p>
            <p>When that Prince found himself to be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously ill, and saw he could not bequeath the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52224:8"/>
care of his Kingdoms to Cardinal <hi>Sandoval,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whose management of affairs he always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, because he was at that time extremely sick, and to say the truth, died but 20 hours after him; he made his will, wherein he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the Queen his Spouse should be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the Kingdom, and Governess of the young Prince, who was then four years and an half old, <note n="a" place="bottom">Since the time of <hi>Don Loys de Haro,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have had no <hi>Privado</hi> or chief Minister. The Duke <hi>di Medina de las Torres</hi> had the management of the Northern affairs, and the Count <hi>de Castrillo</hi> of the rest.</note> he named the Cardinal of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Toledo</hi> and Inquisitor General; the Count of <hi>Castrillo</hi> President of <hi>Castile,</hi> the Count <hi>de Penarauda, Don Cristoval Crespi</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and the Marquiss <hi>d' Aytona</hi>; to the end that these six Ministers should assist the Queen in her Councils; and thus the King died in the month of <hi>September</hi> 1665. <note n="b" place="bottom">The six Ministers that composed the Junta, were those that were or should be Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> the President of <hi>Castile,</hi> Vice-Cancellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitor General. And besides these a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> and a Counsellor of State.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen resented the great loss she sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with abundance of sorrow, but she had been still more sensible of it, if she had found her self in the condition of the other Queens of <hi>Spain,</hi> who are obliged to enter into a Convent, when they are Widows, unless the King orders the contrary before his decease; Nor was she insensible of the sweets of Governing. The first use she made of her Authority, was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52224:9"/>
in favour of Father <hi>Nitard:</hi> For Don <hi>Pascal</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> having been made Archbishop of <hi>Toledo</hi> and grand Inquisitor, in the place of Cardinal <hi>Sandoval,</hi> the Queen sent for him, and by her repeated importunities prevailed with him to quit the last of these two Dignities. <note n="c" place="bottom">The Cardinal of <hi>Arragon</hi> being Grand Inquisitor, and afterwards named to the Archbishoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> quitted the post of grand Inquisitor, because he could not not have two places in the Junto.</note> He could not be brought to comply with this request without a great deal of trouble, for he almost chose rather to be Inquisitor General, than Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> although that Archbishoprick is worth 366 thousand Crowns <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he was not able to refuse the Queen a thing she so passionately desired, who as soon as she saw her self in a capacity to dispose of that important charge, bestow'd it upon her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor.</p>
            <p>As she engaged her self in this affair of her own proper inclination, without consulting any thing else but the desire she had to see him made superior to the other Ministers, so she took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to discourse of it to them, who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly began to murmur amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>They read over the will of the late King, where they found it expresly ordered that the Queen should do nothing without consulting their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and yet notwithstanding all this precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the deceased, they saw with no little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that she had without ever communicating
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52224:9"/>
the matter to them, disposed of one of the most considerable Offices in the Kingdom, and that to a meer stranger, who had been born and bred up in the <note n="d" place="bottom">Altho 'tis very true that he had been formerly a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran and it was objected to him, yet he vehemently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, because it might have made him uncapable of that Office.</note> Lutheran Religion till he was 14 years of age. The desire they had to preserve their own authority, and the jealousie which it is natural for all men to have of a Favourite, made them speak very fiercely in the matter: However the Queen being informed of their discontent, took the true measures to appease them. The charming manner of her deportment, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the obliging things she spoke to them upon this occasion, prevailed with them to lay aside their murmurs, so they agreed to dispatch Letters of Naturalization for the Confessor, without which it was impossible for him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the office the Queen had given him.</p>
            <p>Altho all those difficulties that at first threatned to hinder the Elevation of Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> were removed without any great trouble, yet he did not fail to raise several secret enemies upon himself, who envied his growing Fortune. They beheld with a great disdain and impatience the extraordinary confidence that the Queen reposed in him, for she determined nothing without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising with him, and so great was his credit, and interest with her that he durst offer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve things of the greatest importance, without
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52224:10"/>
speaking a word about them to the Queen.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Iuan</hi> was one of those that was the most offended at the advancement of Father <hi>Nitard:</hi> He was sensible that they would turn him out of all by little and little, upon this score he gave way intirely to the Father Confessor, whom the Q. had made Counsellor of State; he then retired to <hi>Consuegra</hi> the ordinary residence of the Grand Prior of <hi>Castile,</hi> of the order of <hi>Malta,</hi> and said very imperiously, <q>that after he had seen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self President of the Privy Council of the King his Father, he could never endure a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was so much his inferior.</q> But the Queen who was wholly busied in advancing her chief Minister, never disquieted her self with think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what reflections people might make upon him, so that without taking the least notice of Don <hi>Iuan</hi>'s discontent, she suffered him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and he continued a long time without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting the Court, until the Queen sent him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular orders at <hi>Aranjues,</hi> whither he was gone to divert himself, to come immediately for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> upon some important affairs, which she was willing to communicate to him</p>
            <p>He was the natural Son of King <hi>Philip</hi> IV. and a certain Actress whose name was <hi>Maria Calderona.</hi> He was privately brought up at <hi>Ocana</hi> near <hi>Madrid,</hi> and of all the natural Sons that King had, he only acknowledged him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were because he loved his Mother better than any of his other Mistresses (and to say the truth she was the most charming person in the world.) or because Count <hi>d' Olivarez</hi> procured this good Fortune for him; for 'tis commonly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52224:10"/>
given out that the Count had a Son named Don <hi>Iulian de Gusman,</hi> whom he had a mind to own, and therefore used this artifice of perswading the King to begin with <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> that so he might follow his Example.</p>
            <p>Whatever the matter was, <hi>Philip</hi> loved this young Prince very tenderly, altho some people suspected he was the Son of the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> of the house of <hi>Gusman,</hi> who had formerly been passionately in love with the young <hi>Calderona,</hi> and was in his time the most accomplisht handsom Cavalier in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Don Iuan</hi> very much resembled him. But if some persons were of this opinion, others could never believe it, especially when they considered the great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and fatherly affection that the King had for him, and besides reflected upon his extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good qualities, which declared him to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be the Son of so great a Monarch. He was brave even to a contempt of all dangers whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, gallant and agreeable, well-shaped, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, liberal, and a person of great honour; he had abundance of wit, and was master of a Genius that extended it self to all Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. As there is ne're a Court in <hi>Europe</hi> where natural Sons are treated with such advantageous distinctions as they are in <hi>Spain,</hi> so this Prince could scarce perceive that the unhappiness of his birth did in the least prejudice his advancement; and 'tis indeed a certain truth, that we see in this Country, the legitimate Sons bred up with those that are not so in the same Father's house, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any distinction between one and the other. But this custom is not altogether observed with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52224:11"/>
relation to the natural Sons of the Kings of <hi>Spain:</hi> For example, they never bestow the title of <hi>Infante</hi> upon them, and <hi>Don Iuan</hi> who passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desired to have it, used his utmost efforts to accomplish it, but had not the fortune to succeed in his designs.</p>
            <p>From the year 1643 the King had given him the Government of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="bottom">He held as his proper right the Government of the <hi>Low Countries.</hi>
               </note> of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> and <hi>Charolois,</hi> and he always enjoyed it, excepting the time when the Arch-duke <hi>Leopold</hi> governed there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iuan</hi> contributed very much towards the reducing the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> to the Spanish Obedience: He took <hi>Piombino</hi> and <hi>Portolongone,</hi> and in all his Campaigns he performed a world of actions that equally testified his bravery and conduct.</p>
            <p>The King his Father having conceived no less an esteem than tenderness for him, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him the most weighty affairs of State, and chose him to be chief of an Assembly of the chief Ministers of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>He was scarcely arrived at <hi>Madrid</hi> but a Council was held, where he came to be informed that the King of <hi>France</hi> was resolved to espouse the interests of his Queen, to whom <hi>Brabant</hi> and some other states of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> escheated by right of devolution, upon the death of the Infant <hi>Don Balthazar</hi> her Brother; that his most Christian Majesty had published a Manifesto
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52224:11"/>
wherein he proved the justice of his claim, and that not thinking himself obliged to consume any time in unprofitable contestations, he had turned his arms towards that side of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that he had matched his Troops with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible diligence, and made considerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests as soon as ever he appeared. Upon a serious examination of the present state of the Monarchy, they were convinced that it was impossible at the same time to maintain a war against <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for them to lay hold of a certain conjuncture that made a very plausible appearance; that <hi>Don Alphonso</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> having by his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant conduct lost the hearts of his people, was dispossest of the Government, and his Subjects freed from the Allegiance they ow'd him; that the Infanta <hi>Don Pedro</hi> his Brother had taken upon him the administration of affairs; that things of this considerable importance could neither be begun nor ended without some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance, during which they must have occasion for their own Troops, and therefore if it was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expedient they should lay hold of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to advance proposals for a peace.</p>
            <p>After every one had delivered his own opinion of the matter, the Queen came to this conclusion. A Letter was dispatched to the Marquiss <hi>de Liche,</hi> who was at that time Prisoner of war at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> wherein he had all necessary instructions given him. In fine, he managed the affair so dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, that the Regent <hi>Don Pedro</hi> listened favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to the proposals, and so a treaty of peace was concluded on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, of <hi>Ian.</hi> 1668.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52224:12"/>This news was entertained at <hi>Madrid</hi> with a great deal of satisfaction, because the affairs of <hi>Flanders</hi> grew every day worse and worse, and it was necessary to take some speedy measures to preserve it, or else to abandon it for good and all. New levies of Souldiers were ordered in <hi>Gallicia</hi> and elsewhere, and the Queen cast her eyes upon <hi>Don Iuan</hi> to send him thither to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Troops; for besides that no body was more capable of so great a trust than he was, she had observed that during the little stay he made at <hi>Madrid,</hi> his aversion to F. <hi>Nitard</hi> daily increased, and this reason alone was sufficient to incline her to resolve upon his removal. She was not able to indure those biting reflections which <hi>Don Iuan</hi> by way of raillery very liberally bestowed upon the Father Confessor. One time among the rest when the Ministers demanded of him who was fit to send against the King of <hi>France.</hi> 
               <q>I am clearly of opinion, says he, that we had best send Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> he is a Saint to whom Heaven can refuse nothing; the post wherein we behold him at present is an undeniable proof of those miracles, which he can command upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Confessor answered, with a very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly air, <q>That he was of a Profession which taught him to hope every thing from the divine mercy, but that it did not belong to his function to be a General of an Army. Oh my dear Father, replies <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> and don't we see your reverence every day employed in things that are full as unsuitable to your profession.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52224:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>As I said before, it was resolved to send the Prince with the new supplies to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and a recruit of nine hundred thousand Crowns, with which they furnished him out of the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that was brought in the Gallions.</p>
            <p>Necessary orders were likewise dispatched to <hi>Cales,</hi> and so the Admiral who had charge given of this Sum, set Sail with eight Vessels, from thence at the same time when <hi>Don Iuan</hi> was marching towards <hi>Gor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ne,</hi> where the rendezvous was appointed to be.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Fleet cruised upon the Coasts of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> and was composed of 36 Vessels and 6 Fireships. <hi>Don Iuan</hi> finding his Forces much inferiour to the Enemy was not willing to hazard all in a fight, where in all probability he could not avoid a total defeat. Therefore he thought it more advised to send his Troops in small bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to <hi>Flanders,</hi> where they arrived without any danger.</p>
            <p>The formidable power of his most Christian Majesty not only alarm'd the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who after a bloody war at last concluded a peace at <hi>Breda</hi> in 1667. and having ceast from all acts of Hostility towards one another, entred into a League, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of 1668. to oblige the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of one of the two alternatives proposed by the King of <hi>France,</hi> who still persisted in his Offers.</p>
            <p>After their Example the Archbishop of <hi>Triers,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and Duke <hi>Ernest Augustus</hi> of <hi>Brunswick</hi> Bishop of <hi>Osnabruck,</hi> concerted their resolutions for the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52224:13"/>
common safety, and made a League, whereby they obliged themselves to endeavour the adjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the differences between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> or else to declare war against either of the two Crowns that should refuse their mediation, and act against the Treaty. The Pope likewise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the League, and a peace was concluded at <hi>Aix la Chapelle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But these things were not so speedily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but that other matters of consequence happened at <hi>Madrid</hi> and other places, which strangely perplexed those persons that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested and concerned in them. <hi>Don Iuan</hi> as was before mentioned, was at <hi>Corogue</hi> upon the point of imbarquing himself, when he received certain informations of the death of <hi>Ioseph Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lades</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Arragon</hi> whom he entirely loved. It was told him to his unexpressible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, that he had been secretly arrested at <hi>Madrid</hi> about eleven a clock at night; and that by an order of the Queen written by her own hand, he was strangled two hours after. The great care they took to keep this execution pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate only contributed to make it spread the faster, and it was not doubted but that the Queen sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed this unfortunate Gentleman to the security of her Confessor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iuan</hi> was extremely concerned at the tragical death of a person whom he loved so well, and yet more enraged at the injury which he imagined himself to have directly received from Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> resolved not to go to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> 
               <q>They would never have exposed me to the puissance of the most Christian King, (says
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52224:13"/>
he to <hi>Don Diego de Valasco,</hi> for whom he had an extraordinary affection) but only with a design to compleat my ruine. They will certainly take care to keep back those succours from time to time, of which I shall stand in need, and whatsoever good conduct I may use in the management of the war, there is no question to be made, but that they will make me answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all the ill success we meet. You see I am now at the port, and yet they have executed a man who was guilty of no other crime than of wearing the character of my friend. What will they do then if I were once in <hi>Flanders,</hi> all my friends would undoubtedly find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves exposed to the malice and hatred of the new Favourite.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He searched the most plausible pretences he could think of, to excuse his going for <hi>Flanders.</hi> For some days he feigned him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf to be indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and sent word to the Queen that he was troubled with a defluxion on his breast, that the Physicians had made him apprehend the fatal consequences of it if he undertook so long a voyage, and therefore he beseeched her to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with him. An alteration so little expected made a great noise at Court, and gave no small mortification to her Majesty and Father <hi>Nitard.</hi> They easily guessed at the cause, and if they had imagined the Prince was no farther off, perhaps they had not sentenced <hi>Malladas</hi> to die so soon. The Q. ordered <hi>Don Iuan</hi> to resign his employ to the Constable of <hi>Castile,</hi> who was to go to <hi>Flanders</hi> in his room, and also commanded him to go immediately to <hi>Consuegra,</hi> without presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to come nearer than 20 League of <hi>Madrid,</hi> which he accordingly obey'd. But it seems this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience was not enough to satisfie the Queen's Indignation, who was so exasperated at him, that in <hi>August</hi> 1668. she carried into the Council with her own hands a Decree against the Prince; wherein she represented to them <q>the disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he had shown at so pressing a juncture, and the reasons which ought to have obliged him to set sail, altho the indisposition he pretended had been really true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a lye from a Subject to his Soveraign was always thought worthy of the highest punishments, and especially under such important circumstances.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iuan</hi> was informed of all that this Decree contained against him, and he was the more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly concerned at this ill usage, since he had trespassed so much upon moderation, in not making a louder complaint of the death of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The man that served altogether to estrange his inclinations from the Queen, was a Captain, whose name was Don <hi>Petro de Pinilla,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving asked leave to speak with the Queen, threw himself at her feet, and entertained her an hour in private without any bodies know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he said to her. It is not doubted by what happened afterwards but that he discovered something of importance against Don <hi>Bernardo Pategno,</hi> Brother to Don <hi>Iuan</hi>'s chief Secretary because he was seized the next morning with 2 of his Servants. These informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were kept so secret that no one knew the matters they contained: The Marquess <hi>de Salinas,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52224:14"/>
Captain of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Guards, received orders from the Q. to post away with fifty of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Officers, and arrest the Prince at <hi>Consue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra</hi>; but altho he used the utmost diligence in this affair, yet he was not able to find him. This, as it happened, did not prove unlucky to him, for Don <hi>Iuan</hi> had about him at that time a great number of his Friends and Domesticks, who would all have hazarded their lives to preserve him from being taken; but by his great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he avoided the exposing any single man of them, for being advertised of what had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed he withdrew in time, and only left a Letter behind him to the Queen, dated <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. wherein he spoke to her with greater liberty than he had hitherto used. He there takes an occasion to acquaint her, <q>That he would have certainly gone for <hi>Flanders,</hi> if it had not been for the surprizing and tragical death of his friend <hi>Malladas,</hi> that he had all the reason in the world to believe that Father <hi>Nitard</hi> was the instrument and author of it, that so horrid an injustice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ied out aloud for vengeance against the man that had committed it, that he found himself possest with an earnest desire to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but what lay in his power towards the removal of so wicked a man, that he humbly beseeched her both for the good of the Kingdom in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as also for her Majesties glory to consent to his banishment; that he hop'd he should never be constrained to have recourse to any other methods than those of prayer to chase him out of that place, where his presence was become odious to all the world; that he found himself
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52224:15"/>
obliged to go and seek a Sanctuary against the violences of this stranger, and that this was a cruel necessity for a person of his quality; that he hoped her Majesty would be pleased to make serious reflections upon the whole, and apply necessary remedies accordingly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reading of this Letter awakened all the resentment and indignation that the Queen had naturally to <hi>Don Iuan</hi>: She flew into the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est passion imaginable, and had made it appear in a terrible manner, if the Grandees and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had not testified less inclination for her. 'Twas a new subject of displeasure to the Queen and Father <hi>Nitard</hi> to see that all the world agreed to set themselves free from his Ministry, and that they had the hardiness to tax him publickly with the murder of <hi>Malladas,</hi> and the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Patigno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This obliged the Queen to set forth a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, wherein she assured the world that both those persons came to <hi>Madrid</hi> to execute the wicked designs of <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> that she was fully inform'd of the whole by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wn proper confession, and that she had never proceeded so far as to take away <hi>Malladas</hi>'s life if she had not been assured of his crime.</p>
            <p>At the same time Father <hi>Nitard</hi> printed and published a sort of an Apology, in which he accuses <hi>Don Iuan</hi> with having frequently endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to assassinate him; he spoke of this design as a thing beyond contest, and declared his own innocence with relation to the death of <hi>Malladas,</hi> and the imprisonment of <hi>Patigno.</hi> He pretended to give an undeniable proof of this assertion, in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52224:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alledging that when the former was strangled, he was saying over his Breviary along with Frier <hi>Bustos</hi>; and that when the second was arrested, he was setting his Papers in order in his Cabinet. Then he took occasion to enlarge upon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of his birth, and upon the considerable services which his Ancestors had done for the Emperours. This Article only served to set people on work to examine the obscurity of his family. He addressed this writing to the Queen, and she for her part forgot nothing that might make his attestation be the better believed.</p>
            <p>Some time after she presented to the Council a second complaint against the Prince, charging him with having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>; in which 'twas easy to discover the high and mighty expectations with which he fed his ambition. That such an insufferable curiosity had been always punished as a crime of High Treason, that it was not only necessary to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the fault, but also the quality of the person that committed it, that the debate was about a man of design, who could by no means pretend to sin out of ignorance; and an ungrateful rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Subject loaded with favours and rewards by the Crown; that it was absolutely requisite to chastize him, for fear lest a connivance should authorize his wicked designs, and put him in a capacity of accomplishing them.</p>
            <p>The Prince had too many friends, not to find some amongst them who had the courage to defend him; there was scarce any thing to be seen in all manner of company but multitude of writings, the bitterness of which only served to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52224:16"/>
animate the interested parties, and make them more inveterate.</p>
            <p>Those that appear'd in behalf of <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that he was incapable of forming so mean and low a design as that of assassinating Father <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard</hi>; that if it had ever entred into his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the execution of it could have been no difficult matter; that the difference was only about a Stranger of an Ecclesiastic, without Friends or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, supported by a Q. who ought to have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him to vengeance, when she was informed of his wicked conduct; that the best proof one can bring to show that the Prince had no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to do any such thing was, because it was not done; that far from endeavouring to take him off privately, he had demanded in publick to have him removed from his Ministry, and that for attempting his removal, he exposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to all the indignation of the Queen: That at the bottom, Father <hi>Nitard</hi> would have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to complain of his ill usage, since he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to retire with the punishment only of a pension of 60000 Crowns <hi>per annum,</hi> which he has hitherto enjoyed, besides some other private benevolences that don't appear; that so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Revenue one would think might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Ambition of a simple Ecclesiastic; who was himself of so vindicative a nature, that he would fain have assassinated the Prince at <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi> and <hi>Consuegra</hi>; that it was not the effect of any particular resentment which made <hi>Don Iuan</hi> press the Queen so earnestly to send him home to his own Country, being generous enough to forget any private injuries; but that he was too
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52224:16"/>
good a Subject to bear any longer with a man, whose rash and violent counsels might some time or other prove the occasion of a general revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Kingdom of <hi>Spain.</hi> To this they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded several other things, which I shall pass over in silence.</p>
            <p>The Court and the City were divided upon this point, every one engaging himself in the affair, either as his own sentiments led him, or as he was influenced by the reports of others. Nay the Court Ladies entred into the quarrel, and for a distinction of the party they embraced, some were called <hi>Austrians,</hi> and others <hi>Nitar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have given you a Relation of what past at <hi>Madrid,</hi> during the time that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> kept himself at a distance from it, and approached to <hi>Barcelona.</hi> The Queen was ignorant what way he took, and her disquietudes doubled upon her, when she considered with her self what dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous effects an affair of this nature might carry along with it, especially seeing it began with so much heat. When he was arrived there he writ a very respectful Letter to the Queen, but did not conceal the resolution he had taken, to demand of her constantly the removal of her Confessor; he advised her to it with very forcible reasons, but they only provoked her the more against him, and she could never suffer her self to be perswaded, that she ought to deprive her self of the man in whom she reposed so intire a confidence, and for whom she preserved so great an affection. <q>She found that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with an affair she had no inclination to,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52224:17"/>
and that since the Council which the late King had assigned her, could find nothing to except against the Father's conduct, she was not obliged to gratifie an aversion, which the Prince had so injustly entertained against him; that it would be for her Glory, to testifie to the world the firmness of her mind in this rencounter; and that if she abandoned her Servants at the first Chimerical objections that were raised against them, it would be a dangerous matter for anyone to serve her.</q> In fine, the extream desire she had to keep Father <hi>Nitard</hi> with her, furnished her with such specious reasons, that no body durst combat them.</p>
            <p>The Father on his part knew not where to turn himself, he was pleased without question to see himself beloved and protected by so great a Queen, and to enjoy an absolute power next to her; but on the other hand, he was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sensible emotions when he considered what an enemy he had to deal with: He was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive of being poisoned or assassinated, and tho the Council had not as yet spoken against him, yet he was not ignorant that he was but ill beloved by all the Ministers. and that if ever it was his fortune to be turned out, the greatest part of the Grandees would commend the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and constancy of <hi>Don Iuan.</hi> These reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons so palled his Spirits, that he often went and threw himself at her Majesty's feet, with tears in his eyes, humbly to beg the favour of her to suffer him to depart: but she always assur'd him of the continuance of her protection, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him any more to mention that thing,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52224:17"/>
which gave her so much pain and uneasiness.</p>
            <p>The Prince did not content himself with wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Queen, but writ also to the chief Ministers, in such vehement terms, that they evidently saw what it was he desired to do with the Father Confessor, and likewise that he would never depart from his resolutions. He pray'd them to second him with her Majesty, and to represent to her, of what a mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence it would be to the State, to send this stranger home.</p>
            <p>These Letters mightily augmented the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of F. <hi>Nitard,</hi> his friends were afraid that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> would betake himself to violent methods, and his enemies had the satisfaction to consider that the Prince would employ his u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to turn him out of <hi>Spain.</hi> But those that beheld the whole Scene calmly and without passion, judged that the Queens obstinacy and the opiniatrete of <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> would necessarily involve the Kingdom in some great disorders, where every thing would be equally confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Queen fell into the greatest passion imaginable, whenever the matter was mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, and finding her person to be no where else in safety, she order'd the Cavalry to come to <hi>Pardo,</hi> which is a Royal Palace within two leagues of <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis certain, that if she had had less fears up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, she had at that moment declared <hi>Don Iuan</hi> Rebel. She communicated this design to her Father Confessor, who approved of this way of procedure well enough, but others that were consulted about it, opposed it with all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52224:18"/>
their might. They represented to her, <q>That in case this was done, the Prince would no longer observe any measures with her, that perhaps he waited for a favourable pretence to declare himself; that he was brave in his own person, well beloved by his friends, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides had the people on his side; that less causes have occasioned great revolutions; that there was nothing left but good usage and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness that could make him return to his duty, or at least convince him that nothing had been omitted to inspire him with a true sense of it.</q> Altho this advice was extremely opposite to the Queens resentments, and by her good will she would never have treated with a Prince, by whom she supposed herself to be injured, yet she was at last perswaded to follow this good counsel. So she wrote a very obliging Letter to him, wherein she conjured him to return to <hi>Consuegra,</hi> and she engaged her Royal word for the security of his person.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iuan</hi> made some difficulty at first of obeying these orders, whether it were, because he was apprehensive, as he told the Queen, of putting himself into the hands of Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> whom he had but lately escaped, or for some other reasons that are unknown: but the Duke <hi>d' Ossone,</hi> who was then at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> spoke to him with so much zeal, and so vigorously solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited him to obey her Majesty's orders, that he submitted to his reasons, and so departed with three Companies of Horse, which the Duke had given him for his guard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52224:18"/>The Queen having received advice of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to give him some affronts upon the road. She knew that he was to pass through <hi>Arragon,</hi> and therefore she writ to the States of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to show <hi>Don Iuan</hi> no manner of respect, nay, even to seek out some opportunities to disgust him; but herein she was ill obey'd. The States sent her word back again, that they could not dispence with themselves from paying to the Son of the late King, and the Brother of their present Monarch, those devoirs that were due to his quality and merits. To say the truth, they acquitted themselves herein with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est zeal; and when he approached <hi>Saragossa,</hi> all the inhabitants went out above two leagues to meet him on the way. The press was so great that he had much ado to get through it, they cried all with one voice, <hi>Let the King live, and the Lord</hi> Don Juan, <hi>let him always have the better of his enemies, and curses light on the Iesuit that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every one scatter'd flowers before him, such as the season of the year furnished them with, and sprinkled him with perfumed waters; the Ladies better apparell'd than they used to be on the most solemn days, made a double lane for him with their Coaches; the air was filled with nothing but the benedictions and praises they bestow'd upon him: in a word, the joy was universal in this great City.</p>
            <p>The Queen and Father Confessor, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a faithful relation of the whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, were sensibly concerned, she to see the contempt wherewith her orders were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,

he to find himself so inveterately hated by the people.</p>
            <p>The report of <hi>Don Iuan</hi>'s extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception spread it self as far as <hi>Madrid</hi>; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst several persons that receiv'd it with joy and satisfaction, there were many that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended some disorder at the return of the Prince.</p>
            <p>In order to prevent those evils that seemed to threaten them, the Regidors and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates of that City assembled on the first of <hi>February.</hi> They sent four of their body to the President of <hi>Castile,</hi> to represent to him the great mischief that might be occasioned by <hi>Don Iuan</hi>'s arrival with his Troops, at a time when the Court was so weak, and the people so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent and disposed for a revolt; that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Prince was well affectioned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, yet he would not be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the lamentable effects they had reason to fear.</p>
            <p>The President waited upon the Queen, and the Council immediately met, where it was ordered to dispatch a Courier to <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> with her Majesty's Orders to send back his Guards without delay.</p>
            <p>He received the Order, but hastened his march, making the Courier follow him two days, on the third he gave him a Receipt for his Order, and sent him back without any answer.</p>
            <p>In the mean time that he delay'd the Couriers coming back, they were alarm'd at Court with the ill success of his Voyage, and their uneasiness was much increas'd in the Palace, when they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52224:22"/>
saw him sent back without any Letter. Some of the Lords went thereupon to find out the President, to desire him to tell the Queen, that they were ready to undertake any thing in the world for her service. The Cavalry was drawn up together, and preparations were making at <hi>Madrid</hi> to sustain a siege, the event whereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very doubtful, altho they had to deal with a Prince who was only attended by 300 Horse.</p>
            <p>'Twas in effect this Guard that occasioned the greatest trouble; the Queen ordered the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>de Penalva</hi> to assemble the reformed Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers together, with those that should offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to go upon this occasion, and tell the Prince, that her Majesty ordered him to send back the three Troops of Horse, he had brought along with him.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>de Penalva</hi> was disposed to obey, but he demanded an order of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Royal, and the Secretary of State refused to expedite it, alledging that the Queen could do nothing without the Council of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that she had never consulted them about this affair. The Queen being provoked, sent the Secretary word, <q>That he ought seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to consider what difficulties he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to start at so ill an exigence, and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they were to the purpose.</q> The Cardinal <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Count <hi>de Penarauda,</hi> and the Vice-Chancellor came to wait upon her Majesty; they represented to her, that the Secretary was in the right, and gave the President of <hi>Castile</hi> a severe Reprimand for giving way by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52224:23"/>
to an Order that might have produced very evil consequences.</p>
            <p>They resolved at last not to take up arms; and to dissipate the apprehensions the people were under at <hi>Madrid,</hi> 'twas publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> had sent back his guards, or that if he had not done it as yet; yet he would send them back at the first warning.</p>
            <p>The Queen having no hopes at all of seeing her self obeyed by force, betook her self to more gentle methods, to try if she could by that conduct oblige <hi>Don Iuan</hi> to send back his Soldiers: She writ to him by <hi>Don Diego de Velasco,</hi> who was his great Confident, and the Letter was very courteous and civil.</p>
            <p>The Prince, who came secretly to <hi>Madrid</hi> to discover the state of affairs, the dispositions of his friends, and what he might be able to effect there, very resolutely sent the Queen word again, that there lay no obligation upon him to expose himself to the revenge of Father <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,</hi> therefore he positively demanded to have him turned out of the Kingdom; that after this were once done, none of all her Subjects should pay a more dutiful submission to her Orders than himself.</p>
            <p>This was to demand a thing of the Queen, which she had no manner of inclination to grant; The Noncio <hi>Borromée,</hi> the Council of State, and the Grandees gave themselves a great deal of trouble to no purpose to adjust the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In the mean time the Prince appeared so firm in his resolution, that all the world judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it would go very happy for the Confessor,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52224:23"/>
if he could escape with his life. He himself was sensible enough of the danger he was in, so he redoubled his importunities with the Queen to suffer him to depart. She returned him no answer but by her Tears and Sighs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that he chose rather to expose his own life to the utmost extremity, than disoblige her by leaving her service.</p>
            <p>News arrived, that the Prince was come with his Troops to <hi>Torrejon-dardos,</hi> which is but four leagues from <hi>Madrid.</hi> Those that were of the Queens party were mightily disquieted at it, and she her self was more afflicted than the rest. They heard her several times repeat these words, <hi>Oh Heavens! this good Father will be the first Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Council of the Government met, and desired the Nuncio to carry <hi>Don Iuan</hi> the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Pope had written to him, wherein he conjured him to preserve those sentiments of respect and submission for the Queen, which a subject ow'd his Soveraign.</p>
            <p>The Nuncio went to find him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and came back about midnight. No body almost in this great City went to bed, but attended his return with impatience, for they knew the occasion of his journey; and the people ran up and down the streets in great bodies, asking each other who they were for. The news the Nuncio brought back with him did not at all please the Queen, he told her that he had earnestly requested the Prince to go to <hi>Guadalajara,</hi> or at least to stay where he was a few days, that new measures might be taken to satisfie him, but that the

It was afterwards known, that this Negotiation passed after another manner, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Prince had agreed to let Father <hi>Nitard</hi> be with the Queen, provided she would grant some advantages to him which he proposed; but that the Nuncio, who had no kindness for the Father, was resolved to break the Treaty all to pieces by concealing the favourable inclinations of <hi>Don Iuan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>Nitard</hi> was informed of all that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, he Confessed the Queen the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and afterwards threw himself at her feet, beseeching her not to expose him to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages which he might expect to suffer from an incensed Prince, that his life was at stake, and that there was no other way to preserve it, but by submitting to the present necessity. The Queen answered him with abundance of tears, that she was not able to consent to his removal, that he should not disquiet himself at all, for she would take care to set things to rights again.</p>
            <p>He was well enough satisfied of her own good will for him, but he questioned whether her power answered her inclinations; nevertheless he resolved at last that he would be torn in pieces by the people, before he would leave <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> without her Order. So he tarried with her, having all the apprehensions upon him that a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52224:24"/>
man, who every moment expects his death, can be capable of.</p>
            <p>These affairs came to this upshot at last, that on <hi>Monday</hi> the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the great Court of the Palace was filled with numbers of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all conditions, who in a disorderly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that was not easie to be suppressed, loudly demanded to have the Confessor discarded without any more delay, <q>That no body was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what <hi>Don Iuan</hi> had said to the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, that the City would go near to be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to plunder and desolation for the sake of a Jesuit who was a stranger, and had no other merit to recommend him but his pleasing the Queen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>d' Infantado</hi> and the Marquess <hi>de Liche</hi> seeing such a vast multitude assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ran to the Queens Apartment, who was then in Bed: She had not closed her Eyes all night long, and had not enjoyed one moment of rest, having it seems received some informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what had past. One of her Ladies, whose name was <hi>Donna Eugenia,</hi> was upon her knees by her to comfort her in these extremities. <hi>Alas,</hi> said the Queen to her, <hi>what signifies my Grandeur, and these high Titles they give me, since I am not allowed the liberty to keep the good man any longer with me, upon whom the consolation of my life depends? There is never a Lady in</hi> Spain <hi>but has the priviledge of keeping her Chaplain, and no body finds fault with it. But I am the only woman in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that is persecuted upon this score, and whose Confessor must be taken away from her by force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Council sate immediately because the disorder still increased in the City, and it was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52224:25"/>
to be feared that it would augment more and more. Some of the Ministers, who were in the Queens interests, were for finding out some expedient to hinder the departure of Father <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard</hi>; but others pretended there was no room left for an accommodation, and said that if the business was any longer delayed, all would be lost: that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> would soon enter <hi>Madrid,</hi> and then Friends and Enemies would fare alike, that their debate at present was only about a poor Ecclesiastick, whom the people hated even to madness, and never mentioned without the bitterest execrations, altho at the bottom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deserved them, and was an honest man.</p>
            <p>Her Majesty happening to be in Bed, when the Duke <hi>d' Infantado,</hi> and the Marquess <hi>de Liche</hi> demanded to speak with her, they could not see her, because it is the custom in <hi>Spain</hi> for no body to go into the Queens Chamber when she is gone to Bed. So they went to the <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuela,</hi> which is a place under ground belonging to the Palace, where the <note n="*" place="bottom">Who is called in <hi>Spain</hi> Secretary <hi>del Defpacho</hi> Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal.</note> Secretaries of State abide. They spoke to <hi>Don Blasco de Loyola,</hi> and would have given him a memoir to deliver to her Majesty; but the great haste they made in running up to the Queens Apartment, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in hurrying down stairs again to the Privy Council, together with the great ado they made to get in, caused several persons that met them, to follow after them, so that when they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52224:25"/>
entred the Chamber where the Ministers were assembled, to inform themselves of what had past, <note n="*" place="bottom">These two Lords were not of the Junta of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> they found a great rabble of people who entred along with them, and began to cry out all together, <hi>Deliver us from the Iesuit, and send him packing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ministers continued a while surprized, and looking upon one another, while the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble renewed their importunities, adding at the same time some menaces against those that should offer to stand by the Father Confessor.</p>
            <p>Without demurring any longer upon the matter, they resolved to send <hi>Don Blasco de Loyola</hi> to wait upon the Queen with a Decree, with which they entrusted him. He brought her word that the Council had determin'd that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nitard</hi> should depart <hi>Madrid</hi> within three hours warning. The Order was already drawn and the Queen discovered no emotion in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; she signed it with great steadiness of mind, and without shedding one tear; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirous that her Confessors removal should not seem to be extorted by force, but that he made an honourable retreat, she procured an Order of Leave to be drawn up in these words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas F.</hi> John Everard Nitard, <hi>of the Society of</hi> Jesus, <hi>my Confessor, Minister of State, and Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor General, has humbly intreated me to give him leave to withdraw himself out of these Kingdoms; altho I am fully satisfied not only of his integrity and his other
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52224:26"/>
good qualities, but also of the great zeal and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith he has always served the Crown; yet nevertheless upon the account of his earnest supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as for divers other important reasons, I have given him my permission to go where he pleases: And since I desire that this may be done in a manner that is suitable to his merits and dignity, I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hought it expedient to give him his choice of going in the quality of Embassador Extraordinary either to</hi> Germany <hi>or</hi> Rome, <hi>with all the emoluments and advantages that belong to that charge. Given at</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid <hi>the</hi> 25<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">th</hi> of</hi> February, 1669.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Don Blasco</hi> was gone, the Queen using no farther violence with her self to keep in her tears, shed them very plentifully, and casting herself upon the bed with all the grief i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable cryed out incessantly, <hi>Alas! alas! to what purpose is it to be a Queen and Regent!</hi> On the other hand the Council commanded the Cardinal of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Penaranda</hi> to go and acquaint Father <hi>Nitard</hi> with the order her Majesty had signed. He who had long expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this tempest, seemed not to be surprized at the News, but was perswaded by the Nuncio's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities not to go to Council as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, for he told him the people were so highly incensed against him, that he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly run the risque of being torn to pieces, if he offer'd to shew himself.</p>
            <p>The Superiors of the Jesuits were come to wait upon him to prepare him for this fatal stroak. The Admiral of <hi>Castile</hi> came thither also, telling him with great fierceness and that freedom of Conversation, that so peculiarly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52224:26"/>
distinguishes Persons of Quality from others, that he had drawn all these Misfortunes upon himself by his own ill measures, which he there particularly enumerated to him. The Father who had been never accustomed to these Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, replyed that this discourse was not fit for an Inquisitor General to hear before all the world.</p>
            <p>When the Cardinal of <hi>Arragon</hi> arrived, he found the Father extremely afflicted. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of parting immediately without so much as taking leave of the Queen his Mistriss toucht him to the quick. The Cardinal was not able to refrain tears at beholding it, whether from a consideration of the incertainty of humane affairs that have no sure Foundation, or else from the particular esteem he always had for him. He offer'd to furnish him with a thousand Pistols for his voyage, and the Count <hi>de Penarauda</hi> with letters of Exchange for thirty thousand Ducats, but he would not accept of them, saying, that as he came thither a poor Ecclesiastic, so he knew well enough how to depart from thence under the same circumstances.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal comforted him as well as he was able, and told him that he would accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him to <hi>Fuencaral,</hi> then he withdrew to leave him at liberty to set his own things in order, and towards the Evening came to take him up in his Coach, which was well guarded: He asked him immediately whether all his things were ready, I have no other things, replies the Father, save only my Habit and Breviary, so they departed, being accompanied by all the Officers of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52224:27"/>
As soon as ever the people saw Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> they fell a crying and throwing stones at him, and followed him with Curses and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations: It happen'd well for him that he was in company with a person of the Cardinal's Dignity, for otherwise he had been exposed to the fury of the rabble. The grief that so rude a treatment possest him with, obliged him several times to say with tears in his eyes, that God had now tryed him by throwing him into this furnace of tribulations, and that he should be very happy to be found good alloy. As he passed through the streets, he said to the people who pursued him with contumelious reproaches, Farewel my Children, farewel, I am a going.</p>
            <p>He was not willing to accept of the Embassy to <hi>Rome,</hi> altho the Queen writ a very obliging Letter to him at <hi>Fuencaral,</hi> and reiterated the offer to him. She sent him two thousand Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoles for his Voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> some Precious Stones, and an augmentation of two thousand Crowns by way of pension. When he was gone, his Domestics found a Hair-cloth and some Disciplines in his Cabinet.</p>
            <p>When there was now no longer any fear of displeasing the Father Confessor by showing respect to <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> every one went to see him at <hi>Consuegra,</hi> and testified their zeal for him. He wrote to the Queen to thank her for send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away his inveterate enemy, as well as that of the State, and pray'd her to give him leave to come to Court, and kiss the Kings hands. But instead of granting him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, she order'd him to retire a dozen leagues
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52224:27"/>
from <hi>Madrid.</hi> He was sensibly toucht at this unexpected severity, and complained of it as of a sort of banishment. Nevertheless this did not hinder him from demanding by Letters, as well to the Queen as the Council, to take the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good into their consideration, and to fill Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nitard</hi>'s places with persons that were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of discharging them well: he represented to them, that those dignities ought to be taken from him, since it was equally as important a matter to hinder him from coming back again into the Kingdom, as it was necessary to make him leave it.</p>
            <p>He demanded also that they should take away the Place of President of <hi>Castile</hi> from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Placentia,</hi> since he was the man that is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued out the Decree, by virtue of which <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladas</hi> was strangled; and that the Marquess <hi>d' Aytone,</hi> his capital enemy, should no longer have the liberty of passing his judgment in those affairs that concerned him.</p>
            <p>The Queen was very much offended at the manner wherein the Prince wrote to her, and yet more enraged at what had happened, sent him a very unpallatable Message, and order'd him forthwith to discharge his guards, as he had engag'd to do.</p>
            <p>He complained of this to the Cardinal of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> and the Nuncio, giving them as well as the Queen to understand, that he could not part with his friends that accompanied him, till such time as he was certainly informed that Father <hi>Nitard</hi> was out of the Kingdom, because he had still reason to fear some mischief from that quarter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52224:28"/>Hereupon the Council met, and judged it convenient that the Cardinal should go to <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalajara,</hi> to engage the Prince to comply with the Queens desires; he consented to it at last and dismist his guards, after the Cardinal had managed a sort of a Treaty between that Princess and <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> by which she confirmed him in the government of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and passed her word that the Father Confessor should quit his places; that the President of <hi>Castile</hi> and the Marquis <hi>d' Aytone</hi> should not meddle with the cognizance of those things wherein the Prince was concerned; that as for himself, he might settle whereever he thought convenient; that they would take particular care to ease the people of their grievances; that no body should be admitted to any of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Orders of <hi>Castile,</hi> who had not served ten years by Land or by Sea; that the Pope should be the Depository of the Queens word for the security of the Prince. There were many other Articles besides these, but not of the same weight and consideration, all tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either to the satisfaction of <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> or the ease of the people.</p>
            <p>He forbore making his usual remonstrances till the month of <hi>May,</hi> at which time he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved information that the Queen was setting on foot a Regiment of guards for the Kings service, whereof she had made the Marquis <hi>d' Aytone</hi> Collonel.</p>
            <p>He wrote very sharply to her about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and represented to her, that it was against the custom of the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> to have any other
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52224:28"/>
guards but the Inhabitants of <hi>Madrid,</hi> that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment would be an everlasting reproach to the City, and would occasion abundance of ill effects, which he there enumerated at length. It is worth the observing, (and I could not forbear to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it) that in this same Letter he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Queen did not answer him with her own hand; but used that of the Cardinal of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi> under pretence that she was troubled with a megrim; telling her in plain down-right terms, <hi>that a man of his rank and quality was not able to bear such a contempt.</hi> The world may learn from this remarkable passage on what grounds the natural sons of the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> pretend to stand.</p>
            <p>All the Courts of Judicature as well the chief as the subaltern, the body of the City and the people made several Remonstrances to the Queen, to hinder the setting up this Regiment in <hi>Madrid,</hi> but to no purpose. In fine they importuned her so often upon this score, that she signed an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by which she prohibited them to speak to her any more about it, and so without any more delay she compleated the Regiment.</p>
            <p>She afterwards commanded <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> under very rigorous penalties, to remove from <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lajara:</hi> He obeyed her Orders with a great deal of respect, altho he was in a condition, by the the help of his friends, that were come to him from <hi>Arragon</hi> and other places, to do what he pleased; the report ran, that he was coming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little distance of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and this gave seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral persons abundance of uneasie thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:52224:29"/>To pacifie their spirits, the Queen wrote to him and desired him to repair to <hi>Arragon,</hi> in the quality of Viceroy and Vicar-General of the Kingdoms dependant upon it.</p>
            <p>This Order affected him with a very sensible joy, and he took care to testifie it by the thanks he returned the Queen, to whom he writ a very large Letter, desiring her Majesty to consider se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously of the education of the young King. In it he represented to her the great consequences of it, as being a man, that was master of a great deal of wit and honour. He wrote likewise to the Pope on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> to conjure him to oblige Father <hi>Nitard</hi> to quit his Offices.</p>
            <p>In the mean time some of the Queens ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies set about a sham decree, wherein she gave orders to the Council to disarm the people im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and return their Arms into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hall. It was an easie matter to perswade the world that this was her real intention, and indeed this pretended innovation so far estrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the peoples hearts from her Majesty, that they were just upon the point of making an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
            <p>This reason joined with the horrible disorders that were committed by the Regiment of the <hi>Scambergues</hi> (for so the people nick-named them because they were clad <hi>a la Francoise,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> copied this mode from M. <hi>de Schomberg</hi>) this reason, I say, obliged the Council Royal to present another Remonstance to the Queen, wherein they desired her to send these new Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to the Frontiers; but she did not think fit
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52224:29"/>
to comply with their requests, because she ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined this body of military men would keep the City in awe and subjection.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Iuan</hi> was now at <hi>Saragossa,</hi> beloved by the Nobility, and adored by the people: the Queen could never forgive him the irreparable injury he did her, in forcing her to part with her Confessor, who made but a sorry figure at <hi>Rome,</hi> so that by way of raillery it was frequently said. <hi>That the Queen of</hi> Spain <hi>had so invincible an aversion to the</hi> Spaaiards, <hi>that she would never consent to the ruine of Father</hi> Nitard, <hi>till he was naturalized a</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</p>
            <p>But however she still preserved so great an esteem and affection for him, thatshe employed her utmost endeavours to procure him a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Cap. For this reason she gave secret orders to the Marquiss <hi>de S. Romain,</hi> her Ambassador ordinary at <hi>Rome.</hi> This soon came to be known at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the news alarm'd the people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, every one apprehending that if ever the Father Confessor was made Cardinal, he would certainly by those steps come back to <hi>Spain,</hi> and they were all perswaded that the Queen maintained the Regiment of the <hi>Schombergs</hi> for no other end, but only to favour this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
            <p>The Council being really afraid lest the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue should succeed, bethought themselves of some means to defeat Father <hi>Nitard</hi> in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, and for that purpose they dispatched a Courier to the Marquess <hi>de S. Romain</hi> to propose to the Pope some other Subjects of <hi>Spain,</hi> who
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52224:30"/>
better deserved the purple. The Queen made as if she consented to the busine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, but under hand renewed her orders: but the Ambassador, who was no friend at all to the Jesuits, managed his affairs so prudently, that his Holiness reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> and besides obliged him to resign his other Places.</p>
            <p>The General of his Order, whom he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly neglected, and who for that reason owed him a great deal of ill will, thought he had now an opportunity in the reverse of the Father's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to pay the debt, so he sent him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to one of their Houses near <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He retired thither with a spirit of moderation that was very exemplary, and of all his Train he kept no one with him but Friar <hi>Bustos</hi> his Companion: Behold here a continued series of Thunder claps one upon the neck of another. This harsh usage appeared so terrible to the poor Queen, who did not in the least question the success of her negotiation, that she fell sick of a Tertian Ague, which continued a long time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her.</p>
            <p>'Tis easy to believe, by what I have already related, that her resentments became more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than ever against Don <hi>Iuan</hi>: from her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural disposition she was inclined to make him him responsible for every thing that gave her any disquiet, and when she saw at the same time the Bulls for the Charge of Inquisitor Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral arrive at <hi>Madrid,</hi> she did not doubt but it was all of the Prince's doing. In fine that place which she had seen so deservedly filled by Father
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52224:30"/>
               <hi>Nitard,</hi> was possest by Don <hi>Antonio Balladores,</hi> President of <hi>Castile</hi>; and Father <hi>Nitard</hi> for his part continued still near <hi>Rome,</hi> but subject to all the ill treatment, with which the General of his Order thought fit to mortify him.</p>
            <p>The Queen was not able to endure, that a man who had formerly enjoyed so great a share in her friendship and confidence, and who had governed the whole Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely should continue exposed to all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments and caprices of his General, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she employed all the credit she had at <hi>Rome</hi> to place Father <hi>Nitard</hi> in another condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clement</hi> IX dying in the Month of <hi>December</hi> 1669. Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> was chosen Pope, and took upon him the name of <hi>Clement</hi> X. The Queen, who did not doubt but that this Pope would bestow a Cap upon her Confessor, named the Father to be Ambassador extraordinary of <hi>Spain</hi> at his Holiness's Court, an employment which she had formerly offer'd him, when he departed from <hi>Madrid,</hi> and which he was not then willing to accept of; she procured leave for him to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in fine, managed this affair with his Holiness so successfully, that Father <hi>Nitard</hi> was created Archbishop of <hi>Edessa.</hi> She continued to sollicit his promotion with a great deal of vigour and application. The Pope being thus importuned, made him Cardinal <hi>Priest</hi> in the month of <hi>April</hi> 1672, and gave him in the Month of <hi>August</hi> following, the title of St. <hi>Bartholomew d' Isola,</hi> and gave him a place in the 4 Congregations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52224:31"/>This news filled the Queen with a very sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble joy, and all those persons who were of her party did not fail to compliment her upon this occasion. The new Cardinal writ a very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging Letter to Don <hi>Iuan</hi> in hopes that this civility would draw another from the Prince, and that finding by this correspondence a means to reconcile himself to him, he would at last consent to his return into <hi>Spain.</hi> But he was mightily mistaken in his project, for Don <hi>Iuan</hi> sent him no answer back again. Cardinal <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard</hi> seeing that the Prince still continued his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to him, laid aside all hopes of going to <hi>Madrid,</hi> till the time of the King's Coronation.</p>
            <p>But since what I have written concerning Cardinal <hi>Nitard,</hi> has insensibly led me to the time of Don <hi>Fernand de Valenzuela,</hi> I think my self obliged to speak of him.</p>
            <p>He was originally of the City <hi>de Ronda</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> and was supposed to be an <hi>Hidalgo,</hi> that is to say a Gentleman, and not a <hi>Cavallero.</hi> For they make this difference in <hi>Spain</hi> between a Cavalier and a Gentleman, that the former is descended of an ancient fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or at least allied to some illustrious house, and pays neither taxes nor tribute, whereas the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is exempt from nothing, tho he perhaps has acquired the quality of a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valenzuela</hi> came very young to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where the Duke <hi>de l' Infantado</hi> took him for his Page, when he went Ambassador to <hi>Rome.</hi> He was handsom and well-shaped, of an agreeable meen, had a great deal of wit, loved his studies, and was naturally a Poet. The character of his

verse was tender and passionate, there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pieces of his to be seen that are composed after this fashion, and among the rest some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which he caused to be represented for the diversion of the Queen Mother, at the time when he first began to have the honour of being in her good graces.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de l' Infantado</hi> being returned out of <hi>Italy,</hi> made Don <hi>Fernand</hi> Knight of St. <hi>Iago.</hi> 'Tis by this means ordinarily that great Persons begin to recompence those of their Domestics, for whom they have the greatest consideration. But he received nothing else but this bare title for the many years service he had waited upon his Master, because it so happened that the Duke died, before he did any farther kindness for him.</p>
            <p>He found himself therefore all at a blow destitute of a Protector, and so miserably poor, that he was obliged to become <hi>Passean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e en Corte,</hi> which is as much as to say, a man that lives by his wits. To say the truth, he was Master of very happy Talents, which put him in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to accomplish every thing he undertook, so that after he had seriously examined with himself the meanness of his fortune, he imagined the best conduct he could use to advance it, was to make himself acquainted and known to some persons, that were particularly devoted to the interests of the Queen. He searcht out means to effect this design with so continued an application, that at last he found access to Father <hi>Nitard</hi>; he chose him immediately for his Patron, and indeed could not have pitch'd upon a better; and soon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52224:32"/>
insinuated himself into his favour by his exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary submission and diligence. The Father taking notice that he wanted neither address nor wit, and besides that he was capable of keeping a secret, communicated to him some of his own, and afterwards entrusted him with those of the Queen, acquainting him with the resentments she had entertained against Don <hi>Iuan</hi> of <hi>Austria.</hi> He knew very well what advantages to make, both of the discovery that was made him, and of the favourable disposition of the Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, and rendred himself so necessary to him that he could not almost be a moment without him. This obliged him to give him admission into the Palace, whether he often came to give him on account of the several things he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted him with.</p>
            <p>As soon as ever <hi>Valenzuela</hi> was introduced into the Palace, he lost no time there, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved all his favourable moments to the best advantages; he plaid very well at Cards, and being informed that amongst the other women that waited upon the Queen, there was a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Lady, whose name was Donna <hi>Eugenia,</hi> in whom her Mistress intirely confided, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolved to use all means to see her: He walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed often under her Chamber window, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an handsome agreeable young fellow, she for her part failed not to take due notice of him.</p>
            <p>In short they spoke to one another, he pleased her at least as well as she pleased him, she gave him leave to <hi>Galantear</hi> her, for that is the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable word with them there, when any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52224:32"/>
devotes himself to the service of any of the Court-Ladies: And 'tis a thing so common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that altho a man is married, yet he does not forbear to treat his Mistress in publick with all those Ceremonies, that are usually paid to the Lady, whom they design to marry.</p>
            <p>Donna <hi>Eugenia</hi> did not receive the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that young <hi>Valenzuela</hi> gave her of his passion with the least coldness or indifference, and he pursued the point so vigorously, and prest her so earnestly to consent to marry him, that she discoursed the Queen about it.</p>
            <p>Her Majesty had already taken notice of him, and he had the good fortune not to displease her, so that to tye him the faster to her interests she consented to let him marry her Favourite, and afterwards bestowed a Gentleman Querry's place upon the new Bridegroom. About this time the differences between the Queen and Don <hi>Iuan</hi> daily increased, and as Don <hi>Fernand</hi> was a man of address enough to sound the bottom of any intrigue, so he did not omit to do the Queen all the useful services that lay in his power. She beheld his zeal with a great deal of pleasure, and took him so far into her consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that she daily gave him some fresh assurances of her confidence.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Nitard</hi> placed all this to his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and voluntarily contributed to <hi>Valenzuela's</hi> advancement, because he looked upon him as his own creature: But tho Fortune now began to dese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t and leave him, yet she absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her self in favour of <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> about the time when Don <hi>Iuan</hi> returned from <hi>Arragon</hi> to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52224:33"/>
               <hi>Castile,</hi> and caused the Father Confessor to be turned out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valenzuela</hi> continued the Queen's sole Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite without any spy upon him, for the Prince returned back to <hi>Saragossa</hi> in quality of VicarGe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon.</hi> The Queen was so extremely perplexed and mortified by the removal of Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> and her enemies knew so well to make their advantages of it, that it was some time before she could tolerably reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver herself from the impression that so rude a Shock had made upon her: but having consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the necessity she lay under to have a faithful person near her, whom she might entrust with her most secret affairs, she cast her eyes upon <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> who for his part still continued very much amaz'd at the misfortunes of Father <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One day the Queen spoke to Donna <hi>Eugenia</hi> to bring her Husband with her privately towards the Evening, because she had a mind to discourse with him alone: Donna <hi>Eugenia</hi> who wanted neither wit nor ambition, was transported with joy to think that <hi>Valenzuela</hi> was going to have such particular conversations with the Queen, and exactly obeyed the Orders she had received.</p>
            <p>The first time he entred into the Queen's Chamber, he was very cautious and fearful, for he came armed with a <hi>Broquel,</hi> which is a sort of a Buckler, that they generally carry with them in <hi>Spain,</hi> when they go to a place where they apprehend any danger: His hair, that was very fine and delicate, he had tyed up in a Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon knot, he had not his <hi>Golilia</hi> on, for 'tis the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52224:33"/>
fashion there to leave them off at night, in short he forgot nothing that might render himself charming and agreeable to the Queen. She appeared in a <hi>deshabille</hi> that sate much better upon her, than the Widdows habit she wore in the day time, which very much resembles that of a Religious woman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valenzuela</hi> threw himself immediately at her feet, and after he had returned her his most humble thanks for the great honour she was now pleased to do him, he assured her, that his blood, his life, in a word every thing that lay in his power was so intirely resigned to her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that he had the presumption to believe none of all her. Subjects was devoted to her Majesty, after so particular a manner as himself. The Queen gave credit to his words, and after this meeting scarce a night past over his head, but she caused him to come privately to her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment.</p>
            <p>His Wife always conducted him thither, and the Queen ordered her to be present all the while to take away all Suspi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion and umbrage. Here it was that he gave her a particular account of every thing he knew, and informed her of all the most secret intrigues that were carried on in Court or City, of the designs of Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> of those Lords that were of the Prince's Faction, of the measures that were taken against her, so that she knew all the most private affairs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho to appearance she spoke with no body. It was commonly said at Court that there was a <hi>Duende</hi> in the Palace, that is to say a familiar Spirit, that acquainted the Queen with all the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52224:34"/>
news, and secret designs: But some time after when it came to be publickly known, that <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenzuela</hi> was this <hi>Esprit folet,</hi> this Familiar Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he was usually called <hi>el Duende de la Reina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The affection she had for him encreased to such a degree, that all the world knew it, and the Courtiers all endeavoured to please the new Favourite: No favours were to be obtained but through his Intercession, and the Credit of the other Ministers sunk so low that they stood only for Ciphers, So they began to murmur amongst themselves. <hi>To what purpose was it,</hi> said they, <hi>to remove Father</hi> Nitard <hi>and send him away, since a new Favourite is started up, that succeeds him in his place, and acts with more Authority than the other ever did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This good fortune of <hi>Valenzuela</hi> occasioned him a thousand enemies, they spoke of the Q. with all the freedom and liberty imaginable; both Grandees and people made no scruple of saying in publick that a young ignorant Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite without fortune or merit governed all <hi>Spain,</hi> and that it was a shame to endure it. The Q. being informed of what was said, resolved to advance <hi>Valenzuela</hi>'s fortune without delay, to the end that he might feel the good effects of her protection, before they were able to hurt him. Upon this consideration she gave him the charge of Master of the Horse, without having any regard to the custom, by which she was obliged to concert it with her Ministers, as is the way in <hi>Spain,</hi> when they are going to dispose of any considerable post, because she apprehended they would have opposed her designs; so that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52224:34"/>
entring into any manner of consultation (that is the usual term in <hi>Spain</hi>) she ordered his Commission to be dispatched.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>de Castel-Rodrigo</hi> who was at that time Master of the Horse, opposed it with all his power, and peremptorily refused to give him admission into that place, alledging abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of very disobliging reasons against the pretensions of Don <hi>Fernand,</hi> and particularly that he had no Title to make him hope so great an honour. The Queen removed that difficulty very easily, for she created him Marquess <hi>de San-b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rtolome de los Pinares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the World observed so advantageous an alteration in the fortune of <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> no b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy questioned but that he was a <hi>Valido,</hi> that is to say a Favourite. The report immediately spread it self through all <hi>Spain,</hi> attended with some circumstances that deeply concerned her Majesty's reputation, but she made no account of them; whether it were, because she thought those persons not worth her consideration that had the boldness to talk so freely of her, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she had some particular reasons to herself not to alter this conduct.</p>
            <p>Some time after, the Marquis <hi>de Castel Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigo,</hi> Master of the Horse, happened to die, and the Queen bestow'd his Charge upon <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenzuela:</hi> if the Grandees formerly murmured when he was advanced to a less considerable post, 'tis an easie matter to imagine the excess of their dissatisfaction and jealousy, when they behold him settled in a place, which all of them could have wished to have enjoyed, and of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52224:35"/>
which they believed themselves to be infinitely more deserving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But they ceased to make any farther clamours about this business, when they found they had a Subject to talk of that was a great deal more surprizing. Her Majesty made <hi>Valenzuela</hi> a Grandee of <hi>Spain</hi> of the first Class, with a double gold Key. At this piece of news all people looked upon one another, and continued mute for some time, not being able to express the astonishment they were in. The Lords as they met one another said nothing else but <hi>Valenzuela made a Grandee, O tempora, O mores</hi>: In fine the Queen declared him her sole Favourite, so that he issued out all Orders for her as Chief Minister, or to speak more properly, as an absolute Master. No body was surprized at this new honour that arrived to him, for they made no question, but that after such strange unaccountable beginnings, he was marked out and designed for the Ministry.</p>
            <p>Being elevated to so eminent a post, he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but some friends to help and support him, if it ever should be his ill fortune to make a wrong step. And it was no difficult matter for him to effect it in so advantageous a scituation, where all favours, all the mony, all the the offices and benefices were at his intire disposal. But as soon as ever he procured a favour for any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ingle Grandee, he at the same moment disobliged above twenty more, who from that time dated themselves his mortal enemies, and heartily wished his ruine, because he did not prefer them: So that he was often heard to complain and regret his fate, for that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52224:35"/>
he could not satisfy all the world, And as the number of his friends was infinitely inferiour to that of his enemies, so the latter began to cabal against him, and think of some way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to oblige Don <hi>Iuan</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> to return, out of an expectation that he was the fittest person to remove this universal grievance, this new Creature <hi>Valenzuelae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Cabal of Malecontents increased so mightily, that there was almost nothing to be seen but Pasquils, Lampoons, and Satyrs both in prose and verse against the Queen and against him. Nay they had the boldness to give out, that he hindered her Majesty from recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the services of several persons, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might have expected considerable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In short, their insolence proceeded so far, that one night very near the Palace, they hung up the portraiture of the Queen with <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuela.</hi> He had at his feet all the marks that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented his several places, a Sword for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, an Anchor for Admiral, a Golden Key for Gentleman of the Bed Chamber, a Collar of the Fleece for Knight of that Order, and so of the rest. He pointed at all these things with his hand, and below was written <hi>Este se Vende,</hi> that is to say, all this is sold. And the Queen leaning her hand upon his heart with this inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption <hi>Yeste se da,</hi> that is to say, and this is given: The report ran very strong, that he sold all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and Dignities at high rates, at which some persons of the highest quality were extremely offended, and his avarice drew upon him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52224:36"/>But what is still the most remarkable is this, that all these various reports made not the least impression on the Queen. She said <q>That her rank placed her above these little contumelies, and that she should be angry with her self if she were capable of being disquieted at such miserable reproaches, that were so infinitely below her indignation; that the most effectual way to punish and extinguish these licentious abuses was to take no notice of them, that the reason why they were so inveterate against the Marquess <hi>de Valenzuela</hi> proceeded only from their envy, that she was resolved not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and sacrifice one of the best Subjects that the King her Son had, to gratifie the insatiable humour of some Malecontents that were never to be satisfied.</q> So that now it was apparent, that all the methods they took to destroy this Favourite, served only to confirm him so much the deeper in the affections, and good graces of the Queen.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless he used all possible means to procure the good will of the people, he took care that <hi>Madrid</hi> should be always plentifully sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with provisions, necessary for life; and that all sorts of commodities should be sold at cheap easy rates. He often entertained the City with Bull Feasts, where he generally made his appearance in a black habit, embroidered over with silver, and wore black and white Plumes, as being in second mourning, because the Queen was a Widdow: But as soon as ever he entred the Lists, and according to the custom of those that design to combat the Bulls, came under
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52224:36"/>
the Queen's Balcony making her a profound reverence and demanding permission <hi>de Taurear,</hi> (as they call it there) she sent a Messenger to forbid him to expose himself. 'Twas obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in one of these courses, that he wore a Scarf of black Taffata embroidered o're with Gold, with the device of an Eagle gazing stedfastly upon the Sun, and for the Motto these words, <hi>Tengo solo Licentia,</hi> that is to say, <hi>it is only permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me.</hi> Some days after he appeared at the running at the ring, having an Eagle painted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Buckler, (for they always wear them at this sort of Course, which is an ancient diversion of the <hi>Moors</hi>) armed with <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s thunder, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Motto, <hi>It is only permitted to me.</hi> There being no hazard to run in this sport, the Queen was willing that <hi>Valenzuela</hi> should show his dexterity, which he did, and carried away the prize from a great number of young Lords, that disputed it with him, and received from the Queen's hand a Sword beset with Diamonds. They talked hotly at Court of the two devices of the Favourite, and every one was ready to explain them according to his own fancy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. He caused some Comedies of his composing to be publickly represented on the Theatre, and all the Town had the liberty of seeing them for nothing. This was the most taking way in the world to gain the hearts of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for they are such passionate admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of all publick shows, that they will lay up the mony, which ought to be spent in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their poor Families, to purchase a dear seat at a Bull-feast. <hi>Valenzuela</hi> was not satisfied to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52224:37"/>
cultivate the affections of the people by these magnificences, but sought other ways to win their hearts. He set several noble buildings on foot, rebuilt the great Square, the better part of which had been consumed by fire, and particularly the House where their Majesties went to behold the Courses at the Bull-feasts, and running at the ring. He caused a bridge to be built at the gate near <hi>Toledo</hi> over the <hi>Mancanares,</hi> that cost a million of Ducats, and another bridge over the same river at <hi>Pardo,</hi> which is a house of pleasure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the King. The Frontispiece and place before the Palace was finished by his order, as also the Tower of the Queen's Apartment was raised much higher.</p>
            <p>He employed all his thoughts in contributing to the diversion of the Queen, and the King her Son; this young Prince now began to go to all the meetings of Sport and Pleasure that were kept at <hi>Aranjues,</hi> the <hi>Escurial</hi> and the other Royal Houses. One day when the Marquess <hi>de Valenzuela</hi> had received Orders of the King to prepare a Chase for him, and the Court was then at the <hi>Escurial,</hi> the King designing to shoot a Stag, shot his Favourite and wounded him on the Thigh; the Queen being terribly affrighted broke out into great Lamentations, and fainted away between the arms of her Ladies. This accident occasioned some people to predict the approaching ruine of <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> whereof this odd adventure seemed to be a presage.</p>
            <p>The time being now come to order the King's Houshold, the Marquess made choice of all the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ficers, He made the Duke <hi>d' Albuquerque</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:52224:37"/>
Mayor-Dome Mayor, the Admiral of <hi>Castile</hi> Cavallerizo Mayor, and the Duke <hi>de Medina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celi Sumiller de Corps,</hi> this Officer is the same in effect with High Chamberlain, and puts on the Kings shirt: The name is originally French, and comes from the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> from whom the House of <hi>Austria</hi> is descended. After the same manner he disposed of the other places.</p>
            <p>Now as there were abundantly more pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers than places to fill, he drew upon him by this means a considerable number of Enemies, who could not digest the affront of having nothing given them, and were less inclined to pardon him for that which directly concerned themselves, than for what related to the Interest of State. At this time they thought more earnestly than ever of Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> hoping that he would come to revenge their quarrel upon <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> and besides they laboured underhand to convince the King, how necessary it was for the better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of affairs to have the Prince about him.</p>
            <p>The Queen being informed of what was designed against her, passed many sorrowful days, and more melancholy nights, altho she had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most continual conferences with the Marquess; but she could never represent to her mind the killing thought, that they would treat the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess after the same cruel manner as they had used Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> but she fell a weeping and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered all the signs of a real concern. She knew very well, that the Grandees frequently assembled together, and that they spoke of the Government with all the freedom imaginable;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52224:38"/>
that the Libels and Pasquils, that were insolently scattered abroad, all tended to defame her administration, were publickly owned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Authors themselves, and that she was obliged to seem, as if she knew nothing of those matters, because she was not in a capacity to punish them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valenzuela</hi> for his part was not without his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy moments, the elevation of his fortune only served to make him sensible of the terrible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice he was falling down, from which he did not perceive any visible means to secure himself.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> who continued still at <hi>Saragossa,</hi> was discontented at his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how honourable-soever it appeared, it is sufficient that it was not voluntary, and that was enough to make him disrelish it. The Queen and he had still the same mutual aversion to one another as formerly, and notwithstanding the fair appearances of his outward behaviour, he laboured under hand with his friends to get himself declared, Infant <hi>de Castile.</hi> At least people report it of him; 'tis indeed very true, that he was never able to accomplish that design, but they pretend that he was not absolutely without hopes to effect it.</p>
            <p>However it was, he made so great a Faction, by the means of some considerable persons about the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were for promoting his return, that his friends sent him word, that the King desired it, that every thing was disposed, and ready to receive him, and that the credit of the Queen would never be able to stand in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against his.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:52224:38"/>This good news obliged him to quit <hi>Arrag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> and make all the haste he could to arrive at <hi>Buen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiro</hi> 1677.</p>
            <p>To bring about this affair with more facility, they gave the King to understand, <q>That he was not only under the Tutorage of the Queen his Mother, but under that of <hi>Valenzuela.</hi> They afterwards represented to him the constraint he lived under in such lively colours, that he protested he would free himself immediately from this servitude.</q> And altho the Queen had always her eye upon him, for fear he should be seduced by any ill Counsels, and take contrary measures to what she prescribed him, yet he found the opportunity one night to steal out of the Palace with only one Gentleman of his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, who lay in his room, and so muffled up in his Cloak he walk'd on foot to <hi>Retir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> which was far enough off: From thence he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched an Order immediately to the Queen not to stir out of the Palace.</p>
            <p>It is easy to imagine what entertainment such mortifying news found with her, and what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects this sudden reverse of fortune caused in a Princess, who had been accustomed to govern.</p>
            <p>She employed the remainder of the night in writing to the King, conjuring him in the most tender terms to give her leave to visit him, but he still refused it.</p>
            <p>While the King tarried at <hi>Retiro,</hi> the people being informed of his intentions, flockt in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes to salute and acknowledge him. All the Lords of the Court made him very considerable presents, so that some persons valued them at a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52224:39"/>
hundred thousand Crowns, either in Mony, Plate, Tapistry or Diamonds. There was an universal joy at <hi>Madrid</hi> upon this occasion, and that for these two reasons, which equally caused it. The first is, the exceeding affection the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have for their Prince, the second, because the Queen was so ill beloved, and besides the people could never forget some words that dropt from her once, viz. <hi>That she should never be at rest, till she had brought them all to be cloathed with Esterac.</hi> This is a sort of a course Matt made of Rushes, that serves them for Mattresses and their bedding.</p>
            <p>The next night after the King's retreat, they made Illuminations in all the streets.</p>
            <p>As soon as Don <hi>Iuan</hi> arrived, he obliged the King to remove the Queen from thence, so she was sent to <hi>Toledo,</hi> with positive orders not to stir out of that City. The unfortunate <hi>Valenzuela</hi> took his leave of her with all the Testimonies of grief and duty, that so short a time would allow him, and retired to the <hi>Escurial</hi> according to order.</p>
            <p>Thus there being a new face of affairs, every body made his Court and Application to Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> and the King by his extraordinary caresses, sufficiently testifyed how joyful he was to see him again. He commanded him to take care of all his affairs, and indeed Don <hi>Iuan</hi> rendred himself so absolute a Master, that his authority became much greater than that of the Queen, and her two chief Ministers.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Iuan</hi> earnestly desired to have <hi>Valenzuela</hi>'s person in his power, but could not tell whither he was gone. At last being informed that he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52224:39"/>
was to be found at the <hi>Escurial</hi> he showed a great deal of joy at the news. This is one of the King's Houses, and is of so prodigious an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that if we take in the Buildings, the Park, and a Convent of Religious <hi>Ieronomites,</hi> which is contained within the Precincts of it, 'tis thought it is several Leagues in compass, and is all inclosed with Walls:</p>
            <p>The King commanded Don <hi>Antonio de Toledo,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> to go thither in person and arrest <hi>Valenzuela</hi>; he departed immediately with the Duke <hi>De Medina Sidonia,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>de Valpa rayso,</hi> Don <hi>Fernand de Toledo,</hi> several persons of great quality, and two hundred Horse. The Marquess was then walking in an adjoyning Forrest full of heaviness and melancholy, but hearing on a sudden a great noise about him, and being informed at the same time, of what had happened, by a certain Messenger, whom some of his Friends had sent in all speed to acquaint him with the news; he returned hastily to the <hi>Escurial</hi>; and finding out the Prior of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the <hi>Ieronomites,</hi> who was a very honest man, and particularly concerned at the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of this Favourite, he told him in a few words what danger he was in, and what reasons he had to apprehend the loss of his life, in case he was taken; praying and conjuring him with all imaginable earnestness to conceal him in some place of safety.</p>
            <p>The Prior immediately ordered a hole to be contrived in a Cell, belonging to one of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, of whose Confidence he was well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Cell it seems was all over wainscoted,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52224:40"/>
so that taking down one of the Pannels of the Wainscot, and making a cavity in the wall which was of a considerable thickness, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a nitch, they threw in a few Mats, and there the poor Marquess was shut up.</p>
            <p>It being very well known, that the Marquess was retired into the Convent, there was no place or corner left unsearcht by Don <hi>Antonio de Toledo,</hi> and those that accompanied him. They had so small a respect to the most holy places, that they almost turned every thing in the Church upside down.</p>
            <p>But their search was to no purpose; and Don <hi>Antonio</hi> could not tell what to resolve upon. He had been upon the hunt there several days to find out <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> who, as he now began to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, had certainly found the means to save himself: When the unhappy Marquess bein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> almost stifled in the Hole for want of air, and besides disordered with his late afflictions, fell so dangerously ill, that there were little hopes of his life. Finding himself therefore in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate condition, he cared not what became of him: But the Father Prior having first taken the Chirurgion of the Convent's word to keep the secret inviolably, sent him to the Marquess to let him blood: This treacherous Villain within a quarter of an hour after discovered the whole mystery to Don <hi>Antonio,</hi> who had been it seems in the Cell, where poor <hi>Valenzuela</hi> lay immured, almost every day since he began to make the search after him. He then immediately entred the Convent, and all on the sudden commanded the Pannel, which covered the Marquess, to be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52224:40"/>
taken down. He f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nd him fast asleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but very much altered by his indisposition and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; his arms lay ready by him, and if he had been awake, there is no question to be made but that he had resolutely defended himself, being a person of great courage and bravery: And besides what would not a man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in so deplorable a condition?</p>
            <p>He was conducted to the Castle <hi>de Consuegra,</hi> which belongs to the Grand Priory of <hi>Castile,</hi> of the order of <hi>Malta.</hi> Don <hi>Iuan</hi> chose to make this the scene of his confinement, because the Castle depended upon him. <hi>Valenzuela</hi> lay there dangerously sick, and often said in the hearing of his Guards, <hi>Oh heavens! and there is no hope then that I shall dye immediately, must I still live after I have endured so many afflictions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he was somewhat better, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the Castle <hi>de los Puntales</hi> at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> where he suffered a very close imprisonment; nevertheless heshowed a great deal of constancy and resolution, in the midst of all his ill usage and disgraces.</p>
            <p>At last he was imbarked in a Vessel to be sent to <hi>Chile</hi> in the <hi>Philipines.</hi> These are certain Islands in the extreamest part of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> almost adjoyning to <hi>China.</hi> 'Tis a long and tedious Voyage thither, and they generally transport their most notorious Criminals in <hi>Spain</hi> to those places, where they are forced to work in the Quicksilver mines. They seldom tarry above two years in that slavish employment but they die, or at least are troubled with a general trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in their limbs, which makes them suffer infinitely more than death it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52224:41"/>
               <hi>Valenzuela</hi> was in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormed before his departure, that he was degraded from all his honours, and that the King had taken away all his Offices, leaving only his bare name to him. <hi>I perceive then,</hi> says he very pensively, <hi>that I am under more unfortunate circumstances by far, than when I first came to Court, and the Duke</hi> de l' Infantado <hi>took me for his Page.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho they took care to acquaint him with what related particularly to himself, yet he could learn nothing of the Queen's destiny, or what became of his Wife, and Children. They had shut up her Majesty together with them in a Convent at <hi>Talavera de la Reine,</hi> and strictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Abbess, not to let them stir abroad, or speak to any body.</p>
            <p>'Tis commonly reported, that at the time, when he was at the Port of <hi>Cales</hi> ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque, a woman of an extraordinary size, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly drest, and covered with her veil, as it is the Spanish Fashion, bustled through the Guards close up to him. <hi>Take courage</hi> Valenzuela, says she to him, <hi>thy Enemy will die, and thou shalt once more see</hi> Spain.</p>
            <p>Those that heard her say so, would have stopt her, but she found out means to make her escape. What she told him afterwards proved in effect to be true, for Don <hi>Iuan</hi> died, and one of the first graces that the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begged of the King at her return to <hi>Madrid,</hi> was to have <hi>Valenzuela</hi> recalled home. So a Vessel was sent to the <hi>Philippines</hi> to bring him back, but he found to his sorrow, that <hi>d' Eguya</hi> hindered his return, altho the Queen so earnestly desired it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:52224:41"/>The Pope having received information of what had passed, as well in the Church as in the Convent, when they dragged <hi>Valenzuela</hi> by force out of the Escurial, excommunicated all those that were concerned in the fact; so that before the Lords could prevail to have the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Censure taken off, which by this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the Churches Liberty they had incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they were obliged in white Sheets and Halters about their Necks to walk to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Colledge, where Cardinal <hi>Mellini,</hi> who was then Nuncio at <hi>Madrid,</hi> made each of them undergo some blows of Discipline.</p>
            <p>All the Kingdom testified an extraordinary satisfaction to to see Don <hi>Iuan</hi> enter upon the Government, and we may safely say, that all the hopes and expectations of <hi>Spain</hi> were lodged in him.</p>
            <p>As he was master of a great deal of wit and vivacity, so that it was natural to believe that the different empl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed him extreamly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of repairing the breaches and reforming all the irregularities of the State. Several of the Grandees had entred into a sort of an Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his return; and now they had leisure to make severe reflections upon the weakness of the late Government, where they found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but private intreagues and little factions, that were extreamly disadvantagious to the Publick Interest.</p>
            <p>A German Queen, an Infant King, a Foreigner Chief Minister of State and Confessor, <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

birth and without capacity, raised upon the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by a strange caprice of Fortune, and thrown down again into his primitive nothing: In fine, all their hopes centred in Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> and they had long expected him almost to a degree of impatience: but when he was once arrived, and they beheld him at a nearer view, presently all those great and glorious Ideas, which they had conceived of him, vanished away like a dream.</p>
            <p>This is commonly the fate and destiny of all great Ministers; the high place they possess only serves to expose them the more to the envy of their inferiours. Even those persons that took the greatest pains to place them in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, think they have laboured all the while for an ungrateful wretch, and if he fails to showr down all his favours upon them, will be sure to give him less quarter than any men else. So small a distance there is from publick favour and admiration to publick hatred. This rule which generally holds a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>imes and in all places, did not fail to be accomplished in the person of Don <hi>Iuan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most people were concerned to see what harsh usage he gave the Queen, and could not forbear to accuse his obstinacy, for refusing to enter <hi>Madrid,</hi> till the Queen was gone out, and on her way to <hi>Toledo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was not content with this affront that he put upon her at his first appearance, but to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her still the more, he added another that was full as mortifying, he descended into a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere examination of her past conduct, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of which had not the least relation to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52224:42"/>
the present state of affairs, and only tended to defame her.</p>
            <p>This Princess suffered with an incredible grief a treatment so unbefitting her high Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and so injurious to her reputation, but all other ways of shewing her resentments were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied her, and she had nothing left to exercise, save only her patience and virtue.</p>
            <p>But several persons of Quality that were still linked to her whether out of affection or duty, could not without a sensible affliction, behold the oppression she lay under. They generally spoke of it with heat and indignation, and spread abroad a report, that altho Don <hi>Iuan</hi> was no legitimate Prince, yet he flattered himself that he should one day become absolute Master of the Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Abundance of people maintained the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, alledging that he was never guilty of such a design, and that if he had been capable of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring any such thoughts, he might easily have succeeded in them, by the assistance of his own party which was very numerous, and by his own power; that the King was but fifteen years old, and besides was equally destitute of authority and experience.</p>
            <p>What occasioned this suspicion was his esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of some innovations that were never practised by any Minister before him. One that made the greatest noise was this, that in his Chamber of Audience he would neither give the right Hand nor a Seat to the Ambassadors. At first they shewed themselves extreamly disobliged at it, but at last the Nuncio and the other foreign
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52224:43"/>
Ministers submitted to this Rule, and visited him without difficulty. The Queen's Creatures made a greater bustle about this affair than even the Ambassadors themselves, who were only concerned in it, and whether they discoursed of it with too much freedom, or Don <hi>Iuan</hi> only suspected their private sentiments, he caused se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them to be banished. Among the rest were the Admiral of <hi>Castile,</hi> the Duke <hi>d' Ossone,</hi> the Prince <hi>de Stillano,</hi> the Marquess <hi>de Mansera,</hi> the Count <hi>d' Humanez,</hi> the Count <hi>d' Aquillar,</hi> and the Marquess <hi>de Mondejar.</hi> The last of whom was accused for making the following Verses, but they were mistaken in the Author, for they were written by the Admiral, who was a person of extraordinary wit.</p>

            <p>Don <hi>Iuan</hi> found these Verses upon his Toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette, and in several other places of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; he was more concerned at them, than in reason he ought to be, for certainly he could never be so vain as to imagine that he was equally acceptable to all the world. These re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments having sowred and exasperated his spirit, he observed that the conversation of the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> diverted the King; this was enough to render him suspected; and altho this Nobleman had set himself at the head of a party, which declared for the Prince's return, yet all his services were forgot, and the prejudices of jealousie, which are sometimes too headstrong to be mastered, made Don <hi>Iuan</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end him to command in <hi>Catalonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He afterwards banished him, and what is more, ordered a Trial to be commenced against
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52224:45"/>
him about the affair of <hi>Puicerda</hi>: thus the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Count saw himself all in a moment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from Court, where he flattered himself long to continue in the King's and Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But that Monarch was young, and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of experience, and besides laboured under the ill effects of a bad education; for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that regards nothing in the world but what has a particular relation to his own interests, will be sure to keep back those lights from his Prince, that may help him afterwards to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by what an ill conduct he is managed. Don <hi>Iuan</hi> was very well acquainted with the policy of this Maxim, and accordingly took care to conceal the affairs of State from the King, with as much precaution as the Priests keep their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries from the people. To make himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways necessary to him, he never instructed him in the art of governing, but perpetually amused him with some little insignificant diversions, that possessed his tender years with a spirit of laziness, which could never fail to produce ill consequences afterwards, and never gave him leave to stir a foot out of the Palace but in his own company.</p>
            <p>The people that are never sensible of events, but at the very moment when they feel the smart, had perhaps looked upon the banishment of the Lords, and the captivity of their King with an indifferent Eye, if they had not been sufferers themselves. But the great scarcity of provisions that were daily inhanced, the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar administration of justice, and the disorderly management of the <hi>Finances,</hi> made them soon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52224:46"/>
sensible, that the changing of Masters is not always for the better. And as it is natural to run headlong from one extream into another, and the just limits of carrying on a reformation are known but to very few persons, so they began to disrelish the Regency, and to show a dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that might easily have been improved into an insurrection, but that the anger of the people of <hi>Spain</hi> is generally weak and feeble, and 'tis not only upon these occasions that the apparent fierceness of that Nation goes off, and vani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hes. For 'tis very true, that the people content themselves there with railing and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, so that if there was any thing to be feared it was from the Grandees, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their banishment, left very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Relations and Friends behind them at Court: These being concerned to see them exiled, began privately to join and associate for the same Cause; they proceeded so far as to signifie to the Queen that they passionately desired her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and that she ought to attempt something on her side as they were resolved to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on theirs, and in short they took an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to discourse the King about the matter.</p>
            <p>They made him sensible that he was under a slavish ignominious dependance, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in his natural inclinations to take the government of the State into his own hands.</p>
            <p>He relished very well the overtures they made him, and the Queen likewise received her informations not without pleasure; but it was not enough to wish well, something of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was necessary: for the King was young,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52224:46"/>
wanted assistance, and every one shifted it off from himself to another. The pleasures of the Court, and that laziness which is so peculiar to the Spaniards made them advance so slowly in their affairs, that Don <hi>Iuan</hi> had leisure enough to destroy in one day the foundations they had been laying for several weeks. The Queen for her part was under a confinement, which held her chained to the place, so that she could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing without being discovered. She was afraid too of finding Traitors among her own Servants, and drawing new disgraces upon her, whilst she endeavoured to free her self from those she lay under at present. What was past instructed her in some measure to fear and avoid what was to come.</p>
            <p>As she is naturally of a slow disposition, so after long reflections upon the matter, she was of the opinion, that she ought not by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate actions hazard the future repose of her life.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Iuan</hi> on his side was alarm'd with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fears and jealousies; and having abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Spies about him, he was instructed of what he did not care to hear, the unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried designs that were daily formed against him. Notwithstanding the great authority and power, with which he was invested, he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear very sensibly to apprehend the bad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of an aversion, that began to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained so generally against him.</p>
            <p>He was in a manner responsible for all the good and all the bad successes of the State, and the weight of so cumbersom a Monarchy hung
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52224:47"/>
very heavy about him. He sometimes consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with regret the tranquility he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly enjoyed in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi>; in fine his spirit was not in its natural sphere, and we may say of him, that he even overbought the pleasure of making so great a figure on the Theatre of the World.</p>
            <p>The war that was kindled 1672. between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> interested several Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> who took their sides in it, either accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their several inclinations, or else the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular engagements they had to the powers, that were then at variance. <hi>Spain,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inseparable from the interests of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, neither spared her Mony nor Forces upon this occasion, when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made a peace with <hi>France</hi> first in the year 1678. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and some of the Princes of the Empire fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their Example, nay <hi>Spain</hi> could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it self from doing the like. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who as yet kept their Swords in their hands still, laid them down likewise, and a peace was concluded at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> that gave repose to all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of Marrying the Arch Dutchess, the Emperor's Daughter: this affair was so far advanced, that the Articles were regulated, and the Contract signed. This marriage was of the Queen's doing, who earnestly desired the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of it; but Don <hi>Iuan</hi> at his return broke off this match, not being desirous to strengthen his enemy's party, as it must assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been by the accession of this young
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52224:47"/>
Princess, who was of the same Name and same Country with the Queen, and besides all this, was her Grand Daughter and Neice. He too much feared the ill consequences of this affair to give his consent to it.</p>
            <p>The King about his nineteenth year seemed to be setled in a healthful state of body, which promised Successors to the Crown, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed a great inclination to be married; he considered that of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> he alone was left remaining of the Spanish branch, and that his whole Kingdom had an equal interest to see him have Children.</p>
            <p>The circumstances of the Peace, that hapned to be concluded at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> made him cast his eyes upon Mademoiselle, Eldest Daughter of Monsieur, who was the Kings only Brother. She was almost of his own age, amiable, well-shaped, of a sweet disposition, witty and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: all her inclinations were noble and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great took an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary affection to her, because her humour so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly suited with his, so that all the Courtiers were surprized at it.</p>
            <p>The King had accidentally seen some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures of this Princess, and several Spanish Lords who had been at the Court of <hi>France</hi> spake of her as a Prodigy. These advantagious testimonies so luckily concurring, sensibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he could not take his rest a nights, he carried her Picture next his heart, and held long conversations with it, as if it understood him. But what is the most incredible thing of all, and yet is related for a certain truth, is this, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52224:48"/>
he became enamoured he could not endure any woman near him, but these dispositions were altered in him upon this occasion, and he beheld the fair Sex never after with aversion.</p>
            <p>All the people were ravished with joy to hear that the King desired Mademoiselle. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the first Wife of <hi>Philip</hi> the IV. was so deeply imprinted upon the hearts of all the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to see one of the same blood sit upon the Throne again.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Iuan</hi> agreed with the King's inclinations, as well as those of the people in relation to this Princess. He sent orders to the Marquess <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who was come from <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> where he had assisted at the treaty of peace, to go and demand Mademoiselle for the King his Master.</p>
            <p>Every one was surprized that the Prince lent his helping hand to this affair. True policy would have required him to protract as long as he was able and to delay the Marriage, because as it gave a Wife to the King, so it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps give an Enemy to the Favourite.</p>
            <p>And here many people could not forbear to call to mind the first Ideas of that ambition, of which he was suspected, now it was for good and all to abandon the design of making himself declared Infant, to content himself with reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the King, in case he had no Children. Many persons do likewise pretend, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the great earnestness he showed in publick, yet he had no over great desire to have the match succeed. They alledge this for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52224:48"/>
that he ought to have done something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so open an Embassy, by way of secret di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatches, which might absolutely have had the success of a negotiation: but that at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, whatever he did or whatever he said to the contrary, he did not heartily desire it; that he was afraid lest a French Queen, supported by the authority of the greatest King in the world, would never truckle to him; that now he was Master, but hereafter would become no more than a Companion, Others were of the contrary opinion, and said that he had a fair prospect of being well received by Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle, especially since he had broke off the marriage with the Arch Dutchess, and given the preference to her. These different conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations embarrassed and perplexed Don <hi>Iuan</hi> to such a degree, that he knew not which way to determine himself, and even at the very time that the Marquess <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> demanded the Princess in <hi>France,</hi> he very cunningly got the King at <hi>Madrid</hi> to see the portraiture of the Infanta of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who was a Lady of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable beauty: He talked exceedingly of her charms, and not knowing as yet that her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was agreed upon, he underhand made a proposal to give her to the King; but he was too deeply gone to alter his affections.</p>
            <p>The Demand made by Don <hi>Balbazez</hi> was very agreeable to his Most Christian Majesty, and Don <hi>Iuan</hi> who received advice of it, did not at first doubt of its success. Therefore he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow endeavoured to overshoot the favourable
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52224:49"/>
dispositions of <hi>France,</hi> either to promote his own interest by it, or else by demanding things that were too great, to meet a refusal, and by that means to find a plausible pretence to break off. In effect, he pretended that Mademoiselle not being the Daughter of a King, they ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for that reason on the side of the French Court to enter into particular considerations, and restore to <hi>Spain</hi> some of those places, that were yeilded up to <hi>France</hi> by the last Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this he held a Council, where he was desirous to insinuate his own sentiments into them, but he found no body inclined to hearken to them. Every one concluded, that they ought to have nothing else in view but the King's sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; that they were happy enough in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a Princess, that was beautiful and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give them a Soveraign, and that they ought not to take pains to destroy a thing of that consequence, which all the world so earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly desired to see accomplished.</p>
            <p>The Queen who continued still very solitary at <hi>Toledo,</hi> and who was consulted in no affairs, wrote a Letter to the King, wherein she told him, she had received information that he was going to be married, that she counselled him in the mean time, while that affair was carrying on, to go to <hi>Arragon,</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> to confirm the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent priviledges of those people. The King sent her barely word again that he would do it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out explaining himself more openly upon his marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:52224:49"/>Ever since the twenty fourth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1679. the King had nominated those persons who were to fill up the respective offices of the House of the new Queen. The Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> was made <hi>Camarera Major,</hi> that is, first Lady of Honour, but her power is of a greater extent than that of the other Ladies of Honour; because she is Mistress of all the Women that serve the Queen in her Palace. She is the Widow of the Duke <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> who was of the House of <hi>Pignatelli,</hi> and a Grandee of <hi>Spain.</hi> She in heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a vast fortune that descended to her from <hi>Fernando Cortez,</hi> for her Mother bore the name of that famous Captain, who left her a small Kingdom in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> tho he might, if he pleased, have left her a more considerable one in that part of the world, where he made so great a progress.</p>
            <p>She is descended of a branch of the House of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that setled a long while ago in <hi>Sicily</hi>; she is extreamly rich, of a fierce imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humour towards persons that are above her, insupportable to her equals, but kind and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to her inferiours.

            <p>She is a meager pale woman, of a long and wrinkled visage, her eyes little and severe, in short she makes a dangerous terrible Enemy.

            <p>The terrible noise this affair made in the world, obliged her to retire into <hi>Arragon,</hi> where Don <hi>Iuan</hi> resided at that time, deeply afflicted at his misfortunes.</p>
            <p>Both of them imagined, that they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to complain of the severity of their fortune, and this soon occasioned a certain friendship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as it usually happens amongst per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of their Quality when they come to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the same circumstances. After they had frequently conversed with one another, the Prince found out part of the Dutchesse's hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; he knew she was ambitious, but as all the other ill qualities of her soul were outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set off by the appearance of a great devotion, he never took her for so malicious and spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Devil, as she really was. He therefore cast his eyes upon her to make her <hi>Camarera Major</hi> for the Young Queen.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>d' Astorgas</hi> was nominated at the same time to be Grand Master of her House, Don <hi>Iuan</hi> had some thoughts at first of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Office upon Don <hi>Vincente Gonzaga</hi> of the House of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and made him quit his Viceroyship of <hi>Sicily</hi> to come and possess it, which the other freely left, in consideration of the place, that was now offered him. But his expectations were deceived; for the Marquess
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52224:50"/>
               <hi>d' Astorgas,</hi> who had heaped up a prodigious wealth when he was Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> having profered the use of it to Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> who migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily stood in need of mony at that time and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the profer, was preferred to Don <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ouncil of State, where his great abilities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question, did great service.</p>
            <p>Altho the Duke <hi>d' Ossone</hi> continued as yet in exile, Don <hi>Iuan</hi> did not forget to nominate him for Master of the Horse to the Queen; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed that place upon him only that he might have an opportunity to take away from him that of the President of the Orders, where his conduct it seems did not please him. He affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a certain air of devotion that sate very disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably upon him, because he mixed too much Bigotry with it, and it was a strange sort of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry too; for this good Duke one evening caused the Count <hi>d' Humanez</hi> to be set upon in the streets by some men of <hi>Valencia,</hi> who never come to <hi>Madrid</hi> but to commit murders and other crimes of that nature. The occasion of the quarrel was this, the Duke was passionately in love with a certain Lady, and soon after came to discover that the Count was a more fortunate man than himself. Nevertheless the Count escaped the danger. This affair made a great bustle; Don <hi>Iuan</hi> who was particularly disgusted at the Duke, laid hold of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to banish him the Court, but now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured this considerable post for him, that he might gain over to his party a man of so great an importance; besides it was his interest to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52224:51"/>
see the Chief Offices of the Queen's House fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with those persons that were at his devotion, and might prepossess the mind of that Young Princess in favour of him. The other Officers of her House were likewise nominated about the beginning of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time the Marquess <hi>de Mansera Mayor Domo</hi> to the Queen Mother was fined a hundred thousand Crowns, which he paid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nail. After this manner the King some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times punishes the crimes that the Grandees commit against him. He was soon after ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished to the Castle <hi>de Cocchia,</hi> and his place was given to the Count <hi>de Chincho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> But the Queen being highly incensed at these proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, declared that she would never suffer it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that the Widow of <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth, and Mother of <hi>Charles</hi> the second ought not to be treated after this unworthy manner, so they were forced to let the matter drop, and proceed no farther in it.</p>
            <p>There happened a little after another business, that occasioned a great clamour. Don <hi>Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co de Toledo,</hi> second Son of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> the Count <hi>de Mirande</hi> Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Marquess <hi>de Valero</hi> Son of the Duke <hi>de Bejar,</hi> and the eldest Son of the Duke <hi>de Sessa</hi> occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the escape of a man, that was accused of great crimes. The manner whereby they brought it about, was this. They sent a woman with a basket of Fish to stand near the Prison, she sold such good pennyworths there, that a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the purpose having informed the Jaylor, and the Keepers of it, they presently
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52224:51"/>
ran to the place to buy some Fish. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man amused them with abundance of foolish stories so well, that she succeeded in her design, for in the mean time the above-mentioned Lords broke open the Prison Gates.</p>
            <p>The King ordered all of them to be arrested, however this affair, like others of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at <hi>Madrid,</hi> brought no ill consequences upon them.</p>
            <p>The King took all the care imaginable to have the young Queens Apartments in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace fitted up, and made ready. He was to have gone according to the usual custom, in the month of <hi>April</hi> to <hi>Aranjues,</hi> but Don <hi>Iuan</hi> hindred him, because that place was too near <hi>Toledo,</hi> so he went to <hi>Buen-Retiro.</hi> The Queen Mother wrote to him thither, desiring that he would be pleased to come and see her; but tho she prest it with a great deal of tenderness and importunity, she was not able to succeed in her desires.</p>
            <p>He diverted himself every day with hunting and seeing Comedies, either at <hi>Pardo</hi> or <hi>Zar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuela,</hi> which are two Houses of Pleasure belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Opera <hi>d' Alcine</hi> was represented before him, it cost a world of mony, but was miserably performed.</p>
            <p>There was likewise a Bull-feast kept, where two young Cavaliers unfortunately perished: On the following day there was running at the ring.</p>
            <p>About this time the Prince <hi>de Ligne</hi> arrived, and a day or two after kissed his Majestys hand, and took his place at the Council of State. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52224:52"/>
               <hi>Francis de Relux</hi> a Dominican came like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from <hi>Salamanca,</hi> where he had been Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor of Divinity, and was chosen by Don <hi>Iuan</hi> to be the Kings Confessor. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had engaged that he should submit himself intirely to Don <hi>Iuan</hi>'s will, who accepted him upon his parole. At this time the Cardinal <hi>de Portacarero</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Toledo</hi> returned from <hi>Rome.</hi> The Court at <hi>Madrid</hi> was very full and numerous.</p>
            <p>On the twentieth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> named the Marquess <hi>de Villars</hi> to be his Ambassador in <hi>Spain,</hi> who was at that time under the same Character at <hi>Savoy.</hi> He was known to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> for in the year 1673. he resided there in quality of Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; he arrived at <hi>Madrid</hi> on the seventeenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> and those persons that were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the disposition of Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much doubted whether he would meet with that reception, which he might reasonably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise himself: they knew well enough that the natural haughtiness of Don <hi>Iuan</hi> would never comply with the instructions of that Minister, who to be sure would never go to visit the Prince, unless he were assured beforehand of receiving the honour of the Hand, the Step and the Chair; that Don <hi>Iuan</hi> would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to this proposal, because it was not to be imagined that he would easily give up the rights he had obtained over the other Ambassadors, and that it would be an inconvenient thing for him of <hi>France</hi> not to treat directly with the chief Minister. What people surmised upon
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52224:52"/>
this occasion really happened, for the Prince would not bate him an ace, and the Marquess <hi>de Villars</hi> kept fast to his instructions. Therefore they looked upon one another with great cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but nevertheless this did not hinder the Ambassador from having a private Audience of the King on the eighth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and a publick one a little after, upon the conclusion of his Marriage with Mademoiselle.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Iuan</hi> had three fits of a Tertian Ague towards the beginning of <hi>Iuly.</hi> On the thirteenth the Secretary of the Marquess <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, who brought word that the King had consented to the marriage of Mademoiselle with the King of <hi>Spain</hi>: Nothing is equal to the joy that he shew'd upon this account, for he had expected the news with the greatest impatience. He ordered <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be sung at our Ladies <hi>d' Atocha,</hi> all the Houses in the City were illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with white Wax Tapers, and Bonefires were to be seen in every street. An hundred and fifty Cavaliers of the best Families in the Kingdom performed a Masquerade on horse-back, that consisted only of some embroiderie, Tiffany Ribbons and Feathers; for they were apparalled in black as they used to be, but were not masqued at all. After this manner they ran all night, every man carrying a Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaux in his hand: all these divertisements last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three days and three nights. A Courier ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived soon after, who brought the contract of the King's marriage, this was soon communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Queen Mother, who exprest a great deal of joy at it. The Ratification was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52224:53"/>
sent back, and Bonefires were made as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>While the people did thus endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press their zeal to the King, the servants of the Queen Mother were busied in finding out some means or other to advance her return. The Marquess <hi>de Villars</hi> had refused to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the other Ambassadors in the conduct they used towards Don <hi>Iuan</hi> upon the occasion of those new customs, which they suffered him to establish; and this seemed a favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to perswade the enemies of the Prince, that Monsieur <hi>de Villars</hi> had some secret instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which were not favourable to him. They flattered themselves immediately with the hopes of making him one of their party, and believed it would extreamly strengthen their own side if they could once bring him over to them. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this consideration, the greater part of the Courtiers applauded him mightily for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, and made him abundance of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon that score. He was respected at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and had the good fortune to find out several of his friends again, and the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shewed a particular esteem for him. She gave him a very obliging proof of this, when he came to wait upon her at <hi>Toledo</hi>; for after publick Audience was over, she was pleased to entertain him in private about her own Affairs, and testified what an entire confidence she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in him: But altho several proposals were made to him, to be of a party against the Prince, and besides his own natural disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion led him to espouse the quarrel of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52224:53"/>
who opposed a Minister, whose civilities he had no great reason to applaud, yet he was of opinion that in this present conjuncture it would be his best way to remain Neuter.</p>
            <p>He considered still, that the marriage of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with Mademoiselle would bring along with it some agreements that were not to be expected before the arrival of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that it was a sure unfailing way to oppose one power to another, that this young Princess would never suffer theMinister of <hi>France</hi> to be run down in that Court where she was to become the Mistress and sole delight, that it was certain she would link her self to the interests of the Queen Mother; that the most Christian Queen who loved both the one and the other very affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, would be sure to give her this in charge before her departure amongst the other counsels, which she was always to observe; that their credit being united together and seconded by all those persons, that desired another Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Don <hi>Iuan</hi> would without question find himself obliged to give way. Most persons reasoned after the same manner upon this affair, and encouraged one another to stand firm against the Favourite; they now began to speak those things aloud which before they were almost afraid to mutter in private, they complained of him, and importuned the King to call the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles home, and openly promoted the return of Queen Mother. Don <hi>Iuan</hi> was now more disquieted than ever: the appearance only of his fall had prevailed with several persons, who ought to have been his Creatures, to abandon
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52224:54"/>
him for good and all; and as for those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, they had neither authority, nor merit enough to support him. He could scarce find any comfort but when he was alone, but this sort of conduct does not always afford a man a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary; for even the silence, the retirement, and the infinite reflections we make are rather apt to perplex and disturb, than to relieve our spirits. He was still more afflicted, when he saw some of his friends, or at least such as he believed to be so, embrace the interests that were directly opposite to his, and he knew they employed the Confessor's credit with the King to bring all these matters about.</p>
            <p>I have already told you, that Don <hi>Iuan</hi> was the man who caused him to come from <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi> and after he had advanced him to this preferment, thought he might ever after have him at his devotion. Nevertheless, whether he had promised him nothing, or really broke his word, 'tis certain he quitted the Prince's party, and caballed amongst his enemies. Some people pretend that this proceeded from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Conscience, but it is impossible that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude should ever flow from a good princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. However it was, he obtained for the Princess <hi>de Stillano,</hi> who was the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Daughter, the return of her Husband. Don <hi>Iuan</hi> had absolutely refused it, and found so little credit upon this occasion, that he was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly afflicted at it: for the thing it seems was pushed so far, that the King out of pure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance to his Confessor said <hi>it signifies nothing that Don</hi> Juan <hi>opposes it, 'tis enough that I would
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52224:54"/>
have it so.</hi> These few words very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the Prince's melancholy; but as misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes seldom come unattended, there happened another mortification upon the account of the Duke of <hi>Ossone,</hi> who was in the number of the Exiles. The Prince had sent him notice by some of his friends, that he desired him to throw up his place of Master of the Horse to the new Queen, which he had lately bestowed upon him, but he rejected his proposal with the greatest scorn imagi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able. Don <hi>Iuan</hi> was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily enraged at it, and would have banished him farther off, to make him sensible of his power, and of the affront he had done him in pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to oppose his intentions: but he was so far from succeeding in his project, that he saw the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> who hitherto kept fair measures with him, had prevailed with the King to recall the Duke <hi>d' Ossone.</hi> The Son of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had married the Daughter of the Duke <hi>d' Ossone,</hi> and this occasioned the great friendship between them. The pretence was, that it was necessary for him to be with the Queen, and the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> having found a favourable opportunity, told the King that he was not a little concerned to see a man of the Duke <hi>d' Ossone</hi>'s quality, who had the honour to possess one of the highest Offices in the Queens House, banished so far from Court, at a time when all those persons that ought to serve her, should be making preparations to meet her. The King consented to his return, as likewise to the Count <hi>de Montereys,</hi> upon condition that they should neither make nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any visits at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:52224:55"/>A general custom seldom fails to hold true for any particular person, and 'tis an usual obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that when we begin to receive any one misfortune, we ought to expect another. Don <hi>Iuan</hi> being perswaded that he was not happy enough to be excepted from this invidious rule, was desirous to strengthen his party by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Constable of <hi>Castile</hi>; but he met with a very unlucky rub in his way, for having engaged the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> to propose an accommodation to him, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Constable calling to mind the insupportable pride wherewith Don <hi>Iuan</hi> had formerly treated him, and therefore still looking upon the Prince as his formidable enemy, answered very coldly, that the time was past. To encrease his troubles, all those that were exiled came into favour, for they took an opportunity to solicit their return whilst he was sick, and made such advantages of that conjuncture, and pushed matters so home, that the King was resolved to call home the Queen Mother. While they were deliberating upon the conduct, that was to be observed in this affair, the King held a long Conversation with the Inquisitor General; he sent his Confessor to acquaint the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> of the House <hi>de la Cerda,</hi> and the Count <hi>d' Oropeza</hi> of the House of <hi>Braganza</hi> to meet at an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hour at the Inquisitors. When they were met, the King sent them word by the aforementioned Father <hi>Relux</hi> to advise him of the best method to remove Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> and recall the Queen Mother. The day was spent in Conference, and after all, it was unanimous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52224:55"/>
agreed that the King should depart from the Palace as if he were going out to hunt, and that before his return he should send word to the Prince to withdraw immediately. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was not put in execution, the Prince knew not a syllable of the matter, and for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and courage the design fell.</p>
            <p>On the twenty sixth of <hi>Iune,</hi> a Bull feast was kept, where there was very good sport, at the same time the Marquess <hi>de Fuentes</hi> got to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Our Ambassador made his entry on the thirteenth of <hi>August,</hi> and we did not fail to go to some of our Friends to behold the Show. 'Tis a custom there for the King to send the Ambassador a certain number of Horses out of his own Stable both for himself and his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, for the Ambassadors make their entry on Horseback; next morning the <hi>Major Domo</hi> in waiting, the Conductor of the Ambassadors and his Deputy accompanied him from his own House to the Palace. In his publick Audience, which he had of the King, he always spoke in <hi>French</hi>; the procession of his Entry was a long time interrupted by the opiniatrete of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador of <hi>Malta,</hi> who pretended that his Coach ought immediately to follow that of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassador, who was the last Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador of the Chappel, in such manner that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52224:56"/>
he was got before the second Coaches of the Marquess <hi>de Villars:</hi> but to put an end to the dispute, the Conductor of the Ambassadors was sent to the Palace, where every thing was adjusted to the advantage of the Ambassador of <hi>France,</hi> and the pretensions of him of <hi>Malta,</hi> who was Don <hi>Diego de Bracamonte,</hi> were adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ill grounded, since the Ambassadors of Crowned Heads never gave him the Right Hand at their Houses. After some instances on his side, his Coach withdrew; he is the first Ambassador of <hi>Malta</hi> that ever aspired to this honour.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Rodrigo de Silva de Mendoza,</hi> Duke <hi>de Pastrane &amp; de l' Infantado,</hi> having been named by the King to go Ambassador extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> and to carry the presents of Marriage to Mademoiselle, went immediately to <hi>Toledo</hi> to receive Orders of the Queen Mother, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to <hi>Madrid,</hi> he departed from thence with a dozen Postillions, and six Trumpeters clad in green Velvet embroidered with Gold: He had several Gentlemen, and Pages with him, and his two Brothers Don <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and Don <hi>Gaspar de Silva</hi> accompanied him in his journey.

            <p>The Ministers and Grandees went to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the King on St. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s day, because it was the Birth-day of the young Queen; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with with a more pleasant air than was his usual manner, and having abundance of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones in his Hat, he told them that he wore them <hi>for the sake of the Queen.</hi> The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Portocarero</hi> came to wait upon his Majesty, he went from <hi>Madrid</hi> to <hi>Toledo</hi> very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented; and told some persons, that if the King did not receive him with more honour, than he did the first time, he would never come back again to Court; but he had reason enough now to be satisfied, for as he came out of the Coach he found the Halberdiers of the Guards under their Arms, touching the pavement with

their Halberds, as they always use to do when the King passes by. So great and so welcom a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception made him resolve not to give the right hand to Ambassadors and to the Grandees, which at first a little displeased some people, but the Dukes <hi>de Medina Celi, d' Ossone,</hi> and <hi>Alva,</hi> the Popes Nuncio, and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador having made him a visit, were pleased to submit to the new regulation he had establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which some others followed after their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise gave order, that as soon as ever he was dead, they should remove his Cabinet, which was filled with Papers of great importance, out of his own Apartment to that of the King.

               </gap>mestick affairs. He was born a Libertine, and lived private, and could not fix himself so as to make a regular Court either to the King or the Chief Minister. He was of opinion that whatever is done by constraint cannot be recompenced by all the favours of fortune, he communicated himself to a very few persons, whether it were, because he had too exquisite and nice a tast to accommodate himself to all the world, or because he was a lover of soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which the most delicious Gardens and the finest House in <hi>Madrid</hi> recommended to him. Formerly he kept some Mistresses, for whose sakes he almost ruined himself. He was Master of the Horse to the King.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>d' Astorgas</hi> of the family <hi>d' Ozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> was in his time a person of the greatest gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry in the world, and notwithstanding the disadvantage of being 68. years old, continued still to be so. He was of a chearful lively Spirit, and talked justly and well upon all occasions. He was Grand Master of the young Queens Horse; his Lady having entertained an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable jealousie and hatred against a young beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful woman, for whom he had an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary affection, found an occasion to kill her,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52224:62"/>
took out her heart and made a Ragoo of it. When her Husband had eaten part of it, she asked him how he liked it, he answered very well. I am much surprized at it, says she, for 'tis the heart of your Mistress, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drew out her Head, all bloody as it was, from under her Farthingal, and so threw it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Table, where he was with several of his friends.

               </gap>eply he was concerned at so tragical a sight, she saved her self in a Convent, whither she retired full of rage and jealousie, and never stirred out of it. The Marquess's affliction was so great, that it had like to have made an end of him. He was exceeding rich.</p>
            <p>The Prince <hi>de Stillano</hi> of the House of <hi>Gus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and Duke <hi>de Medina de las Torres,</hi> had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wit, and if he had joyned a little more experience to his natural parts, had assuredly been capable of the greatest things. But he was never out of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and lived an effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate lazy life there, which alienated his mind from all manner of business. He lived at <hi>la Floride</hi> near the Gates of <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he had charming Gardens, and continued there under so unconcerned a state, that he neither received nor made any visits, and never endeavoured to draw any advantages from the Court; he had a prodigious estate, but for all that it was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently intangled, for want of putting every thing in order. When he married the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Duke <hi>d' Albe</hi> he ordered a Sedan to be made for her all covered over with plates of Gold, and garnished with Coral; but when it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52224:62"/>
was finished, no body was found strong enough to carry it. He was 42. years old, and was deeply in the interests of the Queen Mother.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>d' Ossone</hi> of the House <hi>de Giron</hi> was Master both of good and bad qualities, that equally distinguished him. He loved his friends passionately, and served them freely with his credit and purse, he was of a liberal temper, and a great adorer of Ladies, sparing no cost to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate himself with them; he was an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable enemy, and withall was of a proud naughty imperious humour, that made him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable to all the world; and yet his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation was diverting and pleasant enough, when he could leave off his grandeur and Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domontadoes. He was a man of an inflexible steadiness, and always had some quarrel or other in Court or City. He was one of the richest Noblemen in <hi>Spain,</hi> and might be about 49. years old. He had been Vice Roy of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> President of the Orders, and was Master of the Horse to the young Queen.</p>

            <p>Don <hi>Vincente Gonzagua,</hi> Prince <hi>de Guastalla,</hi> had never been married, he was a very polite witty person, and came very young to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Court, where he ran through most of the considerable Posts, and always acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self well in them. He had been Vice-Roy of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52224:63"/>
               <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and being a man of singular integrity, Don <hi>Iuan</hi> caused him to come to him to <hi>Madrid,</hi> in order to give him a place in the Council. He was 74. years old.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Louis Portocarero,</hi> Cardinal and Arch-Bishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> possessed the greatest Benefices in <hi>Spain.</hi> He was extreamly rich, and his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoprick was worth three hundred and sixty thousand Crowns <hi>per annum</hi> to him. He did abundance of good in his station, was very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging and courteous, of an easie temper, and had the repute of being an honest man. He might be about 52. years old.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>de Liche,</hi> who carried the name of <hi>de Haro Gusman,</hi> had two very opposite qualities, he was liberal and yet covetous, he carried his magnificence even to an excess, considering his rank in the world, but especially towards his Mistresses; nevertheless he sometimes shewed his frugality in things that did him no credit. He had but an ordinary mein, and was ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, but was master of all the wit, penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vivacity imaginable. He was a great Lord, full of ambition and so naturally forward and adventurous, that they feared him at Court, and kept him always at a great distance. He was Ambassador at <hi>Rome,</hi> and was 42. years old.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> was Brother to the Marquess <hi>de Liche</hi>; more medling in all affairs. and no less ambitious, but more discreet, and more moderate, gallant, liberal and witty.

            <p>The Marquess <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> a <hi>Geniese,</hi> of the House of <hi>Spinola,</hi> was very rich. He was not without justice reproached for falling into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in the manag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It must be owned that he had both zeal and capacity for the service of his Master. He had been Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> and afterwards was Ambassador at <hi>Vienna</hi> and at <hi>France,</hi> and Plenipotentiary at <hi>Nimeguen.</hi> He was 50. years old.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Diego Sarmiento</hi> was originally of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> his birth was not illustrious. The Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther protected him, and procured for him the place of Councellor of State, because he was altogether devoted to her service. He was a person of great abilities and prudence, and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to be 58. years old.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Villa-Hermosa</hi> of the House of <hi>Borgia,</hi> mightily increased his fortunes during his stay in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he was Governour. He passed for a person of great bravery, and had the Character of a sweet-tempered affable man. He was not very rich, and might be about 50. years old.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Melchior Navarra</hi> owed his elevation to his good fortune, and to the Queen Mother. He was a man of great merit and knowledge, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52224:64"/>
was a member of the Council Royal. He left <hi>Spain</hi> in the year 1680. to be Vice-Roy of <hi>Peru,</hi> and was supposed to be 50, years old.</p>

            <p>The Count <hi>d' Oropeza,</hi> who carries the name of <hi>Toledo</hi> conjunctly with that of <hi>Portugal,</hi> was young and not above 30. years old. His stature was somewhat of the lowest, otherwise he was well enough made as to his person, of a smiling agreeable countenance, and a sweet and infinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating conversation, open in appearance, but in effect very reserved and close, not always speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he thought, and generally intent upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to deceive and amuse. He pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be devout, and under the exteriour shew of unconcernedness for the world concealed his great ambition, to which he might be prompted perhaps by his illustrious birth: he was of the House of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and presumptive Heir of that Kingdom in case the King had no Children. The King at that time loved him exceedingly, and this love has been since wonderfully increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; he is become a Favourite and chief Minister.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>de Mansera</hi> had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sent. Ambassador into <hi>Germany,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was made Vice-Roy of <hi>New Spain,</hi> where he enriched himself, and came back to <hi>Madrid:</hi>

he was of so unhealthful a constitution, that he could not fill the chief places of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which otherwise he might have done, being a person of great capacity, in regard of his experience and judgment. He was 59. years old.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>d' Albuquerque</hi> was General at Sea, he was very brave, and was not destitute of wit. He married the Daughter of his Eldest Brother to keep up the name of his Family, which was that of <hi>Cueva,</hi> and was very antient. He might be about 48. years old.</p>

He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards rose to be Secretary; for Don <hi>Pedro del Campo</hi> not being in the good graces of <hi>Valenzuela, d' Eguya</hi> was chosen to officiate in his place by a Commission, and after some time had the good fortune to get it for himself, for he, to whom it belonged, died of grief because he was not permitted to exercise it any longer. The King had a great kindness for him, and he behaved himself towards his Majesty with all the Address imaginable. His Office was under the King's apartment, he was called Secretary of State and <hi>del Despacho Vniversal.</hi> He was never of the Council: his employment direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fastned him to the person of the King and

chief Minister. He kept the <hi>Bolfillo,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being obliged to give up his accounts. Now these are the fines that come to the King, as well from <hi>Spain</hi> as the <hi>Indies</hi>; they amount to a prodigious summ, and are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for secret services, either by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents or pensions.</p>

            <p>And now as for the Ladies, I shall only say in general, that there is no place in the world where they have a greater share of vivacity and wit, and a better talent to please, than they have in <hi>Spain</hi>; amongst these, without reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52224:65"/>
the Maids of Honour that belonged to the two Queens, the most remarkable for wit were the Dutchesses <hi>Dalbuquerque, de Terra Nova, d' Ossone, de Frias, de Medina Celi, d' Hijar, de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strane,</hi> and the Countesses <hi>de Monterey</hi> and <hi>de Villambrosa</hi>; for beauty the Marchioness <hi>de Liche,</hi> the Princess <hi>de Montelion</hi> the Marchioness <hi>de la Roche,</hi> the Countess <hi>de Penaranda,</hi> the Princess <hi>Stillano,</hi> the Dutchess <hi>d' Osseda,</hi> the Wife of Don <hi>Pedro</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that of Don <hi>Henrique Henriques,</hi> and the Marchioness <hi>de la Puebla.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint wherein they live, the climate of the Country and their own natural temper carry them to gallantry on course. They are for the most part little, lean and slender, their skin is swarthy, soft, and painted, their features regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, their eyes full of fire, their hair black and in great abundance, and their feet small to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Their habit sits so ill upon them, that unless one has been long accustomed to it, she can scarce know how to endure it. The men are no less disadvantageously apparalled; they always come to Court in their <hi>Golilia</hi> and a black Cloak and hanging sleeves, and altho they be never so well shaped and handsom, with fine heads of hair and good features, yet their awkward way of dressing and parting their hair on one side of their face, and throwing it behind their ears, does abominably disfigure them.</p>
            <p>This digression has caused me to interrupt the series of these Memoirs, but now to reassume my discourse, I must inform my Reader, that the good understanding which passed between the King and the Queen Mother, occasioned abundance of people to make their court to the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52224:66"/>
latter. They looked upon her as a Princess, who had assumed all her former Authority, for the King was still young, and had need of good counsel, and his Mother being accustomed to Govern, was for all sorts of reasons more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to direct him than any one besides. Nay it was commonly believed, that she would not be displeased to take the Government again into her hands, and so some by inclination, and others out of policy endeavoured to get into her favour, in order to obtain some place or other under the new Ministry, that was going to be formed, as well upon the score of her return, as the arrival of the young Queen.</p>
            <p>The world had reason to believe, that the face of affairs would be absolutely changed, and therefore every one thought of himself in the present conjuncture. 'Tis true abundance of persons that were very well read in politicks, judged that the Queen Mother would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps manage the Reins of the Government, they pretended <q>that this would be always a weighty and troublesom Charge, that she had been of late years accustomed to ease and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness, and having undergone all the varieties of an uncertain fortune, she was afraid of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her self exposed to them the second time; that there was hopes she would disswade the King from taking a chief Minister, and that she would be forward enough to make him conceive an aversion for one; that to effect this she only needed to put him in mind of the sorry figure he made, when Don <hi>Iuan</hi> had such an authority over him, and that in fine she would endeavour to form a Junta, which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52224:66"/>
should be composed of her own Creatures; that this would be the true way to Reign, without making her self responsible for any events; that all her Orders would be punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally executed, and yet she not appear to have any hand in them.</q> I ought to acquaint my Reader, that a <hi>Iunta</hi> is an extraordinary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, which the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> erect to remedy the pressing necessities of the State: For example, <hi>Philip</hi> IV. by his last Will created a <hi>Iunta</hi> to serve and assist the Queens Council du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the minority of the King his Son.</p>
            <p>Thus people searched after, and as easily found out the Lords who were to compose this <hi>Iunta</hi>; the hatred or the friendship of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that made reflections upon the present af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs enriched or impoverished those they had a mind to; they bestowed Offices and took them away, they made vows to no purpose, and had effectual fears and apprehensions upon them: In a word, all these busie Spirits were divided upon the point, and the most quiet among them found themselves somewhat concerned for what was to come. But the Queen Mother made no stir, she seemed in appearance to have no other thoughts than how to establish her self in the favour of the King her Son, and serve her self in the same condition.</p>
            <p>This young Prince was passionately in love, and was sensible of all the pleasure that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies those agreeable Ideas, that love uses to inspire, and flattered himself to see all his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations suddenly crowned; the possessing a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, who was already become so dear to him,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52224:67"/>
employed his heart to such a degree, that he could think of nothing else. He pressed the time of his departure that he might be the sooner with her.</p>
            <p>The arrival of the Courier, who brought the news, that the Queen was advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the frontiers was expected with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream impatience. The Marquess <hi>de los Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazez</hi> sent them word exactly on what day she was to arrive at <hi>Irun:</hi> while she was in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of <hi>France</hi> the Kings Houshold waited upon her. The Prince <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> accompanied her in quality of Ambassador Extraordinary and the Princess his Wife likewise made the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The Mareshal <hi>de Clerambant</hi>'s Lady who was Governness to her, waited upon her as La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Honour, Mademoiselle <hi>de Grance</hi> as Lady of the Wardrobe, and this place has left her the name of Madam instead of that of Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selle. Nothing was omitted in any of the Cities through which her Majesty passed, to receive her with a respect suitable to her high rank, and we may say she so much set off the grandeur of her Birth by her natural beauty, and by her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging and courteous deportment; that all <hi>France</hi> was sensibly grieved to lose her.</p>
            <p>One of the first persons that took the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to speak to the Queen and give her advice was a Religious <hi>Theatin,</hi> called Father <hi>Vintimiglia.</hi> He was born in <hi>Sicily</hi> of an Illustrious Family, and was Brother to the Count <hi>de Prade</hi> who happened to be Governour of <hi>Palermo</hi> at the time when that City revolted in the late troubles. He had been seized, and people thought it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52224:67"/>
would have cost him his head, but he got the favour to be sent to <hi>Madrid</hi> to justifie himself; his Brother the <hi>Theatin</hi> went along with him to assist him with his credit. He was a bold hardy adventurous man, and devoted himself entirely to Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> and his zeal for that Prince car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him so far, that in some of his Sermons he spoke of the Queen Mother with very little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. This Father departed from <hi>Madrid,</hi> in company with the Duke <hi>d' Ossone,</hi> and tho he had not now any hopes of being made the Queens Confessor, as he had before the death of Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> yet he could not forbear to go as far as <hi>Bayonne</hi> to salute her; his deportment, his birth, and his knowledge of the <hi>French</hi> tongue, which he spoke perfectly well, because he had resided a long time at <hi>Paris,</hi> procured him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess enough to the young Queen to take his opportunity of prepossessing her with some suspicions and jealousies against the Queen her Mother in Law, and the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador. By this piece of conduct he did not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to injure those persons who had formerly been enemies to Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> but he had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular aim, that personally respected himself, and wherein his ambition had by much the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand of his discretion: and that was to perswade the Queen to endeavour the erecting of a <hi>Iunta,</hi> that was to depend solely upon her. He told her, that in order to bring this design about, she was to chuse the Duke <hi>d' Ossone</hi> to be a member of it, because he was a person of consummate abilities, and besides had a great zeal for her Majesty, he took care to reckon

himself in the number of the Ministers, and could not forbear to write a Scheme of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the memoirs of which he gave to the Duke <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> to the end that he might present them to the Queen, but 'tis very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he never showed them to her Majesty.</p>
            <p>The Queen was now advanced as far as St. <hi>Iohn-de-Luz,</hi> and she departed from thence about one a clock in the afternoon on the third of <hi>November,</hi> followed by the Guards <hi>an Corps</hi> of the King. She came to a wooden house that was purposely prepared for her, it was gilded and painted within and without, there was a great Hall in it, a Chamber, and a moveable Closet of Crimson-Damask with Galloon and a rich Lace of Gold and Silver. This house was scituate upon the brink of the River <hi>de Bidassoa</hi> which parts <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Spain.</hi> As soon as the Queen arrived there, she put on a most sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Habit, then coming into the Hall, she took part of a noble Collation: There she staid a little, and afterwards retired into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, after this she ascended a Scaffold, and placed her self in a Chair of State under a noble Canopy; at this very moment she was seized with an air of melancholy which shewed what a regret she had to be so near leaving <hi>France.</hi> The Prince <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> placed himself at her right hand, the Princess <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> at her left, the Mareshal <hi>de Clerambaut</hi>'s Lady and Madam <hi>de Grance</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her Chair. Monsieur <hi>de Saintot</hi> went to inform the Marquess <hi>d' Astorgas</hi> of it, who was <hi>Major D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>no</hi> to the Queen. He was in a Boat upon the River, near a little Island, which the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52224:68"/>
Treaty of the <hi>Pyrantes</hi> has rendred since so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and which was joyned to the Queen's House by a Bridge of Communication. The Guards <hi>de Corps</hi> formed themselves into several Squadrons in this place. The Marquess was waiting for his orders in this Boat, which was very magnificent, and was prepared on purpose to carry her Majesty over to the other side.</p>
            <p>As soon as he was informed that the Queen expected him, he set foot upon the ground, and fourscore persons, Gentlemen, Pages, or Valets marched on foot before him, he threw himself immediately at the feet of the Queen, kissed her hand, made her a Complement, got up again, and covered himself, without staying for the Queen to say any thing to him. The Prince <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> covered himself likewise at the same time. The Marquess spoke to her all the while in <hi>Spanish,</hi> and presented her Majesty with two Letters from the King and Queen Mother; but before he gave them, he touched them upon his Forehead, his Eyes, his Mouth, and his Heart, as the fashion is. The Queen told him she was extreamly glad that the King her Husband had given him the charge of conducting her. After this the old Marquess turned himself towards the Prince <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> and made him a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who answered that he had orders from the King his Master to deliver the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> into his hands. Monsieur <hi>de Chateanneu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52224:69"/>
persons of Quality to her Majesty, who kissed her hand kneeling down upon one Knee. The Bishop of <hi>Pampelune</hi> kissed her hand, but did not kneel. The Queen did not press to depart, but the Marquess informed her that it was high time to march; she immediately arose, placing him on her right hand and a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nin</hi> of Honour on her left, upon whose shoulder she leaned, for he was a young Boy, and thus she advanced towards the Bridge. The Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> met her just about the middle, and kissed her hand with the Ladies of the Palace that followed her, who threw themselves all at her feet. After the Dutchess had made her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, she presented several Spanish Ladies to the Queen. Monsieur <hi>de Repaire,</hi> Lieutenant of the King'sGuards <hi>duCorps,</hi> who carried the Queens Train, gave it to the Dutchess. The Queen entred into the Boat along with her, her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was glazed all over; and thus being all alone with this old Dame, she cast her eyes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently towards that side of the Kingdom which she had quitted, and her languishing air sufficiently testified by what commotions she was agitated within. Twenty four Seamen placed in two Barques drew the Boat along, and the Spanish Horse discharged their Musquetoons and Pistols as soon as it began to move, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillary of <hi>Fontarabia</hi> answered them with a great firing. The Prince and Princess <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> the other Ladies and all the Queens Attendants passed over in Boats that were prepared on purpose. The Queen setting foot upon the Ground towards the evening, found her own
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52224:69"/>
Coach, her Litter, and a Chair with abundance of men in Liveries; she placed her self in her Chair, and twenty Valets on foot lighted the way with long Flambeaux of White Wax: when they came to <hi>Irun, Te Deum</hi> was sung, and this was the first time her Supper was served after the Spanish fashion; the repast was so little and so ill drest, that she was extreamly surprized at it, and could scarce eat at all.</p>
            <p>Alas! that a young Princess bred up in the most magnificent and refined Court in the World should be forced to pass so many sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful melancholy moments. She had always had the liberty hitherto to eat in publick, and it had not been denied to her upon the way; she danced, she rode on Horseback, she knew and esteemed those that were her Companions, and they (if I may use the expression) adored her. And now she found her self all on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain amongst persons whom she knew not, and consequently could not appear amiable enough to divert her grief, she understood so very little of their language, that she could not tell what they meant, or return them any answer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble; then besides all this, the manner wherein they served her appeared so strange, and carried so small a resemblance to that of <hi>France,</hi> that she was not a little discomposed at it. All was Ceremony, all was Restraint and Affection; from the very first day she appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst them, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> expected she should know and do every thing as readily as themselves, who had been learning them the better part of their lives. They never considered
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52224:70"/>
the difference between the two Nations, that are opposite to one another in every punctilio, but believing that her Majesty ought immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to be made acquainted with their way of living, which she was religiously to observe for the rest of her life, they dispensed with her in nothing, so that from that time she suffered a kind of slavery, to which the rigid humour of her <hi>Camarera Major</hi> contributed very much; but the natural sweetness of the Queens temper, and her prudence made her receive all these things, that naturally fatigued and displeased her, with a world of patience.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless one would have been apt to conclude, that out of meer policy the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> ought to have managed the good disposition of the Queen after another manner, especially since having no interest in her at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, she ought by a courteous deportment to have gained her favour, because she had so great a number of considerable enemies; and the greatest part of the Court Ladies were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of her place. The Prince who advanced her to this Post, was already dead, all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances seemed to predict her fall, and she her self was very apprehensive of it. However she took different measures from what any body would have thought she ought to observe, for instead of shewing any complaisance to her young Mistress, she became a spy upon her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so that by this means she might merit the King's favour. She studied all her inclinations, and her humour, she frequently caused some <hi>French</hi> women, that followed her to <hi>Madrid</hi> to be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52224:70"/>
entertained, she drew strange consequences from the slightest occasions, and every thing became poison in her hands. She likewise drew for her self a Plan of the conduct she was to follow, and this effectually hindred her from being turned out of her Post.</p>
            <p>She was not only content with taking these remote measures to ingratiate her self with the King, but likewise was of opinion, that to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her own interests, she was to hinder the young Queen from ever having any friendly correspondence with the Queen Mother, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing any confidence in her: because her party being absolutely opposite to that of Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> it was natural to believe that the first sacrifice she would demand of her Daughter in Law, would be the removal of the <hi>Camarera,</hi> who was the Creature of her Enemy. Besides she could not flatter her self, that the young Queen would refuse to give the Queen Mother this proof her complaisance, at a conjuncture that would deliver her from a sort of a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whom she had no great reason to love; thus she could not think of a better expedient to support her self, than by possessing the Queen, <q>that the Queen Mother was her secret enemy; that she would oppose her in every thing; that she could never forget that she was in part the cause that the marriage of the Arch Dutchess her Grand-Daughter was not consummated with the King her Son; that she was always uneasie because she had not that ascendant, as she desired, over the King's affections; that she was resolved to keep her under a subjection
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52224:71"/>
that was more befitting a Daughter in Law, than the Spouse of so great a Monarch.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To effect this more easily, she had instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some persons that stood very near the Queen, who acted their parts well enough. When they first took the liberty to discourse her about this affair, she thought them to be altogether devoted to her service, and their pretended tears seemed to engage for the sincerity of their apparent zeal, <q>What have you lost Madam, would they say to her sometimes with a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful air, What have you lost by the Death of Don <hi>Iuan?</hi> What would not he have done to please you? If it had not been for him the King had married the Arch Dutchess, and his breaking off that Match drew abundance of mortal enemies upon him. Now if you could promise your self, that the Ambassador of <hi>France</hi> would prove faithful to you, you might find some consolation in him, you might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his advice, and profit your self by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; but considering his present dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Heaven preserve you, Madam, from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Counsel: Alas, he quarrelled with Don <hi>Iuan</hi> only upon the Queen Mothers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he clearly declared himself for her in his first Embassie, and she reposes an intire confidence in him. Thus your Majesty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not show your self too great a stranger to such a Minister, that will never go cordially along with you, and who will penetrate into your private sentiments for no other reason, than only to make an ill use of them.</q> The Queen was extreamly alarm'd at the things they told
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52224:71"/>
her, and knew not which way to determine her self, being so young, and having no experience in this new world, where she was acquainted with no body.</p>
            <p>She departed from <hi>Irun,</hi> and lay that night at <hi>Hernani.</hi> The next day she mounted on Horseback, followed by the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> who made but a sorry figure upon her Mule; Madam <hi>de Grance</hi> accompanied her. The Marquess <hi>d' Astorgas,</hi> and the Duke <hi>d' Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone,</hi> with each a pair of Spectacles upon their Nose, as is the fashion of the Grandees, bore their shares in the Cavalcade. The Marquess placed himself next her Majesty, because she was to be his charge till she saw the King; but the Duke pretended a right to the same place, as being Master of the Horse, and so took it by force, menacing the Marquess very haughtily. This dispute obliged the Queen to take Coach again. She lay that night at <hi>Tolosette,</hi> where as soon as she was arrived, the Duke <hi>d' Ossone</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested the Guard, who had abused his Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, because he would not suffer the Coach of the Marquess <hi>d' Astorgas</hi> to go before his. This quarrel was renewed upon the discharging of their Offices; the Marquess pretended, that all the honours of the Queens Reception belonged to him; the Duke maintained that he being Master of the Horse, ought therefore to have all the pre-eminences in her House. To decide the matter, they were forced to write to the King about it, who decided it in favour of the Marquess. The Duke not thinking himself justly dealt with, continued his pretensions still,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52224:72"/>
but this obstinacy drew an Order upon him to return to <hi>Madrid,</hi> with a prohibition to pass through <hi>Burgos,</hi> where the King was at that time.</p>
            <p>In effect, the King left <hi>Madrid</hi> on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty second of <hi>October,</hi> being but slenderly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied. The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, the Constable, and Don <hi>Ioseph de Silva</hi> were all three in his Coach; as for the Admiral of <hi>Castile</hi> he did not go along with them, for he pretended that for want of mony he was not in a capacity to fit out an answerable equipage: there might indeed be something of truth in this pretence; but it is certain, that his natural lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was the real occasion, he loved his pleasure, he shunned all trouble, and carefully avoided whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver might make him uneasie, and this was the true reason why he did not meet the King and Queen till they were within a days journey of <hi>Madrid.</hi> The King continued fifteen days at <hi>Burgos,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was extreamly troubled with a Cold, in the mean time the Queen advanced forwards by small journeys. She wrote to him several times, and he answered her again. Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty was forced to send to him to demand leave to dine in publick, and sometime to ride on Horseback; for those two terrible Creatures the Marquess <hi>d' Astorgas,</hi> and the <hi>Camarera Major</hi> would not consent to it, till they had received positive Orders. He granted it very freely, and she sent to him in this place a Watch beset with Diamonds, and a Cravat with a Knot of a fire colour. He immediately put on the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat, and ordered five hundred Pistols to be
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52224:72"/>
given to the Gentleman who brought him the Present.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>d' Altamire,</hi> Grandee of <hi>Spain</hi>; came to <hi>Ognate</hi> to complement the Queen from the King, and presented her with Bracelet of Diamonds and Rubies. She arrived on the eleventh to <hi>Victoria,</hi> where a lamentable Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was prepared to Regale her. There it was that she drest her self first <hi>a l' Espagnolle,</hi> and she appeared no less beautiful and charming in that, than in her <hi>French</hi> Habit. She went likewise to the Great Church, where the Bishop of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lahorra</hi> received her at the Gate, and held the Canopy over her, she afterwards was pleased to go and see a Bull-feast in the Market-place, but there was little or no magnificence in the sight, because it was only performed by Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. She received in this place a pair of Pendants for the Ears, with Pearls to them of a Pear fashion, this present was sent to her from the Queen Mother, and was valued at four hundred thousand Livers.</p>
            <p>Monsieur the Ambassador of <hi>France</hi> came to wait upon her at <hi>Bribiesca,</hi> and tho he tarried but a little time with her, and their Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was but short, yet he could very easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that she exprest a great uneasiness, and a particular distrust of him; he could not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the reason of it, however he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judged that these dispositions were not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to her, he told her several things that might be serviceable to her, he advised her not to amuse her self with the different impressions that any persons might endeavour to make
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52224:73"/>
upon her, that she ought to consider that the greatest part of those that waited on her only minded their own proper interests, that her su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest way would be to love the King cordially, and so by that means engage him to love her; to unite her self to the Queen Mother, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert all affairs with her; that she ought to rest satisfied, that that Princess had a great kindness for her, and that if she took care to make sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table returns, she would find the affections of a true Mother in her. The young Queen was already prepared for this discourse, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for what concerned the Queen Mother. She had been tampered with upon that point before, but if she had seriously examined what he spoke to her, she had soon been made sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as she was a person of extraordinary wit, that the Ambassador dealt plainly with her, and that whoever perswaded her to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, endeavoured to disunite her from her real interests. He took his leave of her, and went back to the King at <hi>Burgos,</hi> and during this short time he had the honour to discourse with her, she still entertained him with great coldness and indifferency.</p>
            <p>The Prince <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> was advanced as far as <hi>Burgos</hi> to salute the King; and since the Queen was to come to <hi>Quintanapalla,</hi> which is within three leagues of it, it was generally supposed that she would come to lie there on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>November,</hi> and that the Ceremony of the Marriage would be there solemnized: But the Marquess <hi>de Villars,</hi> having met, as he was coming back, the Patriarch of the <hi>Indies</hi> who
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52224:73"/>
was going to meet the Queen, it came imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into his head, that the Marriage might perhaps be consummated, without his being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of it; this thought made him inquire the news of Don <hi>Geronimo d' Eguya,</hi> Secretary of State, who only told him, that the Queen was expected the next day at <hi>Burgos.</hi> This doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful answer, which had nothing positive in it, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our Ambassador to inform himself still more particularly, and he understood at last that the King was to go the next day to <hi>Quintanapalla</hi> to celebrate the Marriage. Being assured of this, he took care to send advice of it to the Prince <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> and they departed together soon enough to be with the Queen before the King arrived thither.</p>
            <p>When they came there, they found it no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter to discover, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have the Marriage solemnized without them. The <hi>Camarera Major,</hi> who was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that opinion, and to whom they spoke with abundance of honest freedom, told them coldly that they were not to assist at the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and that the King would have no body be there, except only those whose presence was indispensably necessary, such as the chief Officers, and some Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber. The Prince <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> and the Marquess <hi>de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> answered, that the King their Master had given them Orders to be present at it. She fiercely replied, that the King their Master had nothing to do to command in <hi>Spain.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Villars</hi> told her that the King his Master was used to command his Ambassadors, and that they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52224:74"/>
would obey him in every thing; that if the King was not willing to have them assist at his Marriage, he ought to signifie to them by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in writing that they were not to be there. The <hi>Camarera</hi> ravished with joy that she had an opportunity to show her zeal for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> altho this was a very improper time for it, was so far transported with the matter, and spoke several things so incoherent and so fierce, that the Ambassadors left her and addressed themselves to the Marquess <hi>d' Astorgas</hi>; he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently listned to them, and told them ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously that he would immediately dispatch a Gentleman to the King to know his pleasure herein. This Gentleman found him on the way, and he consented that the Messieurs <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> and <hi>Villars</hi> should assist at the Ceremony. In short it was occasioned by the industrious dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of some persons who had no inclination to the <hi>French,</hi> that this thought was insinuated into the King: They were of opinion, that so Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust a Marriage ought not to be Celebrated in a poor Village, where there were not above a dozen Houses, and their <hi>Spanish</hi> vanity was so extreamly offended at it, as to desire that the Ambassadors of so great a King might not be witnesses of so great a negligence, not to say mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. And now, to excuse the matter, they gave out that the King was young and amorous, that every thing that hastned the pleasure of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Spouse touched him so sensibly, that he even forgot the magnificence and grandeur of his Rank; that love alone made up the Honours of his Feast, and that the King thought this alone
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52224:74"/>
sufficient. The Queen having passed the night at <hi>Quintanapalla,</hi> about ten a clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was told that the King was arrived; this news caused a small emotion in her, and spread a colour upon her Cheeks that made her still appear more beautiful and lovely. She went to receive him in her <hi>Spanish</hi> dress, and having met him as he was just going to enter her Anti-Chamber, she would have thrown her self se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times at his feet, and kissed his hand, but he hindered her still and saluted her after the <hi>Spanish</hi> fashion, that is, without kissing her, but pressing her arms close with his two hands, and calling her often <hi>Mireina, Mireina,</hi> my Queen, my Queen. They discoursed together a long time, without being able to understand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this was certainly no little pain to them. Monsieur <hi>Villars,</hi> who perceived it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced forward to serve as an Interpreter; if he did not say every thing they said, it is at least very certain that he spoiled nothing of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, and that he mingled a great deal of tenderness, and passion with it. The King was drest <hi>a la Scombergue,</hi> which is properly after the <hi>French</hi> mode, and all his attendants were clad after the same manner: For the campagne ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> somewhat resemble ours.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>de Villars</hi> having observed that the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> took the right hand, spoke to the King about it, and represented to him, the rank the Marquess <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> had given to him at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> when the Queen was espoused there. This reason prevailed, so the King ordered the Ambassadors of <hi>France</hi> to be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52224:75"/>
treated after the same manner. The Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> could not be brought to quit his place without some trouble; he had still a small di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute upon the point, which continued a little time between the Ambassador and him, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver civility was still preserved on both sides, and the rest of the Grandees placed themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the King. Don <hi>Antonio de Benavidez y Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan,</hi> Patriarch of the <hi>Indies</hi> and Grand Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gave them a second benediction; the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony was performed <hi>incognito</hi> in the Queens Anti-Chamber: If the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Burgos</hi> had not been indisposed, he had performed this Office. Whilst Mass was saying, they put a Ribbond of black Taffaty about the King and Queen, tied up in a true Lovers knot, and a white Gauze with a Silver Fringe upon the King's Shoulders, and over the Queens Head. The Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> held up her Train. When the Ceremony was over, the King and Queen withdrew into a Chamber by themselves, where they continued two hours alone: they dined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in publick, and parted from thence to go and lie at <hi>Burgos.</hi> There was no body with them in the Coach, and since they did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand one another but very little, one can scarce imagine what they said, however the King appeared very amorous and affectionate; several Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> went before their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties with very stately Liveries, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them to the Palace, where a Comedy was acted, and artificial Fireworks were to be seen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:52224:75"/>The next day the King came to a rich Abby of Nuns, that are called <hi>Las Huelgas,</hi> which is not much beyond the Suburbs of <hi>Burgos:</hi> She dined there, and about three a Clock made her entry on Horseback, being drest after the <hi>Spanish</hi> mode, but appeared so beautiful and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that she ravished the hearts of all the spectators. Three Grandees marched before her, the Marquess <hi>d' Astorgas</hi> followed her; a Canopy was carried over her head; the Old Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> rode upon a Mule, and the Maids of Honour accompanied her on Horseback. On the twenty second of <hi>November</hi> Prince <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> made his entry, and had Audience of the King and Queen; after Dinner there was a Bull-feast, which pleased the Queen exceedingly, because the Cavaliers showed extraordinary dexterity and courage in the performance. The day following she saw the <hi>Parejas,</hi> that is to say, an Horserace, in which nothing is observeable, but that two men who start together, ride even without going a step one before the other, altho they ride full speed: Sixty Gentlemen clad in Silver Brocard ran after this manner.</p>
            <p>After they had thus spent three days in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent pleasures and diversions, it was high time to think of going to <hi>Madrid</hi>; most of the <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen and Ladies that followed the Queen took leave of her in this place, so that the greatest part of the Houshold went back to <hi>France</hi>; but this was not done without shedding abundance of Tears. The Queen had the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty still to keep with her her two Nurses, two

Women of the Chamber, some <hi>Valets de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi> a Gentleman to look after five or six Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Horses she had ordered to be brought with her, and some other Officers for her Table. She presented the Prince and Princess <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> the Mareshal <hi>de Clerembaut</hi>'s Lady, and Madam <hi>de Grance</hi> with her Picture enriched with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds of different prices, according to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the persons to whom she gave them: and the obliging manner wherewith she knew how to accompany her liberalities augmented the price of them exceedingly. They pretend that the present the King made the Prince <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> was worth twenty hundred thousand Crowns, but it fell much short of it; the Queen got a Pension of two thousand Crowns for Madam <hi>de Grance,</hi> which was to be paid her where-ever she lived.</p>
            <p>The Princess <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> and the other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that followed the Queen went back to <hi>France,</hi> while she and the King took the way to <hi>Madrid,</hi> being both by themselves, and sate in the back part of the Coach. Several Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Houshold went before, and marched by different Roads to avoid an embarras; the Counts <hi>d' Arcos,</hi> and <hi>de Talara,</hi> Don <hi>Ioseph de Silva,</hi> and the Duke <hi>d' Hijar,</hi> Gentlemen of the Chamber, were named by the King to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him in his journey; he came back the very same way as he went to <hi>Burgos</hi>; he lay at <hi>Lerma,</hi> at <hi>Aranda,</hi> at St. <hi>Stephen de Gormas,</hi> and at <hi>Guadalajara:</hi> The Nuncio and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassador came thither to make their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements to the Queen: The next day their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52224:76"/>
Majesties arrived at <hi>Torrejon,</hi> which is within three leagues of <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the while that the Court was on the way from <hi>Burgos</hi> to this place, the <hi>Camarera Major</hi> frequently discoursed the King in private: She found it no difficult matter to insinuate those sentiments into him, that are so natural to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and he had for his share been educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a Country where they make no reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Ladies virtue, unless they take away from her all opportunities of trangressing. <q>She represented to him the ill consequences of that liberty which the women are allowed in <hi>France</hi>; that it was absolutely necessary for the Queen to live after the retired manner that those of her sex observe at <hi>Madrid</hi>; that she was young, lively, and of a brillant spirit, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to the <hi>French</hi> fashions; that what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in one place may become criminal in another; but if he would be pleased to confide in her, she would by her great diligence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent every thing.</q> The King commended her zeal, and gave her sufficient assurances of his confidence.</p>
            <p>The Queen Mother was arrived at <hi>Torrejon</hi> before the King; she quitted her Apartment to go and meet their Majesties; when the King saw her, he ran to her and embraced her very tenderly; the young Queen advanced forward at the same time to kiss he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hand, but the Queen Mother would not suffer it: She took her between her Arms, and embraced her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times with great testimonies of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, treating her still by the name of <hi>Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52224:77"/>
but the young Queen told her, that she requested her to call her Daughter, and love her as one, and to be perswaded that she had all those dutiful sentiments for her, that might make her worthy of this Honour. The King gave her his hand on one side, and the Queen Mother on the other; and thus going between them she entred the Palace, that had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive them. The Queen Mother perceiving that the Queen had never a Muff, presented her with her own, about which was a great knot of Diamonds: afterwards she took from her a Ribbond that tied some of her Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and in exchange put upon her Arm a Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let that was computed to be worth three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pistols. In a word, she showed the Queen all marks of her good inclinations to her, from which she might promise her self all happy consequences. She staid with their Majesties as long as she could, but went home that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, because this place had not conveniencies enough to receive her. The next day which was the second of <hi>December,</hi> the King and Queen arrived at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in a Coach with the Curtains open, that they might be seen by the people. They went down to our Ladies <hi>Dato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> where <hi>Te Deum</hi> was sung, and at night lay at <hi>Buen-Retiro</hi>; the next day a Comedy was acted, and some French Musitians, that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Queen, prepared some <hi>Opera's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> being resolved to take entirely from the Queen that little liberty that remained to her, and desiring to continue sole Mistress of her Majesty's Will, declared
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52224:77"/>
when she was arrived at <hi>Buen-Retiro,</hi> that no body, of what quality or condition soever, should see the Queen till after she had made her publick entry. This was a sorrowful state, and a heavy restraint to the young Queen to find her self thus all on a sudden shut up from those persons, that either might have afforded her some consolation, or diversion, or useful advice. She kept her in this solitary condition at <hi>Retiro,</hi> without permitting her so much as to go out of her Apartment. All the entertainment they regal'd her with, was to see long fulsom tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Comedies, little of which she understood; and the terrible <hi>Camarera</hi> was incessantly before her eyes, with a severe affected air, and never laught, but was perpetually finding fault with something or other. She was a professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all manner of pleasure, and she treated her Mistress with as much Authority, as a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness would use towards a little Girl.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>de Villars</hi> knew all that passed, and was mightily concerned at it, but it was not time as yet to speak of it. He sent to the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> to know whether he might have leave to salute the Queen, she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him just as she did all the rest of the world, that she was not to be seen till after the Entry was over. This answer he looked upon to be so positive, that not desirous to run the risque of meeting a second refusal, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to acquiesce: but the Queen being informed of what had hapned by some of the French wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that still continued with her, could not forbear to acquaint the King with it, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52224:78"/>
leave to see our Ambassador <hi>de secreto,</hi> that is to say, as a private person. She imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately took care to inform him of it; and the Marchioness <hi>de Villars</hi> imagining that she might likewise have the favour of the same priviledge, sent to the <hi>Camarera Major</hi> to know whether she might be admitted to wait upon the Queen, but she received the same answer that Monsieur the Ambassador had received from her before, saying in a few words, she had no order to let her in. The Gentleman that discoursed the matter with her, still insisted that she had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of moment to say to her; 'tis all one, says the <hi>Camarera,</hi> I'll never suffer any new customs to be introduced within these Walls.</p>
            <p>Her Majesty not knowing what had passed between the <hi>Camarera</hi> and the Ambassador's Lady, charged her Confessor to tell her, that she desired to see her, and that she would extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige her by making her a visit. But she was not in a capacity to obey the Orders she had received, and the Confessor being informed what obstacles stood in the way, very fairly gave the Queen an account of all. She was not a little troubled at the ill services the Dutchess had done her; and one may be able to judge by these few instances what an absolute power that old Lady assumed in the Queens House, and over the Queens person. The Queen Mother, who came every day to <hi>Retiro,</hi> observed an air of melancholy in the looks of the young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, which sufficiently testified her disquietude within: She easily apprehended, that a person of her age could not chuse but be disgusted at
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52224:78"/>
the severity of the <hi>Camarera</hi>; so she thought her self obliged to acquaint the King with it, and desired him that he would be pleased to treat her after a more gentle method: She succeeded in her Petition, and procured leave for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioness <hi>de Villars</hi> to go and wait upon the Queen, who was introduced into her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through that of the Dutchess <hi>de Terra No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> who appeared less savage and somewhat more respectful to her than she used to be. The King according to the custom of <hi>Spain,</hi> sate in a Chair of State, the two Queens upon two low Stools, and presently another was brought for the Ambassador's Lady. Soon after the Queen Mother going out along with the King, she found her self alone with the Queen, who seeing she was now at liberty to talk, could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orbear to shed some Tears, as she acquainted her with the sorrowful life she led. After she somewhat eased her self by recounting to her the several ill usages that so much disturbed her, the Ambassador's Lady did not fail to apply those consolations she judged expedient for one in her condition. <q>She made her sensible, that this life, so full of constraint as it was, and for which she expressed so great a reluctancy, was yet the very same that all the Queens and Infanta's of <hi>Spain</hi> had ever been accustomed to; that there was nothing particular in what she suffered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently was not design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to disoblige her; that she ought to hope, that when the King was better acquainted with her, and saw he had an entire possession of her heart, he might out of complasance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52224:79"/>
her some relaxations which hitherto her Predecessors had never enjoyed; That since the Queen Mother loved her, and cherished her interests as her own, she could not do too much to cultivate that friendship, which would be so advantageous and necessary to her; that in the distribution of humane things, the greatest happiness is always attended with some inconveniencies; that she was now elevated to the supreamest Grandeur upon Earth, which Heaven would have her purchase at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a few mortifications, but that her complaisance to the King and Queen Mother would soon deliver her out of them.</q> She likewise told her several things, which in the conduct she was to observe towards the rest of the Court, might assist her to support the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and render what followed more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Villars</hi> spoke with a great deal of zeal of the Queen Mother; but the young Queen being not as yet disingaged from those senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which she had been lately possessed, looked upon all this discourse as designed to mislead her, and tho she ought to have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the Ambassadress could have no other views in what she told her, than only to make her sensible of her own true interests, yet these advices did not at that time make those impressions upon her, as one could have wished they had for her good. Her prejudices to the Queen Mother, which were perpetually inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into her, ballanced the confidence she had in Madam <hi>de Villars,</hi> and her mind, that was
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52224:79"/>
only accustom'd to be entertained with those agreeable things, that use to employ persons of her youth, her temper that was naturally free and lively, dissipated the application she ought to have made, in order to distinguish good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels from bad. She knew just enough to embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rass her and give her occasions of being uneasy, but could not tell how to disintangle herself, and for want of a steady resolution to free her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from these melancholy Ideas, thought it too great a fatigue to solve these apparent contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. So she continued under this uncertainty without being able to rescue her self from it, and perhaps by this means lost a favourable jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that then offer'd it self to deliver her from the Subjection, under which the Dutchess kept her afterwards. The Ambassador of <hi>France</hi> saw her sometimes whilst she continued at <hi>Retiro,</hi> but this was before Company, and besides the time they allotted him to be with her, was so short, that in those general visits they could discourse of no particular affairs.</p>
            <p>The Queen Mother continued to visit the Queen often, she desired her to dress herself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the French fashion, because she never beheld her in that dress; she did so, and the Queen Mother liked it extremely well. When she was returned to her Palace, which is the House of the Duke <hi>d' Vzeda,</hi> and is one of the finest in <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Young Queen sent her two little Cabinets full of pretty curiosities; she on the other hand procured her by way of exchange the diversion of going a hunting at <hi>Pardo.</hi> She had not been on Horseback since she came to <hi>Retiro.</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:52224:80"/>
The King killed a wild Boar before her, and after that day they went frequently to the Chase to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>The Councils of the Inquisition, of <hi>Castile,</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> of War, of the <hi>Finances,</hi> of the Crusade, and of the Orders, went on New years day to wish a happy year to their Majesties; for this is the Custom in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>Sera</hi> a Genoese, offer'd to make the <hi>Naples</hi> Squadron consist of fourteen Gallies, which was never more than seven, and not put the King to any expence, provided he would allow him the same conditions that the Duke <hi>de Tursis</hi> had at <hi>Genoa.</hi> He had made this proposal to Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> some time before his death, who found it to be very advantageous. However their resolutions are so long a taking in <hi>Spain,</hi> and they have so small a consideration for Novelties, of whatsoever use they may prove, that it is almost impossible to introduce one; and this affair it seems met with the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> took the Oath of fidelity for his place of Counsellor of State, and Don <hi>Manuel de Lira</hi> did the same, for that of Secretary of State in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Duke <hi>d' Ossone</hi> still expected that they would accommodate the dispute between him and the Marquess <hi>d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storgas,</hi> but seeing that they said nothing to him about it, he took up a resolution to go no more to Court, and appeared every day in the City with a great equipage. This is often enough practised in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:52224:80"/>There are some people in the world that are never to be discountenanc'd by a repulse, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> was of this number: Altho he had received no manner of answer to the memorial he gave the Pr. <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> at <hi>Bayonna</hi> to present to the Queen, yet he could not forbear to draw up a second, wherein he regulated all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; he intrusted a French Gentleman with it, who promised to find out some means or other to give the Queen a sight of it: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he show'd it her, or not, 'tis certain that <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> by an express order of the King was banished out of all his Dominions. He betook himself to the Ambassador of <hi>France,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more became of the matter.</p>
            <p>'Twas expected that immediately after the King's return some sort of Government would be established to settle affairs in their old course, which had been intirely suspended ever since the Death of Don <hi>Iuan.</hi> Just as his Death hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, every thing was making ready for the Journey, which employ'd all the Court, and the King in particular; his Marriage might well enough detain him some time from making those applications he ought to use in the choice of an able Minister: And the world was not at all surprized, to find him forget the concerns of the kingdom in general, at a time when he was wholly possess'd with a Passion for his Queen; and had his head full of those agreeable Ideas, which all Lovers amuse themselves with. But now when that business was over, they impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expected to see him take up some fixed Resolutions. The Queen Mother who was
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52224:81"/>
newly returned from her Exile thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else than how to preserve her self in the favourable Scituation she was in at present, and no body in a manner was so interested with the King as to be able to pretend to the Ministry. Thus the whole government was lodged in the hands of a Monarch, who was but 17 years old, and who was never so well versed in things of les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser consequence as to have any just knowledge in greater Affairs.</p>
            <p>The only man that shared the Monarchy with him, was Don <hi>Ieronimo d' Eguya,</hi> who had been Secretary of State 4 years, to which post he arrived from that of a simple Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>missary. His address together with his good fortune render'd him agreeable to the King, who had followed no other Counsel than his, unless <hi>d' Eguya</hi> who was fearful of giving it sometimes, had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him to consult the Constable of <hi>Castile,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Medina-Celi</hi> in certain affairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had no mind to answer for every thing himself. It is indeed true, that during the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney nothing of importance was debated upon, for they only busied themselves about that in particular, and the orders that are necessary to be given upon such occasions.</p>
            <p>The Court became now very full; the Kings marriage and the return of the Q. Mother had brought together the most considerable persons of the Kingdom. Every Family was consulting about the measures that were to advance some particular man amongst them to the Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry: Some wished their Relations had it, others desired it for their Friends, and abundance
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52224:81"/>
of people wished to enjoy it themselves: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those that had the justest pretensions were reckoned the Constable of <hi>Castile,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi:</hi> They were both of them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with great personal qualities, were both of an illustrious birth, and considerable fortune; they possessed the chief Offices of the Crown, were Counsellors of State, and their merits e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually distinguished them: But nothing was more opposite than these two Lords were to one another: an old Spirit of hatred, which they were not able to suppress, and which they had testified in a thousand Rencounters, increased their common emulation; their humors and inclinations were as contrary as night is to day. Several of their common Friends had endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reconcile them, but their pains were to no purpose: They were all sensible that if they concerted matters together, they would recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally render good Offices to one another, which might serve to advance their Fortune. This was one of the reasons they used to accomodate the matter between them; but sometimes we meet with aversions that are never to be surmounted, and this I have mentioned was of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina-Celi</hi> was 45 years old, his Humour sweet and good natur'd, but too slow and careless in matters of moment, of an insinuating agreeable Spirit. He was descended of the illustrious Houses of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>de Foix</hi>: he is seven times a Grandee of <hi>Spain.</hi> His Wife was Heiress of the House of <hi>Arragon de Cardonne,</hi> she is very rich on her side, as well as he is on
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52224:82"/>
his. He was President of the Council of the <hi>Indies, Sommellor du Corps,</hi> that is to say, High Chamberlain, he made his Court regularly, and always testified a particular zeal for the person of the King; and his Majesty as he never fails upon that point, expressed a certain affection for him, which he never show'd to any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. This made the world believe, that he stood fairer for the Ministry than all his Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors.</p>
            <p>The Constable of <hi>Castile,</hi> descended of the House <hi>de Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>sco,</hi> was 57 years old, and was Master of a considerable estate, nevertheless he did not live easy amidst all his wealth; he is the tenth Hereditary Constable of <hi>Castile,</hi> Dean of the Council of State, and Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the King's Houshold. His Genius is vast, his Abilities and Knowledge are surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and he was always concern'd in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where he acquired experience. The last of his Governments was that of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and altho these posts ought to have made him sociable and familiar, yet he always preserved so severe and rigid a character, that it rendred him terrible: access to him is very difficult, and his humour is naturally so imperious, that he can never submit. And this is the reason why he was embroiled so deeply with Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> and hindered him from receiving several favours, which that Prince would otherwise have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly bestowed upon him, to have brought him over to his own Party. 'Tis true he declared himself very violently for the Queen Mother, and this might be one of the principal causes,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52224:82"/>
that kept him from being of Don <hi>Iuan</hi>'s Faction. No body doubted but that the King respected him very much, for what the Queen Mother might say in favour of him, and the world was perswaded, that among those persons, whose merits she would recommend to the King, the Constable would be the first, who besides this would unquestionably find himself supported by all the party that had been ill treated by Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> and by all those that continued still in the Interests of the Queen Mother: She was obliged for her own proper Interests to procure the King's favour, and the Favourite's place for the Constable. But amidst all these flattering ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, he seemed to be very indifferent in the matter, whether it were because the ill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of affairs, and the tender Age of the King, made him apprehend some danger to be in the chief post, or because he was sensible that he had not a prospect of obtaining it at one step, and so was willing to ascend it by degrees. He seem'd to desire that a Junto were established for the Government, wherein he wou'd bear his share with the Inquisitor General and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>de Mansera.</hi> He sometimes told his Friends that the weight of great affairs astonished him, and that he found it a harder matter to adjust them, than those persons who behold them only at a distance, can well imagine; and that all his ambition was to contribute what in him lay to the erecting a Junto.</p>
            <p>The Queen Mother was not unwilling to have this project take effect; because this was the way to keep the entire Authority in her own
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52224:83"/>
hands; for the Council being composed of her creatures, they would in all probability act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her directions. The Constable for his part secretly promised, that by his conduct and management he would always keep the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand over the other two, and that thus his Companions would only enable him to bear the publick hatred, in case any thing should meet with ill success.</p>
            <p>But this Junto, that would lodge all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the hands of three persons only, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the same time the expectations of all those that would have it be divided amongst more, out of a consideration of their own interest: This party desired to have it full as numerous as it was during the Regency, and would have it composed of the Cardinal <hi>Portocarero</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> of Don <hi>Melchior Navarra,</hi> who had been formerly Vice Chancellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and the other three whom I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>After so many different projects, People were so well satisfied that the Council at last would be only composed of the Queen Mothers Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the alarm became general to those persons who had been devoted to Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Iuan,</hi> and were very apprehensive of the credit of the Queen Mother and the advancement of the Constable: Several of them assembled hereupon, they beheld their ruine in the elevation of the contrary party, and united themselves to the D. <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> to find protection from him, out of hopes of beholding him made Chief Minister: They considered that it would be more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52224:83"/>
to them to see one man made happy, who was sure to befriend them, than to see three happy persons depending upon one alone, who had just reasons to wish them ill.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Mediea Celi</hi> was of an equal and peaceable temper, which rendred him agreeable to the King. This good fortune, which seem'd particular to himself, made him be looked upon by the greater part of the Courtiers as the only man that ought to pretend to this favour, in a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urt where the greatness of rank and birth is one of the most essential qualities to recommend a Chief Minister. Those that penetrated into the true disposition of the King, saw very well that in the midst of these different parties, the Duke could not fail to get the better; but whether it was an effect of his Prudence and Moderation, or whether it was occasioned by the Intrigues of those persons that were on the contrary side, he advanced but slowly. It appears probable, that the greatest part of his Ambition came from his Friends, and that he rather followed the advices they inspired into him, than his own proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. <q>I desire the same thing that you do, would he say to them, but in truth the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity a man abandons to expose himself to all the murmurs of the people, and to all publick inquietudes, very much moderates the pleasure that is inseparable from so great a Post: and unless it were for the service we hereby render to our Master, I can't imagine how any man could find any satisfaction in a thing that draws so many hazards along with it.</q>

               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:52224:84"/>Thus people busied themselves about the two different factions, that were formed by the Constable, supported by the Queen Mother, and by the Duke <hi>de Medina-Celi,</hi> who was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by all the Creatures of Don <hi>Iuan:</hi> But while these Rivals were openly disputing the prize, and all the Court seemed divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, every one embracing a party ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own inclinations, <hi>Don Ieronimo d' Eguya</hi> formed a third almost alone. He saw himself all on the sudden made Secretary of State, when the Marquis <hi>de Valenzuela,</hi> after the removal of F. <hi>Nitard,</hi> became the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Favourite and took away that Office from Don <hi>Pedro Fernandez del Campo,</hi> who did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself supple and submissive enough to him, so that we may say his Haughtiness was the occasion of his Fall, <hi>Valenzuela</hi> having no reason to be content with him, obliged him to quit his Office, and bestowed it upon <hi>d' Eguya.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had too fresh an example before his eyes to fall into the same fault, and being very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droit, complaisant, and well enough versed in dissimulation, neglected nothing to please <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuela</hi> as long as he stood upon his Feet: but when he saw his Fortune declining, and that the Court declared in favour of Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently copied after them, and preserved himself, during that Ministry, by his exemplary Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He was one of the first that espoused his party, and was likewise one of the first that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd the Prince, when he saw his credit began to sink in the world. Nay some time before the end of Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> he managed himself
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52224:84"/>
as he had done before <hi>Valenzuela</hi>'s fall, he entred into a correspondence with the Queen Mother, assuring her that he would only depend upon her, so whether she was really perswaded of his since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or had not as yet a fit occasion to remove him from his Post, she suffered him to continue in it without the least molestation.</p>
            <p>In all these Changes he only held his place by a Commission, but as this furnished him with an occasion to see the King perpetually, and to discourse him in private about all affairs, so he made use of this opportunity to possess him with a distrust of all those, that might with justice make pretensions to his favour, nay even of the most considerable persons: So that being only a simple Secretary of State by a Commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ion, and in all appearance of a narrow unexperienced Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, he beheld himself in a capacity to ballance at one time two powerful parties, so that neither one nor the other could succeed in their affairs, so long as he opposed them.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever Inclinations the King had for the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> Don <hi>Ieronimo</hi> frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, by awakening him with an Idea of Don <hi>Iuan</hi>'s Ministry, <q>The Slavery he then suffered, the Persecution of the Queen Mother, so many Persons of quality ill used without any occasion, the Misery of the People, and many other disorders that inevitably happen, when the Government is abandoned to the Caprice of one man: On the other hand he represented a Junto to him, as a Company of Ministers that would command every body, and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly embarras their own affairs by their Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52224:85"/>
and mutual Discords; that it would be a burthen to himself, as well as unprofitable to the State; that Junto's might do some good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Minority, but that his Majesty was too far advanced in Age, to want any Governors; that suppose he were pleased to compose one, yet the obligation he had to make the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one of the number, would involve him in new difficulties; that his temper was haughty and imperious in Authority, and that he was wholly devoted to the Queen Mother; that she had been accustomed to govern, and would easily come to be Mistress again, by the help of a Junto composed of her own Creatures; that since he was married, and had Prudence and Wit sufficient, he ought to manage himself, and that if ever he was prevailed upon to do otherwise, he would find himself by little and little reduc'd to those sufferings, from which he desir'd to free him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is natural for a Young King to desire to be at large, and independent; so whilst he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued thus in suspence, <hi>Eguya</hi> was Master of all affairs: The Confessor possessed the King with the same sentiments to chuse no Chief Minister, upon whom he must depend: And the Dutchess <hi>de Terra nova</hi> found herself equally concerned to keep off the Queen Mother, a Junto, and a Favourite. During this Interregnum, she had opportunity enough to fix and settle herself in the King's good opinion, she did not question but if the Q. Mother hapned to be once more Mistress, she would endeavour either by herself or by her Creatures to turn her out of the Court;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52224:85"/>
this consideration obliged her to discourse fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with the King, and her only care was to perswade him, that he ought to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of the Queen Mothers designs. She like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise inspired him with the same distrust of the Queen, whose Youth and Easiness of Temper made her uncapable of taking strict measures: She constantly whispered some disagreeable things or other into his Ear, that only tended to disquiet him; but he preserved so great a Love for his Queen, that notwithstanding he believed all the Stories this old Beldam told him, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the less affection and tenderness for her.</p>
            <p>The Court continued still at <hi>Buen-Retiro,</hi> that is to say without <hi>Madrid,</hi> expecting the Queen to make her Entry, after which they were to go and lodge in the Palace; the preparations for her Entry were very long, it was commonly believed for some time that the Queen was with Child, but all these hopes vanishing about the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1680, She made her Entry on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the same Month; The Queen Mother went in the morning to <hi>Buen-Retiro,</hi> from whence she parted some time after along with the King, they went together to see all the streets through which the Queen was to pass, and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Countess <hi>Dognates</hi> in a Balcony made on purpose, and having a Lattice-Window gilt all over, the Avenues that led to <hi>Retiro</hi> were all shut up, and a prohibition was issued out for any Coach to go that way. About eleven the Queen mounted on Horseback, those that were to go before began to march, and passed through a marble Gate, which was but lately built: The
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52224:86"/>
Kettle Drums and the Trumpets of the City, in their Habits used in these Ceremonies, marched at the head of all; after them the Alcaldes of the Court, the Nobility, the Knights of the three Military Orders, the Gentlemen of the King's house, the Mayor domo's to the Queen, and the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> followed by a great number of Lacquays, whose different Liveries of Brocard, and Gallon of Gold and Silver of a mixt colour, made an agreeable diversity; the Querries of the Queen marched on foot immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before her: the Count <hi>de Villa Mayana</hi> was on her Right hand, who was her Chief Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Usher: She was surrounded with her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nins and Pages of Honour (when she walks on foot she always leans upon one of them) the Dutchess <hi>de Terra nova</hi> followed her, and Donna <hi>Laura de Alargon</hi> Governante of the Maids of Honour, both of them mounted upon their Mules, and in their Widdows habit; which somewhat resembles that of Religious Women, except that when they are on Horseback, they wear great Hats on their Heads, which made no less terrible a figure than the rest of their garb. But People saw after this with a great deal of pleasure Donna <hi>Teresa de Toledo,</hi> Donna <hi>Francisca Henriquez,</hi> Donna <hi>Maria de Gusman, Iosepha de Figueroa,</hi> and Donna <hi>Manuela de Velasco,</hi> Maids of Honour to the Queen, all very beautiful and richly drest; they were on Horseback, each of them was accompanied by their Relations, in the midst of whom they marched: There were several led Horses admirably fine, led by Grooms clad in rich Liveries, and the passage was shut
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52224:86"/>
up by the <hi>Guards de la Lancilla.</hi> At the <hi>Prado,</hi> which is one of the most agreeeble walks in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> by reason of the several Fountains that water it continually, was to be seen a Gallery open on every side with one and twenty Arches, there were several jettings out in it, on which the Armes of the several Kingdoms under the Dominion of <hi>Spain</hi> were affixed to Pillars that supported some gilt Statues, which carried Devices in honour of the Queen, with Crowns and Inscriptions that had a relation to the several Kingdoms; The Queen found at the end of the Gallery a Triumphal Arch, very magnificent and well design'd, through which she entred into the City. The Corrigidor and the Rigidors apparelled in Brocard of Gold, of a red Crimson colour, with Bonnets and Breeches, such as the antient <hi>Castilians</hi> wore, presented her with the Keys of the City, and with a Canopy which they carried over her head, during the procession: The Streets were adorned with the richest Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestries, and the precious Stones that were to be seen in the Goldsmiths Row were valued at Eleven Millions. It would take up too much time to describe all the magnificences of that day, I shall only content my self to say, that the Queen was mounted upon a fine <hi>Andaluzian</hi> Horse, which in this noble march seemed proud to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry so beautiful and great a Princess. Her Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit was so covered with Embroidery that the Stuff was not to be seen; she wore on her Hat white Plumes mixt with red; and a Pearl called there the <hi>Peregrina,</hi> which is as big as a small Catherine Pear, and is of an inestimable value,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52224:87"/>
hung below a Clasp of Diamonds with which her Hat was beset. She wore on her finger the great Diamond of the King, which, as they pretend, surpasses in beauty any thing of that nature that was ever set in a Ring. But the graceful deportment of the Queen in all her actions, and particularly in the management of her Horse, and the charms of her person made a greater lustre than all the pretious Stones she wore, altho it is certain that people could scarce behold the glittering of them. She made an halt before the Balcony of the Countess <hi>Dognate</hi> to salute the King, and Queen Mother; they opened the Lattice about 4 broad fingers to see her, and the K. taking hisHanderchief in his hand, carried it several times to his Mouth, his Eyes and his Heart, which is the greatest piece of Gallantry in <hi>Spain.</hi> She went on in her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and the King with the Queen Mother received her in the Court of the Pallace, he helped her to light off her Horse, and the other taking her by the hand conducted her to her Apartment, where she embraced her often, telling her that she was over happy to have so amiable a Daughter in Law. That Evening there were curious Fireworks, and Illuminations for three nights together; the King next day went to the Royal Chappel, where the Queen was likewise in her Chair of State, the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors and Grandees were there according to the Custom, and <hi>Te Deum</hi> was sung. After dinner the King and Queen went out together, which was the first time of their appearing in publick: They were in a Chariot made like a Triumphal
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52224:87"/>
Coach without a Crown upon it, and open on all sides to shew themselves to the People, they traversed the great Square before the Palace, and passed through several Streets, where the Balconies were full of Ladies, who mingled their Acclamations with those of the people; the Grandees followed their Majesties in very rich Coaches, with a great number of Livery men. There were abundance of these Lords who for nine days together had nine different Liveries, and each finer than the other; after this manner they went to our Ladies <hi>Datocha,</hi> and it being already night before they returned to the Palace, white wax Tapers were lighted at all the Windows, and the Streets were so prettily illuminated, by them, that a man might almost see from one end of the City to the other. The finest show of these Lights was at the <hi>Placa Mayor,</hi> which is a very large noble Square, the Houses are built with five Rows of Balconies one over another, and could reckon above three Thousand Tapers in all. As soon as the King and Queen were arrived there, the Fireworks began. Many other diversions lasted for several days; sometimes their Majesties went a hunting, at other times to a Comedy, or took a Walk: Sometimes they went to Sup with the Queen Mother, or the Queen Mother came to eat with them at the Palace. All the Ladies had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to kiss the Queen's Hand, the Councils and the Grandees complemented her also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:52224:88"/>Some days after her Entry a Bull-feast was kept at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which was the most magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the kind that had been seen for a long time. The King and the Queen came to the Great Square about one a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon: aftewards entred the Duke <hi>de Medina Sidonia,</hi> the Marquess <hi>Camaraza</hi> Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> Don <hi>Felix de Cordova,</hi> Second Son of the Duke <hi>de Sessa,</hi> Don <hi>Francisco Moscoso,</hi> and Don <hi>Fernando de Lea,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Cordova,</hi> each of them followed by an hundred Lacqueys, some dressed after the <hi>Turkish,</hi> others after the <hi>Graecian</hi> fashion; and after this manner they represented several Nations. They combated the Bulls with extraordinary dexterity and courage; the Son of the Duke <hi>de Sessa</hi> had two Horses killed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. This sport is an old remainder of the Moors, whose Genius and Customs are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely extinguished in <hi>Spain,</hi> altho they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have been long turned out of it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> still seem to preserve something of the barbarity of these people, since they do so freely expose themselves the rage of Mad Bulls to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Publick. But to say the truth, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation is one of the finest things in the world, and nothing can afford so agreeable a prospect, as the place of the Combat, which is prodigiously spacious, encompassed with five ranks of Balconies all equal and regular, and curiously set out with rich hangings and Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as filled with almost an infinite number of Spectators.</p>
            <p>The King on the eighteenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> named the Marquess <hi>d' Ossera</hi> to go Vice-Roy <hi>per inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> because the Count <hi>d' Egmon</hi> was not as yet in a condition to go thither: He named the same day the Marquess <hi>de Fuentes,</hi> Son to him who had been Ambassador in <hi>France,</hi> to go thither in that quality in the room of the Duke <hi>de Giovenazzo,</hi> who from an Envoy to the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> was nominated to that of <hi>France,</hi> but it seems was at last destined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Turin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Marquess <hi>de Villa Mayna,</hi> Chief Gentleman Usher to the Queen discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Office of Master of the Horse, in the place of the Duke <hi>d' Ossone,</hi> who for his ill conduct was prohibited to come to the Palace. The Marquess <hi>d' Astorgas</hi> took the advantage of his absence to make his own Court, and altho he had been indisposed, and continued to be so still, yet he went every day with five Coaches of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fineness, and a numerous retinue of Livery-men to wait upon the King. The Duke <hi>d' Ossone</hi> being informed of it resolved to meet him, and give him some affront, so he took abundance of people with him, and knowing which way the Marquess was to pass, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Coachman to drive thither full speed, and to overturn the Marquess's Coach, in case he was within: It happened he went that day in a Chair, and his Coaches followed him, but the Duke <hi>d' Ossone</hi>'s Coachman for all that met with him so conveniently, that he threw him along in the River: This rencounter made a great noise, and did not at all accommodate the affairs of the Duke, which before this were in no good condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:52224:89"/>Madam, the Constable <hi>Colonna</hi>'s Lady, who went out of the Convent, where she sojourned, to behold the Queens Entry, staid with the Marchioness <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> till the fifth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> when she was carried away by the King's Order to a Convent some leagues off <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the Custom of <hi>Spain,</hi> that upon all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn occasions, whether of Joy or Grief, all the Kingdoms and all the Principalities that depend upon the King, send their Deputies to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him. Thus Don <hi>Pedro de Salinas y Vnda</hi> came in the name of the Principality of <hi>d' Avila,</hi> accompanied with the Duke <hi>de Pastrane,</hi> and Don <hi>Ioseph de Silva</hi> his Brother, to kiss the King's hand, and complement him upon the score of his marriage. The Kingdoms of <hi>Naples, Navar, Arragon, Granada,</hi> and divers other places sent likewise. After the King had given them Audience, he took the Queen along with him to a great hunting of the Wild Boar, where they killed abundance of them. The Duke <hi>de Pastrane,</hi> who exercised the Office of Chief Ranger in the absence of the Marquess <hi>de Liche,</hi> conducted the Queen to a place in the Forrest, that was extreamly pleasant. Several streams of water ran by the place, and under some of the highest Trees a Pavilion of Gold Brocard adorned with a Fringe of the same, was set up. All the Trees were covered with little Apes, Squirrels and Parrots, and a thousand other Birds that were fastned to them; young Boys that were drest like Fauns and Silvanes, and Girls apparelled like Nymphs and Driades, and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdesses
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52224:89"/>
served up a nobleCollation to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, who seemed to be at first extreamly pleased with the entertainment. But altho no body knew what it was that disquieted her afterwards, she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be very sad all the remainder of the day.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Candlemas day</hi> there was a procession in the Galleries of the Palace; the Religious of the <hi>Mendicant Orders,</hi> and all the Ecclesiasticks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Chappel walked before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the King, and those of the Queen follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after. The Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> marched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Majesties, the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> held up the Queens Train, the Maids of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour came next, and there did not seem to be above eighteen or twenty of them: 'Tis not here as in other Holidays where they all wait upon their Soveraign.</p>
            <p>Tho the young Queen changed her place of abode, yet she did not change that solitary and disagreeable life she led at <hi>Buen Retiro,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guard of the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova.</hi> She governed her like a Child, and continued still to treat her after a worse manner, unless it were that she was permitted to receive the visits of some Ladies, which oftentimes appeared more tedious to her than even solitude it self; not that they wanted wit, for no body can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them with want of that: But the Queen understood but a little of what they said, and besides could not repose that confidence in them, which gives liberty, and life, and spirit to Conversation; all was Grandeur, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Reverence, and State. Much about this time I had the honour to kiss her hand, but
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52224:90"/>
she could not forbear smiling, to see me so much altered for the worse by my <hi>Spanish</hi> Garb, for unless her self alone, I never saw a Stranger look well in that Habit. After I had passed through her Apartments, which to say the truth, were exceeding pretty, I found her in her Closet, which was painted and gilded, and set out with great Looking Glasses fastned to the ceiling; she sate upon a little square Stool near the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, making Gold Net Work, mingled with Blew Silk; her Hair was parted in the middle of her Head, which was bare, only one knot of her Hair was curled and plaited with great Pearls, and reached down to her Waste; she had a Velvet Robe on, of a Rose Colour, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Silver, and had Pendants in her Ears that touched her very Breast, and so heavy that she gave her self the trouble to take out one of them that I might pass my judgment on it, and I was exceedingly surprized at it. She spoke very little <hi>French</hi> to me, affecting to talk <hi>Spanish</hi> before the <hi>Camarera Major.</hi> She order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to send her all the Letters I received from <hi>France</hi> which had any news in them, to which I replied, that the news which was sent to me did not deserve the consideration of so great a Queen. Ah good God, cryed she, lifting up her Eyes with a charming air, I shall never think meanly of any thing that comes out of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is so dear to me. This affection, said I to her, which your Majesty preserves for your own Native Country, makes me hope eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, Madam, since as I have the happiness to be one, so I have all the inclinations of a good
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52224:90"/>
               <hi>French</hi> Woman. She answered this with her usual goodness, and whispered me in <hi>French,</hi> that she would rather see me apparalled after the <hi>French</hi> fashion than that of <hi>Spain:</hi> But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, said I to her, 'tis a sacrifice which I have made to the respect I have for your Majesty. Say rather, continued she with a smiling air, that the rigid temper of the Dutchess has frightned you. She appeared to me so very charming that day, that I could not forbear to admire her, for in spight of her melancholy she was plump and and in good liking, and that contributed to make her still more beautiful and agreeable.</p>
            <p>When I came back to my lodgings, I found my Letters from <hi>France</hi> were arrived; there was one amongst the rest, which I supposed would please the Queen, so I made all the haste I could the next morning to carry it to her, but the <hi>Camarera</hi> would not suffer me to have the honour of seeing the Queen two days together, therefore I was contented to write to the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess, desiring her to present that Letter to the Queen.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52224:91"/>
together did not glitter so brightly as her Eyes, and whose lustre was inferiour to the Lillies and Roses of her Complexion. All the Court was in a transport as soon as she appeared, and the majesty of her stature was not a little increased by a Train five Ells long, which Mademoiselle <hi>de Nante</hi> carried. The King drew near to a Table that stood against the Wall; the Queen was on his left hand, and next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Monseigneur, Monsieur, Madam, Mademoiselle <hi>d' Orleans,</hi> Madam the Dutchess of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Guise,</hi> Monsieur the Prince, and Monsieur the Duke, and Madam the Dutchess, the Prince <hi>de la Roche sur yon,</hi> Mademoiselle <hi>de Bourbon,</hi> the Princess <hi>de Carignan,</hi> the Count <hi>de Verman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois,</hi> the Count <hi>du Maine,</hi> Mademoiselle <hi>de Nante,</hi> and Mademoiselle <hi>de Tours,</hi> all placed in a Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle about the Table.

The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>de Seignelay</hi> drew near to the King, and read the beginning of the Contract with a loud voice, but he had scarce read the qualifications, when the King told him 'twas enough, and so signed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. After all the Royal Family had signed it the Cardinal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> entred, and advanced forward to the middle of the Chamber; then the Prince <hi>de Conty</hi> and Mademoiselle <hi>de Blois</hi> approached up to him, and performed the Ceremony of the Betrothing. The Princess's Name, as you know, is <hi>Anna Maria,</hi> and the Prince's <hi>Louis Armand</hi>: This Ceremony being over, the King and all the Court went to see an <hi>Opera.</hi> Next day the Cardinal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> married this young Prince and beautiful Princess in the Chappel of the Old Castle in the presence of the

            <p>The Queen Mother had given all imaginable assistance to the Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> to deliver her from part of her troubles, if she could have cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her self of those suspicions with which some people had possest her against her; but she unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily imagining, that the other still regretted the Arch-Dutchess, and would have been glad to see her in her place, that opinion made her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly distrustful: and the Queen Mother who found nothing of that openness of heart and freedom as she desired, was likewise trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for her part: for in effect, she loved her tenderly, and was ready to give her all possible testimonies of her affection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:52224:92"/>The Ambassador of <hi>France,</hi> his Lady, and the Confessor often reminded the Queen of that conduct she was to observe, if she intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be happy. <q>They told her, that she ought to give her self intirely up to the Queen her Mother in Law out of a principle of Duty, and Gratitude for the friendship she showed her, as out of a consideration of her own proper interests: they represented to her, that the Queen Mother ought not to be suspected by her, and that altho the Arch Dutchess was her Grand Daughter, yet she had received such few tokens and assurances of friendship from the Emperour during her disgrace, that she was too sensible ever to forget it: that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>France</hi> towards her was directly opposite to this, that there she had been pitied and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that her Most Christian Majesty had ever preserved a strict correspondence and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with her, and that the Queen Mother knew well enough that she could not by any returns oblige the Queen of <hi>France</hi> more, than by showing back all that kindness to the young Queen of <hi>Spain</hi>; that she had all the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in her, which could engage her heart; that besides this she hoped to see her give an Heir to the Crown; that this was necessary for the good of <hi>Spain</hi>; that the melancholy humour, to which she abandoned her self, might hinder her from having one; that they ought to concert all their affairs together, in order to possess the good graces and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the King; that it was natural to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he would divide his power between his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52224:92"/>
Mother and his Queen, rather than bestow it upon a Favourite, who would think of serving him no longer, than his Family reaped advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by it; whereas the Souls of Soveraigns, having something in them that was more noble and great, than those of private persons, the motives of interest would never be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to influence two Queens, so much as they would a Chief Minister; that in fine there ought to be no separation between them, but that they must begin with the union of their hearts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen relished these reasons, and found them plausible enough, but for all that she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed all on a sudden into her old distrust, into which the different things that had been said to her, did cast her anew: Besides the extream trouble she suffered from the rigid conduct of the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi>; she found her so absolute and inflexible that she began to fear her, to which the tenderness of her youth, her want of experience, and her natural sweetness contributed not a little, so that she could not open her self to the Queen Mother, when she considered, that if she did not really love her, but would make invidious reflexions upon what she said, this would be the way to throw her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new inconveniencies; so that notwithstanding the desire she had to speak to her, she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways silent in her company. The Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perceived it well enough, yet for all that she continued to visit her almost every day, and sent her presents from time to time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:52224:93"/>At last the young Queen being entirely van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished by all these demonstrations of amity, resolved to submit her self wholly to her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. They had a long conference together, where they took those measures which they judged were necessary to promote their common satisfaction. After this the Queen Mother spoke to the King, but found him in a cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served humour, so she made him no discoveries of any thing, but took her opportunity to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, imagining with her self that her Son would be obliged to come after her; and that the world might take less notice of this alteration, she gave out that she only desired to live easie, and that she preferred her own repose to all other considerations whatsoever: She talked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this rate before several persons, in whom she reposed no ordinary confidence, altho at the bottom she was clearly of a different opinion.</p>
            <p>The Constable was the first man that was aware of this alteration, and was one of those who were mightily troubled at it. He easily saw that the Queen Mother was leaving all thoughts of advancing him, and as he had his own particular views, so he used all the means in the world to effect his designs. In fine, he joyned interests with the <hi>Camarera Major,</hi> Don <hi>Ieronimo d' Eguya,</hi> and the King's Confessor, who brought the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> into the same confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy: the design of these three last was to set up the Constable against the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> whose favour with the King increased, as they thought, very fast, and this gave them vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent jealousies of him. The Constable for his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52224:93"/>
part endeavoured to gain by them what they designed to make the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> lose; his Emissaries began to promote the affair with very favourable appearances, but after they had seriously reflected upon the imperious humour of the Constable. <q>He is so arrogant and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, said they, that he would rather ruin every man of us, than ever be brought to own that he was obliged to us for his elevation, and whatever Minister has his place, will certainly be less dangerous than he.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Don <hi>Ieronimo d' Eguya,</hi> who thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but how to ballance the credit of these two Lords one with the other, did not neglect their reflections. He mentioned them almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and endeavoured to make them more strong if it were possible, he found it would be a great deal more advantagious to him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the same condition, than to see himself subjected to a new dependance, and this reason obliged him to inspire the King with an aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and jealousie for the Constable; so that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of doing him any service as he promised, he did him underhand all the ill offices imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>When our own particular interest lies at stake, and we are pursuing the dictates of our ambition, we are so clear-sighted, that it is a difficult matter for any one to deceive us long. We penetrate even into the most secret thoughts of him that calls himself our friend, and easily find out whether he doth us good or ill. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant to this maxim, the Constable soon percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how well he was served by his friends, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52224:94"/>
what designs each of them drove in particular. It is no difficult matter to imagine how a person of his Temper, as I have already described, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented this usage, and his uneasiness to be sure was so much the more violent because he smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd it for some time before he let it break out.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Ieronimo de Eguya</hi> was the first person whom he attacqued. Having represented to them one day in a full Council, and that with the greatest fierceness in the world, how all affairs went from bad to worse, he added, that no body ought to be surprized to find it so, since <hi>d' Eguya</hi> who pretended, to manage every thing, had neither Judgment, nor Experience, nor Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and that he ought to be confined to the Duties of his Post, without medling with those things that had no relation at all to it. When he had ended his discourse, Don <hi>Manuel de Lira</hi> Secretary of State of the Council of <hi>Italy,</hi> who was of the Constables Faction, presented to them at the same time a large memorial, in which he laid open the vast prejudice which the State of Affairs received from the ill conduct of <hi>de Eguya,</hi> and most of them there had been well enough satisfied, if these complaints had obliged the King to remove him.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Manuel de Lira</hi> did not act only out of Complaisance to the Constable but had his own private ends. He imagined that if <hi>d' Eguya</hi> were once turned out of his Post, he might perhaps succeed him in it. Now nothing animates a man's zeal in any affair, more than the prospect of some advantage or other to be gained by it.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52224:94"/>
However this same business did not meet with that success which he and the Constable proposed to themselves, so after long consideration the Constable was obliged to come back to the Queen Mother, and importune her to appear in favour of him. He represented to her, <q>That if the Chief Minister was not one of her party, her repose would not be of long continuance; that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> stood very fair for it, and altho he advanced insensibly, yet it was probable he would soon find himself pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of a place where he would make his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies severely feel the weight of his Indignation; that in spight of Politicks, to which he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he would not fail to set up the President of <hi>Castile</hi> against her, who was a Creature of Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> and always ready to execute those resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that had lodged in his breast so long; that this Duke was the very person who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had the hardiness to carry her the Order for her Exile; that he seem'd at that time to rejoyce at her misfortunes and perplexities; that if ever he came to be Favourite, she would find him to be a constant rub in her way, and that this conjecture perhaps was not ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, since the Duke still possessed all the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Don <hi>Iuan.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen Mother was alarmed at what the Constable represented to her, and gave him her word to act vigorously in his behalf; but the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> being advertised of it, was resolved to prevent the blow, and judged it the best expedient to soften the Spirit of the Queen Mother, by making a profound Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52224:95"/>
to her. In fine he went to her, and told her, <q>That he was resolved to be oblig'd to her for all the King's favours, and desired to depend upon her out of an obligation of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as he had done a long time ago out of Duty and Inclination; that he humbly begged of her to do him the justice as to believe, that his Heart, his Birth, and his Fortune, were too great ever to suffer him to be one of Don <hi>Iuan</hi>'s Creatures; that he would never receive that title but from his own Master, and that the Party must wear a Crown who commanded the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi>; that altho he had declared himself for the President of <hi>Castile,</hi> yet it was not out of a Consideration of Don <hi>Iuan,</hi> but the King's Service, and he was ready to abandon his Interest at any time, having no particular engagements of Friendship to him; and that if he appeared in this affair, it was only done with a design to defend the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the King, which the Nuncio had a mind to invade in the conduct which he used towards the President.</q> The Queen Mother answered him, that she did not without a great satisfaction, believe what he said to be true, that she had a great esteem for him, and would not fail to give him convincing proofs of it in a short time.</p>
            <p>The Constable being informed on his side, that Queen Mother had very favourably receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Submission of the Duke, whether out of a Spirit of kindness, or indifference to the choice the King might make of a Chief Minister, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired at last of seeing himself succeed in any of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52224:95"/>
his projects, either of the Junto whereof he pretended to be a Member if one were erected, or in the place of Favourite which he could have desired rather to fill alone. He resolved to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit something at least of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> by yielding up that Post with a good grace, when he was in a capacity to dispute it with him still.</p>
            <p>In short, he laid hold of the first opportunity he could find, to tell the King that no Person was fitter to serve his Majesty, and preserve the Government in good order, than the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi.</hi> He bestowed wonderful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations upon him for the good conduct he had ever used; The free unconstrained manner wherein he spoke all this, was exceeding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, especially in a man of the Constables haughty Temper, who, as the world imagined, would dye a thousand times, rather than offer this violence inwardly to himself: But people at last believed that he design'd to render himself agreeable to the King, by commending a man, for whom his Majesty testified so great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. After all, it must be confessed that he showed a generosity, which is not common, in treating his declared Enemy after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>It cannot be easily imagin'd, what a great detriment the Republick received by these Factions of the Courtiers, and the King's Irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to take or not take a Chief Minister. Nothing was concluded, nothing was done; a Spirit of Lethargy seemed to be predominant at Court, which helped to increase those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52224:96"/>
under which the Kingdom laboured before. Every body languished to see what would be the success of the smallest matters; and business that had been carried into the Council, tarried there whole years, nay things that went directly into the King's hands were dispatched never the sooner. Thus no one knew what Party to take, or where to address himself.</p>
            <p>Our Ambassador who promised himself to find a better treatment than he had met with a long while, and which he dexterously dissembled in expectation of the Queen's arrival, perceived at last that they designed to satisfie him no better, than the other Ministers. who made their Complaints. About five Months were passed since he demanded Justice for some vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Peace that were lately committed as well by the Governors of the Provinces, as by the taking of several Vessels, and the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others. But at the time when he was urgent to have a positive answer, he received a new injury by the insolence of an <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Who is a kind of a Provost or Judge.</note> Alcalde, and several <note n="(b)" place="bottom">These are Serjeants and Bayliffs.</note> Alguazils who passed before his House, which was never done at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in the quarter belonging to an Ambassador. He was extremely surprized at it, but was so far from receiving the satisfaction that was due to him for this affront, that they told him His Majesty had given Order that his quarter should
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52224:96"/>
be no longer exempt. This Resolution so much the more disgusted him, because it affected only himself, and all the other Ambassadors enjoyed their Priviledges as formerly. Not but that they had several other complaints upon their Hands, as for example, the Envoy from the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> made a great noise because they had amused him a long time with specious promises that had no effect at all; they ow'd his Master a great Sum of money, he demanded the payment of it, but they shifted him off from time to time, so that at last he perceived that they neither had the power nor inclination to satisfie him. The Nuncio did not seem to be less disgusted for his part, because he saw the President of <hi>Castile</hi> keep his Place and continue still in Favour, altho the Pope had declared him suspended, and he himself omitted no application to have justice done upon him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time they wanted mony to raise four <hi>Spanish</hi> Regiments that were design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be sent to <hi>Milain,</hi> because they apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some motion from the Court of <hi>France,</hi> but it was almost impossible to find any funds, and besides this the Silver that came from the <hi>Indies</hi> in the <hi>Flota</hi> was so suddenly gone and with so little order, that no body knew what was become of it, so that it was a difficult matter to send any returns into <hi>Flanders,</hi> or other places, where there was occasion. Those that used to advance mony upon these sorts of occasions, would now do nothing at
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52224:97"/>
all, they were all of them drained, and the necessities were generally so great, that they knew not where to take up mony to defray the ordinary expences of the King and Queens House. This proceeded in part from the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of the mony; a Pistole which ought to go for no more than fourty eight <hi>Reals de Vellon,</hi> was raised up to a hundred and ten; and the Patacoons that are only worth twelve <hi>Reals</hi> went at the rate of thirty. The occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it was this, a great part of the <hi>Reals de Vellon,</hi> that are of Copper, were bad, and the common custom made them pass as well in commerce, as if they had been good. But at last they were called in all on the sudden, by reason of the excessive price a Pistole was raised to, and 'tis impossible to recount the disorders and inconveniencies that attended this new Regulation. The Court was of opinion in the month of <hi>February</hi> 1680. that there was a necessity to find out some remedy or other suddenly for it; so a Pistole from a hundred and ten <hi>Reals</hi> was levelled to fourty eight, the Patacoons to twelve, and the other mony was so confounded one with the other, that it was reduced to the eighth part of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary value. There was no body almost but lost more or less upon the account of this new Regulation, and accordingly felt it; that which before the sinking the value of the mony was worth fourty <hi>Reals,</hi> which make four Livers of <hi>French</hi> mony, since the reducing of it, was worth a hundred and ten
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52224:97"/>
               <hi>Reals,</hi> which is ten Livers of our mony; so that what Commodities a man could buy on <hi>Munday</hi> for fifty Sons, went on the <hi>Tuesday</hi> for above a third part more; and the Debtor, who, it may be, on <hi>Saturday</hi> owed twenty thousand <hi>Reals de Vellon,</hi> which made but two hundred Pistoles, found to his sorrow the next day after that he owed near five hundred Pistoles. This ruined a great number of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and caused a mighty dejection in the spirits of the people; for every thing a man has occasion to buy, is dearer by much in <hi>Madrid</hi> than any where else, because they are brought a great way off, and there are few or no Manufactures at all in that part of the Country. A kind of a mutiny happened at <hi>Toledo,</hi> because after this sinking the value of mony, no care was taken to regulate the price of Provisions, for which they paid excessive rates. It is still to be noted, that the Civil Government in <hi>Spain</hi> is managed but after a very sorry manner, and that the slow lazy humour of those persons, who might, if they pleased, correct the ill conduct of others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes exceedingly to the publick loss.</p>
            <p>All these disorders and continual complaints, which made a noise from all quarters, began at last to shake and undermine Don <hi>Ieronimo d' Eguya.</hi> He knew very well, that the Post where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he stood, was ticklish and dangerous, and that after all his endeavours to disgust the world, in case he remedied nothing, the oblige maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and hatred would fall upon the Favourite.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52224:98"/>
The present ill state of affairs was attributed to his ill conduct, so he thought within himself, that he could not too soon deliver himself from the torrent of the popular fury, and therefore resolved to omit nothing, whereby he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the King to choose a Chief Minister. The consideration of his own interest soon determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to act vigorously in favour of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> he knew the King had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affection for him, and besides he perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself, that when the Duke was informed what good offices he had done him, he would maintain him still in his Post, as well out of a principle of acknowledgment, as for the great services he might do him in these affairs, since he had managed them for so long a time, and consequently was in a capaci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y to furnish him with some necessary lights, which all those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that newly enter into the Government are altoge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her unacquainted with. And then he knew the natural sweetness of the Duke's temper would never permit him to turn him out of his place, and he was certain that as long as he continued in it, he could manage the King's favour, the functions of his place giving him opportunity to approach near the King's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son very often.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Camarera Major,</hi> and his Majesty's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor had each of them particular designs in their head, however they were both agreed as to the Duke's advancement, so that all the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with the favourable dispositions which the King had for him, he signed a Decree (that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52224:98"/>
is the usual term with them in <hi>Spain</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declared the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> to be Chief Minister. He immediately commanded Father <hi>Relux</hi> to carry it to him, who came to his House about ten a Clock at night on the twenty first of <hi>February</hi> 1680. and acquainted him with the good news.</p>
            <p>No body had any reason to be surprized at the Duke's elevation. It seems he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himself the place some time before, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were because the King gave him his promise, or that some outward appearances assured him of it.</p>
            <p>However it was, it was agreed upon by all hands at Court that the King could not have made a better choice. He was a person in whom all good qualities were to be found; his agreeable Conversation, his obliging Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, his noble and generous. Deportment, his free easie Temper, made him beloved by all the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> world: People only wundered, that being so great a Lord as he was, he would sacrifice his repose to the administration of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that were then in a miserable condition. They could scarce imagine (and perhaps he was of the same opinion himself) how he could ever be able to remedy evils of so invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a malignity. Before he could effect this, he must in all appearance make an intire Change in the ordering of the Monarchy, but this was an impracticable design, and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be executed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:52224:99"/>As soon as the choice His Majesty had made in favour of the Duke, came to be publickly known; all Persons that were of any Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty went to complement him, as well the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of foreign Princes, as the Grandees of <hi>Spain.</hi> The next day being accompanied by all his Friends and Relations, he repaired to Court to kiss his Majesty's hand, and thank him most humbly for all his great favours. On the following days he received visits in his Bed, pretending a slight indisposition to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt himself from the fatigue of Ceremonies, His Apartment and Furniture were extreamly magnificent, but it is an odd sight to see a <hi>Spaniard</hi> in his Bed of State, because they wear no Morning Gowns here, but only their <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilia</hi> and black Cloaks, and have their Hats on, or else are bare-headed, for the Men as well as the Women wear no Caps; He had enjoyed the place of <hi>Sumiller de Corps, i. e.</hi> Lord Chamberlain for a long time, and in this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he was the only person that commanded in the King's Chamber, and lay there.</p>
            <p>He did not delay to give publick Audience in the Hall, which they call the <hi>Rubis,</hi> and is the place where the Council of State uses to assemble. 'Tis under the King's Apartment. Here it was that the Duke received the visit of the Nuncio and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassador, they did not seem to be pleased at the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wherein the Chairs were disposed, because it could not absolutely be determined whether either of them or he had the Chief Place of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52224:99"/>
Honour. Besides this, he only reconduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the middle of the Hall of Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. They acquainted the Marquess <hi>de Villars</hi> with it, who told them that he had designed to make that visit along with them, because the Ambassadors of the Chappel generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit themselves of these sorts of devoirs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but that he was not displeased with himself for not being there, since he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to take direction by the fault they had committed; and that he would not neglect, as they did, to use all necessary precautions about the Step, Place and Rank, and would be assured both of the one and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he performed that Ceremony. In short, he sent to the Duke to know whether he would not receive him, as Don <hi>Louis de Haro</hi> used to receive the Ambassadors of <hi>France</hi>; he immediately agreed to it, and that there might be no mistakes committed, the places were marked out, and every thing was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed before the day of Audience. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ambassadors were concerned at the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight they had committed, and by this visit of our Ambassador, regulated those they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to make to the Chief Minister.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> kissed the Kings hand and the Queens, he complemented them from the part of the City of St. <hi>Iago de Compostella,</hi> the Marquess <hi>d' Astorgas</hi> did the same from the City of <hi>Avila.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time Don <hi>Francisco d' Agourto</hi> was nominated by the King to be Master of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52224:100"/>
the Camp General of the Cavalry. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy extraordinary from <hi>England</hi> surprized all the Court by the strict prohibition he gave his Domesticks not to suffer any Ecclesiasticks or Religious to come within his Doors.</p>
            <p>The young Queen was so taken up with the diversions of the Carnaval, that she had scarce opportunity to perceive that this was a set time of mirth and jollity: Her best days were spent in hunting with the King, and the three last days of the Carnaval there was a Comedy represented upon the Theatre at <hi>Buen-Retiro,</hi> which is a well-contrived Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The King and the Queen saw it on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> the next day it was acted before the several Councils, and on <hi>Tuesday</hi> before the Officers of the City. The Queen being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the Dutchess <hi>de Bejar,</hi> and the Marchioness <hi>de Castel Rodrigo,</hi> who had never bore any Children before, were each of them delivered of a Son, begged leave of the King to send them word that she wished them joy, <q>I agree to it, says the King smiling, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that within nine months they will come in their turn to perform the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All <hi>Spain</hi> impatiently expected to see what remedies the New Ministers would apply to those disorders, that seemed for a long time to be radicated in the Monarchy; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good intentions he had to rectifie them, he found it a difficult matter to put them in execution. The King's Treasury was exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52224:100"/>
several private Families ruined, the price of all Commodities excessive high; and these perplexities were heightned by the connivance of the Magistrates, and the length of time. During the Ministry of Don <hi>Iuan</hi> nothing had been set in order, and since his death one would have thought they had affected to abandon all manner of business.</p>
            <p>To this we may add, that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had never been in any employ, where he might learn that experience which is so necessary for Government. He was born and bred in the Genius of <hi>Madrid,</hi> which is so supine and careless, that nothing almost is determined there. Nay what is more, he suffered the Master of the Council to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate about the Publick Affairs, after the same manner, as he did, before his Ministry, and submitted to take his Counsel; he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise erected <hi>Iunta's</hi> to debate of those things, which he supposed to carry any great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with them.</p>
            <p>He erected one amongst the rest, to which he nominated the Constable, the Admiral, and the Marquess <hi>d' Astorgas,</hi> all which three were Councellors of State; he also admitted three Divines, whereof the King's Confessor was one, and three Councellors of the King's Council to examine along with him the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of the President of <hi>Castile,</hi> about which the Nuncio made so great a noise. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this Dispute was this, Monsieur <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini,</hi> the Nuncio, had a mind to preside over
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52224:101"/>
a Chapter of Religious, whom they call <hi>Clericos Minores,</hi> who were going to choose a Provincial. The President desired that one of his friends might be named; now he knew that the Nuncio had a kindness for another, so he went the shortest way to work, and obtained a Decree of the King, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him to preside in that Assembly, and because he did not exactly obey it, he was fined a thousand Crowns.</p>
            <p>The Nuncio suffered this strange treatment with indignation enough, and complained of it to the Pope. His Holiness writ to the King about it, and Don <hi>Iuan</hi> promised him to get the Fine revoked; but the many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders that happened after his death, hindred the execution of it. The King thought the business was laid asleep, because he writ a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry submissive Letter to the Pope about it, but for all that, the Nuncio, who was not to be appeased by a Letter, renewed the quarrel after the Prince's death. He saw that the King had not as yet pitched upon a Chief Minister, and judged that the President of <hi>Castile</hi> was not well supported; he knew he had abundance of enemies, and that amongst the rest the Queen Mother was the most inveterate against him. All these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations served to perswade him, that he should obtain an intire satisfaction without any trouble:</p>
            <p>He pretended therefore that he ought to lose his Place, and to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to have the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52224:101"/>
suspension taken off, which he had incurred in the year 1679. The Court absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to grant him what he demanded; upon this he complained very highly to the King, telling him that he ill performed what he had promised the Pope in his Letter.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> being advanced to the Ministry, was willing to examine the reasons of the Nuncio, and those of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident by a <hi>Iunta.</hi> 'Twas alledged in favour of the last, that being a native of <hi>Spain,</hi> the King could not abandon him to the Pope's resentments if at the bottom he did not deserve it; that it was true indeed he had done irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular things upon several occasions, but then his Place was of that nature, that he could not forfeit it unless it were for reasons of the greatest importance: The Chief Minister de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he should keep his Place of being President of the Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and that Don <hi>Vicente Gonzaga</hi> should perform all his Functions. He received with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary satisfaction the offer which the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Castile</hi> made, to resign the Office of Master of the Horse to him, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally possest by the Favourite, but would not accept of it.</p>
            <p>He gave order to Don <hi>Gabriel Quinones,</hi> Secretary of the Council of War, to bring in his accounts, out of hopes of drawing some mony from thence; and indeed the State was never in such extremity of want as now; for since the publishing of the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52224:102"/>
King's Declaration for sinking the value of mony, all Commerce was intirely stopt, the Shops continued shut up, and the people groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the greatest necessities imaginable. The Duke used all his power to remedy these pressing Grievances, he designed to coin new mony, and to lessen the price of all Commodities, but the effect of his good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions was long delayed, and the publick misery increased more and more every day.</p>
            <p>Hereupon a man of great business, whose name was <hi>Marcos Dias</hi> presented a Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Duke, wherein he proposed a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to raise the King's Revenue, and yet ease the people; he offered to prove that the Magistrates of the City of <hi>Madrid,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of reimbursing themselves of the mony they had lent the late King, had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed considerable summs, and had never given any account of them. He proposed a way to force them to refund the overplus, as well to supply the present want, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like exactions for the time to come. The Duke hearkned to him, and told him his advice was good. Immediately after this <hi>Marcos Dias</hi> presented another Memorial to him, wherein he shewed, that his Majesty's Dues were considerably diminished, that he offered to pay the full worth of them, and yet to make an advance of two hundred thousand Crowns, a present of a hundred thousand Crowns to the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lessen the imposition of the Dues one half of what it
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52224:102"/>
amounted to the year 1664. when they were less by one third part, than they were this present year. For this he demanded that the Rents of the Guild-Hall of the City of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> the payments whereof were assigned for these funds, should be reduced to five in the hundred, whereas they were risen to eight; and what is more, he still offered to reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse those persons who were not willing to suffer this diminution.</p>
            <p>It is natural to believe, that he knew his own accounts well enough, not to lose any thing by his project, and to say the truth he had been no loser: for the disorders and rapines were at that time so great, that not a ninth part of the King's rights came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Coffers. The Duke foreseeing the event of this affair, advised <hi>Marcos Dias</hi> not to stir out of the Palace, but he had a mind to go to <hi>Alcala,</hi> and he returned with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of blood and Convulsions, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned the belief that he was poisoned: for this overture of accommodating the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affaris, disgusted some particular persons of great estates, who got prodigious summs at the expence of the King and People. These persons, to avert this blow, had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Dias,</hi> and threatned to have him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly stabbed if he continued his proposals. He was very apprehensive of the danger he incurred, and besides this, these very Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates offered the same terms to his Majesty: But the Duke saw there was all the reason
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52224:103"/>
in the world to prefer <hi>Dias,</hi> and so he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the others. Upon a consideration of what these differences might produce, the Duke advised him to have a care of himself, till the Treaty was concluded. The advice was good, if he had had the good fortune to have followed it, but as he came back from <hi>Alcala</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> he met some men in Masques, who gave him several blows with little bags full of Sand, so that he spit abundance of blood at his mouth, and being seized with a violent Feavor died on the first day of <hi>April.</hi> The Corrigidor, and some other Officers of the City were the men that were principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exasperated against him, because he had discovered their Villanies a little before: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless they were willing to submit to some beneficial alterations in matters, and so they reduced the Rents of the Guild-Hall of the City, from eight to five in the hundred. There was also some small regulation made in the Civil Government, but the Duke could not forbear to be sensibly touched for losing, by the death of <hi>Dias,</hi> an opportunity to serve the King and ease the People.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the people who had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flattered themselves that if the Proposals made by <hi>Dias</hi> had taken effect, they should have met with plenty instead of want; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g informed of his indisposition, flocked about his House, and cryed out aloud, that he was poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, and that this business ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined to the bottom, because he suffered for
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52224:103"/>
the good will he had expressed towards them. They added menaces against those persons who had opposed such profitable advice, and as the King accidentally passed by them in his Coach, a great body of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> got about the Coach, and followed it crying,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vive el Roi y muera el mal Goviorno,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Let the King live, and the ill Government dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were great endeavours used to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the first motions of the popular fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which exceedingly increased on the day that <hi>Dias</hi> died. Above six thousand were got together, who ran up and down the Streets complaining and weeping bitterly, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them said, that they had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the only man that wished them well. They accompanied his body to the place of burial, and the Streets were so full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the King durst not stir out of his Palace, altho he was to go to a great Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val that was celebrated by the Jesuits, and he had a great desire to be there. There was little probability that they would ever be appeased, but as good fortune would have it, the multitude was only made up of poor irresolute people, whose spirits were broken by the miseries of which they complained. All this Tempest past over in vain menaces, and some injuries against some considerable persons, but however it did not alter the State of Affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:52224:104"/>At this same time word was sent to the Nuncio, by an express Order from Court, that he should enjoy no other priviledges than what the Ambassador of <hi>Spain</hi> did at <hi>Rome.</hi> This was a new occasion of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to him; but the Action was general, and they took care to inform the other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Ministers, that for the future the would allow them only the same priviledges as their Princes allowed to the Ambassadors of his Catholick Majesty; so that he had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to complain since he was treated but like the rest. This resolution was taken upon this account. Six <hi>Alguazils de Corte</hi> passing before the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Alguazels</hi> returned them a sawcy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, whereupon the servants drew their Swords, but the <hi>Alguazels</hi> fired immediately upon them, and killed them upon the place. The Ambassador made great complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, they promised to give him full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, but to av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id the doing of it, they thought it more expedient to revoke all the Franchises.</p>
            <p>The King received a Letter from the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and was extreamly glad to hear that he had found out a way to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row three hundred thousand Crowns of the Merchants of <hi>Genoa</hi> for the raising four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men that were to be sent into the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanese:</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:52224:104"/>
But they were perswaded at Court that it would be a long time before they could be in a condition to get there, because they demanded a further supply of mony from <hi>Madrid,</hi> and here they wanted it, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for every thing. However this did not hinder them from using all imaginable efforts to contribute towards the raising of these four thousand men, because they were exceedingly alarmed at the Treaty of <hi>Casal,</hi> which they pretended our King had bought of the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> They apprehended, this was an open pass to render himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>Italy</hi> when he pleased, and they were fully perswaded that he had sent an Army thither upon this score.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Genoese</hi> first whispered and spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these jealousies, which at last reached the <hi>Venetians,</hi> so that they drew their Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers out of their Garrisons in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and bestowed them in their own Towns in <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> where they made some new Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Emperor for his part was as much alarmed as the rest of his Neighbours, for he sent his Troops to the <hi>Milanese</hi> to guard them, and several Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> put themselves to a great deal of trouble, out of an apprehension of a rupture. But if there was any reason to fear one, it was from the side of <hi>Bisca,</hi> where the people of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, who are under the dominion of <hi>Spain,</hi> have almost every day some disputes with those that live under the dominion of <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:52224:105"/>
sometimes about the fishing, at other times about other differences, each of them appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating the River <hi>de Bid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st, that they burnt several Barques, and took several of the <hi>French</hi> prisoners. Our Ambassador was ordered to demand justice for these injuries, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoke to the Ministers about it, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued deaf in these cases because they had no mind to redress them. They persisted to be so stiff and obstinate upon this occasion, that the Ambassador declared at last to Don <hi>Vincente Gonzaga,</hi> that his Master would order his Troops to march towards the Frontiers, by which mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mself so not only on this occasion. Upon this he made some particular reflections that were not very obliging to the new Secretary of State.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Pedro Fernandez del Campo,</hi> Marquess <hi>de Majorada,</hi> who had been formerly Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State, and to whom the Marquess <hi>de Valenzuela,</hi> when he became sole Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite had an aversion, because he would not blindly obey him, died of grief for the loss of his Place, and to see it still possessed by Don <hi>Ieronimo d' Eguya.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The number of the Maids of Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Queen, was about this time augmented. The King added to them the Daughter of the Princess <hi>Pio,</hi> those of the Countess <hi>de Villambrosa,</hi> the Marquess <hi>do Pouar</hi>; the Duke <hi>d' Hijar,</hi> Donna <hi>Eleonora</hi> of the House <hi>de Zapara,</hi> the Niece of the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> and Mademoiselle <hi>de Lalain,</hi> who was a Flemish woman. But altho this was a Testimony of the particular considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the King had for his Young Queen, because ordinarily the Queens of <hi>Spain</hi> have not so many, yet he could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52224:106"/>
Queen Mother. Nay it was even believed that the King would give him the Place of President of <hi>Castile,</hi> in case the President, who was then embroyled with the Nuncio, were turned out of his Place.</p>
            <p>The King and Queen had the pleasure of hearing Mass celebrated at the Jesuits College in the Chaldean language, by a Priest of the City of <hi>Muzal,</hi> which was heretofore called <hi>Ninive.</hi> After it was over, the Queen, who was always desirous of informing herself in matters of Curiosity, sent for him to come to her, and by the means of an Interpreter, she asked him several questions, and amongst the rest, whether the women were as severely lock'd up at <hi>Muzal,</hi> as they were at <hi>Madrid.</hi> This question, altho there was nothing cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in it, was so maliciously explained by the Dutchess <hi>de Terra nova,</hi> that the King was observed to look upon her with a great deal of Coldness for some days after. This did not hinder the Queen Mother from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to visit her, who assured her with all the Tenderness imaginable how sensibly she was concerned at these ill Offices that were done her. They went together to St. <hi>Marie la Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alle,</hi> where was celebrated the Beatification of <hi>Torribio Alphonso Mogrobejo,</hi> Second Archbishop of <hi>Lima</hi>: The Musick of the Chappel was there; their Majesties were informed at their return that the Great Arch Deacon of <hi>Madrid</hi> was dead. The Queen Mother seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be desirous of seeing this Dignity filled
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52224:106"/>
by one of her own Creatures, and the Young Queen proposed to send to Cardinal <hi>Porto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carero</hi> to demand it of him: But now it was too late, for the Cardinal to prevent all Sollicitations upon this point, made haste to gratify his Nephew Don <hi>Pedro Portocarero</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, whilst these small things happened, News was brought that a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of <hi>French</hi> men of War, commanded by the Marquess <hi>de Valbelle,</hi> was arrived before the Isle of <hi>Majorca,</hi> to demand of the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy some Merchantmen that had been taken by the Corsairs, since the peace, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Valbelle</hi> had in his hands an Order of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for their Restitution. The Viceroy would not restore these prizes, alledging <q>That the Persons who had taken them had already shared and divided them, and that they were not all of them <hi>Majorcans</hi>; that theEffects were all consumed and gone, and for his part he demanded Damages for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hostilities which these Corsairs had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</q> 
               <hi>Valbelle</hi> continued his instances, but seeing they had no Effect; he declared that he would not forget to make use of the Right of Reprisals; <q>That the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whenever he met them on the Sea, should find it to their cost; that the King his Master had reason to complain of the usage he found at their hands; That several Governors and Viceroys dependant upon the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had taken liberty to

commit all injustices against the French; that it was almost to no purpose to demand satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from those at <hi>Madrid,</hi> where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were filled with persons who had played the same Tricks, when they were in the like posts, and consequently durst not condemn and punish others for the very same crimes they had committed themselves; that he was assured this was the reason that occasioned this impunity and all their frivolous pretences: In a word, that he was going to take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther course with them, and do himself Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These Menaces, one would have thought, were sufficient to alarm those persons that were concerned in them; but they have this Maxim in <hi>Spain,</hi> that provided the danger is a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, they never fear it, whether this happens through insolence or temerity, and they rather chuse to suffer the disorders, that always fall out in military executions, than give themselves the trouble to do justice upon the complaints that are made.</p>
            <p>But before I finish the first part of my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs; I think it will not be altogether amiss to say something of the Councils of <hi>Spain,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the best information I have received concerning them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>This Council is the chief of all, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish it from the rest by a Title of Honour, the King calls it <hi>Our Council.</hi> It was established by St. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the third of that name, in the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52224:108"/>
year 1246. There are in this Council a President, Sixteen Counsellors, a Fiscal, Six Reporters, Six Secretaries, a Register, and a Keeper of the Registers, a Receiver of the Fines due to the Council, another of the Fines adjudged to particular persons, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, a Deputy, and a dozen Porters. The Council assembles every <hi>Friday</hi> in the Palace, towards Evening the King comes there. The Kings, Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Fourth, and Don <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonzo</hi> the last of that name, established this Custom. This Council is divided into four Chambers, where they distribute those Affairs that are under their Jurisdiction in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of them goes by the name of the Chamber of the fifteen hundred Pistoles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such a Sum is to be consigned before any man can get a review of a process which is pretended to be unjustly judged by the Parliaments of <hi>Vailladolid</hi> and <hi>Granada,</hi> which are the two Parliaments of <hi>Castile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the President of <hi>Castile,</hi> goes out of the Council, the Counsellors follow him to his Chair; he never makes any Visits, never gives the Right hand to any at his House; he is to give the King an account of the most important affairs, that pass in Council, where they name a Council every Week to report them.</p>
               <p>When the King comes there, they all unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themselves and kneel down. Afterwards they cover themselves and sit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:52224:109"/>When Audience is over, the King retires into his Cabinet with the President, who discourses him about business of the greatest moment for which the King gives his Orders, and this does not return any more to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the Counsellors to deliberate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1609. all <hi>Castile</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into five Districts, and every District is under a Counsellor of the Council Royal, who takes cognizance of the conduct of the Judges, the Lords, Ecclesiasticks, and other secular Persons. Besides this, there is a particular Council that is called the Council of the Chamber of <hi>Castile</hi>; the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident is the Chief, and the King names a certain number of Counsellors of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Royal whether they be three, or four that compose it. Here it is that they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch all Benefices in the King's Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Titles, and Patents for the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Places, Letters of Naturalization, and the Ratification of Orders to arrest the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Graces and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to which his Majesty is pleased to give his Consent.</p>
               <p>The King receives prodigious Sums of Money for the Places that are sold by the means of these Counsellors. He gives likewise the Patents and Commissions of several places of Justice, and 'tis commonly pretended that in the two <hi>Castiles,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Leon, Guypuscoa, Biscay,</hi> the Province <hi>de Hana,</hi> and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52224:109"/>
in <hi>Navarr</hi> there are above 72 thousand places of Judicature.</p>

               <head>Secretary of State, and of the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Dispatch.</head>
               <p>This Secretary is in a condition to serve or injure people, according as he stands affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to them, for all the Requests and Petitions, which they call Memorials here, and are presented to the King or Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, pass through his hands. 'Tis he who sends them to his Counsellors, who are to give their advice concerning them: After the consult is made (for this is their Phrase in <hi>Spain</hi>) these Petitions are sent back again to the Secretary of State, and when he reports them to the King, His Majesty orders what pleases him, and this is called a Decree.</p>
               <p>This Decree is expedited by persons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for that Office; so that when these Requests are carried to the King they say the Memorial is mounted; and when they are answered, they say the Memorial falls down; or else the Consult ascended and the Decree de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended.</p>
               <p>Without counting the Secretary of State, whom I have been speaking of, there are two more that enter the Council, one of them dispatches the Affairs of <hi>Arragon,</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52224:110"/>
                  <hi>Sicily,</hi> the other those of <hi>Castile</hi> and the <hi>North.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of these is named Don <hi>Manuel de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who was formerly Master of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and Envoy Extraordinary in <hi>Holland</hi>; he was made at his return Secretary of State. The other is called Don <hi>Pedro Colonna,</hi> he is descended of a good Family, and those of his House have always possest great places. They may give their advice in writing in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of consequence.</p>
               <p>The King sends the Decrees to them, and through their hands Affairs go to the Council of State: They make a Report of them there, and gather the voices; and give an account of all to his Majesty, who at last orders it as he thinks fit. They have power to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the Council out of the appointed days, when they judge it convenient, and when the King has a mind that they should have any extraordinary meeting, they send the Order immediately to all the Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</p>
               <p>Every Secretary of State has a Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary, who is called the Official Mayor, and exercises his Masters Office, when he happens to be absent. The Secretary of State for <hi>Italy</hi> has eight Commissaries reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that is the principal, the King pays them: And the Secretary of State for the <hi>North</hi> has seven under him; They chuse them themselves and the King gives his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: These dispatch all Patents, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

               <p>It assembles on <hi>Mundays, Wednesdays,</hi> and <hi>Fridays:</hi> As for what concerns the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, the King is always President of it, and the Counsellers are men of the Sword. They must be men of experience and service, the number of them is not fixed, and it depends upon the King's pleasure to augment or to diminish them. Their places are not regulated in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but they sit as they they come. It is indeed true, that when the Counsellors of State are called thither, they have the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end, but then they never come but at a time when a full Council of War is held. They have two Secretaries, who have each of them two Commissaries under them, one of these is for the Sea-affairs, and the others for those at Land.</p>
               <p>When they debate about matters of justice, an Assessor of the Council Royal, makes a report of them, who has likewise the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to give his opinion before the Dean of the Council: The King comes there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52224:111"/>
most every day. There are besides some other Chambers that depend upon this Council, such as those of the Flota's, the Gallies, and the Garrisons. The King nominates the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for these Chambers. The Councils are the same with those of the Council of War, and 'tis the Chief Minister or the President of <hi>Castile</hi> that presides there.</p>

This Tribunal is full as ancient as the Council Royal, whoever is judged to be a criminal by it can make no appeals but is executed immediately. For this reason it is named the <hi>Quinta Sala,</hi> that is to say, the fifth Hall. Here they determine both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Criminal Affairs, but when these Councils were established in <hi>Castile,</hi> the Judges thereof were reduced to four <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldes.</hi> They have been augmented since, and are nine at present, two Reporters and four Registers: Their Jurisdiction is divided into two parts, one, as I said before, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates only to Criminal Matters, the other is like that of ordinary Judges, and is to direct the management of Civil Affairs.</p>

Their chief business lies in the recovery and administration of the Finances, in the raising and augmenting of the Rents, Graces, Priviledges and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of the King.

At her return, she served Nine Poor Women at Dinner, and gave each of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52224:118"/>
them a Suit of Apparel, and five Pistols in their Purse: The Maids of Honour carried the Dishes; the Q. Mother performed the same Ceremony on her side. But what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely surprized the Q. was to find a Billet privately slipt into her Pocket, and thus Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscribed:</p>
            <q>
               <p>For the QUEEN Alone.</p>
            </q>
            <p>At first she was in doubt, whether she ought to open it or no; but presently after she had a mind to carry it to the King: Nevertheless the uncertainty of what was contained in it, and after what manner the K<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might take it, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her at last to open it. It seemed to be written in a disguised sort of an Hand, and contained these Words in <hi>Spanish:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Supreme Elevation of your Majesty, and the mighty difference that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> which your admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Qualities have infused into my Heart. I adore you, my Queen; I die in adoring you; and I dare say, that I am not unworthy, to adore you: I see you, I sigh after you; but you don't know my Sighs, you don't understand my secret Languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; nay, you don't turn your Charming Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. Ab, Madam, how unhappy am I to be born a Subject, who find my self possessed with the Inclinations of the greatest K. in the Universe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen continued some time surprized and astonished: She could not imagine who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52224:118"/>
this Rash Person was, that had the hardiness to write to her in these Terms; and did not question, but that the Billet was slipt into her Pocket by one of the Poor Women whom she had served. But then it appear'd very strange, that a Man, who seem'd to be of great Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would trust his Life (for nothing less was hazarded) into the Hands of a poor needy Creature; for such she must be that could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Q. that day. It was true indeed, that she had been amongst the Religious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Incarnation</hi>; but altho' some of them might undertake this business, yet there was little probability to believe it, by reason of the Consequences that would have proved fatal to the Party concerned, if ever the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came to be discovered. Sometimes she thought, that perhaps it might be a Trick of the <hi>Camarera Mayor,</hi> to see what use she made of this Billet, and then to acquaint the King with it, and turn the most Innocent thing in the world into a wrong sense. After these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Reflections, at last she judged it would be the safest way to discover the Matter to the Q. Mother, and follow her Advice. She went the next day to dine with her, and afterwards shew'd her the Letter, beseeching her to keep it: That if the K. came to know any thing of the matter, she would be so kind as to testifie the whole Truth. The Q. Mother seeing that she was discomposed at it, assured her, that it was not worth the while to torment her self about it; and from whatever Hands the Letter came, if the King was disquieted at it,

               </gap>t her more at ease than she was before, by reason of this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance. On this day the Q. arrived to her Eighteenth Year: She received the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all the Lords, and the Ladies made her Presents, particularly the Q.

            <p>It was much about this time that the Envoy of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> parted from <hi>Madrid,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, and loudly th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eatning them with his Master's Resentments. He came to receive several considerable Sums, which the Elector had sent to the K. of <hi>Spain.</hi> They had amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him a long time with many tedious delays, but at last gave him an Assignation to receive fifty thousand Crowns of the Silver that was daily expected from the <hi>Indies.</hi> When the <hi>Flota</hi> was arrived, he went to <hi>Sevil,</hi> but his Journey had no success, because they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the President of the <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Contration</hi> at <hi>Sevil,</hi> to give him nothing. He came back to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> with all the Fury imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to find himself treated with so little Respect: He renewed his Importunities; and they for their part renewed their Promises: At last he was so wearied with these continual Delays, whereby they still put him off, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a positive Answer, and yet tarried longer than he had resolved. But his Master
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52224:119"/>
being informed of the whole Proceedings, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to take his Audience of Leave. The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> would fain have stopt him, promising to pay down fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns in four Months: And perhaps the Envoy had stay'd in expectation of them, if he had not been otherwise ordered, altho' there was little probability, that he would have received satisfaction at the time appointed; and so he refused this Proposal. Then they offered him thirty thousand Crowns in hand. He was upon the point of accepting them, when he was given to understand, that this would be paid him no better than the rest. This put him into a great Passion, which made him speak so fiercely and freely to the Ministers, that he did not spare them at all. He shew'd several Persons a Letter from the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> which was full of Menaces, for the rude Treatment of his Envoy. The Night before he parted, they sent him a Golden Chain worth a hundred and fifty Pistols; but he returned it immediately back again to the Person who brought it to him from the King: The next day the same Chain was brought to him the second time; but he sent it back to the Chief Minister, and told him, He would rather say, he had lost it upon the Road, than accept of a Present that was so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Elector his Master.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Count <hi>de Gubernatis,</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy from <hi>Savoy,</hi> seeing that all his Solicitations and Instances for four years last past, hadnot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced his Negotiation, in the least; and that all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52224:120"/>
the hopes they gave him of granting the same Honours to the Ministers of the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> as they received in <hi>France,</hi> were only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Illusions to amuse him, without ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to perform them; he departed from <hi>Madrid</hi> in a great Fury, which was so much the greater, because they refused to satisfie his Demands, in the payment of those Subsidies that were due to his Master. Some of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Envoys departed also with no less discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; and as for those that stay'd behind, they complained in their turns, of the Ill Usage they had received. But Forreigners were not the only Persons that were disgusted the Subjects of the K. of <hi>Spain</hi> were little better used; and the Count <hi>de Balbo,</hi> with several <hi>Milanese</hi> Officers, returned to <hi>Italy,</hi> without being able to obtain what was due to them, or get the Recompence they demanded. It is indeed certain, that the King had no Funds, that the price of Victuals was not in the least diminished, that many poor: Artisans and Day-labourers died of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that those men who were supposed to be rich, had Billets often sent to them to send their Money to such and such places, with great Menaces to Assassinate them, in case they failed.</p>
            <p>Another Affair happened, upon which the Court had their Eyes fixt for a long time, and several Persons of the highest Quality found themselves Interested in it, by the means of the Prince <hi>d' Stillano,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey.</hi> The first of these possess'd the place of President of the Council of <hi>Flanders</hi> at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi>;

it was taken from him by <hi>Don Iuan</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> and conferr'd upon the Count de <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terey,</hi> who had never taken possession of it. The pretence they used to set by the Prince <hi>de Stillan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> was a quarrel raised for the purpose. He had been banished, but was afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed under hand, that he might, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, come back to <hi>Madrid:</hi> so he fell into the Snare, and returned. The K. and <hi>Don Iuan</hi> seemed to be very angry with him, because he presumed to come back, contrary to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Order; and therefore to punish him, they bestow'd his place upon the Count <hi>de Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi> who at that time commanded the Army in <hi>Catalonia</hi>; and after this usage were so far from revoking his Sentence, that they banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to his old place.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st thing the Count did after he had been summoned to the Court, was to demand the Oath of his Office, and the K. promised to chuse a convenient Opportuni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>carero</hi>'s Palace, to examine the Reasons of one side and t'other: The Cardinal presided in it, and was assisted by the King's and Queen Mother's Confessors, by <hi>Don Benedetto,</hi> and by <hi>Don Pedro Gil del Faro:</hi> They gave the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52224:121"/>
Prince <hi>de Stillano</hi> to understand, that since his Majesty had disposed of his Place in favour of the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> he had nothing left him to do, but only to submit. To this the Prince answer'd, That by an ancient Law of <hi>Castile,</hi> the King could not take away his Place, without commencing a Process against him. Upon this the <hi>Iuncto</hi> broke up, but at their second Meeting concluded, That it was in the King's Power to dispose of this Office, who having a great Inclination to the Count, had decided it in his advantage. Whilst the Prince <hi>de Stillano</hi> continued thus outed, the Queen-Mother was sensibly concerned at the Injustice that was done to one of her princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Servants; and she was perswaded, as well as the rest of her Family, that they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him with nothing but his faithful adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to that Princess. He still persisted in his Demands to have his Tryal come on; That since they had taken away his Place from him, as from a Criminal, they ought to treat him as one, and punish him according to his Faults. All the Queen-Mother's Faction joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the same Complaints; but that did not hinder the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> from continuing still in his Place. It is true, that considering him Personally, he was more deserving than the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He is a well made agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Person, of great Abilities; and we ought to reckon amongst his other good Qualities,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52224:121"/>
his Alliance with the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi;</hi> and this was no small consideration, at a time when the Duke did whatever he pleased at Court: For Example, he nominated his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Vice Roy of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which is a Post where they get a prodigious Wealth in a short time.</p>
            <p>The President of the Council of <hi>Castile,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived about this time a <hi>Breve</hi> from the Pope, whereby he was enjoyn'd to repair immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to <hi>Rome,</hi> to give an account of his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards the <hi>Nuncio;</hi> but they were of Opinion here, that he was not obliged to obey it. It was known at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that the Visitor General of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> had sent word to the Duke <hi>de Saint-Angelo,</hi> Dean of the Collateral Council, to depart out of <hi>Naples</hi> within three days, and to retire sixty Miles off. He obey'd this Injunction, after having taken his Leave of the Vice-Roy, and the most considerable Persons of the City; and afterwards went to <hi>Gaette</hi> with his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The Vice-Roy, who appeared in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of him, was very glad that the City of <hi>Naples</hi> had Writ to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> about him, with a great deal of Zeal and Affection. The Visitor General enraged at the Course they had taken, sent Orders immediately to the Duke <hi>de Monte Sardo,</hi> his Son in Law, to the Duke <hi>della Regina,</hi> his Nephew, and to all his other Relations, to be gone within an hour. The Duke <hi>Della Regina</hi> being a Magistrate of the City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pretended, that he could not be hindered from staying in it. He sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52224:122"/>
his Friends together, and after he had represented to them the Injury that was done to himself in particular, he declared to them, that the Visitor had a design to attack them too in general, as appeared by his severe examining the Conduct of the Princes and Barons of that Kingdom, although by their Priviledges they were exempted from it. 'Twas resolved in this Assembly, to meet again the next day; and accordingly a great number of people came there. In short, there came more than sixty, who elected out of themselves the Prince <hi>Dotojano,</hi> of the House <hi>de Medici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> the Prince <hi>de la Torella,</hi> of the House of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raccioli,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Matalone,</hi> of the House <hi>de Caraffa:</hi> They went to find out the Vice-Roy, who voluntarily engaged to speak to the Visitor General; but he coldly told him, That he executed the Orders he had received from <hi>Spain.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lords were extreamly dissatisfied, and several of them wished, that they had some Chief or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to head them, who was capable of a great Resolution.</p>
            <p>For the better understanding of these <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,</hi> I ought to acquaint the Reader, That the Ambassadors, and even the Envoys, had a certain Right at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which exempted them from paying any Toll at the City Gates, for those things that were nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sary for their Families. This Custom had been observed time out of mind; but it being discovered, that some persons had extended this Priviledge
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52224:122"/>
farther than it ought to be, and that hereby the King suffered exceedingly in his Dues; the Council judged it expedient to convert it into a Sum of Money, which was in effect paid to the Forreign Ministers, and the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quezas</hi> (for so they call this Right) were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. There was likewise another Priviledge, which is called <hi>Immunidad del Barrio;</hi> that is to say, the Ambassadors have a certain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct markt out about their Houses, in which compass Justice is not to be performed without their permission, and the <hi>Alcaldes</hi> dare not pass in the Ambassador's Quarter with their White Rods, which is the Badge of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Every Ambassador is so jealous to preserve this Priviledge, that some Forreign Ministers have been so hardy as to hang the <hi>Alguazils</hi> at their Gates, when they found them trespassing in this point. I must confess very few of them have carried things to this extremity, but several have ordered them to receive an hundred blows with a cudgel.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the apparent Risque they ran, and the Consequences that such Infracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might carry, the <hi>Corrigidor,</hi> accompanied with his Officers, passed at mid-day through the Quarter belonging to our Ambassador: They carried with them their White Rods; but he not being informed of it till they were quite gone, could only send to the <hi>Corrigidor</hi> to tell him, that he was extreamly surprized at his procedure, and that for the time to come, he should remember his Duty better. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, That he was ignorant, till he was now
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52224:123"/>
better informed, that the Ambassador's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extended so far as the place through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he had passed; and that it was sufficient he knew it now. But notwithstanding this sort of satisfaction, the very same <hi>Corrigidor</hi> a few days after came by that way again, and pass'd before the Ambassador's House at a time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hen he was abroad. The Marquiss <hi>de Villars</hi> being informed of it, complained loudly of this Insolence.</p>
            <p>He expected with Impatience what would be the Result of the matter, when an Order from the King came to him, wherein his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty revoked the Priviledges of his Quarter, pretending it was not just, that the Ambassador of <hi>France</hi> should be more favourably treated at <hi>Madrid,</hi> than the Ambassador of <hi>Spain</hi> was at <hi>Paris.</hi> It was said at Court, that in that great City the Officers of Justice went when they pleased up to the very Gates of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Ambassador, to perform the Functions of their respective Offices: That in the Year 1671. there was issued out a Declaration of the same Nature with this; that the renewing of it was no Novelty, and that since the first Declaration the Ambassadors had only enjoy'd this Priviledge by Sufferance, but that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they were resolved to connive at it no more.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Villars</hi> answer'd, <hi>That he owed too great a respect to the King, ever to remove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from it: That he was assured the King his Master would approve of the Proposal to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52224:123"/>
that Minister has at the Court of</hi> France: <hi>That it was not necessary there to demand Audience and Permission, which always retard Affairs, in order to speak to the King and Queen, to see them, and accompany them; that he went a hunting with the King; that he assisted at Feasts, and other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as often as he pleased; that he was allow'd to have Six Horses to his Coach, and so to drive all about</hi> Paris: <hi>That the Ambassador's Lady went in the Queen's Coach; that she sometimes Dined with her, and that she received several Marks of Distinction, all which served to make an Embassy pass very agreeable: That it ought to be considered, that he did not enjoy all these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages at</hi> Madrid: <hi>And lastly, That he would take care to acquaint his Master with the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Christian Majesty: That he could not have an Answer immediately, by reason of the great distance; and that it was but reasonable and just, that things should continue in the Old State, till it arrived.</hi> But the King of <hi>Spain</hi> issu'd out a Second Declaration, wherein it was said, That his Majesty persisted in his first Resolution, and that he thought fit to take away the Immunities of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador's Quarter, without assigning any Cause.</p>
            <p>'Tis indeed very surprising, that Monsieur <hi>de Villars,</hi> who had reason to promise himself very advantageous. Distinctions upon the Queen's account, should be the only man, who was singled out from the rest of the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, to have his Franchises taken away from him, whilst the others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>njoy'd theirs as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. He did not fail to send Advice to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52224:124"/>
Court of <hi>France</hi> of what had happened; the King was sensibly concerned at his Ill Usage, and promised to see Justice done to him. But <hi>Monsieur</hi> desiring, that things might not be carried to Extremities, neither on one side nor the other, writ a Letter to the Queen his Daughter, wherein he signified to her his great Trouble and Inquietude about this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. He conjured her to use all her Interest with the King her Husband, to engage him to do his most Christian Majesty Justice. She was kept ignorant till this very moment, of what had passed, and was no less surprized than afflicted at it. She took occasion to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course the King about it at a favourable Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, as she imagined; but he answer'd her coldly enough, That it was a long time a-go since this Affair had been regulated, and that he would dispense with himself for telling her the Reasons. She earnestly importuned him to acquaint her with them; and after infinite Sollcitations, he could only be brought to reply as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Esque me quiteram este Embaxador, y me em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaram otro Gavacho.</hi> Which signifies in our Language; <hi>Let them take away this Ambassador from me, and send me another in his room.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is easie to judge, that the King speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in those Terms, was not only prejudiced against the Marquess <hi>de Villars,</hi> but also against any other that might be sent to him. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Intreaties the Queen made to oblige him to settle matters in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e Estate they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, yet he continued still inflexible, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52224:124"/>
seem'd indeed to act in this Affair rather by another Spirit than his own, without making any Reflection, either he or his Council, that <hi>France</hi> would resent the Injury. But they awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of their Lethargy, when they saw an Extraordinary Courier arrive on the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> to the Marquess <hi>de Villars</hi>'s House. They had terrible apprehensions upon them, that he brought a Declaration of War along with him; and the Suspicions they had entertain'd a long time from the side of <hi>Italy,</hi> sensibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd them. Our Ambassador had Audience of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> to demand the Re establishment of his Franchises, and the Jurisdiction of his Quarter. <hi>He represented to him the hardship of his Usage, and the little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they had to treat him after this manner, and to chose him from amongst the rest to be affronted: That the King his Master was never the Aggressor, but that he would not tamely suffer an Injury, without revenging it: That particularly he was sensible of this, and demanded publick satisfaction for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke alledged, as he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>That ever since the Year</hi> 1671. <hi>the King of</hi> Spain <hi>was resolved not to grant the Franchises to the Ambassadors any longer, but that the Relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which time causes in every thing, was the reason that the Forreign Ministers by little and little reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their former Rights; That this was no good Consequence, why it should take place of the Law, and for a Testimony that they had no intention to disgust him in this particular, he might rest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that for the time to come, all the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52224:125"/>
other Ambassadors should be treated after the same manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Marquess <hi>de Villars</hi> made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>That instead of finding any particular Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for himself, he met with a new Subject of Complaint, upon the score of this General Conduct; That since the new Alliance that was contracted between the Two Crowns, the Natural Right war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted him to expect that the Ambassadors of one would easily merit-Favours of the other, and even procure them for their Friends; that he was so far from meeting that Usage, that he could get nothing for them but affronts; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he demanded: That as for the Declaration of</hi> 1671. <hi>he was not obliged to take the least notice of it, since having been Ambassador at</hi> Madrid, <hi>near four years a-go, he peaceably enjoy'd all those Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which now they designed to retrench him of, under the pretence of that Declaration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was not content with discoursing the Chief Minister about this Affair, but deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Audience of the King, and immediately obtained it. So he presented to him his Letters of Credence, to have this Affair regulated, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid every thing that was necessary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him to make necessary Reflections upon a thing that might draw after it such evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences. <hi>He reminded him of the Peace that was so lately sworn, and of the Marriage he had contracted with a Princess of the Blood of</hi> France, <hi>and told him what little occasion he had to disgust the most Christian King; That in truth, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster believed he did not act by his own Inclinations,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52224:125"/>
and that upon this Consideration he was disposed to receive the Satisfaction he had so much reason to promise himself on his part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> only answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <note place="margin">
                  <hi>We will see.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Veremos,</hi> according to his usual Custom.</p>
            <p>After this, it was deliberated in Council, what was necessary to be done in the business: The Council gave their Advice to the Chief Minister, and he to the King, as is the way in <hi>Spain.</hi> At last a Resolution was taken up, that the Marquess <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> who had been named to go Commissary to the Ambassador in <hi>France,</hi> should give him Satisfaction. In pursuance to this Order, he went to the Palace of the Marquess <hi>de Villars,</hi> and presented to him a Paper that was signed, wherein was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in terms full of Amity and Respect, <hi>That the King of</hi> Spain <hi>had given necessary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to his Ambassador, to give that Answer and Satisfaction to his most Christian Majesty, which he had demanded in his Letter; and that he came to assure him, That the King his Master had so great a regard to all the Motives of Friendship that united their Majesties, that he would still continue the Ambassador of</hi> France <hi>in all the Priviledges and Immunities of his Quarter; and that he should likewise have the Right of the Franchises paid to him; That if he had them not till this present, it was only occasioned by his own neglect to demand them; and that the King had never any designs to take them away from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a thing seldom practised in other Courts to begin Actions of this Nature, unless they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52224:126"/>
have had an important occasion to do it, and afterwards to abandon them with an Easiness, which may in some measure be attributed to their great Weakness; but there are some places where this Conduct is more in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest than others, and the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> is one of them. Some persons were even perswaded, that this design of taking away the Ambassador's Priviledges, was executed by the Ministers, only out of a Principle of Revenge, because our King had sent word to the Duke <hi>de Giovenazzo,</hi> that he was willing to give him at his Court all the Advantages that belonged to the Character of the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherewith he was invested; but that he had no Intention to leave him those Liberties which he allowed to others. And he had a particular Reason to observe this Conduct with him; for it is very well known, that when he was in the Quality of Envoy at the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he had busied himself, without any provocation, to put them upon the Design of burning the Vessels of <hi>Toulon,</hi> and the Magazines of <hi>Pignerol:</hi> So that the King having very just Reasons to look upon him as a particular Enemy, it was Natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to deny him those Favours that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to those Persons for whom we have an Esteem. However it was, if the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> was at the bottom mortified at this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they took care not to make it appear; and to take away from our King an Ambassador who was by no means agreeable to him, they immediately named the Marquess <hi>de la Fuente</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52224:126"/>
to go and supply his Place. The Queen was extremely satisfied to see the business of the Franchises terminate as she desired.</p>
            <p>The King, who loved her tenderly, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all those secret Enemies that did her ill Services with him, knowing that one of her greatest Diversions was to ride a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ordered Three fine Horses to be brought to her from <hi>Andalusia.</hi> She chose one of the most mettlesome, and mounted him; but she was no sooner got upon his back, but he began to caper, and was very like to have thrown himself backwards upon her, when she fell: One of her Feet unluckily happened to hang in the Stirrup, and the Horse finding this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barras, ran about very furiously, and dragged the poor Queen after him, to the extream pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of her Life. This Accident happen'd in the Court of the Palace. The King beholding her from a Balcony, was brought to the last Despair; And though the Court was full of Persons of Quality, and the Guards, yet no one durst offer to go and help the Queen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not lawful for any body to touch her, and especially by the Feet, unless it be the Chief of her <hi>Menins,</hi> or Pages, who puts on her Chiopins: These are a sort of Sandals, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the Ladies put their Shooes, and make them appear very tall. The Queen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways supports her self upon one of her <hi>Menins,</hi> when she walks any where; but these were Children too small to rescue her from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wherein she was. At last, Two <hi>Spanish</hi> Knights, one of whom was named <hi>Don Louis
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52224:127"/>
de las Torres,</hi> and the other <hi>Don Iaime de Soto-Mayor,</hi> resolved, whatever might happen, to deliver her: So one of them caught hold of the Horse by the Bridle, and stopt him; the other took hold immediately of the Queen's Foot, took it out of the Stirrup, and put one of his fingers out of Joynt in doing her this piece of Service: But without tarrying a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, away they went to their Houses, and presently ordered their Horses to be sadled, to escape the King's Indignation. The Young Count <hi>de Pennaranda,</hi> who was a Friend to both of them, approached the Queen, and told her very respectfully, That those Gentlemen who had been so happy as to save her Life, were yet in fear of losing their own. She had the Goodness to speak to the King in their favour, because, as I mentioned before, no body was permitted to touch her, and particularly by the Feet. The King, who came down imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, to see in what a condition she was, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified an extraordinary Joy to find she was not hurt, and very kindly received the Request she made in behalf of these Generous Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. Word was immediately sent to them, who by this time were got on Horse-back to save themselves: The Queen honoured them with a Present, and ever after had a particular Consideration for them.</p>
            <p>A few days after this Accident had befallen the Young Queen, she received a small disgust from the King upon this occasion: She had a very pretty Spaniel with her, and the little Creature used to lie with her a Nights. The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52224:127"/>
Queen happening to miss her one Night, got out of her Bed, and groped up and down the Room for her; the King too finding the Queen was not in Bed, got up likewise to find her. Behold them now in the midst of a great Chamber, without any Light, going on one side and t'other, and rubbing their Shins against every thing they met; At last, the King being impatient, asked the Queen, Why she got up? the Queen answered him, To search for her Spaniel: <hi>And is it worth the while,</hi> said he, <hi>for a King and Queen of</hi> Spain <hi>to rise out of their Beds, to find a little pitiful Bitch?</hi> Being thus vexed, he spurned the poor creature with his Foot, as she came against his Legs, and was like to kill it. At the Crys she made, the Queen, who loved the Bitch, could not forbear to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in a sweet manner, and came to bed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain very sorrowful; but neither the King nor she were able to find it again; and they were forced to call up the Queen's Women to bring them a Light. The next Morning the King went out very early a hunting all alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out saying a word to the Queen. This dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted her all day long, and she past the greatest part of it leaning upon the Windows of her Chamber, although the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> frequently disturbed her, and told her, <hi>That a Queen of</hi> Spain <hi>ought not to look out at a Window.</hi> All that day she impatiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the King's return, and as soon as ever he lighted from his Horse, met him about half the Stair-Case, and threw her self about his Neck, with that agreeable <hi>French</hi> Liberty,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52224:128"/>
which she had not yet forgotten: He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly charmed at it, and could not forbear to embrace her often, altho it is not the Custom in that Country, where their way of saluting the Ladies, is to press their Arms with their Hands. He was in so good a humour, that she obtained leave for the Duke <hi>de Ossone,</hi> to come back to Court, and execute his Place of Great Master of the Horse.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iuncta,</hi> that was erected to determine the Affair between the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and <hi>Don Iuan de la Puente y Guebarra,</hi> President of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Castile,</hi> decided it on the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> He was sentenced to be banished, and turned out of his Office. The <hi>Nuncio</hi> demanded of them, that they would oblige him to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to take off the Suspension he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred; but they thought they had punished him sufficiently. Abundance of people said, That these great Names he took upon him, did not belong to him; and that his true Name was <hi>Don Iuan de Montesillo,</hi> and that he was barely a Gentleman of the Province of <hi>Castile.</hi> He finished the Course of his Studies at <hi>Salamania,</hi> and afterwards was made Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of <hi>Toledo.</hi> His Behaviour mightily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who was at that time Cardinal of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and taking a delight in his Conversation, trusted him with the Management of all his Affairs. He acquitted himself so well in this Station, that the Archbishop took care to recommend, and make him known to <hi>Don Iuan</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> whom he extreamly pleased by the Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52224:128"/>
of his Carriage, and the Vivacity of his <hi>Genius</hi>; And whether that Prince had any particular Designs upon him, or only intended to prefer him, to acquit himself of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise he had made to the Cardinal, he made him President of the Chancery of <hi>Valladolid.</hi> Some time after the Count <hi>de Villambrosa,</hi> who was President of <hi>Castile,</hi> happening to die, the Prince gave his Place to <hi>Don Iuan de la Puente.</hi> To say the truth, he only executed that Office by a Commission; but it was a very great Post, and could not fail to draw the Envy of several Persons upon him: And so it really did; for few people were concerned at his Misfortunes: They looked upon him as one of the Creatures of <hi>Don Iuan;</hi> and those that were always looking out for an Object for their Hatred, when that Prince was gone, vented all their Spleen and Indignation upon him. The people accused him of all their Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and pretended, that he was the Cause of crying down the Money; That being in a Place which rendered Chief of Justice and the Civil Government, he might, if he had been so minded, have found out some way or other to relieve so many different Persons, that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered according to their Condition. But the Complaints of private Men, nay, even those of the Publick in general, could not have been able to hurt him, if there had not been a necessity at that Juncture, to oblige the Pope, by reason of the Apprehensions they had of the Designs of the most Christian King upon <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52224:129"/>Although the Office of the President of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile</hi> is the next in Dignity to that of the Chief Minister, yet all People have not an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to possess it. <hi>Don Iuan Ascensio,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Avila,</hi> whom the King nominated to it, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it: An Order was sent to him, to come immediately, but he desired the Duke <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Celi</hi> to excuse him, and leave him in his Diocess. He had formerly been a Religious of the <hi>Mercy,</hi> and General of his Order: However, as it is a hard matter to resist the Will of one's Prince, especially when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be so advantageous as this was, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd the Second Order that was sent him, and came without any delay. He was a Person of great Discretion; and 'tis certain a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have too much to qualifie him for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of so considerable a Place: for the Council of <hi>Castile</hi> regulates all the Affairs that respect the Government of the States of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile:</hi> it was first created in the Year 1245. by St. <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of <hi>Castile</hi>; it is composed of a President and sixteen Counsellors; The President never makes any Visits, and at his House gives the Right Hand to no body. They summon to this Council the Chanceries of <hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> and the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature of <hi>Sevil</hi> and <hi>Gallicia,</hi> which are the Four Seats of Justice, where they determine, by way of Appeal, all the Suits that are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Corrigidors</hi> in the Cities, and by the <hi>Alcades</hi> in the Villages: When the King speaks of the Council of <hi>Castile,</hi> he barely calls it <hi>Our Council.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52224:129"/>The Court was exceedingly troubled at the Advices they received, That the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> having with no small pains, heaped together the Sum of two hundred thousand Crowns, part of which he had borrowed to send to <hi>Piombino, Portolongone, Orbitelle,</hi> and some other places which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> possesses on the Coasts of <hi>Tuscany;</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney being embarked in a <hi>Felouque,</hi> Eight Slaves found the opportunity to carry off the Vessel: Two small Vessels and a Gally were sent after them to bring them back, but they were gone too far to be recovered: So all the pains of the Marquess <hi>de Los-Velez,</hi> tended only to set Eight Slaves at liberty, and enrich them for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their Lives.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador of <hi>Venice</hi> seeing that he of <hi>France</hi> received Satisfaction upon the occasion of the Franchises and Immunities, redoubled his Instances to have Justice done him upon the <hi>Alguazils,</hi> who had killed two of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants. He received Satisfaction on the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> The <hi>Alcalde</hi> who led them on was banished, and the <hi>Alguazils</hi> were sent to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and were not enlarged but by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty.</p>
            <p>If the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> was sensibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Joy, to be preferr'd to the Prince <hi>de Astillano,</hi> as to the Presidentship of <hi>Flanders,</hi> he was not a little disgusted to see several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons made Counsellors of State before him; and notwithstanding he earnestly desired to be one of the number, he was disappointed. The King named the Duke <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> General
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52224:130"/>
at Sea, the Count <hi>Doropesa,</hi> who was very Young, and had no other Dignity as yet, the Marquess <hi>de Los Velez</hi> Governour of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermosa</hi> Governour of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Don Melchior Navarra,</hi> who had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>de Mansera Mayor, Domo Major</hi> to the Q. Mother, and the Inquisitor General, to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Council. It was commonly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Q. Mother had a great influence in naming most of these Lords. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State was instituted by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth in 1526. Here it is that they examine the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Services of those Persons that pretend to be made Vice-Roys, or to possess any other great Employments: They regulate the most important Affairs of the Monarchy; the King only is the President of it, and the number of the Counsellors is not fixed.</p>
            <p>Most People were surprized, that <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los Ramirez de Arrellano,</hi> was made President of the <hi>Finances,</hi> on the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> after he had been so long chained and shut up for his Lunacy and Madness: He was chosen in the room of <hi>Don Antonio de Monsalve.</hi> No body could imagine for what Reason the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> thought fit to trust him with a Post of that Consequence; for he had none of those Qualities that are necessary to make a Man capable of discharging it well; nay, he had some that ought to have excluded him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, he was Son-in-Law to a <hi>Corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidor,</hi> named <hi>Don Francisco de Herrera,</hi> who was mortally hated by the People; and 'tis
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52224:130"/>
said, not without just Grounds, since he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little to the extream Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series under which they groaned. The Council of <hi>Finances,</hi> which is there called <hi>de Hazienda,</hi> was established in the Year 1602. by <hi>Philip</hi> III. It is their business to inspect the Tribunal, which is called the <hi>Contaduria May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> and was set up by <hi>Philip</hi> the Second in 1574.</p>
            <p>A certain Accident happened at Court, which I cannot forbear to relate, although it is of little Consequence. The Queen had two of the prettiest Parrots in the World, which she had brought along with her from <hi>France,</hi> and loved mightily: The Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> thought to do a meritorious work in kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, because they could only talk <hi>French,</hi> One day when the Queen was gone out to take a Walk, and the Dutchess, to avoid going with her, and to put this Design in Execution, had pretended a slight Indisposition; she demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Parrots of the Woman that looked after them, and so without any more a-do, as soon as ever she had got them into her Hands, wrung off their Necks, in spight of all the Prayers and Intreaties that were used to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her from killing them. This was a great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to the poor <hi>French</hi> Women that waited upon the Queen, who when she came back to her Apartment, commanded them to bring her Parrots and Dogs, as her custom was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when the King was not there: for he could not endure any of these little creatures, because they came from <hi>France;</hi> and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52224:131"/>
he saw them, he cry'd, <hi>Fuera, fuera, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros Frances</hi>; that is to say, <hi>Out, out, you</hi> French <hi>Dogs.</hi> All the Queen's Women, instead of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fetch what she demanded, stared upon one another, and continued for some time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, without daring to speak a word; but at last, after a long silence, one of them gave her an account of the Execution which the <hi>Camarera</hi> had made of them. She was extreamly concerned, although she took care not to discover it; but as soon as the Dutchess entred the Room, and according to her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, came to kiss her Hand: The Queen, without speaking a Syllable to her, gave her two Boxes on the Ear with her Hand. Never was any thing in the World in such a Rage and Surprize as the Dutchess was; for she was one of the most haughty imperious Women living, and carried as much State and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur: She possessed, as I mentioned before, a Kingdom in <hi>Mexico,</hi> and now to be buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a young Queen, whom she had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to treated like a Child; this appeared insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable; she immediately flew out of the Room, saying all the impertinent things that her Anger suggested to her, and assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether her Relations and Friends, and above four hundred Ladies: With this numerous Train of Coaches, she came to the King's Apartment, to demand Justice of him for the Affront she pretended she had received from the Queen: She made so great a Clamour, and shed so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tears, that he sent for the Queen to come to him: And as he represented to her the high
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52224:131"/>
Rank which the <hi>Camarera Mayor</hi> held in the World, the Queen interrupted him, and told him, without any hesitation, <hi>Senor, esto es une antojo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These few unexpected Words clearly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Face of Affairs; The King embraced her with a thousand Testimonies of Joy, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That she had done very well; and that if Two Blows were not enough to satisfie her, he consented she should give the Dutchess Two Dozen more. Now <hi>antojo</hi> signifies in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Tongue, <hi>the Longing of a Woman with Child:</hi> And they are it seems convinced by long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, That if Women with Child in that Country have not what they desire, and don't do what they have a mind to do, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered before their time of a dead Infant. The King, who believed the Queen was with Child, was ravished with Joy; and though he had a mighty kindness for the Dutchess, yet he exceedingly approved of the Queen's Action: So that all the Satisfaction she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him was this, <hi>Cailla os, est as bofetadas son bii as del antojo;</hi> That is to say, <hi>Hold your peace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Marquess <hi>de Villa Menrique</hi> obtain'd the Vice-Royship of <hi>Peru,</hi> which is one of the most considerable Posts, by the means of a pretty La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52224:132"/>
of whom the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly enamoured.</p>
            <p>The King, the Queen, and the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, went together to <hi>Buen-Retiro</hi> to pass the Holy Week there. After <hi>Easter</hi> was over, the King expressed a great desire to go to <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> as it had always been the custom: But the Queen-Mother, who had no Inclinations to be at any great distance from <hi>Madrid,</hi> because all Affairs were managed there, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors never stir out of it; and likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Neighbourhood of <hi>Toledo,</hi> where she had been formerly confined against her Will, revived a sort of Horror in her, raised so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obstacles, that the King alter'd his Mind: So he stay'd but a very inconsiderable time at <hi>Buen-Retiro,</hi> and passed four days at the <hi>Escuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi> He would only suffer himself to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Horse, one of the Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber, and the <hi>Major domo.</hi> The next day after he was arrived, the Queen wrote a very tender Letter to him, and sent him a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond Ring. He sent her, by way of r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>turn, a Chaplet made of the Wood of <hi>Calambour,</hi> garnished with Diamonds, in a little Box of Gold Filagreen, wherein he inclosed a Billet that had only these Words, <hi>Madam, there has been a great Wind; I have killed six Wolves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As soon as he returned to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the desire of going to <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> seized him again. By a custom that had been established ever since the time of <hi>Philip</hi> II. the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> were used to go to this Noble House some time after
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52224:132"/>
               <hi>Easter.</hi> This is appointed in the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> of the Palace, which is a Rule they always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: In it are to be found all the Ceremonies that are to be observed, the Habits which the Kings and Queens are to wear, the Time of their going to their Royal Houses, how long they are to continue there; the Days of going to Chappel, as also those for Bull Feasts, and running at the Ring, the Hour of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties going to Bed, and Rising, and a thousand other things of the same Nature. But, as it happen'd, there was so great a scarcity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that the King was obliged to stay at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid:</hi> However, to excuse and colour so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a thing, they gave out, that the Small Pox was at <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> which being sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated upon the Road to <hi>Malaga,</hi> where the Plague raged, and from whence it might easily be spread thither, his Majesty was not willing to hazard himself so far as to venture thither.</p>
            <p>The Court was troubled at the Advices they received on the first of <hi>May,</hi> That the Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Fontarabia</hi> and those of <hi>Andaye,</hi> had been lately engaged in a Quarrel about the Fishery of the River <hi>Bidassoa,</hi> which separates the two Kingdoms. They fought, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men were killed on both sides; but what concerned them the most, was, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> instead of sending to part them, play'd the Cannon upon the <hi>French,</hi> and demolished some Houses in <hi>Andaye:</hi> So that to prevent the Consequences, which might perhaps have proved very dangerous, they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52224:133"/>
commanded him to repair the Houses that were battered, and give the <hi>French</hi> Fishermen all the Satisfaction they desired. Our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador assured them, that he would write to his Master, and acquaint him with what readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and complaisance this Affair was made up at Court.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> offer'd to make the Marquess <hi>de Villa Franca</hi> Counsellor of State, provided he would quit his Place of Lieutenant General of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> which the King had a mind to bestow upon Prince <hi>Alexander Farnese</hi>: but he returned him this Answer, <hi>That having Reason to flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he had discharged this Office well, he could never be prevailed with to throw it up to another, as long as he was capable of doing the Duties of it himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King's Confessor was upon the point of being sent away about the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> designed that place for Father <hi>Bayona,</hi> Confessor of the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Alcala</hi>; for he imagined he might reckon upon him, and beside, the King had given his consent. They had a mind to bestow the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick of <hi>Plazencia</hi> upon Father <hi>Francis de Relux,</hi> to have a favourable pretence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him: But he used all the Interest and Credit he had in the World to keep his old Post, declaring, That he would refuse the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick; and that if the King turned him off, he would every where complain of the Chief Minister. Although the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> hated him heartily, because he was difficult of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52224:133"/>
Access, and having a great Ascendant over the King, possess'd him with several Scruples, in order to pursue his own particular Views; yet he was forced to let him alone. Every one is of Opinion, that the Duke had done much more discreetly, not to have discovered his Intentions agains<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> Enemies upon our heads, and exposes us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all the World, which will be apt to conclude we only are too weak. But this was not all; he left in the Person of the Confessor a Man that was always with the King, and who was sure to oppose him in every thing; but that was not the only thing he had Reason to apprehend. The <hi>Camarera Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Don Ieronimo de Eguya,</hi> still continued to possess the King's Favours; They had opportunity to discourse him a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> often as they pleased, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Places, and neglected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o occasions to advance and secure their own Interest. This was a sort of a <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> which might very well check the Authority of the Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; he very well saw what he was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear from this quarter, and was extreamly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it; he had long a-go desired to remove <hi>de Eguya,</hi> but he fixed himself every day more and more in the King's good Graces; and the the Death of <hi>Don Pedro Fernandez del Campo,</hi> left him in the intire possession of a Place, which before he had only exercised by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. He likewise obtained a Place of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52224:134"/>
a Counsellor in the Chamber of the <hi>Indies</hi>; and when the Duke used all his Endeavours to remove him from business, he perceived, that the King's inclination prevailed above all his Attempts to the contrary; for his Majesty was perswaded, that <hi>de Eguya</hi> was faithful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to him. The Dutchess <hi>de Terra Novo,</hi> as well as the Confessor, confirmed him in this Opinion: So that they rendred one another all good Offices reciprocally; and this was a sure and easie way to support themselves.</p>
            <p>Ever since the Night that the <hi>Camarera Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> had received that Chastisement from the Queen, after a long consideration of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, she found, that if she continu'd to observe the same rigorous Conduct towards that young Princess, which she had hitherto used, she could never insinuate her self into her Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Besides this, she knew that the Queen-Mother utterly disapproved this sort of Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that she had frequently spoke to the King her Son about it; that she had represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, that there was so vast a difference between the Customs of <hi>France</hi> and those of <hi>Spain,</hi> that there was a necessity to make some Allowances, and not to perplex a Young Princess, whose Age, as well as the Sweetness of her Temper, deserved another sort of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. The <hi>Camarera</hi> looked upon her self as undone, if she did not lay aside all her former Severity; and these considerations prevailed with her to assume a more engaging Air, and to endeavour to relieve the Queen in all her pensive moments, by discovering the King's
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52224:134"/>
Humour to her, and the means to please him. Whenever the King was vext, and out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, she seemed to spare no pains to sweeten him; and the Queen being of a frank, easie Disposition, was immediately perswaded, that the Dutchess had taken up a better Temper, and even believed, that she did her all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices she could. But the rest of the World were of a different Opinion from her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; they knew well enough that this Old <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame</hi> was rather inclined in her own Nature, to throw Oil into the fire, than endeavour to quench it; and they alledged, as an indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Proof of this, all the ill impressions she had made upon the King, in relation to the <hi>French;</hi> nay, even the most inconsiderable things that came from <hi>France</hi>: For, as I signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before, the Queen durst not play with the little Dogs she had brought along with her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King; and the two Parrots were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for no other reason but because they talked <hi>French:</hi> The King was out of humour as oft as any <hi>Frenchman</hi> passed through the Court of the Palace, especially if the Queen looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, although it was through the Windows and Lattices of her Chamber.</p>
            <p>As she was going one day to <hi>Dato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> a poor fellow, who was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> came to her Coach, and begged an Alms of her; the King was in so horrible a Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they were afraid he would have caused this Unfortunate Wretch to be killed immediately. The <hi>Camarera</hi> officiously coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell'd the Queen to order him to leave <hi>Madrid</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:52224:135"/>
without any delay; but if the Dutchess had not prejudiced the King after this manner, it is not to be imagined that the Queen had been exposed to these Injuries, which happened so often to her.</p>
            <p>This is so undeniable a truth, that one day when their Majesties went into the City, two Gentlemen belonging to the Ambassador of <hi>Holland,</hi> chancing to meet them, they stopt their Coach, out of Respect, and saluted them as they ought: They were on that side the Queen happened to be of, and were apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after the <hi>French</hi> Fashion. This immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately raised the <hi>Camarera</hi>'s Passion, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded one of the Guards to go and demand of them who they were, from whence they came, whither they were going, what busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they had in <hi>Madrid?</hi> And when to this they answered, That they were both <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in the Ambassador's Retinue, she belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to be a Sham, or at least pretended to believe it, that she might give the King a fresh occasion to commend her Care and Zeal for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that she sent to the Ambassador him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be better satisfied; and when she was fully assured of the truth, she sent the two Gentlemen word, That when they met their Majesties, they should never be guilty of the Presumption any more to go on the Queen's side, to salute her, or look upon her. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, observing the Queen to be concerned at this Conduct, as soon as she was informed of it, she thought to efface all this out of her Mind, by sending often to the <hi>French</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52224:135"/>
and giving him to understand, that she was angry with him for coming so seldom to the Palace, She used the same Expressions to the Ambassador's Lady, and told her, That it would be the greatest Joy, in the World to her to see them visit the young Queen oftner, who perhaps was too melancholy in private, and would certainly find no small Diversion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Company of Persons of their Merit, and who were of the same Country with her. This did not make the Marquess <hi>de Villars</hi> alter his Conduct in the least; for he understood well enough what was the meaning of these fair Speeches; but as for his Lady, there seldom passed a day but she went to wait upon the Queen, either in the Queen-Mother's compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or all alone by her self; but notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Assiduity of her Visits, she seldom found an opportunity to entertain her in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: She was hindered from doing this, by the presence of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ladies, who came to make their Court; or else by the King's coming, who went every other moment from his own Apartment to the Queen's; for 'tis the Custom there, that as soon as he appears, all the Women that are in the Chamber do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately withdraw.</p>
            <p>Without reckoning the Pennance of this extraordinary Solitude, the Queen had other things to afflict her, and one was to find her self clearly destitute of Money; and this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Generosity of her Heart, and her natural Inclination to be liberal, was a very sensible Mortification. She had lived there six
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52224:136"/>
Months intire, without having any Money to serve her for her lesser pleasure and she was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She wanted Money likewise to send back some of her Women that could not comply with the Customs of <hi>Spain,</hi> and whom they could not consequently endure there. The few Officers that she was allowed to bring with her, were all dismist, even to her Chyrurgeon, who had bought the Place, and performed the Journey at his own Expences. All of them departed; and this consideration redoubled the young Queen's Afflictions, to see she was not Mistriss enough to keep them any longer, or to do them those kindnesses she designed. On the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 500 Pistols a Month were assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this was in a manner less than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, because for six Months together she had been forced to borrow Money, and even out of this small Sum she was obliged to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side 200 Pistols monthly for some Alms and Charity, which the Queens of <hi>Spain</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to make. All this while no Orders were given out about the Currant Money of the Kingdom, nor was the Price of Victuals regulated; a great Want and Scarcity reigned every where, and the Publick Miseries daily increased: it had not rained for six Months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and this very much contributed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the Price of Corn: So that the People
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52224:136"/>
were reduced to the last Extremities: Nay, what is infinitely more surprising, they were not in a condition to pay the Queen the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that was assigned to her, Gold and Silver being so scarce, that none of it was to be seen.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Aquila</hi> being arrived at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> took possession of his Place of President of <hi>Castile;</hi> and the first of his Cares was to relieve and ease the People of their Grievances To effect this, he made a strict Examination into the most minute matters, and soon disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that the gross Monopolies, and insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Avarice of the Magistrates, were partly the occasion of these horrid Disorders. He came to be informed, That even the Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of the Council Royal, by some of their Creatures, took their shares of the Imposts that were laid upon Victuals; and that the same thing was done in the Oil, Chocolate, Coals, and other Provisions necessary for Life: That the <hi>Regidors</hi> and <hi>Corregidors</hi> belonging to the Town-Hall, play'd most abominable Cheats in the Corn, and consequently advanced the Price of Bread, at least one half above its usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Price. But he was sensible that he was not able to rectifie these Abuses alone; so he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> about the matter, whose Encouragement and Assistance he promised himself. Nevertheless, whether the Duke, were otherwise employed, or had no real intentions to change the Form of the Government, he did not answer the President's Desires, who perceiving that if he acted by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52224:137"/>
himself, the hatred of all those Persons, whom he should cause to be punished, would direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall upon his own Head, he was not willing to Sacrifice himself for the Publick Good. He remembred that in the time of the Regency, a certain Bishop, who was President as he was, having endeavoured to suppress these Abuses, had been poisoned by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</p>
            <p>In the mean time every thing without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception continued to be as dear as formerly, and Silver was so scarce a Commodity, that one would have imagined it had been all melted down; I once saw at a Relation's House of mine the Sum of almost three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns received in Pieces of <hi>Bellon</hi> and in <hi>Ochavos</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">These are much of the same value with the <hi>French</hi> Doubles, and are scarce an <hi>English</hi> Farthing.</note>, which are a wretched sort of Brass Money, and for the greatest part had, and yet happy was the Man who in this Universal Scarcity could get this Money. However I am obliged to say this in honour of <hi>Spain,</hi> that althô the Finances were in that sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as I represented them before, yet the King paid all the Pensions that were due to Foreigners very exactly, because he looked upon himself obliged in Honour to do it, and yet to confess a truth, some of these Pensions were not inconsiderable. I knew a certain Lady, to whom he gave Eight Thousand Crowns, and they were constantly paid her in the most difficult times.</p>

               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:52224:137"/>The Families that were ready to die of Hunger, set themselves to Rob and Murder, being in a manner Authorized in these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, by the little care that was taken to punish Murderers as they deserved, and by the extraordinary Partiality which the Judges shew to the Natives of the Country. These Families, I say, that were very numerous at <hi>Madrid,</hi> assembled together in one of the least frequented Quarters of the Town, and resolved by main force to break open some of the Magistrates Houses, because they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally charged them with the Disorders of the present Affairs, and afterwards to Plunder them in the face of the World, to serve for an Example to others. But as this Design was only formed by a Mutinous Rabble, who had never a Head to lead them on, so it is not to be wondred if they did not push their wicked Intentions any farther. In short, every Man returned to his ordinary Occupation, and none of them were called to an Account for As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling after this Tumultuous manner. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now the Effects which this sort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance and Toleration always produces.</p>
            <p>The Shoemakers being informed about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> that that the Price of Shoes was orderd to be regulated, presented a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the new President of <hi>Castile,</hi> wherein with terms full of Respect they represented their Reasons against this Regulation, making it appear, that they could not possibly lessen the Price of Shoes, as long as Leather was sold so dear as it was. He sent them to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52224:138"/>
President of the Chamber of the <hi>Alcaldes</hi>; so they formed themselves into a sort of a Body, to meet him with the greater Ceremony: but he being a Man of a sour sullen Humour, fell into a Passion to see so great a number of them; he threatned to Imprison them, and told them, that if their Power were equal to their ill Intentions, they were to be feared, because they were neither better nor worse than down-right Mutineers. They muttered a few words, and being at that time none of the strongest, went in a Body to find out their Companions and Friends, and then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately repaired to the Court of the Palace. They ran under the Windows of the King's Chamber, and, as it is the Custom there when the People complain of the Government, they cried out as loud as they were able, <hi>Let the King live, and let the ill Government die.</hi> As soon as the King perceived it, he came near the Window, and was extreamly surprized to see so great a Rabble got together, for by this tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> abundance of other People had joyned them. The King sent in great hast to find out the President of <hi>Castile,</hi> who came amongst them, and promised them all the satisfaction imaginable: He moreover told them, they violated that Respect they owed His Majesty, in coming to demand Justice of him with such Clamours and Tumults, and that if they would follow him home, he would presently content them. They very readily went along with him; so he gave them a permission to sell their Shoes at the same Price as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52224:138"/>
the Order was published. This made them return the joyfullest People in the World, but they happened to meet the President of the <hi>Alcaldes</hi> in the way, who not knowing a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of what had past, and not at all consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had to do with an unruly Mob, stopt them to vent his Reproaches and Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against them. But this procedure raised their Indignation so high, that they drew out their Swords with a design to kill him, and pursued him so fiercely, that never was any Man under more terrible Apprehensions. He had never escaped their hands, had not their Fury so far transported them, that they took no notice how he saved himself through a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Gate, which he took care to shut after him, but his fear was so great, that he fell dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously ill upon it. After they had searched for him on all sides, to no purpose, they were going homewards, when they saw the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Castile</hi> coming that way; they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently surrounded him, and swore they would not let him pass any farther, till he had signed the Permission he had given them to sell their Shoes at the ordinary Price. He immediately did every thing they demanded of him; so without any delay they took Drums and Trumpets to publish and affix this Permission to all the Publick places of the City. They suffered this first Heat to pass over without Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, but afterwards they arrested several of those whom they found the most Seditious; nevertheless they tarried but a short time in Prison, and what deserved an Exemplary Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52224:139"/>
was punished like an inconsiderable Trifle. It is indeed very true, that in order to humble the People, it was proposed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all manner of Tradesmen to carry Swords about them, and to wear black Silk Cloathes with the <hi>Golilia.</hi> 'Twas likewise designed that that this Prohibition should extend to all those Persons who had no Titles, and were not able to keep a Coach: However they durst not put it in execution, because they thought this Regulation would be too difficult and severe to be practised.</p>
            <p>The Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples</hi> was not a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at the loss of the Money which the eight Slaves had carried away with them. He was obliged to get more, but it was no easie matter to find it in a place, where they were burthen'd every day with Imposts upon Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posts. He received Orders from <hi>Madrid</hi> to Let out the Lands belonging to the King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at forty thousand Crowns <hi>per Annum;</hi> but no body could be found to take them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though those Persons, who had formerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them, enjoy'd them peaceably; and this Example one would have thought ought to have encouraged others to imitate them. The <hi>Banditti</hi> of that Country had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or some time suspended all Acts of Hostility, out of hopes that His Majesty would have given them a General Indemnity upon the score of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but when they perceived that their Expectations were like to be frustrated, and that endeavours were used to Apprehend their Captain <hi>Mattheo Tango,</hi> who was just come
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52224:139"/>
from Pirateering at Sea, they met to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Three Thousand, pillaging and rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging every thing they found in the Country, and, what is strange, not a word was spoken of the horrible Disorders they committed.</p>
            <p>The Queen-Mother who was every day at <hi>Buen Retiro,</hi> and searched all means to gain the Affections of the People, gave three Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with Musick between the Acts, that were represented on a Theatre in the <hi>Placa Mayor,</hi> that abundance of People might have the pleasure of seeing them without putting them to any Expence. The Comedians play'd for three days together, and the crowd was so great, that some People were killed. The City seemed to be very well pleased with these Shews, for they love them more in <hi>Spain</hi> than in any other part of the World; and what helped to sustain the publick Joy, was the mighty expectation they had of seeing a new face of Affairs, under the Ministry of the Duke <hi>de Medina-Celi:</hi> they promised themselves to find an end of all their present Grievances, without considering that although his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were never so good, it would be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter to redress them. He had <hi>Don Vincente Gonzaga</hi> for his Friend, who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry capable to advise him and furnish him with all necessary Expedients to accomplish his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, but the execution of them seemed to carry almost invincible difficulties along with it. There was a necessity to be severe, to disgust some, and punish others; to remove several things that had been long established,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52224:140"/>
to give ones self up entirely to Business, and constant Application, before these matters could ever be accomplished: But this was not the Genius of the Duke, and his Natural Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Bounty suited but very ill with that steadiness and resolution that ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in these nice ran-counters. This gave him abundance of uneasie thoughts, so that <hi>Don Vincente,</hi> who still prest him to take up steady Measures, and support them with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, had opportunity enough to discover his Weakness. To deliver himself therefore from so rigid and severe a Supervisor, the Duke gave him the Government (as 'tis called there) of the Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> upon Condition that he himself should always be the President of it; but as for the Profits, one had as great a share as the other. And now <hi>Don Vincente</hi> thought of nothing more than discharging the Duties of his New Place, and it was not doubted but he would worthily exercise them; for his Judgment, his Age, and his Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence made him to be considered as one of the Chief Persons of the Council.</p>
            <p>In the mean time several People of great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Birth were displeased to see the Duke confided in him no longer, they were in hopes that they would have joyned together to Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Money. The good was diminished, as I said before, and the bad continued to go as freely as formerly it did. It was therefore resolved to suppress it for good and all in Commerce, and an Edict was published on the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1680. by which the King suppressed all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52224:140"/>
the Copper Money that had gone for several Years, and People were ordered to bring it in within Ten Days to certain Offices that were set up in all parts of <hi>Madrid,</hi> where they were to receive Bills of Exchange for it, that were payable in Six Months. But they found a vast inconvenience in the Execution of this Project; for in the two <hi>Castiles</hi> they had six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Millions of this Money, part of which were mixed with good Silver, and the other was notoriously bad. So that to draw these sixteen Millions out of the hands of private Persons, they found in the King's Coffers a Fund of only sixscore thousand Crowns: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this did not hinder the crying down of the Money; and as for those Persons that had store of it, they were utterly undone. It is an easie matter to imagine what sad Effects these new Grievances drew upon the People, who were miserable enough in all conscience before, and who were forced to buy every thing at excessive Rates.</p>
            <p>The Ministers of the Inquisition, with their Trumpets, Kettle-Drums and Banner march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them, went on the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> in a Cavalcade, from the Palace to the <hi>Place Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> where they ordered it to be published, That on the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> they would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly punish all those whom they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the fire and other torments. It was forty years a-go, since a thing of this nature had been seen; and the Sight was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at <hi>Madrid</hi> with as great an impatience,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52224:141"/>
as if it had been the most agreeable Festival in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Thomas de la Cerda,</hi> Brother to the Duke <hi>de Medina-Celi,</hi> parted for <hi>Cales,</hi> with so mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent an Equipage, that a Prince of the Blood could not have a finer. Three Men of War waited to carry him over to <hi>New Spain,</hi> of which he was made Vice-Roy.</p>
            <p>They received Advices at Court, That the Count <hi>de Fuensalida,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Navar,</hi> had sent some Troops to <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> under the Command of the Duke <hi>de Canzano.</hi> This Conduct did not seem to agree with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they had sent him from this place, to give Satisfaction to the <hi>French</hi> Fishermen of <hi>Andaye,</hi> who had been abused and injured.</p>
            <p>On the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> a Bull Feast was kept, at which the King and the Queen, attended by all the Court, made their Appearance. This seemed an extraordinary fine Show to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> because two of the Combatants were killed upon the Spot, and three Cavaliers more were dangerously wounded. The Queen was so concerned at it, that she found her self some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what discomposed; however, she took care not to discover it, for fear of disquieting the King.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Gubernatis,</hi> Envoy Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary of <hi>Savoy,</hi> waited for his Orders to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, but he received a command to attend the Marquess <hi>de Dronero,</hi> who went Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Extraordinary into <hi>Portugal.</hi> So he tarried at Court without any Character.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52224:141"/>We were here informed, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Captains, who were at <hi>Naples,</hi> were not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mortified at the Prohibition that was issued out to forbid them to go drest after the <hi>French</hi> Fashion. There is never a <hi>Spaniard</hi> of 'em all that is not ravished with Joy, as soon as he is out of his own Country, to quit the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of it also, and to ablige them to wear it again, nothing less will serve the Turn but re-iterated Edicts one upon the back of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The execrable Secret of preparing the most subtle Poyson, that is so frequently practised in <hi>Italy,</hi> has been used from time to time in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> The Regent <hi>Galeota,</hi> who came back from <hi>Gaeta,</hi> made a sad Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, in a Dose of Physick, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched him in a few hours after: The Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> who loved him dearly, exprest a mighty sorrow at his Loss, and promised, that if ever he was able to discover the Crime, he would make a notorious Example of those that were concerned in it.</p>
            <p>On the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> there was kept at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> an <hi>Auto de Inquisition</hi>; That is to say, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Execution of the <hi>Iews.</hi> The People ran thither in their best Cloaths, and with as great an earnestness as if it had been to the most solemn show. A great Scaffold was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the <hi>Placa Mayor,</hi> where from Seven a Clock in the Morning till Nine at Night, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to be seen but Criminals of both Sexes, that had been sent from all the <hi>Inquisitions</hi> to <hi>Madrid:</hi> Their Process was read aloud, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52224:142"/>
Judgment was pronounced against them: Twenty <hi>Iews,</hi> as well Men as Women, and a <hi>Renegado Mahometan,</hi> were sentenced to be burnt: Five more <hi>Iews</hi> of both Sexes, this being the first time they were apprehended, and now repenting of their Errors, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to a long Imprisonment, and to wear a Yellow Scapulary, with a Red St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Cross upon it, which they call a <hi>Sanbenito,</hi> as those that carry this Habit are called <hi>Sanbenita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos.</hi> Ten more accused of <hi>Bigamy, Witchcraft</hi> and <hi>Sorcery,</hi> were sentenced to be whipt, and sent to the Gallies: These wore Past-board Bonnets upon their Heads, with Inscriptions upon them, having a Rope about their Necks, and Torches in their Hands. All the Court was present, the King, the two Queens, the Ladies, the Ambassadors, the Grandees, and a great multitude of People. The Inquisitor's Chair was placed after the manner of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and was much above that of the King, and a great deal higher. These Unfortunate People were persecuted so near the King, that he heard all their Complaints and Groans; for the Scaffold where they were ranged touched his Balcony. The Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> did the same thing here as our Provost-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal's Men do in <hi>France,</hi> they conducted the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals that were to be burnt, and held them tied fast with thick Cords: The <hi>Famillares</hi>; that is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, the Domestick Officers of the <hi>Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,</hi> at the same time led the other Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and several of the Religious, whether Learned or Ignorant, disputed vehemently
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52224:142"/>
with them, to convince these miserable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Truth of our Religion. Some of the <hi>Iews</hi> were very knowing in their own way of Worship, and returned very surprizing Answers to their Disputants. Amongst the rest, there was a young Woman, of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Beauty, who seemed not to be above Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen Years of Age, and happening to be on the same side where the Queen was, she addressed her self to her, to obtain Favour at her Hands: <hi>Great Queen,</hi> says she, <hi>cannot your Royal Presence bring some Remedy to my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes? Have pity on my Youth, and consider that I am persecuted for a Religion which I have sucked in with my Mother's Milk.</hi> The Queen turned away her Eyes, and appear'd to pity her case, but durst not make any intercession to have her saved.</p>
            <p>Mass was now began, in the midst of which the Priest that officiated, quitted the Altar, and sate down upon a Seat which was prepared for him; then the Inquisitor General descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Amphitheater, drest in his Cope, and having a Mitre on his Head; and after he had bowed towards the Altar, he advanced to the King's Balcony, which he ascended by some Steps that went round the Scaffold, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by some Officers of the Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who carried the Cross, and the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, and a Book containing the Oath, by which the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> oblige themselves to protect the Catholick Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, to extirpate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and to support the Procedures of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition</hi> with their Royal Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52224:143"/>The King stood up, with his Head unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and having the Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> on one side of him, who held the Royal Sword lifted up, swore to observe the Oath, which a Counsellor of the Council Royal read to him, and continued in this posture till such time as the Inquisitor was returned to his Place. Then a Secretary of the Inquisition got up in a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and read the same Oath, which he caused the Councils, and all the Assembly to take. It was about Noon when Mass began, and it was not over till Nine a clock at Night, by reason of the long Sentences of the condemned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that were read aloud one after another. The Constancy and Resolution with which they went to the place of Punishment, had something in it which was very extraordinary; several of them cast themselves into the fire, others burnt their Hands, and afterwards their Feet in the Flames, bearing their Torments with a Tranquillity which made them be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that such resolute Souls were not illuminated with the Light of Faith. As for my self, I did not go to behold this sad Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle; for besides that it was mid-night, and the place of Execution was without the Gate of <hi>Fuencaral,</hi> I was so concerned at what I had seen in the day-time, that I found my self indisposed. The King could not avoid seeing this horrible sight, both because it was a Religious Affair, and because he is obliged to authorize by his Presence whatever the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition does. We must not believe that these rigorous Examples do in the least promote the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52224:143"/>
Conversion of the <hi>Iews;</hi> they are not at all concerned at it, and there are a considerable number of them in <hi>Madrid,</hi> who are known to be such, and yet are quietly suffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their Employments in the <hi>Finances.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these <hi>Don Aventura Dionis</hi> was reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: His Father gave Seventy thousand Crowns to be made a Knight of St. <hi>Iago</hi>; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a few days after this Execution obtained of the King a Marquess's Title, which stood him in Fifty thousand Crowns. His Uncle was one of the most Famous <hi>Iews</hi> of <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>: All this was known at Court, but there was not the least notice taken of it; and indeed the General Receipts and Farms are full of these People. When they are rich, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> content themselves with affrighting them, that they may make them empty their Purses to redeem their Lives. By this means they draw prodigious Sums of Money from them, and provided they are in a condition to pay a good round Sum, they make a shift to escape the Fire, which they deserve as well as the rest.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Giovenazzo,</hi> who from being Envoy at the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> was nominated to go Ambassador to that of <hi>France,</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to return to <hi>Turin.</hi> But the Count <hi>de Gubernatis,</hi> who at that time was under no Character at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and who was making Prepatations for his Journey to <hi>Portugal,</hi> went to find out the Chief Minister, and represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, <hi>That the Duke his Master was so ill satisfied, to see that his Ministers were not treated in</hi>

In the mean time, they made several Reflections at Court upon the Proposals of the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and <hi>Don Antonio de la Cerda,</hi> who had been nominated to go to <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> was recalled home before he arrived there.

            <p>This Princess, as it was commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, was supposed to be poysoned; and what made the World judge so, was, because one of her Officers having carried some of the

Dishes from her Table to his own House, his Wife, and some others, after they had eat of them, found themselves extreamly ill, that they believed they should die, and had all of them Marks of poyson about them.

            </p>
            <p>A little time appeased all these Clamours, and the Count <hi>de Gubernatis</hi> departed towards the end of <hi>Iune</hi> to go for <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 22<hi>d</hi> of the same Month, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>de Grana,</hi> Ambassador from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, made his Entry. All his Retinue were ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely cloathed in Gray, and his Coaches had no Gilding about them. Most People were surprised at the sight; and to say the truth, this was not the right way to please in <hi>Madrid</hi>; for there they shew them more or less Respect, according to the Expences they are at in these sorts of occasions. To this we may add, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52224:145"/>
the People there love fine Shows above any thing in the World, and it being known, that the Ambassador had received twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns to defray the Charges of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and that he drew every Year from the Emperour and the King forty thousand Crowns more, they were ready to throw Stones at him, when they saw him make so scandalous an Entry. <hi>Don Diego de Braca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monte,</hi> Ambassador of <hi>Malta,</hi> was the Reason why he made his Entry no sooner. He was still of Opinion, that they had not done him Justice, when as he Marquess <hi>de Villars</hi> made his Entry, but that as soon as ever he renewed his Pretensions, he should have Satisfaction given him. Being under these Expectations, he demanded that his Chariot might march immediately after that of the last Ambassador of the Chappel; the Marquess <hi>de Grana</hi> would by no means consent to it, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what had been formerly done by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador of <hi>France,</hi> and so that Example was followed. This small difference was scarce determined, when the Marquess <hi>de Grana</hi> had another Contest with <hi>Don Geronimo d' Eguya</hi>; he would have had him make the first Visit, as the other Secretaries of State had always done before him. <hi>D' Eguya</hi> excused himself, by pretending, that all the other Ambassadors has come first to visit him, and that he lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Obligations to make any particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions for the sake of Monsieur <hi>de Grana.</hi> Upon this, the other Ambassadors taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what ill Advantage he had made of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52224:145"/>
Civility that shew'd him, unanimously decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they never pretended to make that Visit, as if it had been a Duty incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; so that <hi>d' Eguya</hi> was not a little mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified at a Declaration so contrary to his Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Pretensions, and found himself now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an indispensable necessity to go first to the Ambassador of <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He carried till the Court was gone to the <hi>Escurial,</hi> and took his Opportunity to go to his House on a certain day, when he knew he was not at home: But this did not satisfie the Marquess, who said, he reckoned that Visit for nothing, which he had not received: <hi>D' Eguya</hi> answered, That he had acquitted himself of his Duty; and thus they did not see one another at all. The Embassador Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary of <hi>Malta</hi> made his Entry, which tho' it made no Magnificent Appearance, was handsomly ordered.</p>
            <p>It was no small satisfaction to them at Court to hear, that the Flota for the <hi>Indies,</hi> which they believed would scarce be in a condition to go this Year, by reason that the great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of the currant Money had not a little hindred all manner of Commerce, had set Sail out of the Port of <hi>Cales,</hi> and made a Happy Voyage with the Brother of the Duke <hi>de Medina-Celi,</hi> who went Vice-Roy to <hi>New Spain:</hi> But to allay their Joy, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that one of the greater Vessels had struck against a Rock in the middle of the Bay, and received so much damage, that springing a Leak on every side, they had not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52224:146"/>
time enough to bring her off to any place where they might unload and repair her, so that she was lost with some of her Passengers, and all her Merchandize.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Medina-Celi</hi> not being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely assured to continue Chief Minister long, thought it the best way to make all Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the present Opportunity. He had nine Daughters, but had only married two of them, and had a great mind to bestow the third upon the Son of the Constable <hi>Colonna,</hi> who was newly returned to <hi>Madrid</hi> from his his Vice-Royship of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and had brought his Children along with him. This appeared to be a very Advantageous Match for the Duke's Daughter, and therefore having it still in his Eye, he shewed a particular Respect to the Marquess <hi>de los Balbazez,</hi> who was Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law to the Constable. Few Persons penetrated at first into the true Motive of the thing; they thought he did it only to have a fit Occasion to take his Instructions, because he was capable of giving him the best: but the more understanding People soon disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that the great desire he had to conclude this Alliance, was the principal Reason; for at the bottom the Marquess <hi>de los Balbazes</hi> had more Reputation at the time when his Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and great Negotiations kept him at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, than when he was at <hi>Madrid.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it proceeded from the Envy the World bore him, or that his Presence made them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his Faults more narrowly, it is certain that People had a better Opinion of him when
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52224:146"/>
he was absent, than when they saw him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. The good Graces of the Duke still contributed to draw more Hatred and Envy upon him, but they did not last long enough to make him suffer any thing upon that Account.</p>
            <p>One of the greatest things they usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached <hi>Balbazez</hi> with, was his excessive Avarice which busied it self in the most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable matters, altho he was Master of a plentiful Fortune, and might have lived after another manner, without incommoding his Estate in the least. He was a <hi>Genoese,</hi> of the House of <hi>Spinola</hi>; his Grandfather had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly commanded the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, and this was likewise a great Captain; but whether it were because he was a Stranger, or for some other Reason, the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> looked upon him as much inferiour to them, although he was a Grandee as well as themselves, and was of illustrious Birth. They despised him, because he made Advantage of his Money, after the manner of a Banker, which is so sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom practised in <hi>Spain</hi> by Persons of Quality, that they, cannot endure those that do it. His Enemies pretended, that he had committed notorious Oversights at the Treaty of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> and that they daily beheld new Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences arise from his ill Conduct there; That this was the Subject of perpetual quarrels between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> because he had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to lay down in plain intelligible terms, what things were yielded up, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances, and that every one made use of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52224:147"/>
this Obscurity to interpret it to their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that what they alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Marquess <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> had foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation enough, but the Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> was the Man that took the greatest pains to expose his Miscarriages to the World. He had no kindness for him for <hi>Don Iuan</hi>'s sake, whose Favourite he had always been, and for which Reason the Marquess declared against the Queen. This was the true Cause of the Aversion that was between the Constable and him, and it increased very much on the side of the former, when he saw what a Respect and Esteem the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> testified for the other. He needed no more than this to revive the Old Grudge he had against the Chief Minister, and it proceeded so far, that he incessantly heighten'd the Complaints that came from all parts, under the Dominion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> against the Duke. It must be allowed, that the Constable was one of the most dexterous prudent Men of his Age, and that his Rank and great Abilities gave him vast Advantages over the rest; so that whenever he gave his Advice, few People were found so hardy as to oppose him. The Duke was sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he directly thwarted him upon all occasions: This together with his other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, made him extreamly uneasie, to find himself perpetually engaged in a troublesome Combat, and to dispute against a Man, who, as we may say, took a Pleasure in chasing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and who searched all occasions to perplex
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52224:147"/>
and disgust him. Therefore in this Affair the Duke took the mildest course; he courted the Constable's Friendship, and made all Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards it: He knew that he was fall'n ill, and that though he was not in a condition to go to the Council, he was not so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed, but that he might his have Advice, in case it were demanded.</p>
            <p>He sent constantly to the Constable's House to consult him upon all important occasions, and this mark of distinction flatter'd his Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so agreeably, that he found himself migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily obliged to the Duke. He wanted very little of pretending to be always sick for the time to come, as long as the Duke conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to give him so evident a Proof of Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: However, 'tis very certain, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was as well as ever, he would not stir abroad for a long time, only to prolong a thing which filled him with so much Pleasure and Satisfaction. He received another Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the Duke, which made no less an impression upon him; a considerable Benefice happening to be vacant, he bestow'd it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon one of his Natural Sons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Constable's ever demanding it. So many unexpected Favours perfectly overcame him, and made him desirous to do something on his side; so he proposed to submit to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, in order to accommodate the business of the Duke <hi>de Cardonne</hi>'s Succession. The Constable had espoused his Widow, and the Duke his Daughter: These Two Ladies had great Pretensions, and as great Differences;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52224:148"/>
therefore they thought it the best way to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them by the mutual consent of both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: The Duke was sensible, that the Constable, who naturally loved long tedious Law-Suits, shew'd a great deal of Complaisance in this matter, and indeed the Constable was of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that it would be better to put an end to this Affair, than be engaged in an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Contest with the Chief Minister.</p>
            <p>This Chief Minister often assisted the King, and denied, Audience to no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but neither did his Endeavours or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences produce any advantageous Effects for the publick Interest, and the smallest Affairs were as difficult for him to determine as the greatest. The Marquess <hi>de Grana</hi> knew so well before hand what he was to expect upon this score, that he could not be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Embassy for <hi>Spain,</hi> till he received ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Orders from the Emperour, although for his farther Encouragement, he had several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Friends at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and that besides his having resided there formerly, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of those Favours he might reasonably expect for his Master's sake, ought to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the unwillingness he expressed to come to this Court. It is true, what served to increase it very much, was the secret Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which he thought his Enemies, and those that envied him, might have upon him, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Absence from <hi>Vienna</hi>? But for all this he found he had reason enough to be content with the manner of his usage, the King allow'd him a double Franchise, and paid all the Charges of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52224:148"/>
his House at his Arrival: The Two Queens honoured the Marchioness <hi>de Grana,</hi> and her Daughters, with several Presents; they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him in every thing, yet nevertheless he could not forbear to say proudly, that he hoped he should not tarry there above a year, and that it should not be his Fault, if he did not depart sooner. He was a fine Gentleman, had abundance of Wit, Penetration and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; but he was of a prodigious bigness, and found himself mightily incommoded by it: He sometimes could not help changing his Countenance, when he happen'd to be in Company with People whom he was not well acquainted with, when they looked stedfastly upon him. The Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Inclinations for him, that they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted him whatever he desired; but they could not forbear now and then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise him some things which they never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and he himself was sensible that they never would. He was frequently vexed upon these Occasions, saying, That it was his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune not to know what he might depend upon: He was concerned at the Misery to which all sorts of People were reduced at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> and I have heard him frequently say, That whatever Idea's a Man might form to himself of the Publick Grievances, yet they infinitely fell short of what they really were, when he came to see them, and that for his part, he could not imagine what Remedies they could apply to them. It is indeed true, that Funds were wanting for the most necessary.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52224:149"/>
Exigencies, and that they were forced to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row five thousand Pistols for the Subsistence of some Troops that they thought convenient to send to <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Frontiers of <hi>Biscay,</hi> by reason of the Apprehensions they had at Court of the Designs of our King. I have heard it often said, That the Couriers could not go, for want of Money to defray the Expences of their Journey, although they had Affairs of great Consequence to dispatch; and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> who knew this better than any body, represented to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> that there was a perfect necessity to take full Cognizance of the Funds, upon which they might depend for the time to come. The Duke relishing this Proposal, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a true Scheme of the King's Revenues to be brought before him: But the President of the <hi>Finances,</hi> and some others, after they had deliberated, as their Fashion was, upon the matter, that is, with a regard only to their own proper Interests, answered all with one Consent, That what he demanded of them was the Work of several Years. This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was sufficient to make him abandon the Undertaking; for the Duke never cared to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himself in any business that was of long continuance; nay, he had scarce Resolution enough to go through those things which he was obliged suddenly to begin, and as soon to finish. One of the best Examples I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to justifie this, is his leaving the <hi>Camarera Major, Don Geronimo de Eguya,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, quietly to enjoy their Places, without
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52224:149"/>
endeavouring to remove them, whether it were because he despised them, or that he imagined them to be too powerful to attempt any thing against them. The Weakness which he shew'd in that Rancounter, served only to increase their Courage and Haughtiness; and they went so far at last, as not to fear him at all: They possessed the King with a strong Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to him, and insinuated several things into him that were quite opposite to the Duke's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. He was well enough sensible of it, but his natural insensibility hindered him from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting it: His Gentleness rend'red him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible both to one and the other, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> who spoke often to the King about him, and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her self upon her constant Chapter, the Duke, in such bitter Language, that he being informed of it, as he certainly was, every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had Reason to wonder how he was able to endure it.</p>
            <p>This ill-natur'd old Beldame had only a seeming, and not a real Kindness for the Young Queen, and it lasted so short a time, that her usage served only to make the Queen sensible, that she knew how to moderate her self well enough, when she saw it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for her interest so to do. But as this was indeed a true constraint upon her Nature, and she could not counterfeit the least sweetness of Temper, without a great Reluctance, so she soon re-assumed her proper C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>racter, and her Persecutions became more frequent than ever. The Queen, utterly impatient of this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52224:150"/>
Rigorous Deportment, charmed the King one day, by all manner of tender engaging Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses, till she found him in a Humour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny her nothing. After some time had past, she told him, That if she was dear to him, she conjured him to give her some testimony of it, that was as well necessary for her Health, as the Satisfaction of her Mind. He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to consent to whatever she desired. <hi>Why then,</hi> saith she, <hi>deliver me from the Tyranny of the Dutchess</hi> de Terra Nova. This Demand surprised him, and it was a pretty while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he returned her any Answer; but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this had disquieted her a long time, he told her at last, That what she requested had never any President, and that no Queen had ever changed her <hi>Camarera Major. Ah, Sir,</hi> replied the Queen, <hi>your Majesty has shew'n me several Favours for which none of your Predecessors have left any Example; and cannot you then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to grant me this? I consent to it,</hi> says the King, taking her by the Hand, <hi>I consent to it; but then, Madam, have a care upon whom you cast your Eyes; for after this first choice it will be impossible for you to make another.</hi> The Queen testified her Joy and Acknowledgment, by Thanks proportionable to the Pleasure she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>The first Journey she made, was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Queen-Mother with the News, not at all questioning, but that she would almost shew as much Joy upon this occasion as her self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52224:150"/>But she was not a little surprised to find her so reserved and cold, as if the matter were absolutely indifferent to her. This mightily perplexed her, and so she discovered the whole Affair to the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador's Lady, who took pains to put her in heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, by making her sensible, that the Queen-Mother was only apprehensive of seeing this place filled by some other Lady, who might perhaps be full as disagreeable to her as the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> was, and that she was of Opinion, that if she proposed some body to her, whom she liked, she would open her self more clearly to her. The Young Queen replied, That she would do nothing in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, without the Advice of the Queen her Mother in Law; That she was minded to have said as much to her, when she first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed her about it, but that she seemed to be so indifferent in the matter, that she had not Confidence enough to explain her self farther. The Queen judged it would be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to acquaint the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> with this Affair, for fear, least if she made a Mystery of it, and he should afterwards hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to discover it, he might look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself to be disobliged, and resent it so much, as to endeavour to hinder the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of it: But she still lay under some Perplexities, because she fancied she did not understand the <hi>Spanish</hi> Language well enough, to be able to hold any long Conversation in it with the Duke, and this was a nice Case, wherein she ought to explain her self clearly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52224:151"/>
and intelligibly. She was yet more afraid, that the <hi>Camarera,</hi> who was always a listening in all parts of her Apartment, and who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times slipt into Corners, where, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceived, she understood and saw every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that past, would go and discover what she said concerning her. These Reasons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with her to charge one of her Women, in whom she reposed a great confidence, to go to <hi>Don Antonio de la Cerda,</hi> who was a near Relation of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and who besides expressed a great Zeal for her Majesty, and desire him to acquaint the Chief Minister with what had happened, and to tell him, That since the Queen was resolved to remove her <hi>Camarera,</hi> she desired him to chuse for her one of his Friends, of whose Fidelity he was assured; and that it was necessary for him to assist her in this Affair, to the end, that acting in Consort one with another, the business might succeed to their common Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. The Duke received the Honour the Queen did him, with a great deal of Respect and Acknowledgement, and sent his Dutchess that very Evening to return her his most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thanks. When she came to the Queen's Apartment, she carried till the other Ladies were gone out of the Room, that she might have a better opportunity of making her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment.</p>
            <p>The Queen, who knew very well, that the Dutchess was sensible enough of the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Condescensions she had made on her side, was desirous to bestow the Place upon her;

but the Affair did not succeed as she imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, because that Lady had too much busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon her Hands to accept the Offer. <hi>I have designed it for you,</hi> says the Queen, <hi>and I am of Opinion, that you will not be unwilling to serve me.</hi> The Dutchess thanked her, as in Duty obliged, and told her, She could wish with all her heart that she was in a condition to accept this Honour, and that no body in the World should serve her Majesty more faithfully than she would; but her Health was so ill, that it would not permit her to render her those Services in which that Place, as well as her own inclinations, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her. But the Queen continuing to press her still, she told her, That although this Consideration was laid aside, yet she had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of equal importance, which she could never dispence with, That she had Seven Daughters, upon whose Education and good Conduct all her Cares were bestow'd; and therefore she requested her Majesty to think of her no more: However, she durst assure her, she believed the Marchioness <hi>de Los Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lez,</hi> to be the most proper Person to execute this Place; That she was a Lady of great Merit, and illustrious Birth; that she had formerly been <hi>Governante</hi> to the Young King, and consequently being so well known to his Majesty, could more dexterously humour and please him than any one besides. The Queen very well approved of this Advice, and the Dutchess afterwards withdrew. She gave her Husband an Account of what Conversation
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52224:152"/>
had passed between her and the Queen; but he was displeased to hear that she had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Marchioness <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> because he had already engaged himself in behalf of the Dutchess <hi>de Albuquerque,</hi> and earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to see her advanced to this Post.</p>
            <p>The Confidence which the King reposed in <hi>de Eguya,</hi> would not permit him to conceal from him the promise he made the Queen to remove the <hi>Camarera.</hi> He for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> part omitted nothing that might turn off the intended blow; but he found the King was so fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to satisfie the Queen, that he perceived it would be to no purpose to use any importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities with him upon this score: So all he could do in the matter, was only to acquaint the <hi>Camarera</hi> with what was designed against her, that so she might be the better provided to bear the shock when it happened. She had some Suspicions of this before, it being her principal Talent to penetrate into the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Affairs. This blow sensibly afflicted her, and she could not forbear to speak to the Queen about it. <hi>Madam,</hi> says she, <hi>I should reckon my self extreamly unfortunate, if my Zeal for your Majesty should ever 'happen to displease you: I have spoken to you with more Zeal, and perhaps with more Freedom than any one has done; nevertheless, my design was only to inspire you with a desire of learning all our Fashions, that so you might absolutely possess the Heart and good Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the King: The Liberty I took has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too assuming; I have drawn your displeasure upon my self, by endeavouring to deserve your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52224:152"/>
and I am informed at last, that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty desires to see my Place filled by another.</hi> The Queen; surprised to see that the Affair she had communicated to so few Persons, had taken Air, answered coldly, <hi>It is not worth the while, Madam, to trouble your self about what People say; few Persons know my Thoughts; and 'tis a thing usually practised in Courts, to invent News, and then to relate it as if it were true.</hi> The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marera</hi> was not able to draw any Discoveries from this Conversation; but whether her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science reproached her for the Conduct she had used, or else she had been informed of the Queen's Designs before <hi>de Eguya</hi> spoke to her about them; it was some time a-go since she suspected that she was to be removed, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Consideration, having examined all the Ladies of the Court, who gave her the greatest Jealousie, she found Three, <hi>viz.</hi> the Marchioness <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> the Dutchess <hi>de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque,</hi> and the Dutchess <hi>de l' Infantado.</hi> This is the Cause that she took her measures a long time before, and spoke of these Three La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in very disobliging Terms before the Queen, whenever an occasion presented it self. She accused the Marchioness <hi>de Los Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lez</hi> for her Haughtiness in all her Actions, and for her insupportable Severity. She pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Dutchess <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> hated all the <hi>French</hi> so mortally, that when she happen'd to meet any of that Nation, she turned her Eyes aside, that she might not behold them; and that she valued her self so mightily upon the score of her high Birth and Vertue, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52224:153"/>
she had always something or other to say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the World: And then as for the Dutchess <hi>de l' Infantado,</hi> she represented her as an old doting Woman, who at the best had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any great share of Wit, and had now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally lost it, by reason of her great Age. She was not content to speak of them after this manner, but engaged all the <hi>French</hi> Women, who were near the Queen, to insinuate the same Opinion into her, and they acquitted themselves in the matter as well as they could, out of hopes, that if the Dutchess continued in her Post still, she would take care to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them for their good Services.</p>
            <p>What they said to the Queen upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, made but a small impression upon her Mind; and the first time she could find an opportunity to discourse the Queen-Mother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, she acquainted her with her Designs in favour of the Marchioness <hi>de los Velez</hi>; but she expressed as great an indifference at this Motion as she did at first. This gave the Queen no small Affliction; so she imagined, that she ought to inform her of every thing that was laid to the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi>'s Charge, as well upon the Affair of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> whom she caused to be Assassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as several other things that rendered her odious. After this, she added the Particulars of the Deportment she had used towards her. But the Queen-Mother pretended, as if all this were News to her, and still continued to speak very kindly of the <hi>Camarera</hi>; not that she had the least kindness for her in reality;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52224:153"/>
for she had not forgotten how deeply she had been engaged in the Interests of <hi>Don Iuan</hi>; and she had not as yet forgiven the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that Prince for the Troubles he brought upon her.</p>
            <p>The Reason of her using this Conduct with the Queen, was only to exclude the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> and the Dutchess <hi>de l' Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado,</hi> whom she did not greatly care for. She thought with her self, that if she desired to oblige the Queen to take a <hi>Camarera</hi> from her Hands, it would he necessary for her to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no Aversion for her that was to fill that Place, and that the Queen being desirous to be seconded by her, would demand of her whom she pitched upon, and so take a Person of her own chusing. The Young Queen was aware of her Mother-in-Law's Designs: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, she pretended to know nothing of them, supposing that such a one would be always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do as the Queen-Mother directed her; Having therefore a particular inclination for the Marchioness <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> she was resolved to sound the King's Sentiments upon that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and proposed her to him; but he exprest an extraordinary Antipathy to her: <hi>If,</hi> says he, <hi>you knew the Marchioness</hi> de Los Velez <hi>as well as I do, I am confident you would never think of placing her so near you; She has been my Governante, and is the only Person in the World whom I dread most.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> desired no more to see her in that Station than the King did, and shew'd as great a dislike to the Dutchess <hi>de l' Infantado;</hi> all their Votes
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52224:154"/>
concurr'd in behalf of the Dutchess <hi>de Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque,</hi> and it was agreed upon at last, to perswade the Queen that she ought to chuse her.</p>
            <p>This Choice had infallibly succeeded, if the Queen could have cured her self of those disagreeable impressions which the <hi>Camarera</hi> had made upon her in relation to that Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess; She often thought of the imperious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that was attributed to her, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Aversion she had to the <hi>French,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of what the King had told her, That when once the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> was removed, and another put into her Place, she must never think of turning her off. She was perswaded, that she should be no Gainer by the change, if she pitched upon the Dutchess <hi>de Albuquerque:</hi> Nay, that it might so happen to her, as to be a considerable loser by it. This Imagination hindered her from pushing this Affair any farther; and she thought it would be much better to carry a little, till she could find out some other Lady, who might be altogether agreeable to her. In effect, as she was searching after one, she was told of the Marchioness <hi>de Eytona,</hi> who was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Solid Vertue, great Merit, and had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Wit and Gallantry. In fine, she was every way so well Accomplished, that it was necessary for her Majesty to have her near her; and by the Relations she had at the Queen-Mother's Court, and with the Chief Minister, she could not chuse but please both Parties alike. The King shew'd no opposition
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52224:154"/>
to her, and the Queen who knew her, loved her already; so that she was mighty joyful to meet with one whom she liked so well. But this Joy did not continue long; for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioness <hi>de Eytona</hi> fell sick, and died a few days after. The Young Queen was sensibly Afflicted at this Loss, and not knowing where to make a better choice, she came back again to the Marchioness <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> because she comprehended no difference between the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> and the Dutchess <hi>de Albuquerque</hi>; And as for the Dutchess <hi>de l' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantado,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he perceived well enough that she was not fit for her.</p>
            <p>But now to propose the Marchioness <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> was to attempt a thing that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver succeed, for the Reasons I have already mentioned. The Marchioness, who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them better than any body, could not endure to be so long exposed to an Exclusion that was so very disobliging to her; So she went to find out the Queen, and returned her Thanks for her great Favours; but she told her, That her Age, and the Trouble she had had with the King, when she was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernante to him, gave her so great a disrelish for the Court, that she could by means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile her self to it, and therefore desired her to think of her no more. All these Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties seemed to arise for the Satisfaction of the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> or at least, they proved the occasion why she continued still in her Place; and that the Queen, utterly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to find so many disappointments in her
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52224:155"/>
way, was come to such a pass; that she was no longer desirous to remove her. The Queen-Mother all the while intrigued more than she, because she earnestly desired to have that Lady turned out of the Palace.</p>
            <p>What still contributed to make the Young Queen less concerned for the matter, was, that her Mind was taken up with new Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that were more pressing upon her than those she received from the <hi>Camarera</hi>; I mean, the Apprehensions they had at Court of a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between the two Crowns. The Queen remained inconsolable, when she considered, that the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> of which she was, as it were, the Seal, was going to be broken. The Love she had for <hi>France,</hi> and the Obligations that fastened her to <hi>Spain,</hi> ballanced all her Inclina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions; and she often shed Tears, out of a fear only of seeing the War renewed.</p>
            <p>The most Christian King pretended, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had pillaged and abused his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in several places, and either burnt or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many <hi>French</hi> Vessels; That they returned him no Answer at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to the Complaints he had made; That the Marquess <hi>de Borgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> who resided at <hi>London,</hi> in quality of Ambassador Extraordinary from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> observed no manner of measures; nay, not even those that Decency prescribes; That he had made a League in the Name of the King his Master, with the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> against <hi>France</hi>; That he was well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as he was upon his departure to go
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52224:155"/>
Ambassador to <hi>Vienna,</hi> he had received pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Orders to stay some time in <hi>Holland,</hi> to try if he could perswade the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to do the most prejudicial things they could to <hi>France.</hi> The King, provoked at so clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine a Conduct, and so extraordinary in the midst of a Peace, which he had not infringed the least on his part, was resolved to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his usual Justice and Equity; and finding himself possess'd with these Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he had nothing to incline him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he was obliged to part with any of his Rights.</p>
            <p>He ordered his Gallies to put to Sea, with an express Command to make those of <hi>Spain</hi> give them the first Gun whenever they met them. He knew that this Affair had been regulated at the same time when <hi>Philip</hi> IV. had agreed, that his Ambassadors should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appear in Publick with those of <hi>France</hi>; and he made the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, that the Conduct he used during the Peace, was so opposite to Peace it self, that he saw himself obliged to seek out all Advantages on his side, as he found it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for his part, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the exact Severity that was show'n him in the smallest matters, alledging, that when the Commissioners of the most Christian King were to have adjusted with those that came from <hi>Spain,</hi> the Limits of what had been yielded up by the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> had refused to Treat with the Deputies
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52224:156"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f <hi>Spain,</hi> as long as the Catholick King should take upon him the Quality of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy:</hi> They added a Declaration to this Refusal, That if within a certain time assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they did not Treat, by Vertue of another Commission, where this Title was not insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they would immediately put the King of <hi>France</hi> in Possession of the Territories and Rights which belonged to him. So that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was content to cut off the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles he usually assumes, with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This League, about which the Marquess <hi>de Borgomaine</hi> made such a bustle and stir in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was at last concluded with <hi>Spain.</hi> It was a mutual Engagement on both sides, whereby they obliged themselves to defend one another, in what place soever they should happen to be attacked. For this end <hi>England</hi> was to furnish Eight Thousand Foot, and Thirty Men of War; and <hi>Spain</hi> was obliged to send an Hundred Thousand Crowns eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Month into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to keep the Garisons there in a good condition, and have Twelve Thousand Men in pay in <hi>Champagne.</hi> They were in good hopes, that the Emperour and the <hi>Hollander</hi> would likewise enter into the League. <hi>Don Pedro Ronquillo,</hi> Ambassador Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary of <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> sent a Couri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with a Ratification of the Treaty, which was received at <hi>Madrid</hi> on the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1680.</p>
            <p>Most People were very well satisfied, when they saw the several Motions on both sides, that the War would infallibly be kindled
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52224:156"/>
somewhere or other in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Villa Hermosa</hi> had demanded to be recalled home, and that another Governour might be sent to supply his Place. The unconcerned Temper, as well as the Natural Slowness of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> held the matter a considerable time in suspence, without giving themselves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to determine it. The Marquess <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> was first pitched upon to be sent thither: but as soon as he received Advice of it, he endeavoured all he could to get himself excused, out of an Apprehension that they would engage him at the same time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract vast Debts, to which his Thrifty Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour gave him an invincible Aversion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, they found it a difficult matter to meet with any Subject who was to their Mind: The Report ran, That the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> would go to command there in Chief; Afterwards it was said, the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi> would be the Man, for whom the Marquess <hi>de Grana</hi> did several good Offices. After they had deliberated a long time about the Merits of these two Competitors, at last they cast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>out the beginning of <hi>Iuly.</hi> He was Brother to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and was about Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Year old; the Gou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, and the Tallness of his Stature was very Extraordinary: He had been a long time devoted to <hi>Spain,</hi> and particularly to the Queen-Mother, at the juncture when she had those great Differences with <hi>Don Iuan:</hi> He
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52224:157"/>
had been General of the Cavalry in <hi>Estrama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dura</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and passed for a very great Souldier, although 'tis certain he had but very little Experience, and the Management of his private Affairs sufficiently demonstrated it; for he ow'd every body Money, paid seldom, and had not a Farthing by him: his Profuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and his Mistresses ruined him; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, after all, he had really a great Estate, yet it was miserably incumbred. It was the General Opinion here, that if the War com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, <hi>Flanders</hi> would be the first Victim; and this made them believe, that it would be less ignominious for <hi>Spain</hi> to suffer this Loss, when an <hi>Italian</hi> was Governour of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> than if a <hi>Spaniard</hi> were there. In short, it could be nothing else but this Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration only, that could possibly induce them to believe they did well to fill this Post with a Man, who never had managed as yet any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of that vast importance as these were. They bargained with <hi>Don Francisco de Castile,</hi> for the Sum of Three Hundred Thousand Crowns, which was to be remitted to <hi>Brussels,</hi> for the payment of the Troops: And after Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> had received the Thirty Thousand Crowns which the King ordered to be given him, to bear the Expence of his Voyage, he parted on the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> to go and take Shipping at the <hi>Groyne</hi> in <hi>Galicia.</hi> He took along with him abundance of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers, and a numerous Train of Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks: He sent a Courier into <hi>France,</hi> to get necessary Pasports, and left the Court in such
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52224:157"/>
haste, that he forgot to carry with him the Patent for his Government. It was not very long before he heartily repented for so doing, and he prest earnestly to have it: However, they promised him one, but d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ferr'd to expedite it; so that he could only be said to be Governour for the <hi>Interim</hi>; and it was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, with Reason enough, that he would not be well pleased with this Usage. He had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted some Persons at <hi>Madrid</hi> to sollicite this Affair for him; but they refused the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when the Court would oblige them to take them in such a Form, and after many Petitions on their side, and several Contests with the Ministers about it, it was not at last inserted into the Patent after what manner he was made Governour.</p>
            <p>In the mean-time the Prince departed from <hi>Madrid</hi> with so little Money, according to his usual Custom, that he was scarce arrived at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> but he dispatch'd a Courier away to the Court with some Letters, wherein he demanded Money to perform his Voyage. They answered him very coldly, That they would advise him not to defer the day of his departure, and that they could by no means believe, that he had already spent his Thirty Thousand Crowns. He embarked immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, accompanied by some Vessels belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Biscay,</hi> which transported five hundred new raised Men, that had been levied in <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and were commanded to guard the <hi>Frontiers.</hi> The People in <hi>Flanders</hi> had not for many Years seen any other Governour but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52224:158"/>
               <hi>Don Iuan</hi>; he possessed the Government as his own till his Death; and although he was at so great a distance, yet Couriers were still dispatched to him, to receive his Orders, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> most important Conjunctures. To say the truth, the Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> had been sent thither, as I have already observed in the beginning of these Memoirs, in the Place of that Prince; and he obtained a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Patent, without specifying in it, that it was only by a Commission; but the Queen-Mother would have it so, on purpose to disgust <hi>Don Iuan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The pressing Necessity there was for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in <hi>Flanders,</hi> obliged the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> to search with all imaginable Application some means or other to furnish them with some; and he tried several without meeting any Success. <hi>Don Francisco de Castile</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately promis'd to remit Thirty Thousand Crowns thither, and afterwards engaged to make a return of Eighteen Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Florins</hi> more; upon which consideration they were to give him Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns in Hand, and to pay him the rest at different times upon Assignations, which in all probability would never have been paid to him.

As for People of Quality, they could not tell what to do: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had pawn'd their Jewels, their Plate, nay, even their Canopies of State, and their wearing Apparel, they found they had now no more Money or Credit left. The Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers were not in a better condition, and the Merchants had neither Merchandize nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The inconvenience of proclaiming Money, to go at a lower Price, was sensibly perceived every day more and more, and the Publick Misery still increased. A Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sufficiently wonder that things of so great a consequence were managed with so little consideration: Nay, matters were come to that pass, that in several Provinces they were forced to exchange Cattle for Corn, and Cloath for Linnen, because there was not Money enough to circulate in the way of Trade. Heaven pitied the great Afflictions of those People, and favoured them with a Plentiful Year; but the Price of Bread was
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52224:159"/>
not in the least diminished, either through the Negligence or Villany of the Magistrates, who were so far from encouraging the Corn to be brought into the great Cities, that they under-hand hindered it from being carried to those Places. The Queen-Mother's Houshold began to find in their turn, the Effects of these Disorders; she had been hitherto very well paid, and her Domesticks received their <hi>Raci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that is to say, their Allowances, either in Money or Provisions; and now when they prest the Treasurers to take care they might have them, they were told, that they might go and visit the Chests of the Treasury, if they pleased, which at present were all open, because they had no Money within.</p>
            <p>So many particular, as well as private Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, were yet increased by the Ravage and Desolation the Plague made in <hi>Andaluzia.</hi> It is not long ago since it was altogether unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited along the Sea Coasts from <hi>Malaga</hi> to <hi>Alicant.</hi> The Kingdom of <hi>Granada</hi> was not free from this Pestilence, which spread it self about <hi>Sevil</hi> and <hi>Corduba,</hi> and in <hi>Estramadura.</hi> It was immediately perceived at Port St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> but they would not take any publick no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, till after the departure of the <hi>Flota</hi> for the <hi>Indies,</hi> for fear of spoiling Commerce. If it had not been for this consideration, it had been visibly perceived much sooner. The difficulties still increased, as to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Trade, and People were apprehensive that their Letters, Commodities and Goods carried the infection with them. It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52224:159"/>
enough for Men to use all necessary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution against so dangerous a Distemper as this was.</p>
            <p>I have already observed, that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> would have fain engaged the King to part with his Confessor, but that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many difficulties appear in the way, he desisted from his design: But Father <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de Relux</hi> had not, for his part, forgotten the ill Offices that the Duke endeavoured to do him. He dissembled his Resentments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was not as yet so well settled in the King's good inclinations, as to venture to cope with the Chief Minister. But as soon as he found himself upon sure grounds, he spoke to <hi>de Eguya,</hi> and the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> to interest them in his quarrel, out of a desire he had to make the Duke sensible of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Power. The old Dutchess was not ignorant, that the Duke hated her, and that he passionately desired to see another in her Place: This inspired her with a mortal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to him; and so these Three Persons being always united, raised a considerable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against him: But that of the Confessor was carried on more secretly, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was more dangerous. It often happens, that a Man pursues his Revenge freely, when he may safely do it under the Pretence of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; And this was the Case of Father <hi>de Relux</hi>; for he incessantly attacked the King in his most tender part, his Conscience. <q>He represented to him the Misery of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Extremity of the State, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52224:160"/>
and Miscarriages, which were so far from being remedied, that they were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encouraged; that no Grievances were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest, that every thing came to ruine; that if his Majesty was sensible that he had not Power and Experience enough to regulate Affairs of himself, and to take the Reins of the Government into his own hands, he ought at least, to intrust them with a Minister, who would give him an honest and faithful Account of his Employment: That the debate was not now about a trivial matter, but that his Everlasting Salvation lay at stake; that God, who makes and preserves Kings in their Sovereign Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, expects that Kings should perform their Duties; that they are obliged to cherish their Subjects as their Children, and to make them happy as far as it lies in their Power; that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> only regarded his own private Interests, and minded nothing but his Family, which was very numerous, and the advancing of his Relations, whilst the rest of <hi>Spain</hi> groaned under the heavy weight of Subsidies, Imposts, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand other Vexations, which were purposely raised to exhaust them; that he was obliged in Conscience to inform him, that unless he vigorously endeavoured to apply proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to these Evils, it was his Duty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him Absolution.</q> The King, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for some time astonished at these Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, demanded of him, whether he did not speak all these afflicting things only to try
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52224:160"/>
him, The other answered, That he was so far from entertaining any such thoughts, that were so little conformable to the Respect he owed him, that he would willingly have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed his own Life, to have been exempted from the cruel necessity of speaking to him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so frank a manner. The King was very Pensive, and spent several days in consulting himself, without knowing what to resolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He loved the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and at last sent for him to come to him. So having shut him up with himself in his Closet, he fairly acquainted him with the occasion of his Uneasiness, and with his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions in relation to his Salvation: He recounted to him every thing that past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Confessor and him, and how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to Absolve him, because of the general disorder of Affairs; and at last told the Duke, He had now sent for him to comfort him with good Reasons. The Chief Minister listned very respectfully to him all the while, and would not suffer himself to be transported with any Passion against the Confessor's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, for fear the King should suspect the true Motives of that Heat. On the contrary he agreed, <q>That he was indeed a Man of Sincerity, and that his Advices seemed to proceed from a good intent: But then he added, That he was a Monk, and had no manner of Experience in the World: That <hi>Don Iuan</hi> had drawn him out of a Convent, where he lay buried; That he never had any Conversation but with Monks, like
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52224:161"/>
himself; that he was dazled with the Post, to which, by the Favour of <hi>Don Iuan</hi> he had been elevated all on the sudden; that his Head was giddy, and that he knew not how to make any difference between things and times, although this was an Article ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary in the Conduct of Souls; that he placed the King's Soul in a parallel with that of a private Man; that he agreed indeed, that in the sight of God one were as valuable as the other, and that all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that was to be found between them, proceeded only from the diversity of their Works; but then every Man had a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way to save himself, that a Prince ought to live like a Prince, and a private Man like a private Man, and so after the same manner, a Secular like a Secular, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious like a Religious; that Father <hi>Relux,</hi> whose Capacity was very narrow, confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Estates, and even lost himself in this Chaos; that his Majesty ought not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed at what he had told him, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially least of all in the present Affairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he assured him, for his part, that he would not lose a moment to set them in the best Order imaginable; that in truth, it was necessary to allow some time for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this; that let a Man's Zeal be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so earnest for the Publick Good, yet he cannot effect it immediately, since it is full as difficult a matter to remedy Grievances, as 'tis easie to desire the removal of them; but that since the Confessor had troubled himself with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52224:161"/>
several things, which did not at all belong to him, if the King would be pleased to take his Advice, he would provide him with one, who was more capable of the Post than F. <hi>Relux,</hi> and would never torment him with impertinent Scruples.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke found it an easie matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade his Majesty to embrace a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ng that would set his Conscience at rest; and the King had consented that very moment to the removal of the Confessor, if he had not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it necessary to take the Advice of <hi>Don Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronimo de Eguya,</hi> and so he told the Duke, that he would make a few Reflections as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, upon the matter. <hi>De Eguya</hi> coming to wait upon the King, he communicated his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to him. After the strict Union that was between this Favourite, the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> and Father <hi>Relux,</hi> there was little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that he would consent to his Removal, but as he preferr'd his own Interests to those of other Persons, and only served others out of a Respect to his own Advantage: So he found, that the Confessor was so devoted to the <hi>Camarera Major,</hi> and that she so resolutely swore the Down-fall of the Duke, that if this Combination continued much longer, the Duke would infallibly fall under the weight of it: That his Successor might perhaps have less favourable Dispositions towards him, and that he had better sacrifice the Confessor to the Minister, than the Minister to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor. These Reasons appeared so well-grounded, that instead of inspiring other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52224:162"/>
into the King, he fortified those he had already, and this was enough to ruine the Father Confessor to all intents and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. They offered him, as they did before, the Bishoprick of <hi>Avila,</hi> in order to observe some sort of Decency in removing him; but he would not accept of it, and was content to contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e a Counsellor in the Supreme Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Inquisition, where they are always obliged to have a <hi>Dominican.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> perswaded the King to take in his Place Father <hi>Bayona,</hi> a <hi>Dominican,</hi> Professor of the University of <hi>Alcala:</hi> He had expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a great desire long before to see him placed in this Station, and had spoke of him ever since the Ministry of <hi>Don Iuan.</hi> That Prince, who had no kindness for him, would never admit him, saying, that he was a <hi>Frenchman.</hi> He was indeed a Native of <hi>Navar,</hi> but that was the <hi>Spanish Navar:</hi> He entred into this Function towards the end of <hi>Iuly.</hi> 'Tis very observable, that in the space of Five Years the King had Seven Confessors.</p>
            <p>This Alteration gave a fatal Blow to the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> and the Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster flatter'd himself, that she would now leave the Palace in a short time. Since People spoke no more of sending her away, and she was well informed of every thing that past, she was of opinion, that they could not find any Lady who was fit to succeed her in her Place, and that she should still continue in it: But the Queen finding all her Stock of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence spent and gone, by reason of all those
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52224:162"/>
occasions of Complaint she still persisted to give her, consented at last to receive the Dutchess <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> near her Person: But this was not till after she had endeavoured to obtain the Marchioness <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> and even the Dutchess <hi>de l' Infantado.</hi> She saw very well, that the Queen-Mother, and the Chief Minister would never give their Consent to it, and that it was indispensably necessary for her to take a <hi>Camar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ra Major</hi> from their hands, or else to rest contented with whom she now had. Every one gave the Dutchess <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> a good Character, to efface those ill impressions she had received against her. They took care to satisfie her, <q>That she was ingenious, and well-read in the World; that she was not ignorant of any of the Customs and Ceremonies of the Court; that she would do her all good Offices imaginable, both with the Queen-Mother, and the Duke <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Celi;</hi> that she had better make this Choice freely and voluntarily, than express any repugnance to a thing, which would unavoidably happen.</q> These Reasons had their Effect; the Queen accepted her, and receiv'd her very kindly when she saw her. She had concerted the matter with the Queen her Mother in Law, and the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi>: But this was not sufficient; the King's Consent remained still to be gained; and he was no less averse to the Dutchess <hi>de Albuquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> than to the Marchioness <hi>de Los Velez.</hi> The Prejudices he had received against this Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess were of the same Nature with those that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52224:163"/>
had been insinuated into the Queen. The Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> and the Secretary <hi>de Eguya,</hi> were the Persons who had thus malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pre possessed him against her; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than all the Authority of the Queen-Mother could make him resolve to admit her into the Palace. She spoke to him of it at first very softly and gently, but afterwards in a stronger and higher Tone. She told him, <q>That it was high time for him now to know People of himself, and not to judge of their Merits by what was whispered to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; that any Person might be so unhappy as to have secret Enemies, and that he was in a miserable condition to depend always upon those that possessed his Ear.</q> When he perceived the Queen-Mother to speak to him after this manner, he opposed the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness no longer, and so every thing was adjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon</hi> received Orders on the Twentieth of <hi>August,</hi> to acquaint the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> with the Queen's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and with the Reasons she pretended to Assign against her Conduct; that the best way she could take, would be to obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resistance, and to make it appear, as well as she could, that she retired of her own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
            <p>This Blow did not surprize her, since she was long ago prepared for it, by the private Whisperings that were spread about the Court. She answered <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon</hi> in a very few Words, and could not yet bring her self to believe, that the King had given his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52224:163"/>
to her Removal: So she was resolved to be satisfied of the truth of it from his own Mouth. She waited to speak with him, as he was just going to sit down to Dinner, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him for some time in a low Tone; at last, raising her Voice to a higher pitch, she demanded leave of him to retire. The King answered her aloud, <hi>I give you my Consent, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; you may retire as soon as you please.</hi> These few Words were like to discompose all the Constancy of the Dutchess; she changed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour several times, and advanced a few steps to speak in private with him again; but he turned his back towards her, and asked some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other of the Duke <hi>de Uzeda.</hi> She went hastily out of the Room, and retired to her Chamber to compose her self again; but the disorder she was in, would not permit her to appear before the Queen till Evening; and then she came to wait upon her at Supper, and at her going to Bed, with as unconcerned an Air, as if nothing had passed, though to counterfeit this, gave her a great deal of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because she was throughly netled. The Queen was informed by the King of what he had said to her; however, she had the Goodness not to discover any thing of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she had no Reason to be well pleased with her.</p>
            <p>Next Morning, the Dutchess, who had not gone to Bed, but had passed the whole Night walking in her Chamber, with the Dutchesses <hi>de Monteleon</hi> and <hi>de Hijar</hi> her two Daughters, only waited till the Queen was up, to go and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52224:164"/>
take her leave of her. Her Visage was more pale than ordinary, and her Eyes more red and fiery: She then approached the Queen, and without weeping, or shewing the least Concern, told her, She was very sorry that she had not served her so well as she wished. The Queen, who was a Person of wonderful Tenderness, could not forbear to seem some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what touched, and to relent a little; but as she was saying some obliging things to comfort her, the Dutchess interrupted her, and told her with an imperious Air, <q>That a Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> ought not to weep for so inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a matter; That the <hi>Camarera</hi> who came to succeed her in her Place, would acquit her self better of her Duty:</q> And so, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out saying a Word more, she took hold of the Queen's Hand, and making a shew of kissing it, immediately retired. When every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Court knew that she was to go away, they came to her Apartment, shedding Tears, either through Policy, Inclination or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. She did not seem to them to be in the least afflicted, and casting her Eyes on all sides, she said: <hi>I thank Heaven, this is a Place where I shall never set my Foot again; I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to taste the Sweets of Repose, and to find Tranquillity at my own House: I will go to</hi> Sicily, <hi>there I shall meet with no such Disgusts as I have found at</hi> Madrid. In saying these Words, she struck her Fist twice upon a little Table that stood near her, and taking a very pretty <hi>China</hi> Fan, she broke it in two, threw it upon the ground, and stampt it under her Feet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:52224:164"/>Thus she was sent away a few days after the Father Confessor; she that never thought of leaving the Court, as well by reason of the Ascendant she had got over the King, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was a thing without a President, till now, to remove the Queen's <hi>Camarera Major,</hi> unless it so happen'd, that she desired it her self. 'Tis easie to imagine the Grief she felt upon this occasion; however, to comfort her in some measure, it was resolved to bestow the Vice-Royship of <hi>Gallicia</hi> upon the Duke <hi>de Hijar,</hi> her Son in Law, and the Order of the Fleece upon the Duke <hi>de Monteleon,</hi> who had married her Grand Daughter. They were likewise willing still to continue to her the Honours and the Appointments belonging to her Place; but as soon as she was informed of the good intentions of the Court towards her, she proudly said, That she would refuse eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing they could offer her, and that <hi>this was to give her Incense, forsooth, and break her Nose with the Censer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As soon as she was departed from the Palace, the Dutchess <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> went thither to take possession of her Apartment; and though she had the Character of a Proud Haughty Woman, yet she did not make it appear, that she intended to Copy after the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi>'s Conduct: On the other hand, she entertained all People with a World of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and Civility, and expressed the greatest Affection imaginable for the Young Queen. This Lady was Widow to the Duke <hi>de Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque,</hi> who was Chief of the Family <hi>de la
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52224:165"/>
Cueva,</hi> and was Fifty Years old. I always saw her wear a little Bandore of Black Taffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, which reached down as low as her Eye-Brows, and bound her Forehead so hard, that her Eyes were swelled with it. She was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great Wit and Reading, and on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain days in the Week, held Assemblies at her House, where all the Learned were well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. She had only one Daughter, whom she married to the Youngest Brother of the late Duke <hi>de Albuquerque,</hi> to keep up the Name of the Family. She was passionately devoted to the Queen-Mother's Party, and People did not doubt, but that she would use the Young Queen very well. They were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confirmed in this Opinion, when they heard the King, a little after her admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Court, tell the Queen, That he would have her take her Pleasure more than she had hitherto done; That she must walk abroad, and ride on Horse-back; and that he was willing she might go to Bed late, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he might go to Bed at Eight a Clock, as his Custom was. Nay, he was so very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant a few days after, as to resolve not to go to Bed till Ten. This agreeable Alteration in his Conduct, gave the World occasion to conjecture, that the Dutchness <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> had engaged the Queen-Mother to speak to the King in favour of her; and that the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which the Queen had hitherto undergone, had been inspired into the King only by the means of the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:52224:165"/>The Marquess <hi>de Caralvo,</hi> who was of the Council of State, died about this time: He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eft prodigious Sums of ready Money behind him; and the Crown gained by his Death sixty seven thousand Crowns, which was yearly given him by way of Pension. The Admiral of <hi>Castile</hi>'s Lady died likewise, and as he had lived after a very indifferent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with her always, and was one of the greatest Admirers of the Fair Sex in all the World; so he did not over-much complain for his Wive's Death, nor was over-sorrowful to become a Widower. He had accustomed her to see near fifteen or sixteen of his Mistris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses live in his House with him, in very fine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, and all different; and he was sometimes so malicious, when she walked out in the Garden, as to look out of a Window with one of these Creatures standing by him, who let her Handkerchief, or a Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban drop, and the Admiral would call to his Wife to take it up, and bring it to the Person to whom it belonged; which she submitted to do, with a Respect and Patience that all the World admired.</p>
            <p>It happened to be said at Court, That a certain Man was found digging in the Ground very early in the Morning, over-against the <hi>Imperial Colledge.</hi> His Design was to take up some Money and Jewels, which a <hi>Iew,</hi> who had been burnt, and whose Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick he was, had buried, in that place. The King ordered him to bring what he had found there: It was all locked up in a little Iron
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52224:166"/>
Chest, which was full of Pieces of Gold of several sorts; and amongst the rest, there were Two Pictures, which I have seen, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than my Hand, and incircled round with Diamonds of a considerable Value: about them were Two little Scrowls of Parchment, with some Writing upon them; upon one, <hi>The Dutchess de Chevreuse;</hi> and on the other, <hi>The Dutchess de Montbazon.</hi> It was judged, that the <hi>Iews,</hi> who traffick much, and lend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney upon Pawns, came perhaps by these Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures after the same manner. They were perfectly finished, and the Ladies were both of admirable Beauty. The King said, that they ought to be sent to the <hi>Escurial.</hi>

            <p>I often had the happiness to see the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioness <hi>de Liche,</hi> who was one of the most beautiful and agreeable Persons at Court; her Husband was a Man of infinite Wit: He was much against his Will Ambassador at <hi>Rome;</hi> and when he was to go thither, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured all the ways in the World to break off his Voyage. He tarried a long time upon the Coasts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and was unwilling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, pretending that he was ill, and praying them to send another in his room, to whom he offered to give all his Equipage, as a free Gift, or else to trust him for it, at his choice: But the Court was afraid of the Vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Genius, and he was known to be a Man of Enterprise: For this Reason it was thought convenient to keep him at a distance and so they sent him fresh Orders to depart, and go to <hi>Rome.</hi> He appeared there with a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52224:166"/>
great Magnificence, and supported the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Ministry very well. When the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> was made Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he writ several Letters to him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd the Interest of all his Family to get himself re-called. It was positively denied him, because he was feared now more than ever; And it was apprehended, in case he returned home, that he would unite himself with his Brother the Count <hi>de Monterei.</hi> To these Reasons of State the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> joyned some private ones, that purely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected his own proper Interest: for it was an easie matter to take Advantage of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Marquess <hi>de Liche,</hi> to have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Law-Suit determined, which was depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them.</p>
            <p>The Marquess being informed of what had happened, and despairing ever to surmount those Obstacles which the Duke laid in his way, thought the surest Expedient to get himself re-called home, would be to disgust the Pope upon all occasions; And herein he acquitted himself so dexterously, and did eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to displease the Pope after so disobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a manner, that his Holiness sent the King Word, That unless he would re-call the Marquess <hi>de Liche,</hi> he must resolve to leave <hi>Rome</hi>; intreating him to send another Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador in his Place, since he had never seen so disagreeable a one as this in all his Life: But they answered him, That one of the Reasons which inclined them to continue him still at <hi>Rome,</hi> was, because his Holiness had declared.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52224:167"/>
That he would grant the Rights of the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chises, and the Immunities of their Quarter, only to those Ambassadors who were then resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in <hi>Rome,</hi> and that those who were to be sent in their room for the time to come, should no more enjoy them.</p>
            <p>The Pope perceiving that he tormented himself in vain, and that if he, for his part, had good Reasons to demand the re-calling of the Marquess <hi>de Liche,</hi> the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had also theirs to deny it, did not renew his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities any more: but being resolved to do all the ill Offices he could to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, who had on purpose disobliged him, as far as lay in his power, he found an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to quit Scores with him; and he took his Advantage of it with pleasure. It was about a Dispensation, which the Marquess <hi>de Liche</hi> demanded of him, in favour of <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon,</hi> his Uncle, to marry <hi>Donna Catalina de la Cerda,</hi> Daughter to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This young Lady was Niece to <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon,</hi> who was Brother to the Duke <hi>de Cardonne,</hi> and to the Cardinal of <hi>Arragon;</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Cardonne</hi> was Father to the Dutchess <hi>de Medina Celi</hi>: so that there was an absolute necessity for a Dispensation. The Marquess was intrusted with the procuring of it by his Uncle, who writ him word, That he should die contentedly, if he could but leave an Heir of his Name and Estate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him; That after he had been twice married, without getting any Children, he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52224:167"/>
hoped his Third Match would prove more Fortunate to him; and therefore he desired him, not to lose a moment to obtain of the Pope what he desired. The Ambassador o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing to compass it, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a great deal of Trouble and Pains to no purpose; they still put him off, and sent him sometimes to one, and sometimes to another Cardinal. In fine, after having made him dance Attendance long enough, till he had lost all manner of Patience, they bluntly told him, that they could by no means grant what he demanded, and that the Pope made a Scruple of giving a Dispensation to a Man, who was Seventy Years old, to marry his Niece, who was not yet Sixteen. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador sensibly resented this Refusal, and sent speedy notice of it to <hi>Don Pedro de Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>: but what gave him a new occasion to be more displeased, was to hear, That at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment, when <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was reading his Letter at <hi>Madrid,</hi> the <hi>Nuncio</hi> brought him a Dispensation that was expedited <hi>gratis,</hi> and told him, That he had received it much sooner, if the Marquess <hi>de Liche</hi> had not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the matter. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> sent his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew word of all these Circumstances, who was exceedingly vexed at it. The Marriage was concluded on the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> without any Ceremony, at the House of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> where Cardinal <hi>Portocarero</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Spanish</hi> Officers at <hi>Naples</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd to reassume the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dress: 'Twas
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52224:168"/>
believed that the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> would soon imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them; but seeing they did it not in the least, an Ordinance was published, by Sound of Trumpet, at the beginning of <hi>August,</hi> commanding all the Officers of Justice to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel themselves after the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fashion. This Conduct had never been used towards them, had it not been to let them see how great a Heart-burning it was to them, to behold them drest after the <hi>French</hi> way. The Troops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued still to make Complaints, because it was a long time since they had been paid off: They spoke several times to the Vice-Roy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, who sent them to the Secretary of War, and he to the Cash-Keeper, or Pay-Master to the Army. He answered them, That the Military Funds were clearly exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, and that he was not in a Condition to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them. This makes it sufficiently appear, That the extream Misery, which indeed op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the whole <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, was not only perceived at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being fully resolved to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as far as in him lay, the Ease and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his People, and thinking himself obliged to the Performance of it, by those things which Father <hi>Francis de Relux</hi> had said to him, at the time when he was his Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, acquainted the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> with his Designs to establish a particular Council, where all manner of Affairs should be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and it should be composed of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable of <hi>Castile,</hi> the Marquess <hi>de Los Balba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zez,</hi> the Inquisitor General, and <hi>Don Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52224:168"/>
Navarra.</hi> The Chief Minister was to be the Head of it, but the King reserved to himself the last Resolutions of things, and all Favours, and Disposals of Places. The Duke approved at first of the King's Project, but after he had maturely deliberated upon it, he went to the King on purpose to disswade him from it, out of an Assurance, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State would be Jealous of it, which was composed of some of the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Persons in the Kingdom; that this would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion a vexatious difference between them, and rather hinder the Success and Advancement of Affairs, than promote them. <hi>Don Melchior Navarra,</hi> Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all the Appointments and Profits, which the Presidents of that Council were formerly used to enjoy.</p>
            <p>It was not at all questioned, but that the Queen-Mother advanced the Dutchess <hi>de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque</hi> to the Place where now she was to be seen; and People were as fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it was she who got the Prince <hi>de Parma</hi> to be sent into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to recompence the great Zeal he had always expressed in her Service. But the Council of State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be Alarmed at the great Power of this Princess. <hi>What is the matter?</hi> would they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually say one to another, <hi>Are we going to have a new Regency, and is the King resolved to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Wardship again?</hi> What gave them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test occasion to talk after this manner, was as follows: The Council having, according to the Custom, named Three Subjects for the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52224:169"/>
Vice-Royship of <hi>Peru,</hi> out of which number the King generally chuses one; his Majesty, without having any regard to it, named <hi>Don Melchior Navarra,</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o had advanced his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by the means of the Queen-Mother, and was absolutely devoted to her. He was born in <hi>Arragon,</hi> of an obscure Family, and at first was an Advocate, and afterwards a Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor at <hi>Naples</hi>; Being come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> he there became Fiscal to the Council of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> and had the good Fortune to please the Queen-Mother, who was then Regent. She made him Vice Chancellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> which is one of the most considerable Places, out of pure Spight to the Council of State, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed her, so that she could not bestow this Office upon the Prince <hi>de Stillano.</hi> The <hi>Iun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto</hi> of the Government refusing to admit him, she put the other in his Place, that she might always have one of her own Creatures in that <hi>Iuncto</hi>; and besides this, might always be informed for the time to come, of what was transacted there.</p>
            <p>The Queen had no sooner given this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of her Affection to <hi>Don Melchior,</hi> but every body stood surprized to see a Man of so mean a Birth, advanced to so high a Post; but when they knew him better, they found him to be a Person of great Merit, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Probity. <hi>Don Iuan</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> who was mightily displeased at his Conduct, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and he came not back to Court till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of that Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:52224:169"/>The Queen-Mother being desirous to make him compleatly happy, got the Vice Royship of <hi>Peru</hi> for him, which is a very Advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Post; for in less than five Years time a Man may very well heap up Three Millions by it, without wronging either his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or his Neighbour. Just at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, they charged him with very rigorous Orders against the Governours of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who had made an ill use of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. This Custom has been taken up of a long time; the Poor and Unfortunate only are made Examples, but the rest make a shift to escape well enough, by giving a good round Sum of Money, which perhaps they have extorted from other People. But as it always happens, that one Man's good Fortune proves an Obstacle to that of another, the Marquess <hi>de Santa Crux</hi> died of Grief, because he mist this Place. He had been General of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Gallies, and was a Man of Birth and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but so extreamly poor, that he saw nothing else could set him up again, but the Vice-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Peru.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He did not question but that they would consider him for the Services of his Ancestors, and remember that the Count <hi>de Chinchon,</hi> his Father, who had been Counsellor of State, was always Faithful to the Crown, and that they would examine his own Personal Merit. He flattered himself, that all these Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would infallibly procure him the Vice-Royship of <hi>Peru.</hi> He came on purpose to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to solicite for it; but when he saw
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52224:170"/>
               <hi>Don Melchior Navarra</hi> preferred before him, he could not master his Grief, and died within few days after. His Death was attended by that of one of the dearest Persons in the World to him, <hi>Donna Antonia de la Cerda,</hi> Daughter to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and Wife to the Son of the Marquess <hi>de Villa Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riquez.</hi> She was very young, and yet extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador of the Estates of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Provinces, had Audience of the King, on the Twentieth of <hi>August:</hi> He demanded of him the Payment of several Millions that were due from the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty of <hi>Holland,</hi> ever since the Year 1675. The King was only pleased to say, <hi>Veremos,</hi> and that Evening having sent for the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> to come to him, <hi>I have never,</hi> says he, <hi>seen so many Debts, and so little Money to pay them; If this holds, I will give no more Audience to those to whom I am indebted.</hi> The Duke told him, He hoped that in a short time things would be in a better Condition, and that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were rich enough to stay a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for their Money.</p>
            <p>People talked very strangely at <hi>Madrid,</hi> of the King's recalling the Duke <hi>de Veraguas,</hi> who was Vice-Roy of <hi>Valentia.</hi> This little King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is, as it were, annexed to that of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> and is a place where there never fail to be abundance of Murderers, Robbers and Cut-Throats. The malignant influence that reigns here, makes the Men naturally so bad, that when there is any ill Action to be done,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52224:170"/>
they make use of the <hi>Bandoleros,</hi> who are a sort of <hi>Banditti,</hi> divided into several Factions, and have each of them their Chief, who are generally seditious Persons, capable of all the Villanies in the World. An Apostatized Monk took shelter amongst them, and they found him to be so resolute and hardened a Fellow, that they chose him for their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but as it happened, the very moment he came to commit an Assassinate, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with his Sword in his Hand. He could not deny so palpable a Crime, and the Vice-Roy was advised to execute speedy Justice upon him. The Vice-Roy was well enough satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ought to serve him so; but what gave him some trouble, was this, that having to deal with a Religious, he thought, that he ought to use more Formality with him. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Reason likewise stopt him a little; for by the Laws of <hi>Valentia,</hi> some days are allotted to Criminals after they are condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Execution. He ordered Four Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of different Orders to meet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted them upon these Two Heads: Two of them were of opinion, that he might take Cognizance of this matter with the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's Consent: The Two others maintained, That although the Laws of the Countrey al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low some time to a Guilty Person, and that this was a Monk belonging to the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Jurisdiction; yet for all that, the King's Service demanded a speedy and severe Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that the Actions of this Man were so abominably odious, that he deserved to have
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52224:171"/>
no Respect show'n him. The Duke <hi>de Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guas</hi> was of their Opinion, and ordered him to be hanged immediately. The Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks demanded him before Execution; the Archbishop supported them by his Authority, and when he knew it was to no purpose, his Official published an Interdict. The People immediately made an Insurrection, and the Vice-Roy was obliged to shut himself up in his Palace; but being besieged on every side, and apprehending some danger from the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Rabble, he escaped out of the City well Accompanied. The Archbishop lost no time to inform the Court of what had happened; the Duke too sent thither as soon, and each of them alledged their Reasons. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the King ordered a <hi>Iuncto</hi> to sit, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of his own Confessor, a Jesuit, and a Dominican. It happened well for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop that he was of the same Order with this last, and had been General of his Order; He wanted no more to gain the Cause; the Duke <hi>de Veraguas</hi> was condemned with one Consent, and a Sum of Money was remitted to him, with Orders to come within Twenty Leagues of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and there to wait the King's farther Pleasure. On the Twenty Sixth of <hi>August</hi> the Count <hi>de Aquilar</hi> was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to succeed him in his Place, and within 24 Hours after he departed, to go and take poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52224:171"/>
Navas,</hi> Vice Roy of <hi>Sicily,</hi> surprized People no less. He merely, for a Humour, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Archbishop of <hi>Palermo,</hi> so as to make him leave the City: The King being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Proceedings, was not only content to Reprimand the Vice-Roy for it, but order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Archbishop should receive parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Satisfaction from him. He wrote a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obliging Letter to this Prelate, wherein he acquainted him how much he was concerned at the Affronts he had received, and sent it to the Marquess <hi>de Navas,</hi> with Orders to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it to the Archbishop with his own Hands. The Vice-Roy received it, and kept it by him; but they being informed of it at Court, a fresh Injunction was sent him: He obey'd this no better than the former. This Stiffness and Contumacy of his, perfectly wearied the Council, without drawing the least inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience upon him; so that they no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to deliver the Letter to the Archbishop. It is very certain, that another Man would not have had this Indulgence show'n him; but the Vice-Roy being, it seems, obliged to marry his Son to one of the Daughters of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> this is one Reason why he was sure to meet with good Quarter, as long as the Duke continued in Favour. Nevertheless, the Marquess <hi>de Louvignies,</hi> who was made Governour of <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina,</hi> was no sooner arrived there, but he was offended to see the Fortifications and Garrison in so ill a Condition. He plainly told the Marquess <hi>de Las Navas,</hi> That he could not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52224:172"/>
dispence with himself from giving the Court an Account of these matters. He was as good as his Word, and the Vice-Roy received a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Check for his Negligence.</p>
            <p>They had a new occasion to be displeased at <hi>Madrid,</hi> when they received Advices of what happened at <hi>Naples,</hi> on the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember:</hi> The Vice-Roy passing through the <hi>Toledo-Street,</hi> to go to Visit the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nuns, was stopt by an Hundred Troopers, all arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and on Horse-back, who Audaciously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, either to pay them off, or else to dismiss them.</p>
            <p>So resolute an Action as this was, did not a little surprize him: He promised to do every thing they desired of him, and returned back again to the Palace very suddenly. As soon as he believed himself to be safe, he ordered Six Souldiers to be sent to Prison, and their Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to come on speedily. He reformed all the Cavalry, together with the Captains, and the other Officers, as well as the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General. This Body of Horse consisted of Seven Troops, and had been kept up above Fifty Years. He pretended, That he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders from <hi>Madrid</hi> to reform them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner; but the real Truth is, he was not in a condition to pay them. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hereupon was exceedingly grieved, to behold the Misery to which all his Kingdoms were reduced.</p>
            <p>But all this evil News was ballanced, when they knew that the Plague was intirely ceas'd in <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> and that the Chief Magistrate
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52224:172"/>
of <hi>Cales</hi> finding the Port of St. <hi>Mary</hi> free from the Infection, had taken off the Prohibition of Commerce. After this, they immediately begun to load the Gallions. On the Fifth of <hi>September</hi> there were great rejoicings at Court, because it was the Birth-day of his Most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Majesty: A Comedy was Acted there, and all the Ambassadors and Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> were present at it. The Queen appeared so covered with Jewels, that her Diamonds cast a greater Light than six large Flambeaux, as big as Torches did, that were lighted in the Great Hall. A few days after this, the King and the Two Queens went solemnly to Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, where the Anniversary of <hi>Philip</hi> IV. was celebrated with great Ceremonies. The Queen being returned to the Palace, found a Sealed Letter in her Pocket, having the same Superscription with that which she formerly received; and seeing written on the out-side, <hi>For the Queen alone,</hi> she would not open it, and almost distracted her self in thinking what Person it was, that could find the means to come so nigh her, as to slip this Letter into her Pocket. Towards Evening she went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the King to the Queen-Mother's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, to make her the usual Complements of Condolance, upon the Death of the late King her Husband. The Dutchess <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> told the King, That she had received a Letter from <hi>Ispaham,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Persia,</hi> which had great Curiosities in it. The King replied, That he was desirous to hear it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:52224:173"/>All the Company being gone out of the Room, she placed her self near him to read it. The Queen took her Advantage of this Opportunity, and told the Queen-Mother, That she had a great desire to see a Picture of <hi>Titian,</hi> which she had lately bought. As she said these Words, she advanced towards the great Closet of the Queen-Mother, whither she fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her. When they had entred into it, the Young Queen gave her the Letter, which she had found in her Pocket, and desired her to keep it, or burn it, as she thought most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. <hi>I don't know,</hi> says she, <hi>but it may come from the Dutchess</hi> de Terra Nova; <hi>but she shall be clearly mistaken in her Project.</hi> The Queen-Mother told her, That she had best open the Letter, to see what was contained in it. <hi>Ah, Madam,</hi> replied the Queen, <hi>I would never, by my good Will, see any such Letters.</hi> The Queen-Mother admired the prudent Conduct of this Young Princess, and bid her not disquiet her self about the matter; for she would take care to keep it sealed by her; And some time after she recounted this Adventure to the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>de M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Queen, and the Queen-Mother did not tarry long together, but came to find the King, who told them, That the Dutchess <hi>de
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52224:173"/>
Medina Celi</hi> had read a Letter to him, wherein was contained a very Tragical surprising Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and that they would by no means think their time lost to hear it. The Dutchess immediately read the Letter; it was dated from <hi>Ispahan,</hi> the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1680. and gave an Account, how, That on the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the same Year, the City of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulipatan,</hi> which is the greatest Scale of Trade in the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda,</hi> had been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd by the Sea, and by extraordinary Rains, accompanied with a furious Hurricane; That above Twenty five thousand Persons were drowned there, and that the Loss of the Goods and Merchandize amounted to Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Millions; That it had Rained Blood for the space of Two Hours, in the Village of <hi>Sobou,</hi> near <hi>Deli,</hi> where the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> keeps his Residence; and that part of the City of <hi>Sougean,</hi> near <hi>Daera,</hi> had been over-whelmed by an Earthquake: That the <hi>Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Princess haughtily replied, That she would never sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

The King scorned the Proposal, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as a Revolted Subject, whom he knew well enough how to chastise. When the other saw that gentle Methods signified nothing, he presently fell a Ravaging the Countrey of <hi>Visiapour,</hi> from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept six or seven Places upon the Coasts; so that his Conquests extended as far as <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He always carried his Fair Prisoner along with him, hoping to gain her by his Respect and Complaisance; but having had one day a very long Conversation with her upon this Topick, wherein she declared, That all the Injuries either she, or those of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, suffered at his Hands, only served to provoke her the more, and that she would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver love any one but <hi>Cercan Loudi:</hi> the Love of <hi>Sevagi</hi> was in a moment turned into Fury, and he had the Cruelty to cause a Scaffold to be erected for her, where with his own Hands he cut off the Head of the young Princess <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka,</hi> and her Lover.</p>
            <p>The Queen-Mother having a great kindness for the Marchioness <hi>de Grana,</hi> received two of her Daughters, who were very lovely and well shaped, into the number of her Ladies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52224:175"/>A short time after, the King, the Two Queens, and all the Court, departed for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranjuez</hi>; but the House not being large enough to lodge half the Officers and Ladies, they came back every Night, and lay near it. The Duke <hi>de Uzeda,</hi> the Count <hi>de Altamire,</hi> and the Two Sons of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves like Muleteers, with Bonnets, after the <hi>English</hi> Fashion pulled over their Heads to hide them; and being drest after this Fashion, they went every day on Foot by the Boot of the Coach of the Queen's Maids of Honour, to Court their Mistresses, as the Custom is there.</p>
            <p>Although the King had Prohibited all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in General, and Married People in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <hi>Los Galanteos de Palacio,</hi> as they call it, at <hi>Madrid</hi>; yet he was not able to hinder it. It has been a thing established time out of mind amongst them, to entertain the Ladies of the Court, with their Gallantry, although they have not the least design to marry them: And they wait upon them with as much Assiduity as if they were already betrothed to them. But what is the strangest, as well as the least pardonable thing of all, is, that they ruine themselves by it: I have seen married men, nay, even those that were Grandfathers, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally taken up in an Amour with one of the Ladies of the Court. The Women, whose Husbands are led away with these Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Fancies, are extreamly disgusted at it; and this often occasions horrid Disorders in their Families; but all that these Cavaliers
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52224:175"/>
pretend to reap by their Passion, is only, that their Mistresses will suffer them to come and stop under their Windows. Here they sit in the back part of their Coaches, and entertain them by their Fingers, and the Ladies answer them after the same manner, without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, but only upon days of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for at that time they have the liberty to Accost them before all the World. But what is very surprising, and was never yet practised any where else, the Ladies of Honour belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Queen, receive Jewels, Apparel, and considerable Sums of Money from their Gallants. The Dukes <hi>de Montalte,</hi> and <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Sidonia,</hi> having no Office to oblige them to follow the Court to <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> sent their Stewards, Cooks, and other Servants, with Gold and Silver Plate, to carry Magnificent Repasts to their Mistresses, as long as they staid at <hi>Aranjuez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Diversion there is but little, because the greatest pleasure one can take, is to walk along the sides of the River <hi>Tagus,</hi> which wash the Banks of the finest Walks in the World; but the Rains were so great, that no body could stir out. When there was the least fair Weather, the Queen rode on Horse-back with all her Ladies, but one of them had the Mischance to be carried away by her Horse, and received so much hurt by her Fall, that she died within three days after. This ill Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent troubled the King exceedingly, so that by his good Will, he would not suffer the Queen to ride; When he saw her not, he would still

be crying, <hi>Let some body go to see how my Queeen does, and bring me word, whether she is fallen off her Horse.</hi> The King was informed at <hi>Aranju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ez,</hi> that Two <hi>Portugues<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The King had a mighty desire when he parted from <hi>Madrid,</hi> to go immediately to the <hi>Escurial,</hi> but he could not fully resolve to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Queen along with him thither, till he had staid some time at some of the other Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses belonging to the Kings of <hi>Spain.</hi> He had been told, That it was looked upon to be an ill Omen to go first to the place where the Royal Tombs are; and since the Queen had as yet been only at <hi>Buen Retiro, à la Casa del Campo,</hi> at <hi>Pardo,</hi> and <hi>Zarzuela,</hi> which are so near <hi>Madrid,</hi> that she just rested her self there a few hours after she came from hunting, He was resolved to begin with <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> to avert and frustrate those evil Presages: Therefore he ordered every thing to be in readiness for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52224:176"/>
his Journey, by the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> which is one of the finest Months of the Year in <hi>Spain;</hi> but the Ministers not finding Money enough in the Treasury to defray the Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Progress, dexterously endeavoured to put it by, though in all appearance they seem'd to desire it as much as the King did, and daily ordered Mules to be got ready to carry the Baggage. They pretended the Ways were dangerous and bad, and at last, that the great Rains had corrupted the Air. Nay, they sent for some Physicians, with whom they had been practising, to confirm all they said. Notwithstanding these Reasons, the King still persisted in his Resolution to go to <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> and did not know till the very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening before he was to depart, that he could not go. He was the only Person that was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it; for the Ministers had acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Friends with it above Twelve Days before, and all the City was informed, that the King was to stay at <hi>Madrid</hi> still. The Queen was not a little displeased at these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; she spoke to the King about it, and told him, that the Ministers might now very well forbear to use them any longer like Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; that if there had been any important Reasons why they should not go to <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> they ought to have given them timely notice of it; but to put them off, and, speaking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, to fool them after this insufferable rate, was never to be endured. The King was vexed, and told the Queen, That this should be the last time he would suffer such things at
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52224:177"/>
their hands, and that they should direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the future only by his Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. This Discourse was over-heard by some of the Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber, who went presently to acquaint the Duke <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Celi</hi> with it, to make their Court by this means. He was terribly disheartned, and feared least the Queen, who was charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and witty, might come to get a greater Ascendant over the King's Inclinations than he desired; and therefore that he might not displease the King any more, used all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable diligence to provide a Fund sufficient to bear the Expences of going to <hi>Aranjuez</hi> and the <hi>Escurial.</hi> Till this very moment he had resolved to break off these Two Journeys; but he apprehended a great deal of danger from the Queen's dissatisfaction; and so to get a Sum necessary for the occasion, he sold Two Offices of the <hi>Contador Major</hi> for Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five thousand Crowns, and received Forty more for a Government in the <hi>Indies.</hi> He took Fifty thousand Crowns out of an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand, that were to be laid out in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipping of the Gallions. He made use of the Money gathered for Custom, that was to have paid off the the Rights of the Franchises, and the Revenues of the Town-Hall: In a word, every thing was got ready by that time the Court came back from <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> for them to go to the <hi>Escurial.</hi> However, the King was not able to go as soon as he desired, by reason that the ill Weather increased; ever since the beginning of <hi>September</hi> never a day passed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52224:177"/>
without violent Tempests, accompanied by dreadful Claps of Thunder: The Lightning struck abundance of Persons in several Places, and the Hail fell so thick, and in such prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quantities in the Forrest of the <hi>Pardo,</hi> which is an House of pleasure belonging to the King, that it broke the Branches of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Trees, and killed so many Birds and Wild Fowl, that both the Fields and the River of <hi>Mancanarez,</hi> were covered with them, and it was the most surprising sight in the World to behold; the Ancient Bridge <hi>de Aranda de Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> was carried away by the Waters of that River, and the <hi>Tagus</hi> over-flow'd its Banks with that Impetuosity, that it did an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mischief to the pleasant Walks at <hi>Aranju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ez.</hi> So many Accidents, of which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived fresh News daily, troubled the Court exceedingly; for there was scarce a place in <hi>Spain</hi> exempt from these continual Tempests: One of them happened on the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> in so out-ragious a manner, that the Gardens of the Countess <hi>de Ognate,</hi> which are the finest in <hi>Madrid,</hi> were overflown in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Water entred into the lower Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her House, where she kept her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest <hi>Italian</hi> Paintings, and her richest Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, and all was intirely spoiled by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation.

The Water of the <hi>Mancanarez</hi> swelled exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and spread it self on all sides.

In the mean time some People got hold by the Traces, and so drew out the Coach by meer Strength. By this means the Mules got out of the Water; but their Majesties could not reach the Palace, and being affrighted at the great danger they had just escaped, were obliged to go to <hi>Buen-Retiro,</hi> where they tarried till mid-night, and waited for the Waters to fall.</p>

The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>Castile,</hi> who was Master of the Horse, did not arrive there till Fourteen Days after the King: he was naturally so lazy, even when he was obliged to make his Court, that he could not resolve in a less time to go to the <hi>Escurial.</hi>

            <p>All the Ladies of the Court, and Six Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Bed-Chamber, Accompanied the Queen; The Marquess <hi>de Villa Maina,</hi> Chief Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, and the Marquess <hi>de Astorgas,</hi> Grand Master of the Houshold, went along with her. As for the Duke <hi>de Ossone,</hi> who was Master of the Horse to her, he tarried at <hi>Madrid,</hi> upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a New Disgust he had received at Court. The King was willing that the Queen should ride on Horse-back, to take a few turns in the Walks of the Meadows, and to meet him as he came from hunting. She had Four Fits of an Ague, but the following ones were so gentle, that she was able to get up a few days after, and divert her self, as she had used to do ever since her Arrival to the <hi>Escurial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:52224:179"/>The King, who was altogether taken up with the Pleasures of hunting, pursued the Sport from Sun rising till Night. One day he ordered a Chase to be prepared after the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> manner; they had Toils, which inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a great quantity of Ground, and here with their Guns they killed above two hundred Bucks or Does. The Queen was at first desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be there, but being informed after what manner they used these poor Creatures, she imagined that such a sight would rather give her occasion to employ her Pity, than afford her any Pleasure. The King in all his Chases generally took no more with him than the first Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, and the Great Forrester; he loved to find himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in vast Solitudes, and sometimes it was a long while before they could find him. When he hunted after the <hi>German</hi> manner, he would be accompanied by the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and the Marquess <hi>de Grana.</hi> At his return, the Chief Minister following the King to the Queen's Apartment, found that her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty did not cast her Eyes upon him, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately penetrated into the Reason of this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration he found in the Queen's Behaviour; for to say the truth, she was displeased with him for disswading his Majesty to expedite a Parent for a Government in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which he had granted to her: But when the Duke knew it, he told the King, That the Queen begged this Grace of him, at the intreaty of one of the Women of her Bed-Chamber, who was a <hi>French</hi> Woman, who would get
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52224:180"/>
considerably by it, when in the mean time twelve thousand Pistols were offered for it. The King thought it was the best way to take this Sum, and after this would not hear the least Word of dispatching the Patent, as he had promised.</p>
            <p>But what provoked the Queen infinitely more, was the Conduct he had used in her Absence towards the Constable <hi>Colonna</hi>'s La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The Dutchess <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had passed her Word to the Queen, as in her Husband's Name, That during the stay her Majesty made at the <hi>Escurial,</hi> nothing should be done to the prejudice of this Lady. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these Assurances, upon which she depended, she was carried away from <hi>Madrid,</hi> and by an Order from the King, confined to the Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le of <hi>Segovia.</hi> To begin this Story from its Original, the Reader is to know, that this Lady was Niece to the late Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine:</hi> She brought a very considerable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with her at her Marriage; and perhaps the Family of the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s had sunk very low without this seasonable Relief. After she had passed the happiest and most pleasant part of her Life at <hi>Rome,</hi> where she always appeared in great Pomp and Splendor, having the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to live after the <hi>French</hi> Fashion, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all Appearances, seeming to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with her Fortune: She withdrew all on the sudden, without so much as knowing the Reason of it her self, through the ill Counsels of some Persons, who hazarded not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52224:180"/>
a little upon her Account, in making her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard every thing on her side: So that she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted privately with the Dutchess of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> her Sister. They had disguised themselves so well, that none knew them when they took Shipping: And thus they arrived safely in <hi>France.</hi> The Constable <hi>Colonna</hi>'s Lady hoped to find here a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> against her Husband, and some vain flattering Idea's, that were not as yet perfectly extinguished in her Heart, served to perswade her, that she should be well received at Court; but so far was she from meeting any Encouragement to make her Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance there, that she was prohibited by the King to come there. I have heard her say, That she resented this Treatment with so sensible a Grief, that she was like to have died of it. After this she went to <hi>Turin,</hi> where she made a short stay, and the uneasiness of her Mind led her at last to <hi>Flanders.</hi> There she happened to find the Marquess <hi>de Borgomaine,</hi> of the House of <hi>Este,</hi> in whom she reposed an intire Confidence, without remembring that he was rather a Friend to her Husband than to her self. He flattered her in all her Projects, in order to amuse her, and to gain time till he might receive Advice from the Constable, how to dispose of her; for he had sent him a Letter by a Courier for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to inform him, that his Wife was at <hi>Brus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi>; and in Answer to it, the Constable ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desired him to Seize and Apprehend her. He acquitted himself immediately of his Commission, and carried her to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52224:181"/>
from whence she was not to depart, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less she would consent to be Shipt for <hi>Spain,</hi> as they desired her. When she was at <hi>Madrid</hi> she delay'd, upon several Pretences, to take the Religious Habit upon her; she loved her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and was desirous still to enjoy it: But The Constable being informed of her Arrival, sent <hi>Don Fernand de Colonna,</hi> his Natural Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with Letters to the King, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, wherein he beseech'd them, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by fair means, or Violence they would oblige his Lady to enter into a Convent. This Necessity seemed very hard to her; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less she submitted to it, and retired to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery <hi>de Santo Domingo el Real,</hi> upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That if she happened to come out of it, she would consent that the King should restore her to her Husband. She continued there a long time, and sometimes in an Evening she escaped out with one of her Women, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten went to walk on Foot in a White Mantle in the <hi>Prado,</hi> where she met with several plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Adventures, because most of the Women that come there are Ladies-Adventurers; and some Ladies of the best Quality at Court, take a mighty pleasure when they can go thither, and are not known.</p>
            <p>The Constable <hi>Colonna</hi> being come to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> in his way to <hi>Arragon,</hi> whereof he was Vice-Roy, went every day to entertain her at this Grate, and I have seen him show those Gallantries to her, which a Lover may show to his Mistress. He departed in a very good understanding with her; but when the Queen
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52224:181"/>
made her Entry, she having a great desire to behold her Majesty, did not imagine they would hold her so strictly to the Word she had given the King, That in case she ever quitted the place of her Confinement, he should deliver her into her Husband's Hands: So without any more a-do, she went to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioness <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> her Sister in Law, who received her very kindly, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess made her an Entertainment that might have deceived a Person of less Faith than her self. Seeing these fair Appearances she thought no more of returning to <hi>Santo Domingo,</hi> but staid with the Marchioness <hi>de Los Balbazez.</hi> All this while he secretly endeavoured to get an Order from the King, and as soon as he had procured it, carried her to a Convent within Four Leagues of <hi>Madrid.</hi> So severe a Procedure afflicted her as much as it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Woman to be afflicted. She wrote to the Queen to demand her Protection; and being informed, that the Constable was come back from <hi>Arragon,</hi> with his Sons, she obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a permission of the King to go into some Monastery or other at <hi>Madrid.</hi> But whether it were, that she was not content to be there, or that she had some other Views in her Head, she made her escape, and went strait to her Husband's House: She lived in one half of it, made her Court very regularly to the Queen, visited abundance of Ladies, and diverted her self very well.</p>
            <p>The Constable left her an intire Liberty to do what she pleased; but when he was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52224:182"/>
to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> he talked of carrying his Lady along with him thither. She was mightily Alarmed at it, and declared, that she would not go. The Reason was, because she had got her Nativity to be Calculated, and it was told her, That if she had another Child, she should die. This Prediction was so fresh in her imagination, that she would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse to return to her old Place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. The King was urgent with her to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain her meaning; She sent him Word back again, That she humbly requested him to grant her his Protection, in the design she had to throw her self into a Convent.</p>
            <p>The King judged it convenient, That the Inquisitor General, <hi>Don Melchior Navarra,</hi> and his Confessor, should meet to determine this difference between the Constable and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The Marquess <hi>de Los Balbazez</hi> sollicited so powerfully, that the <hi>Iuncto</hi> concluded to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end her to the Castle of <hi>Segovia.</hi> This he so passionately desired, that all the last Year he was perpetually troubling his Brain, how to do her some ill Office. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable of <hi>Castile,</hi> and the Admiral, set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves all they could to oppose it; and they were not able to obtain an Order for it.</p>
            <p>They had never obtained one, if the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had not been an Enemy to the Constable's Lady. She being informed of what had past against her, and what Reasons she had to apprehend some Mischief from her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, cast her self at the Queen's Feet, and conjured her, with Tears in her Eyes, not to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52224:182"/>
abandon her in this distress, but to engage the Chief Minister to pass his Word, that nothing should be attempted against her as long as the Court was at the <hi>Escurial.</hi> The Queen inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in this Affair, as I have already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but notwithstanding all this Precaution, within Eight Days after her departure, a Counsellor of the Council Royal, with his Officers, Accompanied by the Constable <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna,</hi> and the Marquess <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> who performed the Office of Bailiffs, being all Armed, as if they had been going to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a Ring-Leader of Robbers, rather than an unfortunate Lady, who was not capable of making the least Resistance, went about E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven a Clock at Night to break open the Doors of her Apartment, although it was within her Husband's House. She was in her Chamber, when immediately an <hi>Alcalde</hi> of the Court pretended to tie her Arms with a Cord: Seeing her self used after so ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a manner, she took up a little Knife, which lay accidentally upon the Table; and as she defended her self, gave him a cut in the Hand. This Resistance made the rest of the Company fall upon her with that barbarous Fury, that they dragged the poor Lady, half naked, as she was, by the Hairs of her Head, and so they forced her away, like one of the most miserable of her Sex. She was condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted after this manner all Night long to the Castle of <hi>Segovia,</hi> without expressing the least consideration either for her Birth or Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although she had given them no occasion
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52224:183"/>
to treat her thus; for in fine, she was actually at that time in her Husband's House, and her only Crime was, her refusing to return to <hi>Rome</hi> with the Constable, although she offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go into a Convent, without having the liberty ever to leave it. Most Persons pitied her sorrowful Condition, and took it ill that they broke their Promise to the Queen, and that they durst employ the King's Name, only to satisfie the Malice and Animosity of the Marquess <hi>de Los Balbazez.</hi> It was for his sake principally that they used this Persecution to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Constable's Lady; for her Husband was one of the best Conditioned Men in the World: He loved her, and as he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given her his consent to stay several Years in a Religious House; so without question he had not now opposed the Conditions she desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if it had not been for the Marquess <hi>de Los Balbazez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alone managed this Affair, and sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> in the Constable's Name; and that Minister thinking by this means to oblige both of them, gave his consent to what was demanded of him.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless it was a surprising thing, that he used so rude a Conduct towards the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable's Lady; it had been a more Generous and Manly Part, to endeavour to reconcile the present Differences, than to imprison a Lady who was to be Mother in Law to his own Daughter. He ought to have considered, that a Husband and Wife are easily brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate matters; and that if ever they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52224:183"/>
came to be Friends again, his Daughter would fall into the Hands of the Constable's Lady, who would then be in a condition to revenge her self upon her for the Injuries he had done her. He might reasonably imagine, that as she was rich, and had a great number of near Relations, who made a considerable Figure in the World: so they would never see her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, without regretting her Misfortunes, and interesting themselves in her Quarrel: That they would vigorously endeavour to procure her her Liberty, and that at the bottom, when he came to cast up his Accounts, he himself would get nothing but ill will by it.</p>
            <p>This Affair made a great Noise in the World: I knew every particular circumstance of the Story, because I was intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this Unfortunate Lady, and knew her to be of a good Disposition, and not given to speak ill of other People, and, as it was truly said of her, she was never an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to any one but her self. Indeed it were to be wished, she had been Mistress of more Discretion, and had not been of so easie a Temper as to believe those Persons who advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her ill. She was very lovely, although she was not in the Prime of her Youth; her Eyes were lively, quick and piercing, her Teeth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, her Hair blacker than Jet, and in a great quantity; her Stature Noble, and her Leg well shaped. The Queen being informed of her Misfortunes, was mightily concerned at them, and continued to be very angry with the Duke <hi>de Medina C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>li,</hi> for not keeping his Promise to her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:52224:184"/>The Calamities occasioned by the Plague, were not the only Evils which the People of <hi>Spain</hi> suffered. The publick Poverty spread it self farther still, for the scarcity of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions continued, and no Remedies were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to rectifie these Disorders. No altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made in the Government, and the Chief Minister seemed to be possessed with a Lethargy. Every body hung down his Head, and Men were so enfeebled, that they had scarce strength enough to lift up their Eyes and Hands to Heaven to implore its Assistance and Relief. The past and present Miseries made them apprehend what was to follow; every one made melancholy Reflections upon the sad condition of Affairs, which carried them further than they desired: But to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the general Calamity, after they had for six Weeks together beheld terrible Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that did a world of Mischief in several goodly Cities, these Accidents were followed by an Earthquake, which happened two days after the King's departure to the <hi>Escurial.</hi> We perceived it at <hi>Madrid</hi> on the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> between six and seven a Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it was so violent, that it made a general Concussion, and the most Resolute Persons were possess'd with fear. This extraordinary Motion was perceived all the Kingdom over, and even at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and the other parts of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi> but the City of <hi>Malaga</hi> found the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Effects, and sustained the greatest Loss by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:52224:184"/>This City is situated in the Kingdom of <hi>Granada</hi> upon the Coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, within Twenty five Leagues of the <hi>Streights,</hi> at the foot of a Mountain, upon the top of which stands a Castle that Commands the Town and the Port. It is large, well peopled, and rich, by reason of the considerable Trade they drive in <hi>Spanish</hi> Wine, Oyl, Citrons, Fruits, and other Commodities, which draw a vast number of Vessels to that Port. Its Fortifications, although they are Old, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, and are adorned with several stately Buildings, which are remainders of the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and the Cathedral Church was formerly the Principal Mosque.</p>
            <p>They perceived there a great Trembling of the Earth, which lasted but a few moments, however the concussions were so violent, that they caused a general fear and desolation in in the City by the strange disorders it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned. The Harbour, and the Walls on the same side, with their Bulwarks, Towers, and Ramparts were overthrown; the Sea was in so extraordinary an agitation, that the Fishes every where leapt out of the Water; the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels that were in the Port were lifted up above Twenty Foot high, and all their sides crack'd as if they had been in a real Tempest, so that the Mariners believed they were unavoidably lost. Fifteen Convents of Men and Women were ruined after that manner, that scarce one stone lay-upon another; and in that of the Observance of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> there were fourteen persons buried in the Ruins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:52224:185"/>This Magnificent Church, which had been enlarged and beautified in the Year 1521. leaned several times on its two sides ready to overturn, and yet received no damage, which the Inhabitants took for a Miracle. 1300 Houses were sorely battered, and more than 1200 ruined. 'Tis easie to judge what a vast number of persons must have been killed, hurt, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in this Confusion. As soon as the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake had ceased, the Bishop, followed by his Clergy, and a great multitude of people, went in Procession to the Church, to implore the Divine Commiseration. Assuredly in these sorts of Occasions the most irreligious hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned persons pray heartily and sincerely.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants being affrighted, retired into the Country, fearing to be overwhelmed in the City by some new Concussion, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Houses fell down all about <hi>Malaga;</hi> a great Mountain was perfectly overthrown, the Earth opened in abundance of places, and cast up the Water in such prodigious quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that great Torrents were occasioned by it, which swelled the Rivers so as to make them overflow their Banks. 'Twas observable that the Wall of the Church <hi>d' Albavrin</hi> opened it self the breadth of four foot, and afterwards closed again, so that the place where this fis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure happened, could not be discerned. The Jasper Pillars in the same Church were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their Pedestals, but afterwards return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their old place, and sustained no damage. At the City of <hi>Velez Malaga</hi> the Earth opened and swallowed up a River which runs near it,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52224:185"/>
after this it closed again with so terrible a noise, and threw up the Water with so great a violence, that it rose above ten Pikes higher than the Houses, and had like to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed every thing when it fell down.</p>
            <p>Several Cities here were entirely overthrown, and the Earthquake did a great deal of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief at <hi>Sevil, Corduba,</hi> and at <hi>Iaen,</hi> where Palaces and Churches, and many Houses were ruined. It is impossible for any thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be more terrible than this was, for no body knew where to save themselves, and Death seemed to pursue them where-ever they fled.</p>
            <p>A few days after this Earthquake, there happened at Night a Tempestuous Storm, which overturned part of the Roof of the <hi>Escurial,</hi> broke the Crystal Windows of the King's Apartment, and tore up abundance of Trees in the Garden by the Roots. The King perceiving the Queen to be affrighted at it, was so complaisant as to rise with her, and sent for some Company to come to her Chamber, and comfort her a little.</p>
            <p>It has been a Custom long ago established in <hi>Spain,</hi> that when any thing happens, the truth of which they cannot immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, for the Ministers to suspect that <hi>France</hi> had a hand in it. Thus they had received certain Advice, that the Count <hi>d'Estrées</hi> had sailed with several Men of War in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and therefore they presently concluded, that it was he who burnt <hi>Porto-bello</hi>; but they were informed of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52224:186"/>
contrary by two Vessels, which were arrived from the <hi>Honduras</hi> at the Port of <hi>Cales,</hi> laden with six thousand Chests of <hi>Indigo,</hi> and two hundred thousand <hi>Piasters.</hi> These brought word, that some <hi>Bucaniers,</hi> commanded by an <hi>English-man,</hi> had landed at the Port <hi>de Basti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentos,</hi> and after five days march in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, had attacqued <hi>Porto-bello</hi>; that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Garrison threw away their Arms, and retired without fighting a stroke into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel; that a poor <hi>Negro,</hi> who was Seventy Years old, had marched out of it, followed by twenty five Soldiers, and made a brave Resistance, but was killed upon the place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abandoned by his Men. The <hi>Bucaniers</hi> carried away thirty six Thousand Crowns, and all the Booty they were able to take with them. In fine, having passed the Gulf of <hi>Darien,</hi> and being conducted by the <hi>Indians</hi> that were Enemies to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived through unknown ways in nine days to the South Sea, within a League of <hi>Panama:</hi> They imbarked in this place in some <hi>Cano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> and passed by Port <hi>de Perico,</hi> where they made themselves Masters of three Vessels, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ks. They went from thence to pillage the Suburbs of <hi>Panama,</hi> the Garrison of which place, without making any Resistance, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Bastion, with the President and the Auditors of the Exchequer. The <hi>Bucaniers</hi> continued some days Masters of the Sea, but at last departed, upon Information that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Four Hundred Men was coming from <hi>Cartagena,</hi> and that two Vessels were setting
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52224:186"/>
Sail from <hi>Lima,</hi> to oppose their Designs. The Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> highly provoked against the <hi>Spanish</hi> Soldiers, who had shewd so little courage upon this Occasion, assembled at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> and resolved to send Three Hundred <hi>Veterane</hi> Soldiers to reinforce the Garrisons. They gave full Authority to <hi>Don Melchior Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varra,</hi> who was named to go Vice-Roy for <hi>Peru,</hi> to Condemn without Appeal the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and other Soldiers that were found guilty, and to decimate them, in case he found them all in fault, as it was believed here.</p>
            <p>It was no small Mortification to them to hear of the taking of a Vessel belonging to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Lading whereof was computed to be worth Four Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns in Goods. Six Ships of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> took her near <hi>Oftend.</hi> This Prince was highly enraged at the ill Treatment of his Envoy, and it seems the Menaces he gave them just as he left <hi>Madrid,</hi> were not without effect. 'Twas believed here, that he had done himself too much Justice; but others, who considered this Action with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, were agreed, that it was but Natural for the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> to make recourse to violence, after the unfair measures they had kept with him, which he had so much the less Reason to expect, because he was devoted to the Interests of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and had chiefly supported it in the last War. But if these Reasons served to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him, there were others that laid some blemish upon him, to use such an Action of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52224:187"/>
Hostility towards a King, with whom he was in Peace, and who had never failed on his side to satifie him, unless he had been utterly uncapable of paying him: That at the very time when the Envoy from <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Money, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had not enough to defray th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e them. They were informed that the <hi>Portugu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ses</hi> pretended to keep the Island of St. <hi>Gabriel</hi> to themselves, and that although <hi>Buenosaires</hi> lay so near it, yet they were in a condition to maintain themselves there. The Coast of <hi>Brasil</hi> lying to near favoured them, as well as the River, whose Channel is so very narrow in that place, that it was an easie matter to Command it, and to hinder all Commerce. The <hi>Portugueses</hi> it seems had entred the River <hi>de Plata;</hi> and all these circumstances were the more afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because it was certainly known that a Squadron of <hi>Brandenburghers</hi> was gone for the <hi>Indies.</hi> This Affair was much talked of, and the Council met about it: But those that were well acquainted with the Genius of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nation, were satisfied that the Alarm would not last very long, because at Court they look upon dangers, that are at any distance, but as so many things that will never happen.</p>
            <p>The King and Queen being come back to <hi>Madrid</hi> from the <hi>Escurial,</hi> every one was very
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52224:187"/>
forward to make his Court to them; and on the Fourth of <hi>November,</hi> which was the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival of St. <hi>Charles,</hi> His Majesty went to the Chappel in the Palace, where the Embassadors of crowned Heads appeared to Complement him, and several of the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> who kissed his Hand according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom. The King was dress'd in a Suit, the Ground-stuff whereof was black, with flowers of Gold, Embroidered with Pearls, and a large Diamond in the midst of every Flower. His Chain, to which the Order of the Fleece was fastened, glittered with several Emeralds half a finger long. The Queen-Mother writ to the Queen in the Morning, desiring her to dress her self that day after the <hi>French</hi> Fashion. The Queen carried this Billet to the King, and after she had read it to him, asked him, if he would agree to it? He told her, she look'd so pretty in her <hi>Spanish</hi> dress, that he pray'd her not to quit that Habit on a day of Rejoycing.</p>
            <p>The King took away the Receipt and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Revenues of <hi>Madrid</hi> from the <hi>Corregidors</hi> and <hi>Regidors,</hi> when he knew their Cheats and Villanies. He entrusted the Management of them to a Council composed of four persons, <hi>Don Lopez de los Rios, Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea Villaran, Don Francisco Carillo,</hi> and <hi>Don Ioseph Benavidez;</hi> and empowred them to make the <hi>Regidors</hi> give them an Account of their Administration. They were Accused to have gotten the Sum of Eight Hundred Thousand Crowns by the Expences of the Queen's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52224:188"/>
and by the Building of the New Bridge at <hi>Toledo,</hi> which was carried away by the Waters of the <hi>Mancanares.</hi> At the same time the Collecting of the Imposts upon Wine, Victuals, and Coals, was taken away from them. These Alterations diminished the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of their Offices so mightily, that they could scarce get any people to bid Six Thousand Ducats for them, whereas before this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation it was an usual thing to give Ninety Thousand, although the Sallaries were not above Six Hundred Ducats.</p>
            <p>The Chief Minister had sent a Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner some Months before to the Frontiers of <hi>Biscay,</hi> to adjust the Rights of both sides with the <hi>French,</hi> but he being fond of his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, endeavoured to prolong it, and so deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded none of the Differences. There were some Regiments at <hi>Bayonne</hi> posted all along the River of <hi>Bidassoa,</hi> and some Brigandines blocked up the Mouth of it to hinder the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Fontarabia</hi> from all manner of Traffick. They could not go out to Fish, or commit any of those Acts of Hostility, to which they had been so long accustomed: And now they were given to understand that they should be kept thus imprisoned till the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had consented to a Reasonable Accommodation. Whilst matters continued in this posture, the Brigandines pretended to go away; immediately the <hi>Biscayners</hi> began to Fish, but the <hi>French</hi> coming back upon them, carried them away Prisoners, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Masters of their Barks. As soon as this

News was brought to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Ministers began to exclaim that this was an unheard of Violence, and such an infraction of the Peace, as was never to be endured. But his Most Christian Majesty ordered his Ambassador to acquaint them that they then ought to remove the difficulties, which occasion'd so many Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders; or till they were regulated to consent to follow the decisions which the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of <hi>France</hi> had made after the Treaty of Peace.</p>
            <p>A Person of the first Quality who had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the King to the <hi>Escurial,</hi> and came back from thence before him, told us, that he had strong conjectures to believe that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had fallen out with the Queen Mother. However, few Persons sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it at that time; but after the return of the Court to <hi>Madrid,</hi> it was plain and visible. Some People pretend that the Duke was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the great number of Creatures, whom the Queen-Mother daily recommended to him, and to whom he was forced to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute part of his Favours; that now he did not look upon her as any longer necessary to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his fortune, and therefore was not willing to grant the frequent demands she made him; that in order to break off with her all at once, he found it convenient to visit her no more, but express a great coldness towards her. On the contrary, there were other Persons that said, that it was occasion'd by the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her self, who was not able to constrain her self so far as to suffer the presence of a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52224:189"/>
Man who minded nothing but how to advance his Family or Friends, and never show'd any Civilities to her. There were others still that were of Opinion, that the Duke's behaviour towards the Queen-Mother was not the result of his own Inclinations, but proceeded from the Suggestions of <hi>Don Geronimo d' Eguya,</hi> and indeed it might be so, if it were not for the two following reasons: the first is because there was not the least appearance of any particular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to engage him to desire a rupture between the Queen-Mother and the Duke; the other is, that supposing he had such a Design, yet <hi>d' Eguya</hi> did not at that time stand so firm in the King's good Graces, as that the Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister should think it worth his while to give him so great a proof of his deference: Nay 'tis certain that they had a pique against one another for some time, the subtle insinuating Humour of <hi>d' Eguya</hi> made him always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Interests of the most fortunate, and he found himself under certain Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which advised him not to press too far, for fear of disobliging the chief Minister. But notwithstanding the coldness which passed between them, the King when he was at the <hi>Escurial,</hi> told <hi>d' Eguya</hi> one day very angrily, that if he was not more punctual for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to come and help him in the Dispatches, he would do all the business with <hi>Vibanco,</hi> who was Secretary to the <hi>Chamber,</hi> and for whom the King shew'd Inclination enough.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:52224:189"/>The Duke immediately, whether out of Generosity or Politick, excused <hi>de Eguya</hi> so handsomely, that he set him right in the King's Favour again; and this Obligation, for which <hi>de Eguya</hi> was indebted to him, made them be in a good Understanding with one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>De Eguya</hi> finding himself so well with the Duke, confirmed him in all the dispositions he already had, not only in regard to the Queen-Mother, but also to the Young Queen,</p>
            <p>He represented to him, <q>That these Two Princesses could do nothing for him; That the King would take it well, to find him te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie a Devotion only to his own Person, and that he would answer him with his Affection better when he saw it was not divided.</q> His true Design in speaking to him after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was only to keep him to himself, that so the Chief Minister might repose an intire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him.</p>
            <p>In fine, they were both agreed, that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to render the Duke an absolute Master, it would be necessary for him to resolve to refuse the Two Queens whatever Offices or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they begged for their Creatures. The Duke imagined that this Counsel proceeded from a true Motive of Zeal, which he thought abounded in <hi>De Eguya,</hi> and believed him so heartily, that he would do nothing but by his Advice. The Duke was generally complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, for suffering himself to be managed like a Child, by the only Man of <hi>Spain,</hi> who as
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52224:190"/>
he was a Person of the greatest Courtship, so he was likewise of the least Sincerity.</p>
            <p>To pursue his Project of disgusting the Queen Mother, the Chief Minister ordered Pensions to be given to several Persons who were directly opposite to her; the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermosa,</hi> who had got enough in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> were in this number. The Marquess <hi>de Astorgas</hi> was made Master of the Ordonance, although he was Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Queen's Houshold; and that single Place, with the Wealth he had heaped up in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> might very well suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice a Man of his Age. The Chief Minister afterwards assigned Pensions to the Women of the Dutchess <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> out of the <hi>Bolsillo,</hi> which is a sort of a Privy Purse for the King's House, and other Private Expences. He gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified several of his own Domesticks after the same manner, whilst those belonging to the King lay under such great Necessities, that they found themselves obliged to quit his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for meer Want and Poverty.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> gave one Proof of his Power, which succeeded a great deal bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than one could have believed. On the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vember,</hi> he married one of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, whose Name was <hi>Don Augustine Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riquez de Gusman,</hi> a Cadet of the House of <hi>Gusman,</hi> very poor, and of little or no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to <hi>Donna Laura,</hi> only Daughter to the Duke <hi>de Montalte,</hi> who was but fifteen years old, and so rich, that she was looked upon to be the best Match in all <hi>Spain,</hi> as well upon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52224:190"/>
the Account of her Fathers vast Estate, as those of the Marquess <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Oropeza,</hi> whose Fortunes she was to inherit, in case they had no Children. This Affair was the Work of the Dutchess <hi>de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Celi: Don Augustine de Gusman</hi> had waited upon her with so much Assiduity, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence his Services, she procured this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for him. All the World was extreamly surprised at it; but no body could compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend upon what Considerations the Duke <hi>de Montalte</hi> consented to sacrifice his Daughter to Policy. The Marquess <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> the Count <hi>de Oropeza,</hi> and all the rest of their Family were hereupon mightily enraged at the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi>; they quitted his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, which they had hitherto embraced with Zeal, and they openly declared, That they would resent so dishonourable an Alliance as long as they lived. The Count <hi>de Oropeza</hi> made particular Complaints against the Duke, because he had contributed more than any one to his Elevation, and that if he had been minded to have taken Advantage of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Dispositions his Majesty had to him, it is certain, that when <hi>Don Iuan</hi> was dead, he might have been made Chief Minister, notwithstanding he was so young: But as he had a great Respect for the Duke, he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that if he vigorously assisted him upon so important an occasion, he would always remember him for his Services; and that if he did not govern by himself, he should at least govern by his Friend. In this he found both
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52224:191"/>
Repose and Security together, he flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with disposing of Favours, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the Aversion of the People. These Reflections engaged him to employ all his Wit, and all his Credit with the King, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Duke his Chief Minister. But for all this Obligation, which was transcendent, and for which he was highly indebted to him, he did not act fairly with relation to the Daughter of the Duke <hi>de Montalte</hi>; for altho the Count <hi>de Oropeza</hi> was her Uncle, yet he knew nothing of her Marriage. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioness <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> Grand-Mother to this young Lady, was no better informed of it; they were married privately without any Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, for fear least any one should come to disturb the Feast.</p>
            <p>The King and Queen, being willing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert themselves, went to <hi>Prado,</hi> to hunt there till St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Day; they came back from thence, by reason the Queen-Mother had a slight indisposition upon her, and they were desirous to visit her every day.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Don Philip Vinzani,</hi> an able Chymist, who came from <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> with <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon,</hi> received Orders from the Chief Minister to examine the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which had been cried down some Months before, in order to separate the Silver from the Brass. It was pretended, that the King by this means, would get Six Millions of Pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Eight, and that he would employ them to send considerable Forces to Sea; for the Pope was willing, that the Money which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52224:191"/>
was to be collected by the Bulls of the <hi>Crusade,</hi> should be laid out to equip a Fleet, to make War against the <hi>Corsairs</hi> of <hi>Barbary.</hi> At the same time they were apprehensive that the Vessels sent to the <hi>Indies</hi> had suffered Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, because they had received Advice, that one of them arrived very much shatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and they could not hear any News of the rest. Although it is the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of <hi>Spain</hi> for the King to dine with the Knights of the Golden Fleece on St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s day, his Majesty dispensed with it, to take the diversion of Hunting. As he came back from <hi>Prado,</hi> towards the Evening, the two Queens went out to meet him, and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the Admiral of <hi>Castile</hi>'s House, where they had passed the time ever since Noon. This Nobleman, who was always ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and magnificent, being informed that he was to receive this Honour, ordered the Basons of several Fountains to be encompassed with large silver Pots, filled with all manner of Victuals, Flowers and Fruits as the Season produced, and the diversity joyned to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had a very agreeable effect upon the Eye. In all the Summer-houses which terminated the walks, there were little Tables set out with pieces of Cristal, Agate, Cornelian, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistry of Gold and Vermilion, having all sorts of things in Basons after the same manner as the Tables had. He got all sorts of Fruit counterfeited, particularly of Grapes which hung with their Leaves and Branches in the <hi>Grottas,</hi> they were composed chiefly of little
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52224:192"/>
Carbuncles of a Pomgranet colour, Topazes, and Amethysts, and nothing could look finer or prettier. The two Queens received a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty satisfaction at this walk. As soon as the King was arrived, they went into the House, where fifteen Ladies and as many Cavaliers immediately appeared, drest after the fashion of the Country. The Ladies came at first in their Mantles <hi>Tabados,</hi> that is to say, all their Face was covered except one Eye. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers for their part wore their Cloaks up to their Noses, and their Hats over their Eyes; this was a sort of Masquerade, and to divert their Majesties they talked with their Fingers, and by signs for some time, with all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral turns and Jestures that are used in this kind of dumb Conversation: Afterwards the Ladies quitted their Mantles, and the Lords their Cloaks, and began to dance a Saraband after the <hi>Moorish</hi> fashion, holding one another with Taffata Skarfs of different colours, and quitting them sometimes to carry Flambeaus in their hands. The Women wore little Caps on their Heads, covered with Plumes that were raised up on the sides very high. When the Saraband was finished, the Ladies kissed the Queens Hand, and the Cavaliers the King's; their Majesties were pleased to declare, that they were extreamly satisfied with this pretty Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and the Constable of <hi>Castile,</hi> knowing what Honour the King had done the Admiral, desired him that he would condescend to come and divert himself at their Houses, whither he went along
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52224:192"/>
with the two Queens. There were Comedies there, and Artificial Fire-works, and a noble Collation: they omitted nothing that might testifie their Joy upon this Occasion, and their acknowledgment of so great a Favour.</p>
            <p>On the second of <hi>December</hi> the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a supply of Mony of all the Councils, and a hundred thousand pieces of Eight of the Council of <hi>Italy.</hi> He proposed to fell some Places to raise this Summ, because it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be raised any other way.</p>
            <p>The King being informed that abundance of People died of several Distempers at <hi>Port St. Mary,</hi> which were chiefly occasioned by the great scarcity of Provisions, told the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> that some way or other must be found out to remedy these Miseries, and that he could not endure to hear any more talk of them; that they had been of a long standing, which made him inclined to believe that all this proceeded from meer negligence. The Duke replied that he would not lose one moment to redress them, and that if his Life would do the People any good, he was free to sacrifice it. He went home very melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and having retired into his Closet with his Dutchess, <hi>I have a great desire, says he to her, to abandon every thing, I slave and kill my self here with business, and after all meet with nothing but Reproaches for my Pains. When you have once brought things into a good Condition,</hi> says she, <hi>you may quit them if you please; but if you leave them at present, all the World will conclude that it is through weakness.</hi> She added so many reasons
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52224:193"/>
to these, that she made him take Courage again, altho' he was mightily dejected. The Marquiss <hi>de Priego,</hi> his Son-in-law being come to <hi>Madrid</hi> to see him, as he entred the Room hit himself a little blow on the Temples against the Edge of a Cabinet, he was immediately seized with a bleeding at the Nose, and died of it within a short time after.</p>
            <p>Our Ambassador prevailed with the King to give his consent to appoint a Judge <hi>Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,</hi> whose only business should be to look after all Affairs relating to the <hi>French</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>The business was decided at last in <hi>Madrid,</hi> in favour of Constable <hi>Colonna,</hi> upon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference he had with the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> about the Priority they pretended to dispute with him in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valcade,</hi> which is every year performed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Pope with a white Mare, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Scedule for the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> holds in fief of the Holy See. His Catholick Majesty's Council had delay'd to regulate this Affair ever since the year 1668. When the Roman Barons percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that it was not determined in favour of them, they searched new occasions to get the sentence revoked; and to succeed in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, they united themselves with the Heads of the Papal Families, to write all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to <hi>Madrid</hi> about the Matter: When the King was told of it, he only answered, <hi>What is judged is judged.</hi> The Marquis <hi>de Liche,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador from <hi>Spain,</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> fell sick; he sent immediately for the Pope's Physician to come
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52224:193"/>
to him, and when his Friends demanded of him why he chose him before his own, <hi>I am so weary of my Life, says he, that I purposely send for one, who will soonest kill me, if it were only to please his Master. The Pope being informed of this answer, sent one of the Gentlemen of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to visit him, and ordered him to tell the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, that he desired his Health as much as he did his absence, and by that he might judge whether he wished his recovery or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>December</hi> there was a great Earthquake in the Province of <hi>Salerne,</hi> as also at <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Places about it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless it did no damage. It was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that the Queen-Mother had engaged the King to nominate Cardinal <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard</hi> to be Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and that she hoped in a short time to see her two Favorites with her. The Cardinal was the first, and the Marquiss <hi>de Valenzuela</hi> the second. The Marquiss <hi>de los Velez,</hi> who had no desire to quit his place, sent the King (in order to six himself in his good Graces) a stately Coach of admirable Sculpture, and Embroidered all over most delicately. But although the King had so many fine Coaches by him, I never saw him in any of them; he just cast his Eyes upon them, and then they were shut up in a Coach-house, where time and the dust abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely spoiled them; the King rather loves to ride in great Coaches of green Linnen waxed over, made after the same fashion with ours, and which a simple Citizen of <hi>Paris</hi> would not vouchsafe to go in. The Marquiss <hi>de los Velez</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:52224:194"/>
sent him likewise some <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Horses, but so finely shaped, that nothing certainly ever came near them.</p>
            <p>Few days passed wherein the King and Queen did not go a hunting, or else to see a Play; they went to <hi>Buen Retiro</hi> to behold some <hi>Dutchmen</hi> skate upon the Ice after the fashion of their Country. Some Ladies sent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Queen that if her Majesty would permit them to appear masked, because they had no mind to be known, they would show her better sport than she had hitherto seen. They were told that they might come if they pleased, and immediately they went upon the Ice in short Petticoats, fine Shooes and Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Pattins after the <hi>Dutch</hi> manner; they danced a Saraband with Castanets to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moving as nimbly as the dance would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; but the Ice not being equally thick in all Places, broke under one of them, and let her fall into the water, where she had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly been drowned, if People had not come to her help immediately. Having lost her Mask by this Mischance, they saw she was a ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y deformed old Woman, who was near threescore years old. When the Queen was told of it, she smiled and answered, <hi>That at that Age it was lawful for any one to go masked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two Queens on St. <hi>Nicholas's</hi> day made a Present of precious Stones to the Dutchess <hi>d' Albuquerque,</hi> because it was her Birth-day. She offered them in way of return, some Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosities of great Value, and particularly a Prayer-book to the young Queen which was
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52224:194"/>
incomparably well painted, with golden Clasps, and adorned with Diamonds. It being now towards the end of the Year, I went (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Custom) to wish her Majesty a happy <hi>New Year,</hi> she was drest in a slight Stuff of white Wool, and had a prodigious quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of large Pearls about her; she sat near a great Vessel full of Olive stones, and turning over the Leaves of the Prayer-book which the Dutchess <hi>d' Albuquerque</hi> had given her, did me the honour to shew it me. <hi>See,</hi> says she, <hi>here are</hi> Henry <hi>the Fourth, and</hi> Mary de Medicis <hi>on their Knees, stretching out their Arms in their Oratory; it is certain that this Book was made for one of them. I was desirous to know by what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident it came into</hi> Spain, <hi>and told her that perhaps Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>brought it thither.</hi> Upon this she called for the Dutchess <hi>d' Albuquerque,</hi> and asked her how she came by it. The Dutchess told her she could not tell, but only that she had received it of her Mother. The Queen said to me afterwards, <hi>Are you not surprized to find me drest in white Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; 'Tis a small sort of Devotion which the King and I perform, but no body shall know the reason of it. Ab Madam, reply'd the Dutchess</hi> de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strane, <hi>we all of us take the liberty to divine. How says the Queen, without mistaking? No, I am not positive said the Dutchess. And for you, said she to me, have you guess'd at the true cause? Yes Madam, very easily, reply'd I, and all</hi> Spain <hi>joyns its Vows with yours. Don't you know, says the Queen smiling, that this is none of the best Places in the World to play the Sorceress in, and that we have a horrible Inquisition here? The King entred
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52224:195"/>
the Room at that moment, so the Queen rising up, told him with a chearful Air, that she had two Sorceresses to shew him; and that the Dutchess</hi> de Pastrane <hi>and I had divined the Mystery of her white Habit.</hi> The King, although in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance he seemed to be in a good Humour, looked so angrily upon us, and particularly upon my self, whom he knew to be a <hi>French</hi>-Woman, that I made a profound Reverence, and went immediately out of the Queen's Apartment.</p>
            <p>An Order was here published to raise the price of Money, which was reduced to a fourth part of its value.</p>
            <p>Although the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed, yet he did not neglect to inform himself diligently of every thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and he was not a little troubled to hear that the Plague began to rage again at <hi>Port St. Mary.</hi> The Scarcity and Poverty of this Country was so extreamly great, that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Persons died daily for Want. And the Duke <hi>de Medina-Cidonia</hi> was obliged to send Corn from <hi>Andaluzia</hi> thither. The Misery was not less at <hi>Naples.</hi> The Pope's Nuncio, by his Holiness's Order, Summoned the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours of all the Regular Houses hither, to oblige them to give the City some Relief in Corn.</p>
            <p>They granted two in a hundred of their Revenue, and it was hoped that what with this Money, and what with the Charities they drew from private Persons, they would reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy these pressing Necessities: But after some
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52224:195"/>
time, Cardinal <hi>Caracchioli,</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Naples,</hi> acquainted the Marquess <hi>de los Velez</hi> by his Vicar General, that the Pope would not suffer the Tax of two in the hundred to be raised any longer upon the Ecclesiastical Revenues. Thus the Vice-Roy found himself disappointed in his designs of raising two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Crowns, which were to be laid out in Corn, and likewise a more considerable Sum that was to be sent to <hi>Madrid.</hi> To aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Disorder, which was already great enough, the price of Gold Money diminished daily in the Dutchy of <hi>Bari,</hi> which totally hindred all Commerce in the greatest part of the Kingdom. On the 16<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> they made a Procession at <hi>Naples,</hi> which is duly performed every Year, to thank God for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving this City from the Flames of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Vesuvius.</hi> The Body and Blood of St. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarius,</hi> one of the Protectors of <hi>Naples,</hi> was carried about in this Procession.</p>
            <p>The King was troubled with an Ague for a few days towards the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1681. It is impossible for any one to show the assiduity that the young Queen made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear during the little time his Indisposition lasted. Two Comedies were acted at Court to divert His Majesty after his Recovery. On one of these days, the King having prohibited all Persons, without exception, to sit upon the Theatre; the Duke <hi>d'Ossone</hi> placed himself there upon a heap of Cushions, and would not depart. The King took no notice of it during the Play, but as soon as it was over,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52224:196"/>
he sent an Order to him, to come no more to Council or to Court. He was not in the least pitied, since he had voluntarily drawn this Misfortune upon himself, and because it was necessary to mortifie him a little. But what principally occasioned the King's Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is, that he had observed in his Journey to the <hi>Escurial,</hi> that the Duke, who was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Horse to the Queen, did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Court thither. A little after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he sent him word, that he expected him to wait more diligently for the future; the Duke took no notice of this Advice, and as he was one of the haughtiest Men in the World, affected a certain negligence in the discharge of his Office, which obliged the King to acquaint him by a Note from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State, that if he did not behave himself better for the time to come, he would dispose of his Place to some body else. He might easily have judged from this, that the King had his Eye fixed upon him, and at least ought to have taken care of himself for some time, but his Natural haughtiness would not suffer him to comply with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> did not pass all his moments with content; he was envied for the high Post he enjoyed, and <hi>d'Eguya</hi> was mortally hated: both of them had powerful Enemies, and amongst these were reckoned the Duke <hi>de Veraguas,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Pastrane</hi> and his two Brothers, the Admiral of <hi>Castile,</hi> the Prince <hi>de Stillano,</hi> the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:52224:196"/>
the Count <hi>d'Oropeza,</hi> and the Marquess <hi>de Mansera.</hi> They frequently met together, and made severe Reflections upon the unequal Conduct of the Duke <hi>de Medina-Celi</hi>; they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that he was too irresolute when there was an occasion for constancy; too lazy, when he ought to be diligent; and too positive, when he was justly and reasonably opposed. They examined the present state of the Kingdom, the Misery of the People, and the little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances there were that he would redress them. They proposed Expedients to Remedy all these Grievances, and likewise to prevent those that might happen; but as it was not the publick Good alone that made them thus inquisitive, but their private Interest animated them, they took all of them different Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to attain the particular Ends they propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to themselves. It is true indeed, they all concurred in the destruction of the Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, but when he was removed out of the way, every one was desirous to make the best Advantages of it for himself; and thus this narrow Spirit of Self-Interest which was so predominant in their Cabals, hindred them from uniting with that sincerity, that makes great Affairs succeed happily.</p>
            <p>Amongst these Noblemen the Admiral was most forward to desire an Alteration: He had not forgot the sweetness he had tasted in that short interval, when the Marquess <hi>de Valenzu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ela</hi> was the Queen-Mother's Favourite: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that Golden time made him desirous of another like it; for though he was
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52224:197"/>
a Person of a great Estate, yet his Expences were so extraordinary, that if he had been a great deal richer, he would have been always in Debt. He desired therefore to contribute what in him lay to the setting up of another Minister, in order to find his Accounts in it; not that he designed to heap up any Money, but to throw it out of the Windows, and squander it away, if he could but get enough to serve so. He carefully look'd about him to find out a fit and capable Person to be advanced to this Honour; and at last, the Count <hi>d' Oropeza</hi> seemed to be the most proper to accomplish his Designs: for he did not doubt but that those particular marks of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem His Majesty always shewed him, would have their effect, in case he were supported by a powerful Party.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> who wanted neither Youth, Wit, nor Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, whose whole deportment was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Court-like, who had been concerned in the management of several Affairs, who was laborious and vigilant, took only resolute and secret Persons into his Party. He had the justest occasions in the World to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and <hi>Don Geronimo d' Eguya</hi> his Mortal Enemy had done him a great deal of wrong before the King. He had painted the Action and Character of this Count in such black colours, that the Young Queen designing to do him some good Offices, and speaking very advantageously of him to His Majesty, he told her, <hi>That</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terey
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52224:197"/>
               <hi>might reckon himself happy enough, that he wore his Head upon his shoulders still.</hi> The Count was sensibly disgusted to see the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermosa,</hi> who had been Governour of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> after him, and who had even served un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Orders, made Counsellor of State at his arrival at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and himself consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluded after so disobliging a manner. Besides this, he saw that the Marquess <hi>de Liche,</hi> his Brother was detained at <hi>Rome</hi> against his will, although he daily petitioned to be called home. This gave the Count a new occasion to complain, and made him sensible of the ill dispositions they had at Court to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and himself. The Marchioness <hi>de Liche,</hi> who was Beautiful and Young, threw her self frequently at the King's feet, to demand of him the return of her Husband, who was continually indisposed at <hi>Rome,</hi> whether it were because the Air did not agree with him, or that his uneasiness to be kept there by force, contributed to destroy his Health. What makes the case harder, is, that she did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to have him come back to <hi>Madrid,</hi> but only that he might have permission to live in any of His Majesty's Dominions. The greater part of the Councellors of State were agreed in favour of the Marchioness, and her Prayers had certainly met with success, if the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Marquess <hi>de Liche</hi> had not taken all Opportunities to confirm the King in the Opinion he had already of him, that he was a Man of the most incurable ill Temper in the World, and that it was not possible for him
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52224:198"/>
to permit him to come home, without haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arding the Peace of all the Court. We may therefore easily apprehend, that the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> had reason enough to be angry with the Duke <hi>de Medina-Celi</hi> and <hi>d' Eguya;</hi> and his Resentments as well as his Ambition made him passionately wish to see another in the Place, that he might effectually Revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the Duke, whom he hated, and might have Access enough to the New Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, to be able through his means to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the Council of State, and push on his own Fortune. He imagined himself capable of doing it by his Merits and good Management; but although he might with Justice aspire to the most high and difficult Posts, he was obliged to conceal his desires and intentions, because he found People's Eyes were still upon him, and that several who made a Solemn Profession to be his Friends, served only as so many Spies to watch him. This consideration prevailed with him to put that restraint upon himself, as to live in a sort of Retirement, and that with so much cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection, as to discover his Designs almost to no body. Nay, he affected to Visit the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and having found him one day more easie of Access than was usual with him, he freely declared to him, that it was not without the greatest impatience that he beheld the preference the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermosa</hi> met with, to be made Privy-Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and himself excluded. The Duke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him, that he might expect his turn
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52224:198"/>
one day, and upon this shewed him some Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, which perswaded the Count to believe, that he had now perhaps a greater kindness for him than formerly. This Reason engaged him to make his Court regularly to him, and to devote himself to him, at least in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Veraguas,</hi> sensible of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front he had received in losing the Vice-Roy-ship of <hi>Valentia,</hi> had no other motive to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to think of the removal of the Chief Minister, but only an expectation that he who succeeded him in that Place, would do him more Justice, than the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had done: For although the Duke <hi>de Veraguas</hi> was descended of an Illustrious Family, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the House of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that besides his Youth, he had a great deal of Merit and Capacity, yet whatever importunities he made at Court to be restored to his Vice-Roy-ship again, he was not able to obtain it. He had received Absolution privately from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick <hi>Nuncio</hi> for having ordered the Monk to be executed, who had quitted his Habit, and was made Captain of the <hi>Banditti.</hi> It was believed, that having now appeased the Pope, this would facilitate his re-establishment; he daily presented his Petitions to the Council, he demanded of them, that if he were a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, they would treat him as such, that his Tryal might come on, and that his Head might answer for the faults he had committed; but that if after a strict Examination of his Conduct, they found he had served His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52224:199"/>
well, they would not deny him the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice that is allowed to the meanest Souldier. His Trouble and his Requests were always equally unsuccessful, he found them perverse and prejudiced against him; and so by this ill usage they obliged him to joyn with the Male-contents.</p>
            <p>As for the Duke <hi>de Pastrane,</hi> he had not in the least been ill used at Court, however he thought it sufficient ill Treatment to be left without an Employ. His Wife, who was Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to the Marquess <hi>de Liche</hi> and the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> being provoked at what Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties those of her Family had suffered, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to use all his Efforts to get a new Ministery established. The Duke <hi>de Pastrane</hi> voluntarily espoused this Party, and his two Brothers, whom he had made acquainted with the Design, were resolved not to separate their Interests from his; one of them was named <hi>Don Gaspar,</hi> the other <hi>Don Ioseph de Silva;</hi> the last of these had a very great share in the King's Affections, and his Place of Chief Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-Usher procured him a great Esteem and Approbation. He had married the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Marquess <hi>de Mansera:</hi> But these three Noblemen were guilty of a great Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism in this Affair; for they communicated the matter to <hi>Don Sebastian Bibanco,</hi> Secretary of the Chamber, out of a presumption that he was of the same Opinion with themselves, but herein they were mistaken; for he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>finitely more devoted to the Chief Minister <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>an to them, and consequently no sooner
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52224:199"/>
knew any thing of Importance, but he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately discovered it to him.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>de Mansera,</hi> Grand Master of the Queen-Mother's Houshold, and her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, desired for her sake as well as his own, to see the Government molded into another form. He was a Man well advanced in years, whose Merit and Experience might with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice prompt him to believe that he was fit to possess whatever Place they would assign him in the Ministry. He desired a <hi>Iuncto</hi> to be erected, that he might be chosen a Member of it: But knowing that his Zeal for the Queen-Mother rendred him strongly suspected, and that he ran an extraordinary hazard if he appeared for himself, he judged it expedient to employ the Marquess <hi>de Grana,</hi> who was his Brother-in-law and Confident. So he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed him about the matter, and possessed him with a desire to take all necessary measures to effect it. The other having nothing to fear by reason of his Quality of being Ambassador, laboured very diligently in the Affair, while the Marquess <hi>de Mansera</hi> expressed but a small concern for whatever happened at Court, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it were for the Marquess <hi>de Grana</hi>'s Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to contribute to his Advancement. He seemed to be of Opinion, that for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of the Emperour his Master, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to procure the Prosperity of <hi>Spain,</hi> which languished under an extream Misery that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it self farther than the Limits of that Kingdom: That it was impossible for the King to Second the Emperour in any of his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52224:200"/>
Designs, as long as the Members of that great body were declining, and continued under the ill effects of a Consumption, that made them utterly incapable of Action; that it was to no purpose to make any Proposals to the Ministers, because whatever they promised him was never executed. All these Motives joyned together, excited him to make all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advances to convince the Duke of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity he lay under to erect a Juncto.</p>
            <p>Besides this he considered that the Marquess <hi>de Mansera</hi> wou'd not fail of making one of that number; that he would manage himself in the Council according to the Directions he gave him, and that this would be the easiest way for him to succeed in all his Enterprizes. He imagin'd that the best Policy he could use to accomplish these Designs, would be to use none at all, and so he addressed himself imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi.</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with commending his Zeal, his Industry and Pains, and afterwards passing into a more strict Examination of every thing, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to make him comprehend, <hi>That the Affairs of this Monarchy were reduced to their last Period, unless he took sure and ready Methods to remedy them; that he made a slave of himself in vain, since it was not possible for one single Man to sustain (like another</hi> Atlas) <hi>the weight of so many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; that</hi> Don Louis de Haro <hi>at a conjuncture of less difficulty, had composed a Iuncto for his own ease, and herein followed the Example of several great Ministers who preceded him; that a Iuncto would serve to determine Matters under the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52224:200"/>
of the Chief Minister, to whom they would carry every thing almost digested in his hand, and that by this means business would go on cheerfully and speedily; that at the present time, whatever good Resolutions were taken, yet they continued without effect by reason of the general Perplexity, which rendred those things difficult that appeared to be very easie; that he ought to consider, that the most accomplished Genius in the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Presumption, could never promise himself to move so ponderous a Machine all alone, and that he therefore counselled him to take some seconds, of Experience and Ability sufficient, to make him repose one part of his Affairs upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Chief Minister relished these Reasons of the Marquiss <hi>de Grana,</hi> promising to weigh the matter with Deliberation, and afterwards if he saw good, to determine himself by the Advice he had given him. This gave the Ambassador good hopes, that his visit would meet with happy success; and as he was a Person of a great deal of Wit, who knew how to set off any thing to the best advantage, and show it by the best Lights, so he did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> would lay hold of the Expedients he had discovered to him; but the Chief Minister had the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to discourse <hi>d' Eguya</hi> about them; who did not lose one moment to disswade him from this Resolution. <hi>He represented to him, that if he composed a Iuncto he went to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so many Tutors; that then he could decide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in concert with them; that he would find himself joyned with Noblemen who were led by
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52224:201"/>
their own Passions, blinded with their own Interests, still pursuing their own ends, and turning every matter to their own private advantage; that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this, he only must resolve to bear the brunt of all, and that every body having their Eyes fixed upon him would pursue all his Motions step by step; that if any difficult juncture, any misfortune, or unexpected accident should happen, he alone must incur the Reproach of it; that the Iuncto would never be called in question for ill Events, but that they would all lye at the Chief Minister's door; that it was very just and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to think, that if he alone was responsible for all Miscarriages, that then he alone deserved to enjoy the Grandeur and Advantages that are annexed to this Place.</hi> He turned the Duke's Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions so happily by these Reasons, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to follow them, notwithstanding the advice that was given him to the contrary; so that when the Marquess came to him with Expectations to find him continue still in the same Sentiments, and ready to put them in Execution, he perceived that he was stedfast and inflexible in the other Opinion, and that all the Avenues to him were shut up and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Lords who had associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated together to make a League against the Duke, continued to assemble in private, and to debate of the Expedients that were to be taken to convince the King of the necessity there was to chose another Minister, or at least to erect a Juncto; but the greatest part of their time was generally spent in making
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52224:201"/>
long Political Discourses, and these same Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks hindered them so, that none of them offered to put himself at the head of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When the Question was about setting up a Chief, every one stood looking upon his Neighbour; they wanted that Amity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in one another which is necessary to cement these Designs, and he that merited the greatest esteem, was sure to find the least Friendship from the rest. Envy reigned amongst them, Sincerity was not observed; and when their Society was examined, there was nothing but vanity and weakness to be found at the bottom.</p>
            <p>Amongst those who were most sensible of the ill management that was to be found in this Cabal, the Admiral of <hi>Castile</hi> was one of the first. He easily discovered all the defects of the Party, and found it was non sense to be longer engaged in it, since the Bow was not drawn high enough to send the Arrow to the Butt. He was assured that the design would be discovered, and that then he should find himself very finely ruined; that supposing it succeeded, and a Juncto was set up, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>de Liche</hi> would in all probability be made a Member of it, and for his part rather than that should happen, he would chuse to go to Hell, because he bore such an implacable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to him. This only Idea, that now he contributed to procure an Advantage for the Marquess, turned his Inclinations absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Society into which he was entred; in fine, after abundance of Reflexions he total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52224:202"/>
abandoned it, and several People were strongly perswaded that he was not content to quit it, but that he went to the King, and acquainted him with the least Particulars of what had passed there; nay, that he gave the same Advice to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Victim the Duke sacrificed to his Resentments, was the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> whether it were because his Indignation was the more violent against him by reason of the Friendship he always pretended to him, and now had violated; or because he feared him more than any of the rest: So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the great security he imagined himself to be in for his circumspect Conduct, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of <hi>Castile</hi> sent him word, that he had something to say to him, and therefore must see him that Evening at Court, (for it must be observed by the way, that the Presidents of <hi>Castile</hi> never go to make any Visits.) The Count was very glad to have this Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to discourse him, having some Affairs to speak with him about, wherein he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. But his Joy lasted but a short time, for the President gave him an Order contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Billet from the King, and signed by <hi>Don Geronimo d' Eguya,</hi> wherein it was specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he must instantly retire to one of his Country Houses. He continued surprized for some time, and told the President that he was ready to obey it; but that being a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> he demanded an Order signed by the King's own hand, since it was the Custom; and that while he tarried for it, he would go
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52224:202"/>
to put his Affairs in Order. In short, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his own House extreamly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and got his Equipage made ready, not at all doubting but that the Order would be sent suddenly to him. He received it next day, which was the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> accompanied with a Permission to tarry three days longer in <hi>Madrid.</hi> He passed them there amongst some of his Friends, and afterwards parted for <hi>Salamanca.</hi> Few People pittied his case, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was generally envied; and when For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune leaves a man, few of his Friends have Generosity enough to declare themselves in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of him, or to espouse his Cause. He was the first Person whom the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> treated ill, and 'tis believed he had not made him serve as an Example for the rest, if <hi>d' Eguya</hi> by his violent Courses had not sowred that peaceable and sweet Disposition that was so natural to the Chief Minister; for he advised him to punish the Count immediately, to be a warning to others; and he was banished ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because he was not agreeable to <hi>d' Eguya,</hi> and had too much Merit, than because he was an Enemy to the Duke. The Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther secretly rejoyced at it, but could not so well conceal her satisfaction, but that it was evidently perceived. The Count had quitted her Party in <hi>Don Iuan</hi>'s time, and 'tis very well known that he had several pressing Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations upon him to have used her after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner; for if he had been willing to have made the best advantage of his Fortune, she had preferred him to <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52224:203"/>
him with the management of her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. He had at least as many good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as the other could pretend to, and was of an illustrious Extraction, but being a young man he neglected the advances the Queen-Mother made towards him. A certain Person who knew the whole Proceedings very well, told me that Father <hi>Nitard</hi> was scarce gone out of <hi>Spain</hi> when she began to cast her Eyes upon him intending to honour him with her Confidence. On the Festival of St. <hi>Isidore,</hi> who is the Patron of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and on which day a Bull-feast was celebrated at the Expence of the City, the Queen-Mother asked the Count whether he designed to combat the Bulls, he told her no, unless her Majesty would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to order him. <hi>No,</hi> says she, <hi>I will by no means command you to do it, but is there ne'er a Lady here in Court, who has laid any such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon you? If any of them had,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>your Majesty may well imagine that I would not fail to give her this mark of my Obedience.</hi> The Queen cryed out Jesus, Jesus, Count! Will you expose your Life thus? A few days after this she let a Paper drop out of her hands as he was giving her an Account of some Affairs she had intrusted him with, he took it up, and kneeling upon one Knee, presented it to her. <hi>Perhaps,</hi> says the Queen, <hi>you believe it is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Importance, come I'll leave you to judge of that your self, open it.</hi> The Count found the following words there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:52224:203"/>
               <hi>Estoy toda la noche despierta sola, triste, y de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seando: mis penas son Martirios, mis Martirios son gustos.</hi> That is to say, <hi>I pass all the Night without sleeping, alone, pensive, and forming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to my self: my Pain is a Martyrdom, but my Martyrdom is a Pleasure.</hi> The Count read these words with so careless an Air, that the Queen who observed it, snatched the Paper out of his hand, and said to him, go you insensible, and say your <hi>Domine non sum dignus.</hi> The Count was sensible of his fault, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to repair it, but it succeeded a great deal worse with him. The Queen-Mother did not doubt but that he had some other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement which he preferr'd to his Fortune; she informed her self of his Conduct, and at last knew that he was desperately in love with the Dutchess <hi>de Monteleon.</hi> This was a young Widow, beautiful and agreeable, but the Queen prohibited her to come to Court. The Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> her Mother, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly disgusted at it, and this was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion why she disengaged her self from the Interests of the Queen-Mother, and joyned with <hi>Don Iuan</hi>'s Faction. In the mean time the Queen continued still enraged at the Procedure of the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi>; so that passing from the extremity of Love to that of hatred, she gave him, during the remainder of her Regency, all the Mortifications she could think of.</p>
            <p>Most People were displeased with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>Castile,</hi> and call him nothing but false Brother, and false Friend. Nevertheless he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52224:204"/>
would have it received for a certain truth, that he never had any intention to make the least Discoveries, but that the King having sent for him, told him, that upon condition he would deal fairly and honestly by him, he would forgive him; whereas on the contrary, if he went about to Excuse himself, he was certainly undone; that he knew every thing that had passed, even to the least Circumstance, that the Declaration he demanded of him was rather to know his Heart, than to draw any new lights from him; that when he would have denied every thing, the King prest him more earnestly than before; so that upon that score he resolved to discover what related per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally to himself, but that he had avoided as much as was possible to speak of his Friends. To say the truth, whether he really excused the Prince <hi>de Stillano,</hi> or the Court looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to have made but an inconsiderable Figure amongst the Party, the Chief Minister did not make him feel the Effects of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. It is indeed as certain, that his Punishment preceded his Fault, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already lost his Place of being President of the Council of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> he had some Justice on his side to expect that they would suffer him to live in quiet.</p>
            <p>The Banishment of the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> so terribly affrighted the Duke <hi>de Pastrane</hi> his Brother-in-law, that he thought of nothing else but how to get handsomly out of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue: He follow'd the Admiral's steps, that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52224:204"/>
is to say, he readily discovered whatever he knew of this Affair, that he might better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the King of his Sincerity and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Secretary <hi>Vibaneo,</hi> to whom he opened himself, had already discovered the whole Contrivance; but in fine, he came soon enough to be favourably received; his two Brothers, who were concerned in the same Cabal, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated his Example in reconciling themselves to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and they seemed in all appearance to embrace his Interests with greater Zeal than any of his best and oldest Friends. Nevertheless the Duke <hi>de Pastrane</hi> and his two Brothers could not forbear to be a little troubled, for being looked upon by the World as timerous Persons, who had only made these Discoveries out of Weakness and Irresolution: This Reason obliged them to use all imaginable means to make it be believed that they had told the King nothing; but that having had the misfortune to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Designs to <hi>Vibanco,</hi> he had sacrificed his Friendship to make his Court at their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; that the King had him ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as a Witness against them, that he had severely threatned them, and affixed their Pardon only to their sincerity; that they could not possibly avoid the doing of this at a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture when they should otherwise have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed themselves without saving any body else; and that if it had not been for these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Circumstances, they had never been capable of doing this Injury to their Friends. People hearkned to them, but gave no Credit
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52224:205"/>
to their words; nay, several of their Friends reproached them very frankly for shewing so little courage and constancy upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the Duke <hi>de Veraguas</hi> had escaped as well as the Prince <hi>de Stillano,</hi> and the loss of his Vice-Roy-ship had prevented the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment they pretended he deserved, for joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to a Party against the Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister: But he was impatient to be restored to his former Dignity, and continually demanded Justice at their hands; he filled all his Petitions with Complaints, and loudly vented them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi>; besides this, he earnestly importuned the King to assign him some Judges, before whom he might Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie his Conduct in condemning the relapsed Monk, who had betaken himself to the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti.</hi> So at last he was sent to the Council of <hi>Arragon,</hi> where he demanded to be re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, as a piece of Justice that could not be denied him, and pursued this Affair with all possible vigour and heat: But on the third of <hi>February</hi> he received an Order to withdraw presently to his Estate in <hi>Andaluzia.</hi> He begged leave to go to any other place, because the Plague raged violently in that Province; but it was refused him, and he had only eight hours to prepare for his departure. One may say, it was only the ill Fortune of the Duke <hi>de Veraguas</hi> that procured him all the ill usage he met upon the account of his Vice-Roy-ship: for it is a certain truth, that if there were a Law to treat all People after the same manner
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52224:205"/>
who fail in their Duty, abundance of Persons had been severely punished, who were now gratified and encouraged for their pains: But His Majesty was so exceedingly prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, that one Evening when the Queen was demanding of him, whether it were true, that the Duke <hi>de Veraguas</hi> was banished: He answered, <hi>Yes, and that all those should be treated in the same kind, who talked impertinently.</hi> This was sufficient to make the Queen know how his inclinations stood, and as she was very prudent, she took care to change the Discourse immediately.</p>
            <p>It was now sensibly perceived at Court, that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and <hi>Don Gero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo d' Eguya</hi> opposed the Queen-Mother in every thing, but the true occasion was not positively known. One day when the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioness <hi>de Mortare</hi> came to Visit us, we spoke to her concerning it; and as she was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly informed of the whole matter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed a greater confidence in us than in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> because we had no Interests to take in this Affair; she acquainted us, That some time before the King went to the <hi>Escurial, d' Eguya</hi> going to find out the Queen-Mother, to shew her a certain Letter which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>de Liche,</hi> Ambassador at <hi>Rome,</hi> had sent to the King: when he was come into her Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, looked for it in his Letter-bag to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. He then remembred himself, that he had lock'd it up in his <hi>Scritore,</hi> where he had several other Papers, which he had no mind any body should see; and sent a little Page for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52224:206"/>
it, who could not read. The poor Boy took the first Letter he found there, and wrapped it up in a sheet of white Paper, as he had eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day seen his Master do the same, when he carried his Expeditions to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Geronimo d' Eguya</hi> tarried all this while with the Queen-Mother, and as soon as the Boy brought him the Letter, without taking it out of the Paper, delivered it to her. It was now towards Evening, and the Queen went to the Window to read it more conveniently: She was immediately surprized to find it was not the Marquess <hi>de Liche</hi>'s Hand, but that of <hi>Donna Lucinda Bucados</hi> (who was of the House <hi>de Barcelona</hi>) one of her Maids of Honour, who was a very Beautiful Lady, and extreamly lov'd by <hi>d' Eguya.</hi> The Letter was writ with a great deal of freedom, and signified to him, that he had no reason to apprehend that the Queen her Mistress would censure their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. She gave him several Reasons for it, that highly reflected on the Queen's Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. After she had read it over, she imposed that constraint upon her self, as to conceal her Indignation for that time, and only told <hi>d' Eguya,</hi> that she must Discourse the King about what the Ambassador had written to him. As soon as he was gone, she sent for <hi>Donna Lucinda,</hi> and after she had reproached her for her Ingratitude and Impudence, she caused her to be privately locked up in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Chamber well grated and barred up, and kept the Key of it her self. Here the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Lucinda</hi> was forced to lye upon a sorry
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52224:206"/>
Matt, having nothing but Bread and Water to sustain her, and the Queen-Mother frequently ordered her to undergo the Penance of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. They told those that enquired after her, that she was sick of the Small Pox, that the Queen had ordered her to be removed out of the Palace, and that she was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously ill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Geronimo d' Eguya</hi> believed the News, and was almost desperate for two days; but having opened his <hi>Scritore</hi> to take out something or other, he was exceedingly surprised to find the Marquess <hi>de Liche</hi>'s Letter there, which he thought he had left in the hands of the Queen-Mother: He searched immediately for that of <hi>Donna Lucinda,</hi> and not finding it, he soon concluded where the fatal Error was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; so he ran in all hast to the Queen-Mother's Apartment, cast himself at her feet, conjured her to forgive <hi>Lucinda,</hi> to consider her Youth, her Birth, and the humble tender Intreaties he made in her behalf, but he found the Queen inflexible. Seeing at last that he was not able to move her, he told her, he knew a way how to revenge himself upon her. She asked him what it was? He replied, that he would hinder <hi>Valenzuela</hi> from ever coming back again; and that she should behold him no more. The Queen very much enraged at this Answer, told him, that she was sensible enough of the ill will he bore her, but that she did not fear the Effects of it; that it was a long time since she had lost <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> who was indeed one of the best Servants she ever
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52224:207"/>
had, but that she was now accustomed to bear his absence. Afterwards she added these words, looking earnestly upon him, <hi>I would advise you for your own sake to hinder his return, for if ever he comes to know that such a fellow as you had the boldness to displease me, he would tear you in pieces, as a Lion does a She-Goat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>D' Eguya</hi> possessed with Rage, took the first favourable Opportunity to speak to the King in prejudice of <hi>Valenzuela; He represented to him, That he was a bold intriguing Man; that if the Queen had him with her, they two would raise Factions together, in which they would engage all the turbulent Spirits in the Kingdom; that by this means they would disturb the Tranquillity he now enjoyed; that the Queen still regretted the Time and Authority of the Regency; that it was dangerous to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w favours to any of those Persons who had been her Creatures of old.</hi> In a word, he so well managed the King upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that he bid him issue out an Order, such as he judged convenient, to hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back of the unfortunate <hi>Valenzuela; d'Eguya</hi> lost no time about it, and the substance of the Order was, That if they met him upon the Sea in his return to <hi>Spain,</hi> they should take him out of the Vessel where he was, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embark him in that which brought the Order, and so carry him to <hi>Cartagne</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> The Queen-Mother for her part sent away <hi>Donna Lucinda</hi> in private, with Orders to Ship her at the <hi>Groyn,</hi> and to Transport her to <hi>Flanders,</hi> where she had sent word to Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> to get her shut up in a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52224:207"/>
Nunnery. But <hi>Don Geronimo d' Eguya</hi> having found means to acquaint himself of what had hapned, dispatched an Order of the Chief Minister to the <hi>Groyne,</hi> to bring <hi>Donna Lucin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> back to one of her Relations, who had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to take care of her.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> espoused <hi>d'Eguya</hi>'s side in this Dispute with a mighty heat. The Affair blew over at Court without any noise or bustle; as for the Queen Mother she spoke nothing at all of it, because it had then been necessary to produce <hi>Lucinda's</hi> Letter, which was by no means convenient to be shown, for the several fierce and disrespectful things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. On the other hand, <hi>d Eguya</hi> had no Temptation to speak of it, for being Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State, and under an Obligation to preserve his <hi>Spanish</hi> Gravity, he was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to discover his Amorous weaknesses to the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D'Eguya,</hi> who was the sole cause of the ill understanding between the Queen-Motherand the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> used all his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to increase it still, and in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish his designs, alarmed the Duke perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually with all that he had reason to apprehend from the Resentments and Indignation of that Princess. What he whispered to him, served to exasperate the Chief Minister more and more against her, and this made him keep a fair Correspondence with her no longer. He considered with himself, that he stood firm in the King's Affection, and that the Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor and <hi>d' Eguya,</hi> who had more frequent
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52224:208"/>
occasions to discourse his Majesty than he had, would take care to confirm him in all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Dispositions he had for the Duke. This Triumvirate began at the same time to sow the Seeds of Discord between the King and the Queen-Mother. No body durst ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the King with the Reasons that inclined them to act so violently, they had seen after what manner the Chief Minister had treated those Persons who were not of his side, and they had no mind to draw down his Anger upon themselves. The great Officers belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King's Houshold seemed to depend intirely upon him; the Gentlemen of the Chamber, who waited every day in their turn, pay'd a no less abject Submission to the Favourite, and those who had Sincerity enough to speak, considering the Injury they might hereby do themselves, left the Province of better informing the King to some body else who had more Zeal, and less Policy: so that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi, d'Eguya,</hi> and the Confessor, finding a clear field, gave his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty what ill Impressions they pleased, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Queen-Mother; they assured him that nothing in the World could make her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Troubles and ill usage she had found when <hi>Don Iuan</hi> governed all; that although she had reason enough to believe that when that Minister treated her so rudely, he acted only by himself; yet it was certainly true that all was done under the Name and Authority of the King; that therefore she would always remember, it was he that abetted the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52224:208"/>
she had suffered; and that he ought to consider, that it was by no means safe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any Confidence in a reconciled Enemy. The natural goodness of the King, and the Respect he had for the Queen his Mother, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him from being absolutely influenced by the pernicious Counsels they gave him; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they prevailed so far upon him as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him jealous, and consequently cold and reserved to her; she easily perceived it, and was well informed of all their Designs, but whether she judged it was by no means a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time to endeavour the Destruction of her Enemies, or whether she had some other reasons to disswade her from attempting it, she did not move at all in that Affair, and a short time after she never went out of her Palace but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make Visits of common decency to the King and Queen.</p>
            <p>The Chief Minister, the Father Confessor, and <hi>d'Eguya</hi> applauded one onother for having removed the Queen-Mother from all share in the Administration of Affairs; but fearing lest the young Queen might become serviceable to her in this conjuncture, they found it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to render the Queen-Mother suspected to her. They took a very odd way to effect it, but one that served their turn as well as any; that is to say, they began to inspire the King with a dislike of the Queen's Conduct, wherein they made him observe abundance of inconsiderable slight things, which they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to him with so much the more Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, because the Queen acting without any
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52224:209"/>
reserve, as all persons of Sincerity use to do, never restrained her own natural Temper.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the King expressed to her some dissatisfaction at it, and this afflicted her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, but while she looked about her to find out who those Persons were that did her these ill Offices, some of the Duke's Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents gave her to understand that all this came from the Queen-Mother, who seeing she had no Children, endeavoured to render the King indifferent to her, that so she might arrive to what she so earnestly desired, which was to see the Arch Dutchess Queen of <hi>Spain.</hi> The young Queen found some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of truth in what they told her, and this threw her into a dejection of Mind, that really made her an object of Compassion. Another Affliction was joyned to this, and contributed to augment her Grief, and that was to see the little Credit she had to obtain what ever she desired.</p>
            <p>For although the Chief Minister had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be always devoted to her Service, and she had accepted of the Dutchess <hi>d' Albuquerque</hi> chiefly upon his Recommendation, yet he seemed not at all to be sensible of it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obliged her in any tolerable manner. It was to no purpose that she begged any favour of the King, and it was to as little purpose that his Majesty granted them; for he no sooner spoke to the Duke about them, but the Duke disswaded him from doing what the Queen desired; in such manner, that if she requested any thing it was sufficient for her
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52224:209"/>
to rest assured that she should lose the fruit of her Prayers. The Queen who had a great deal of Wit and Penetration, and who knew what obstacles the Chief Minister always laid in her way, could not forbear to speak to the King about him in a most pressing earnest manner, which intimated to him his unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fondness for the Chief Minister, and sometimes she closed the discourse with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular detail of the disorders which were to be found in all Affairs by reason of the Duke's insufferable negligence. The King gave <hi>d'Eguya</hi> an Account of what the Queen told him, <hi>d'Eguya</hi> carried all to the Duke to make his Court by it, and this still occasioned fresh Complaints on one side and t'other. The young Queen by this means compleatly lost that little Interest she had in the Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and sometimes could not tell what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures she ought to take to strengthen and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her own Authority.</p>
            <p>The Queen was considering with her self what the Occasion might be that made the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> neglect to give her that deference he was obliged to pay her for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reasons; and the Duke being informed that the Queen's Resentments against him daily increased, made use of the Marquess <hi>d' Astor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas</hi>'s Confessor to tell him who belonged to the Queen, that her Majesty made a wrong judgment of his Inclinations; that he should always be ready to give her all imaginable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of his Respect and Fidelity, but that it was an ungrateful displeasing sight to him to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52224:210"/>
see her Majesty shew such particular Favours to Persons directly opposite to him, amongst whom he reckoned the Marchioness <hi>de Liche,</hi> the Countess <hi>de Monterey,</hi> the Princess <hi>de Stilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> the Dutchess <hi>d'Ossone,</hi> the Marchioness <hi>de los Velez,</hi> the Dutchess <hi>de l'Infantado,</hi> and some others: That if she would be pleased to remove those Ladies, or at least not entertain them with such evident distinctions of kindness, he should receive it with a most sensible acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and omit no opportunity to give her all the proofs of Gratitude he was capable of. He added, that without consulting his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interests in this, he was obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her Majesty, as being her Servant, that it was not the Custom of <hi>Spain</hi> for the Ladies to have such free access into the Queens Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that generally they were introduced by the <hi>Camerara Major</hi> only. The Queen listned to this Advice the Chief Minister sent her, but had no Inclinations to follow it, because she found he designed to subject her intirely to the Dutchess <hi>d' Albuquerque</hi> after the same manner as she had been to the Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She knew that in all the differences he had with the Queen-Mother the <hi>Camerara Major</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways declared for him, that she embraced his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests with more Zeal than her own, and that she had clearly forgotten all that the Queen-Mother had done for her to advance her to this place. The Queen had no desire to throw her self again into a Captivity, from which she had lately got her self delivered with so much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Thus she was content to examine the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52224:210"/>
Motives which made them set so many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues on foot, but had no mind to be the Victim.</p>
            <p>The Duke had so pressing a desire to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the sole Affections of his Master, that he could never forgive those Persons who were in a Capacity to become his Rivals; and he added a certain Air of Sincerity to his Words, whenever he spoke ill of any one, that the King was really perswaded he had no private by-ends in doing it: His Relations, nay, even his Friends had no more Priviledges than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were indifferent to him. The Duke was believed, because he always passed for an honest Gentleman; but one ought to have a great Fund of Vertue, not to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted when he becomes a Favourite. He represented to the King, all those that came near his Person, as so many secret Enemies and Domestick Spies, who had neither Zeal nor Affection for him: And these Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wrought so far upon the King's Spirit, that he was scarce ever able to wear them off. The Duke not only did ill Offices to those that belonged to the King's Houshold, but he extended his Malice to all those who were able to maintain any Intelligence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Queen and the Queen-Mother. He was perswaded, that the Ambassador of <hi>France</hi> and his Lady, contributed to it all that lay in their Power; and this made him conceive an Aversion for them both: He spoke of them daily to the King, after a very disobliging manner, and laid several things to their charge
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52224:211"/>
wherein they were not concerned. This made the King so mightily displeased with them, that he could not forbear to tell the Queen one Day, as they accidentally talked of the Marquess <hi>de Villars,</hi> 
               <q>That he had poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned all the Court, and that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse to have an open War with <hi>France,</hi> than such an Ambassador at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               </q> He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this let fall some reflecting Words against the Ambassador's Lady, which sufficiently te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified what strange Thoughts he had of her, although we may safely say, that neither she nor her Husband deserved it. But the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the Chief Minister was so provok'd against them, was, because he was well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the Prince <hi>de Stillano,</hi> the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Veraguas,</hi> the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Castile,</hi> and some others, had seen him in private, and communicated to him their Designs against him, to which he was to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute something on his side, by getting the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>een to support the Project. But suppose the Ambassador really knew of their Intentions, this is no good Consequence, that he was willing to second them; and indeed there is little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability to believe it, because the Ambassador had no Reason to desire the Removal of the Chief Minister; and the Duke's Abilities were not so formidable, that the Court of <hi>France</hi> had any occasion to be apprehensive of him.</p>
            <p>While the Court at <hi>Madrid</hi> was thus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about the little Intrigues I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the People continued to cry out and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52224:211"/>
of their Grievances, because no care was taken to redress them. It was now a full year since the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had been made Chief Minister, and it was hoped that he would have taken all necessary measures in a matter so pressing and important, as was the easing of the People; but he so far forgot his Duty, that every thing went worse and worse still; and indeed the least Inconveniencies sensibly improve in their malignity, when they are neglected. The lessening the Value of the Copper-Money had occasioned a great Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: 'Tis true indeed it might have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged to the Publick Advantage, but they took such wrong measures in the Regulation, that it became a most horrible Oppression; for the Species of Gold and Silver being thus reduced to one half of its just Value, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners took such hold of this opportunity, that they exported prodigious Sums out of the Kingdom. Besides this, the Price of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govia</hi> Wooll, which is an excellent Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and brings a mighty Profit to those that deal in it, rose in proportion to the Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Money; so that no body would buy it, unless they would sink the Price: And things being in this condition, then at last came the crying down of the Money, and this totally compleated and ratified their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. There was computed to be of it to the Value of Six Millions of Crowns. The King did not at all take them off, although he had promised by his Edict, to pay the full Value of the Metal, to those who brought them into
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52224:212"/>
the Offices appointed to receive them. So all this Money lay absolutely dead: and it is no easie' matter to express the Loss which the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, the Merchants, the King's Farmers, and almost every private Man suffered by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying of it down. Forreigners were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men that made Advantage of this General Misfortune of <hi>Spain</hi>: They bought this Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Money, that was mixt with a good Allay of Silver, for very little, and sent it to <hi>Genoa,</hi> to <hi>Portugal,</hi> and other Places. The Council very well knew the Prejudice the Kingdom received by it, and Assembled several times to find out an Expedient to put a stop to it: There were some Undertakers, that offered to treat for all of it, and separate the Silver from the Copper; and, as I said before, <hi>Don Philip Vinzani,</hi> was made choice of in this Affair; but he had not been preferred before others, if it had not been for the Credit of <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro de Arragon.</hi> This Man owed him great Sums of Money, and had been twice Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and was just upon the Point of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the third time; so he was desirous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce him into some great business, that he might by this means enrich himself, and be in a capacity of paying his Debts: But this Project did not succeed, because so great a quantity of this Money was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy carried out of the Kingdom, and the separating of the Allay was so difficult a matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:52224:212"/>These Losses were the cause that abundance of Persons of great Quality found themselves under a necessity of selling their Plate and Jewels. 'Tis true, there is so much both of the one and the other at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well fail in a long time. What made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral private Men suffer the more, was, that the Rents of the Town-Hall, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from eight to five in the hundred, were not now paid at all, because the <hi>Corregidors</hi> and <hi>Regidors,</hi> who were concerned in the payment of it, were such great Villains, that although the City was sufficiently harassed with Customs, Taxes, and heavy Duties, before these People had drained it as long as they pleased, and that they had put some small in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable matter of it into the King's Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, there was nothing left more out of so many Imposts, and yet they were not levied for the greatest part, but under the pretence of satisfying the Rents of the Town-Hall.</p>
            <p>But how was it possible to put things, as they now stood, into a better Order? It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that there should not be above four <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidors;</hi> there had been more than fifty, and their Places were worth sixty thousand Crowns. It is certain, that before they could reimburse themselves of such a Sum, they must be guilty of great Extortion and Cheating.</p>
            <p>An Order was sent from <hi>Madrid</hi> to all the Ports to publish Reprisals in favour of the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels belonging to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi> I have already spoke of the Vessel which that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52224:213"/>
Elector's Subjects had taken away from his Catholick Majesty. The Elector had allowed three Months to redeem her, but they were not in a condition to do it. The Ambassadors of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> laboured to Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the Businesss with no Success, because the Elector declared he would be paid his Eight Hundred Thousand Crowns that were due to him, and he would restore nothing but upon that condition. And therefore the Court would rather suffer him to enjoy his Prize: however, to save the Honour of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Ministers pretended that the King would have his Vessel restored before he would do any thing, and that he refused to hearken to any other Proposal, till that were executed.</p>
            <p>The Queen-Mother, who seldom stirred abroad, and who lived a very Melancholy Life at her Palace, invited the Young Queen one day to Dinner, when the King was gone out a Hunting: They afterwards shut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up in the Queen-Mother's great Closet, and (as she told the Marchioness <hi>de Mortare,</hi> from whom I afterwards had the Story) they began to weep, and embrace one another ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tenderly. The Queen-Mother complained, <hi>That the Queen her Daughter-in-law, had preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced the King against her, and that she suffered as great a Confinement, as if</hi> Don Juan <hi>did still Govern; that she was not ignorant that the Duke</hi> de Medina Celi, d' Eguya, <hi>and the Confessor did her all the ill Offices they were able; that if she had only these to Combat, she would endeavour to destroy them; that perhaps she might be able to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52224:213"/>
accomplish it; but that when she saw the Queen at the Head of the Party, she had no Courage left to defend her self; that although she very well knew she had promised to do her all the injury she could, yet she could not forbear to speak to her of it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ease her self, than out of any hopes to soften her dispositions. Alas, Madam, Alas,</hi> cryed the Young Queen all in Tears, <hi>why do you add such stabbing Suspicions to the other ills you have done me? Could you not be content to poyson my Conduct before the King, and make him shew me a thousand sensible unkindnesses upon that score, but must you insult upon me too, and accuse me of the only thing in the World I am uncapable of doing?</hi> At these words the Queen-Mother stretched out her Arms to her, and they tarried a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable space of time without being able to speak a Syllable, so much were both their minds prepossessed against each other: But at last, when they could speak in cold Blood, and came to examine what had been said on both sides, they were sensible that some ill Persons had endeavoured to disunite them, in order to Fortifie their own Party, which was equally contrary to them both. They gave one another an Account of the measures that had been taken, of the Persons that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hose whom they ought to suspect for the ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to come, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to employ all their Interest to destroy the opposite Cabal. They staid together till it was Night, and on the next day, which was the fifth of <hi>February,</hi> the Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> gave the King and the two Queens a Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52224:214"/>
Collation, accompanied with Musick. The King's Dwarf, who is one of the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest Creatures in the World, whom the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable brought with him from his Government of <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he succeeded <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> danced a <note n="*" place="margin">A Ground.</note> 
               <hi>Passa Cailla</hi> along with a young Girl whom the Queen had taken to her Service, and was newly redeemed out of Slavery. They were both of them dress'd after the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Fashion, covered with Feathers of Birds of different colours; they had little Tabors, and played prettily upon them. This Feast was followed by another at the House of <hi>Don Pedro d' Arragon,</hi> where the Queen danced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, which she had never done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although she acquitted her self that way to admiration. She had purposely learned the <hi>Canaries</hi> and a <hi>Saraband,</hi> so that the King was perfectly charmed to see her so expert in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dances, and told her several times as he pressed her Arms with his two Hands, <hi>Mi Reina, Mi Reina, eres la mas perfeta de todo el Orbe:</hi> That is to say, <hi>My Queen, My Queen, you are the most accomplished Person in the whole World.</hi> The Queen-Mother sent her that Evening a Watch all adorned with Diamonds, and a Gold Chain of exquisite Work; she writ a Letter to her, wherein she wished that this Watch would only shew her happy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Hours. The Queen returned her this Answer, That they would be always so, if she would continue to love her. She after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards desired the King to tell her some tender
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52224:214"/>
thing, that she might send it to the Queen-Mother. The King told her immediately, <hi>No tengo que desir.</hi> How, Sir, says the Queen, have you nothing to say to the Queen your Mother? I beseech you to give me a Complement that may please her. The King studied a long time what to send her, and at last said, <hi>Ponga os mi Reina que jo tongo busna salud.</hi> That is to say, <hi>Write, my Queen, that I am well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King dispatched an Order to Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> to make a grand Reform amongst the Officers of War and Justice. He gave at the same time the Vice-Roy-ship of <hi>Navar</hi> to the Great Prior of <hi>Castile.</hi> The Count <hi>de Fuen Salida,</hi> who possessed that Post, went to <hi>Gallicia,</hi> whereof he was made Vice-Roy. The Count <hi>de Palma,</hi> Nephew to Cardinal <hi>Portocarero,</hi> had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Malaga,</hi> and the Coasts of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> in the room of the Count <hi>de Cifuentes</hi>; and the Duke <hi>de Hijar,</hi> Son-in-law to the Dutchess <hi>de Terra-Nova,</hi> obtained the Vice-Roy-ship of <hi>Arragon.</hi> This Dutchess had not appeared at Court ever since she had quitted it with so great a Disgust: But her Son-in-law having now received this new Favour, she was resolved to go and visit the Queen on the tenth of <hi>February.</hi> She had already sent to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to demand her Permission, and the Queen sent her word, that she should be glad to see her. The Dutchess at her entrance into the Queen's Chamber, seemed at first a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered: She excused her not coming to Court upon the account of a long Fit of Sickness,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52224:215"/>
and then added, <hi>I assure your Majesty I did not think I should have been able to live, after my misfortune to be separated from you.</hi> The Queen told her, that she had been informed of her Indisposition, but that this was not a place for her to speak of what made her uneasie, and in effect passed to some other Discourse. The Dutchess <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> fixed her Eyes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on the Dutchess <hi>d' Albuquerque,</hi> as if she had a mind to devour her; and the Dutchess <hi>d' Albuquerque,</hi> whose Eyes were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better nor sweeter than hers, looked askew upon her, and they let fall every other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment some Expressions that were a little eager.</p>
            <p>One of the Footmen belonging to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Ambassador had committed some Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the Justices ordered him to be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for it: but this Minister pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was against the Priviledge of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, complained of it to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> but did not receive so favourable an Answer from him as he expected. This so much disgusted him, that he went to acquaint the rest of the Ambassadors with it, who all agreed to represent the Consequences of such an Action to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> in a large Memorial conceived in very harsh terms, which they sent to him all at the same time. The Chief Minister carried it to the Council of State, who, after they had maturely delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Affair, were of Advice that they should set the Footman immediately at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Ambassadors were resolved, in case
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52224:215"/>
they had refused them this Satisfaction, to have forced the Prison to fetch him out.</p>
            <p>Constable <hi>Colonna</hi> came back to <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>February.</hi> The most important Affair that brought him thither, was his desire to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate Matters with his Lady, and to find out a way for both of them to live in peace. The Marriage of his Son with the Daughter of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> did also take him up very much. The Queen was concerned at the Misfortunes of his Wife, and it was no small trouble to her to understand what ill Usage a Person of her Quality recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Prison: Nay, she was particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to protect her, by reason of the Promise the Duke had made her, and the Confidence the Constable's Lady reposed in it. These Reasons engaged her to charge her Confessor to do all he could with the Constable, in order to Negotiate an Accommodation, and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would carry her into <hi>Italy,</hi> or suffer her to stay in some Religious Convent at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> as she had already been. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable and his Wife were strangely exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against one another: She resented to the Life the unworthy Treatment she had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the mutual occasions they had to complain, hindered them from consenting to what might contribute to their common Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. At last, the Constable being ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly importuned by the Queen, and advised by the Marquess <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> proposed, that his Wife should turn a Religious, and that he, for his part, should take the Habit of a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52224:216"/>
Knight of <hi>Malta.</hi> This at first appeared very surprising to all the World, but indeed was more strange to the Constable's Lady than to any one; for 'tis certain she had no great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to that Life, and her Inclination did not very well relish three mortifying Vows, an austere Cloystering, and a severe Rule. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, the Constable was so positive, that all his Wive's Friends were satisfied there was no other Way to deliver the Unfortunate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy out of the Castle of <hi>Segovia,</hi> but by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her to give her Consent to what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. Thus at last they prevailed upon her to consent to it; so she was brought back to <hi>Madrid</hi> on the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1681. where she immediately was shut up amongst the Nuns of the Conception of the Order of St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome.</hi> She was so afflicted at her Misfortunes, that she would see no body but her Children: She told them, she looked upon her self to be the most Unfortunate Creature in the World, and that she was going to do a thing which might cost her the Repose of her Life; That she beheld the Consequences of it with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, but that nevertheless she was resolved to undergo it, because she had given her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. In effect, she went down into the Quire, where every thing was prepared for the Ceremony, and she took upon her the Habit of a Novice, but with a formal design to die rather than make Profession. She wore a Petticoat of Gold and Silver Brocard, under her Woollen Robe, and when she was not in company with any of the Nuns, she would
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52224:216"/>
throw her Veil aside, and put a Coif upon her Head, after the <hi>Spanish</hi> Mode, drest with Ribbons of all Colours. Sometimes it so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that the Bell rung to Chappel, where she was obliged to make her Appearance by the Rule of her Order; and the Mistress of the Novices coming to inform her of it, she clapt on her Frock and Veil over her Ribans and her loose Hair; This made a very odd and Comical Figure, and no body could have forborn laughing at it, had not her Miseries on the other hand, drawn the Compassion of all Persons that knew her; for indeed her Condition was very necessitous; she wanted Money, had but mean Eating, and yet worse Lodging. One Day as I happened to be in the Queen's Retinue, I entred into the Convent, and the Constable's Lady carried me to her Chamber; I was like to have been starved with the Cold there; it was as high as a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis-Court; and, not to flatter the Place it was no better than a great Barn. The Constable got a Dispensation from <hi>Rome</hi> to hasten the time of her Profession; and he himself was obliged, as I have already said, to take the Vows of the Order of <hi>Malta,</hi> but he was told every day, that his Wife had an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable Aversion to become a Religious, and at last had no hopes of it: The Marquess <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> as well as the Marchioness, were not a little concerned to be laught at by all the World. The Constable concluded the Marriage of his Eldest Son with the Daughter of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and parted three
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52224:217"/>
days after to return to <hi>Rome</hi>: He carried his Sister in Law, and his two Sons along with him. As for his Lady, she still carried in the Convent, where she wore the Habit of a Religious long enough, and at last quitted it.</p>
            <p>The King and Queen went to the <hi>Iesuites Colledge,</hi> to see a Tragedy, where a Young Scholar, who Personated a Fury, coming upon the Theatre with a lighted Torch in his Hand, perceived his Tutor in a corner, who Acted a Chymist; in all appearance he bore him a Grudge; for he run after him, and burnt his Beard and Hair, and pursued him like a real Fury indeed. He play'd his part so well, that the King was mightily pleased with him, and would needs have them begin that Scene again, because it was the prettiest in the Play. The Scholar desired it with all his heart, but neither his Tutor, nor any of the Colledge, had a mind to be concerned in the other part. The <hi>Carnival</hi> approached, and a Comedy was play'd the Three last Days of it at Court. On the 19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which was <hi>Ash-Wednesday,</hi> the King had a Solemn Service at the Chappel Royal, and ordered the Ambassadors to be told, that he would continue to have one every Week, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Holyday-Week.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> applied himself seriously to find out means to set a Fleet to Sea by the Spring, and treated with some of the principal Bankers of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> whose Names were <hi>Dominico Grillo, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52224:217"/>
de Monserato,</hi> and <hi>Ambrosio Dionis.</hi> The first engaged to send a Hundred Thousand Piasters a Month to <hi>Flanders,</hi> the second to remit Fifty Thousand to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and the third Thirty Thousand to <hi>Navar.</hi> But what signified all these Treaties, since they were not in a Condition to furnish necessary Funds? The Court received Advice from <hi>Naples,</hi> from whence they expected some Supplies in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, That the Prince <hi>de Belvidere,</hi> and several of the principal Barons, were retired to their respective Countrey-Houses, by Reason of the great Disorders and Misery of that City. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, they were informed, that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Trapan,</hi> and of Two other Cities in that Kingdom, had made an Insurrection, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Governour and Judges, and at the same time had sent to demand Assistance of the <hi>Turks.</hi> This News found but an Unwelcome Reception at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There arrived also at Court a Deputy of the Commerce at <hi>Sevil,</hi> with whom I had a long Conversation. He assured me, that that great and stately City was reduced to a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which amazed all the World; That there did not now remain one Fourth Part of its Inhabitants; That the Imposts increased e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and that this City, which but about Fifty years ago, was one of the Richest in the Universe, was now ready to sink for want of Relief, although the Gallions arrived there, and it still enjoy'd the most considerable Trade of any Place in <hi>Spain.</hi> We may hence justly conclude, in what a sad condition the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52224:218"/>
rest of the Cities of <hi>Spain</hi> were reduced to, since the best of them was almost ruined. This Reason obliged me to enquire of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gentleman, who was well acquainted in those Affairs, what the Revenues of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> might amount to? He told me, That in ready Money only, which came from the <hi>Indies,</hi> they amounted to Thirty Millions, and Eight Hundred Thousand Ducats, which in <hi>French</hi> Money is worth somewhat more than Seventy five Millions of Livres: But then it ought to be observed, that the King does not touch a third part of this Sum, the greatest part of it being either otherwise engaged or purloined; And yet out of this third part are to be defrayed the Expences of the Palace, the Pensions his Majesty bestows, and the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Armies. He is likewise obliged to be still sending considerable Sums to <hi>Milan,</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> to <hi>Messina,</hi> to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and to <hi>Flanders:</hi> For the Vice-Roys and Governours take effectual care that the King shall not draw a Farthing out of those Kingdoms and Provinces; they keep all the Profits to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And this is the Reason why Money is so often wanting, even for the necessary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the King's House. But after all, I can by no means be perswaded, but that he is Richer than he is generally supposed to be; for there is no probability that otherwise he could be able to give, as he does, such consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Pensions, and so much in standing Wages, to so vast a number of People. It is true, these Liberalities so mightily incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52224:218"/>
him, that about the beginning of the Year 1681. all the Livery-men of the Stables having waited Two Years together for their Wages, left the King's Service on the same day, and looked abroad to get a Livelihood; so that his Horses had no body to look after them, or give them Corn. This appeared so much the less surprising, because the Table of the Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber, was absolutely laid aside, although it was the only one the King kept in his Palace. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that waited upon the Queen had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter luck, and the Court could not be supplied with Money enough to defray the least Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. This Extremity lasted for a while, and then things were established as formerly. But what is very remarkable, and deserves the last Commendation, the Souldiers, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this Misery, continued still in the Service; although there were several Officers, nay, entire Regiments of them that had not received two Months pay in three Years. However this was the reason that abundance of Garrisons were ill provided with men, and in a very bad Condition, and particularly on the side of <hi>Estra Madura,</hi> where nevertheless it was their Interest to have been more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, because the <hi>Portugueses</hi> had very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Posts in that part of the Country.</p>
            <p>We saw the Governours of St. <hi>Sebastian, Bilboa,</hi> and <hi>Fontarabia</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who came on purpose to acquaint the Council of War, that their Souldiers died of hunger, that the youngest of them had deserted, that none but
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52224:219"/>
the old and infirm were left behind in the Garrisons; and that in a short time there would be none of these left, unless they gave them a speedy Relief. They had fair Promises made them, they returned back, but were forgotten as well as a great number of others.</p>
            <p>It is indeed surprizing, and cannot easily be believed, that in this very <hi>Spain,</hi> so excessive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poor and exhausted, as it seems to be, the <hi>Flota</hi> from the <hi>Indies</hi> only, in the year 1680. brought thirty Millions of Gold. But of these prodigious Summs that arrive there every year, we must deduct near two thirds which the Forreigners draw away for the several Goods they furnish them with; and besides there is a way found to cheat the King of the fifth Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which is due to him out of all the Silver that comes from the <hi>Indies.</hi> There is another thing still behind that contributes exceedingly to make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> so destitute of Money as they are, and that is the prodigious number of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> who come to help them, whether in the tillage of the Ground, or in their Buildings, or any other things of a more servile Nature, which the <hi>Don Diegos</hi> and the <hi>Don Rodriguez</hi> think so much below them, either out of a Principle of Vanity or Idleness, that they had rather chuse to starve, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to set about them. But Foreigners are not so nice and delicate, they come hither, and when they have scraped a little Mony to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they return to their own Country, in the mean time others come in their room; and are employed in the same work. They are
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52224:219"/>
computed generally to be full forty thousand, who come in and go out of the Kingdom after this manner, and there is not one of them who does not carry away with him seven or eight Pistoles every year, and sometimes more. It is easie to judge that this arises to a prodigious Summ.</p>
            <p>The People still continued to cry out and exclaim, and at last the Duke fatigu'd with the great business he had upon his hands, and with these continual Complaints, resolved to erect a Juncto to set things in Order again, and endeavour to relieve the present Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He cast his Eyes upon a Person of great Abilities, whose Name was <hi>Don Lopez de los Rios,</hi> and whose Vertue and Experience were sufficiently known, for he had always bore some Office either in the Civil Government, or the Finances. He at first shew'd a great Zeal, and the heat of this Zeal did not at all abate in his Mind, but he found himself not strong enough to cope with all the Enemies alone, whom he must expect to create by a severe and steady Conduct. Several Persons, nay even the Ministers interested in these Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, directly thwarted him, and by this means destroyed all that he had established with so much Pains and Industry.</p>
            <p>On the 23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> a private Act of the Inquisition was performed in the Church of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> where twenty Persons were condemned for being guilty of Superstition, Sorcery, and Judaism. The Duke <hi>de Villa Hermosa,</hi> who came back from <hi>Flanders,</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52224:220"/>
about this time at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the Duke <hi>d' Hijar</hi> parted from thence to go to <hi>Saragossa,</hi> and take Possession of the Viceroyship of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon.</hi> Two days after this, which was the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the Marquess <hi>du Mondejar</hi> was made a Grandee of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>d' Ossone</hi> who now began to be weary of not supplying his Place himself, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired some of his Friends to intercede with the King in his behalf that he might come to Court; and the King consented to it, with this Proviso, that he should perform his Duty better for the time to come. The Count <hi>de Pouar,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Montiel</hi> were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Court; both of them were passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love with <hi>Donna Francisca d' Alcannicas,</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Honour to the Queen, and Niece to the Constable of <hi>Castile.</hi> The Count <hi>de Pouar</hi> was under her Chamber Window, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her there with his Fingers as is the manner of <hi>Spain,</hi> and told her a Story very much to the disadvantage of the Count <hi>de Montiel,</hi> who lay hid in a corner where he saw and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood all, so that coming towards the Count <hi>de Pouar</hi> all enraged, with his hand upon the guard of the Sword, he told him he was a persidious Villain, and that he might thank his good Fortune for being in the Palace. The Count <hi>de Pouar</hi> coldly answered, that he would go out of it as soon as he had told <hi>Donna Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisca</hi> two or three things he had still to say to her, and that he came seasonably enough to be a Witness of them, because they concerned him. The Count <hi>de Montiel</hi> transported with
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52224:220"/>
Choler, was upon the point of drawing his Sword upon his Rival. But the Duke <hi>d' Usseda,</hi> Brother to <hi>Donna Francisca,</hi> passing by that way with the Count <hi>d' Altamire,</hi> she made them a sign to draw near, and told them with her Fingers what had hapned. The two Lords laboured all they could to make up the quarrel between the two Rivals, and succeeded in it; however this Accident could not be kept so secret but that the King being informed of it, forbid them the Court.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Sejar</hi> parted from hence to go and serve in <hi>Flanders</hi> in quality of a Volunteer. He was a Person of Illustrious Birth, very rich, and very young; the reason he did this was only because he was jealous of his Lady. The Count <hi>de Talara</hi> had the Place of Judge of the Forrests conferred upon him, which was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant by the Death of the Marquess <hi>de la Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de;</hi> and <hi>Don Francisco de Manserato</hi> obtained the Title of Marquess <hi>de Tamarit.</hi> The King ordered the Council to discharge all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of the Impositions, that are laid upon the Provinces: These Officers were above a thousand, and the suppressing of them must needs be of great advantage to his Catholick Majesty, and to his Subjects.</p>
            <p>A Vessel which came to <hi>Cales</hi> from the <hi>Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duras,</hi> brought News that the <hi>Flota</hi> was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily arrived on the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> and that the Merchants of <hi>Lima</hi> offered three hundred thousand Crowns to the King, on condition that for an year and half he would not send the Gallions here. In the mean time ill Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52224:221"/>
hindred the Fleet, which had set sail from <hi>Cales</hi> a little before, from doubling the Cape of St. <hi>Vincent</hi>; the bad effects of this Tempest were not only perceived at Sea, for it was so violent in all parts of <hi>Castile,</hi> that several Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were beaten down, and the exceeding Rains so swelled the Rivers, that the Roads were o'reflown, and almost all the Bridges carried away by the rapidity of the Waters.</p>
            <p>This ill News was followed immediately by three Couriers, one upon the neck of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the first of them arrived on the 13<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> from Abbot <hi>Masserati,</hi> Envoy of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Portugal.</hi> He dispatched them to inform the Council, that they had received Advice at <hi>Lisbon</hi> by a Vessel, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Buenosaires,</hi> having got together abundance of <hi>Indians,</hi> had joyned them to his Garrison; that on the 15<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 1680. he had surprized the Fort which the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses</hi> had began to build in the Isle of St. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel;</hi> that he had taken the Governour Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and cut the Garrison in pieces; that the Prince-Regent, being provoked at this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, had assembled the Council of State, where the Queen of <hi>Portugal</hi> was present; that they had re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olved to raise the Militia, and send 400 Horse, and four Regiments of Old Soldiers into <hi>Estramadura</hi>; that it would be necessary to get Magazines ready on the Frontiers, and to have a General Rendezvous at <hi>Eluas</hi>; that having demanded Audience of the Prince-Regent, he had refused it him, and that in all probability a War would ensue. 'Twas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52224:221"/>
at Court that the Envoy of <hi>Portugala</hi> would make his Complaints, but they were extreamly surprized to see him take no notic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of it at all: so now it was not doubted, bu that this silence certainly presaged a surprize of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Territories, like to that which the Governour of <hi>Buenosaires</hi> had committed in the <hi>Indies</hi> upon the <hi>Portugueses.</hi> The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters judged it convenient to prevent this blow, and spoke to the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador about it, desiring him to represent to the Envoy of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> that the King of <hi>England</hi> would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take up Arms against him who first broke the Peace, whereof he was Guarrantee; that he had also a more particular Reason than this, forasmuch as by the League that was concluded between the King his Master and his Catholick Majesty, they had mutually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to Declare against the Enemy that fell upon either of them. This Discourse was spoke with a great deal of heat; but the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of <hi>Portugal</hi> answered him, That he looked upon him to be a Partisan of the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> rather than an Ambassador from the King of <hi>England;</hi> that he knew very well he spoke without Order, and of his own Head: This Answer was followed by a Protestation in Writing, wherein it was declared, that the King of <hi>England</hi> could not upon any Reason whatever hinder the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> from using the Right of Reprisals, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get Satisfaction from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for the Injuries received.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:52224:222"/>A little after this, the Envoy of <hi>Portugal</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Order from the Prince-Regent to demand Publick Audience upon this Occasion; and told his Catholick Majesty, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an entire Satisfaction from him, and that the Prince-Regent desired, that they would set the Souldiers and Governour at Liberty; that they would punish those of <hi>Buenosaires</hi>; that they would restore the Ammunition and Cannon; that if the Fort were razed, they would rebuild it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else surrender the place; that in case the Prisoners were sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> they would set them at Liberty; that they would receive into the Fort of St. <hi>Gabriel</hi> the Garrison which the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> should send thither; that the Governour of <hi>Bueno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saires</hi> should be chastised, and that an Answer be given in within Twenty Days, or else they would begin Actions of Hostility. Upon this the Council met, and spent three days to deliberate about it. They gave Orders for their Forces to march towards the most expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, defenceless places, and <hi>Don Antonio Panya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua,</hi> Master-General of the Camp, was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to stay there, till he saw an end of this Affair.</p>
            <p>Besides they set forth a great Memorial, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were contained the Arguments which the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of <hi>Spain</hi> had given in at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to make it appear by Authentick Papers, that according to the Limits appointed by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. the Isle of St. <hi>Gabriel</hi> belongs to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that they have had it a hundred fourscore and six Years in their possession. After this they took
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52224:222"/>
notice of the Declaration of the Envoy of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ended all with a Protestation, signifying, That they were desirous to preserve the Peace, and that they would labour with all Application in this matter. This <hi>Manifesto</hi> was sent to all the Foreign Ministers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to their Masters; but they had scarce given it to them, when they sent in all hast back again for the Copies to Correct something or other, and then they returned them again. At the same time a Rumour was industriously dispersed, that the <hi>Nuncio</hi> by an express Order from the Pope, had moved them to send an Ambassador to <hi>Lisbon</hi> to treat about an Accomodation. But this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a Temperament they had found out to conceal the true motives which engaged them to make this Advance. The <hi>Nuncio</hi> upon this said openly, that he had never interposed in the business, and that it was impossible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Orders from <hi>Rome</hi> about so fresh an Affair.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Giovenazzo</hi> was chosen for this Embassy. As soon as he was arrived at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> he saw the Prince-Regent, who nominated the Duke <hi>de Cadaval,</hi> and the Marquess <hi>de Fronteyra</hi> for Commissioners. He would have made his Complaints at first, and demanded Satisfaction: But he was told, that they were of a Humour clearly opposite to what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and that matters were to be done conformable to the Memorial which the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of <hi>Portugal</hi> had presented at <hi>Madrid,</hi> or else let the Affair go whither it would for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52224:223"/>
them. After some slight contestations, he gave his consent to it, and dispatched a Courier to <hi>Madrid</hi> to inform the Court of what he had done. Immediately the Ministers bellowed out against him as a Man of no Judgment, who had violated his Fidelity to the King, pretending that he had infringed all the Rules of Prudence and good Sense by a Conduct and an Accommodation so disadvantageous to <hi>Spain,</hi> and that his Instructions furnished him with no such Power. All these Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Indignation and Resentment were only offered to the Honour of the Nation: But notwithstanding all this, they did not lose a moment to conclude the Accommodation, and the Ratification of it was speedily sent to the Duke <hi>de Giovenazzo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Money still continued to be as scarce as ever at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and certain it is that it was the greatest difficulty in the World for the Council to provide a hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns for the King to go to <hi>Aranjuez.</hi> The Ceremonial of the Palace, whereof I have already made mention, orders this Summ precisely to be spent in that small Journey, and here they are so exact to follow it, that they would not for all the World lay out a hundred Pistoles less. But after the Money was once in the King's Coffers, the Council thought to send it to the Forces that were kept on the Borders of <hi>Portugal,</hi> by reason of the late dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about the Isle of St. <hi>Gabriel.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> spoke to the King about it, and proposed that in this juncture they might take
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52224:223"/>
Money where ever they could find it; but he roundly answered him, <hi>Do what you will, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you don't meddle with that which is designed for Aranjuez.</hi> He was not able to go thither all the Autumn, because such a Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as is necessary for that purpose could not be then gotten ready. He began his Journey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of <hi>April</hi> 1681. being not willing to break any of the Customs that are established in the Ceremonial of the Palace: <hi>Philip</hi> II. observed it religiously, and after him the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have look'd upon it as Sacred as a Law. Every thing is there set down, the Processions, the Chases, the Solemn days of Chappel, the changing of their Apartments, their Habits, their Walks, their Journeys, the Presents the Kings make their Mistresses, and what is to become of them when they cease to love them any longer: In a word, there is to be found every thing from the most essential circumstance of State down to the most insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Trifles. The King tarried five Weeks at <hi>Aranjuez.</hi> This Royal House is within seven Leagues of <hi>Madrid.</hi> He goes no where all the year round but there, and to the <hi>Escurial</hi> in <hi>October</hi>: These are his two great Journeys.</p>
            <p>I went thither along with a Relation of mine to take leave of the Queen, and receive her Orders. She had the goodness to promise me her Protection for a young Girl, whom I was to leave behind me in <hi>Spain,</hi> and was very dear to me. She told me she would take her into the Number of her Menines, and that I might assure my self she carried her own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52224:224"/>
along with her, since she came from <hi>France.</hi> She honoured me with her Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in Enamel, incircled with Diamonds, and I sensibly regret the loss of it to this very day. This is not a fit place to tell how this Misfortune hapned to me; perhaps I may still write the Memoirs of another Court, where I resided some time, and which are no less par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular than these; and there I shall have a fit opportunity to speak concerning the Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this lovely Queen.</p>
