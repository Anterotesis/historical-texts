         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am not in condition for many words, and I hope theſe few will be <hi>profitable</hi> to <hi>You,</hi> although the Fruits of a repentance,
very <hi>Late,</hi> as to my <hi>ſelf.</hi> The Damned onely can expreſſe what at this preſent I Feel, betwixt the Horrours of pain,
and Conſcience; and this wretched extremity affords me no other proſpect (without a Miracle) then Death, and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I wiſh that the Agonies I endure, may prevent the greater Sufferings of my Fellow-tranſgreſſours; and that you come
not as well to partake in <hi>My Torments,</hi> as I have done in <hi>your Offences.</hi> Which that you may not doe, <hi>reflect ſeaſonably,</hi> and
<hi>ſeriouſly, with me,</hi> upon the <hi>Rapine, Sacriledge, Perjuries,</hi> and <hi>Murthers,</hi> we have committed <hi>together;</hi> and let This moment be
That of your Returne to your Duty, and Reaſon. Do not trifle with Eternity: it depends upon this Inſtant, and there's no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
from the pit. <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> are your declared <hi>Enemies,</hi> and your courſes are not leſſe <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> then <hi>Impious.</hi>
Your portion even in <hi>This</hi> world, is contempt, and Beggery, and that of the Devils, is to be your Inheritance in the <hi>Next.</hi>
You are couſened of the very Bread you Fight for, and you digg, like the Indians, Naked, to furniſh your unthankfull Maſters
with Treaſure. Your <hi>Liberties, fortunes, Reputations, Lives,</hi> and <hi>Soules,</hi> are but a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to a pack of <hi>Cheates, Cowards,</hi> and <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts:</hi>
and there is not a Sword advanced againſt you, which carries not <hi>Infamy, Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> upon the <hi>Poynt</hi> of it. All <hi>Hands,</hi>
and all <hi>Intereſts</hi> are engaged to your Deſtruction. The whole Nation lookes upon you but as ſo many Wolves, and the very
Sheep you have flayed to cover your ſneaking Villanies, will have their skins again. But this is nothing, compared with the
Impreſſions of Divine Vengeance upon your wounded Souls. God will not be deluded; he knowes, that you underſtand the
Crimes you act; and <hi>the Conſcience of your Sin, ſhall be the Sting</hi> of <hi>your Puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh Gentlmen! I ſpeak to ſuch as have not caſt off <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> with <hi>Chriſtian Religion:</hi> to ſuch, as <hi>have not Sinned</hi> unto
Death: to ſuch, as weare not the <hi>Seale of Reprobation upon their foreheads:</hi> by all the Tenderneſſe you owe to <hi>piety,</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi>
as ever you expect Mercy from Heaven, or Peace upon Earth; I Beg of you; nay I <hi>charge</hi> you; ſpill no more Innocent bloud:
Take this counſel; as you expect an Intereſt, in That, which was ſhed for the world. Betake your ſelves to Teares, and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for what is <hi>paſt.</hi> Reſerve your ſelves for more Honourable, and Needfull Occaſions to employ your Courage, <hi>hereafter.</hi>
That which poſſeſſes you at preſent, is the Spirit of Mutiny, and Sedition, not that of Valour. The time is at hand, which will
both Glorifie your ſervice, and Reward them. <hi>Draw your Swords Then, and you will finde the difference betwixt committing a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and <hi>Offering a Sacrifice.</hi>
