            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Discourse concerning PRAYER
Ex tempore, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Have read over this book which the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Divines is pleased to call <hi>The Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for Prayer,</hi> I confesse I came to it with
much expectation, and was in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
confident, I should have found it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and unblameable modell of Devotion, free from all
those objections which men of their owne perswasion
had obtruded against the publike Liturgy of the Church
of England; or at least, it should have been composed
with so much artifice and finenesse, that it might have
beene to all the world, an argument of their learning
and excellency of spirit, if not of the goodnesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of their religion and purposes. I shall give no
other character of the whole, but that the publike dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relish
which I finde amongst persons of great piety, of
all qualities, not onely of great, but even of ordinary
understandings, is to me some argument that it lyes so
open to the objections even of common spirits, that the
compilers of it did intend more to prevaile by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of their Armies, then the strength of reason, and
the proper grounds of perswasion, which yet most wise
and good man believe to be the more Christian way of
the two. But Sir you have engaged me to say something
in particular to satisfie your conscience. In which also I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113924:3"/>
desire I may reserve a leave to my self to conceal much,
if I may in little do you satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I shall therefore decline to speak of the Efficient cause
of this Directory, and not quarrell at it that it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
against the Lawes both of <hi>England</hi> and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome.
If the thing were good and pious, I should
learne to submit to the imposition, and never quarrell
at the incompetency of his authority that ingaged me to
doe pious and holy things. And it may be when I am a
little more used to it, I shall not wonder at a Synod, in
which not one Bishop sits (in the capacity of a Bishop)
though I am most certaine this is the first, example in
<hi>England,</hi> since it was first Christned. But for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it seemes somthing hard to digest it, because I know
so well that all Assemblyes of the Church have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Priests to consultation and dispute, but never to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and decision, till the Pope-enlarging the phyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteries
of the Archimandrites and Abbots, did somtimes
by way of priviledge and dispensation give to some of
them decisive voyces in publike Councells. But this
was one of the things in which he did innovate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
against the publike resolutions of Christendome,
though he durst not doe it often, and when he did it, it
was in very small and inconsiderate numbers.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I said I would not meddle with the Efficient, and I
cannot meddle with the Finall cause, nor guesse at any
other ends and purposes of theirs then at what they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
professe, which is the abolition and destruction
of the Book of Common-Prayer, which great change,
because they are pleased to call Reformation, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in charity to beleeve they think it so, and that they
have <hi>Zelum Dei,</hi> but whether <hi>secundum scientiam,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to knowledge or no, must be judged by them who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113924:3"/>
consider the matter and the forme.</p>
            <p>But because the matter is of so great variety and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
consideration, every part whereof would require as
much scrutiny as I purpose to bestow upon the whole, I
have for the present chosen to consider onely the forme
of it; and because it pretends against the forme of set
Lyturgie, and that <hi>ex tempore</hi> forms doe succeed in room
of the established and determined services, I shall give
you my judgement of it, without any sharpnesse or bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
of spirit, for I am resolved not to be angry with
any men of another perswasion, as knowing that I differ
just as much from them as they doe from me.</p>
            <p>And first I consider that the true state of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
is onely this, Whether it is better to pray to God with
consideration or without? whether is the wiser man of
the two, he who thinks and deliberates what to say, or
he that utters his mind as fast as it comes? Whether is
the better man, he who out of reverence to God is most
carefull and curious that he offend not in his tongue, and
therefore he himselfe deliberates and takes the best
guides he can, or he who out of the confidence of his
owne abilities or other exteriour assistances, speakes
what ever comes uppermost?</p>
            <p>And here I have the advice and councell of a very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
wise man, no lesse than <hi>Solomon. Eccles.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Be not rash
with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any thing
before God, for God is in heaven and thou upon earth, therfore let
thy words be few.</hi> The consideration of the vast distance
between God and us, heaven and earth, should create
such apprehensions in us, that the very best and choycest
of our offertoryes are not acceptable but by Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
vouchsafeing and condescension: and therefore
since we are so much indebted to God for accepting our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113924:4"/>
best it is not safe venturing to present him with a dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baked
sacrifice, and put him off with that which in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and humane consideration is absolutely the worst,
for such is all the crude and imperfect utterance of our
more imperfect conceptions. But let <hi>Solomons</hi> reason
be what it will, good we are sure it is. Let us consider
who keepes the precept best; He that deliberates or he
that considers not but when he speakes: What man in
the world is hasty <hi>to offer any thing before God,</hi> if he be not
who prayes <hi>ex tempore?</hi> And then adde to it but the
weight of <hi>Solomons</hi> reason, and let any man answer me
if he thinkes it can well stand with that reverence we
owe to the Immense, the infinite, and to the eternall
God, the God of wisdome, to offer him a sacrifice
which we durst not present to a Prince, or a prudent
Governour in <hi>reseriâ,</hi> such as our prayers ought to
be.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And that this may not be dashed with a pretence it is
carnall reasoning, I desire it may be remembred, that
it is the argument God himselfe uses against lame, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and imperfect sacrifices, <hi>Goe and offer this to thy
Prince,</hi> See if he will accept it: Implying, that the best
person is to have the best present; and what the Prince
will slight as truely unworthy of him, much more is it
unfit for God. For God accepts not of any thing we
give or doe, as if he were betterd by it: for therefore
its estimate is not taken by its relation or naturall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
to him, it is all alike to him, for in it selfe it is
to him as nothing. But God accepts it by its proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and commensuration to us. That which we call our
best, and is truly so in humane estimate, that pleases
God, for it declares that if we had better, we would give
it him. But to reserve the best, sayes too plainly, that we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113924:4"/>
think anything is good enough for him. As therefore
God in the Law would not be served by that which was
imperfect <hi>in genere naturae:</hi> so neither now nor ever will
that please him which is imperfect in <hi>genere morum,</hi> or
<hi>materiâ intellectuali,</hi> when we can give a better.</p>
            <p>Well then, in the nature of the thing, <hi>ex tempore</hi> forms <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
have much the worse of it. But it is pretended that there
is such a thing as the gift of Prayer, a praying with the
Spirit, <hi>Et nescit tarda m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>limina spiritus sancti gratia.</hi> Gods
Spirit (if he pleases) can doe his work as well in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
as in long premeditation. And to this purpose are
pretended those places of Scripture which speak of the
assistance of Gods Spirit in our prayers. <hi>Zeth.</hi> 12. 10.
<hi>And I will poure upon the house of David, and the inhabitants
of Ierusalem, the spirit of grace and supplication.</hi> But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but
the Spirit it selfe maketh intercession for us with groanings that
cannot be uttered, &amp;c.</hi> From whence the Conclusion that
is inferred is in the words of Saint <hi>Paul, That we must pray
with the spirit,</hi> therefore not with set formes, therefore
<hi>ex tempore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Collection is somewhat wild, for there is great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
independence in the severall parts, and much more is in
the Conclusion, then was virtually in the premises. But
such as it is, the Authors of it I suppose will owne it.
And therefore we will examine the maine designe of it,
and then consider the particular meanes of its perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
quoted in the objection.</p>
            <p>It is one of the priviledges of the Gospel, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
of Christs ascension, that the holy Ghost is given
unto the Church, and to become to us the fountaine of
gifts and graces. But these gifts and graces are improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113924:5"/>
and helps of our naturall faculties, of our art and
industry, not extraordinary, miraculous, and immediate
infusions of habits and gifts. That without Gods Spirit
we cannot pray aright; that our infirmities need his
help; that we know not what to aske of our selves, is
most true: and if ever any Heretique was more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his owne naturals, or did ever more undervalue
Gods grace then ever the Pelagian did, yet he denyes
not this. But what then? Therefore without study, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
art, without premeditation, without learning, the
spirit gives the gift of prayer, and it is his grace that
without any naturall or artificiall help makes us pray <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore?</hi>
No such thing: The Objection proves nothing
of this.</p>
            <p>Here therefore we will joyn issue, whether the gifts
and helps of the Spirit, be immediate infusions of the
Faculties, and powers, and perfect abilityes: Or that he
doth assist us onely by his aydes externall and internall,
in the use of such meanes which God and nature hath
given to man, to ennoble his soule, better his Faculties,
and to improve his understanding? That the aydes of
the holy Ghost are onely assistances to us in the use of
naturall and artificiall meanes I will undertake to prove,
and from thence it will evidently follow, that labour, and
hard study, and premeditation will soonest purchase the
gift of prayer, and ascertain us of the assistance of the
spirit, and therefore set formes of prayer, studyed and
considerd of are in a true and proper sense, and without
enthusiasme, the fruits of the spirit.</p>
            <p>1. Gods Spirit did assist the Apostles by wayes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
and fit for the first institution of Christianity:
but doth assist us now by the expresses of those first as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances
which he gave to them immediately. So
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113924:5"/>
that the holy Ghost is the author of our faith, and
we beleeve with the spirit (it is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> expression)
and yet our beliefe comes by hearing and reading the
holy Scriptures and their interpretations. Now recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
these two together, Faith comes by hearing, and yet
is the gift of the Spirit, and it sayes, that the gifts of the
Spirit are not extasies, and immediate infusions of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
but helps from God to enable us upon the use of
the meanes of his owne appointment to beleeve, to
speak, to understand, to prophecy, and to pray.</p>
            <p>2. And that these are for this reason called gifts, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/>
graces, and issues of the Spirit, is so evident and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

<hi>No man can say that Iesus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost.</hi>
For if the holy Ghost supplyes us with materials, and

the whole edifice to be of him, although the

not give us new faculties, and create another nature,

but meliorates and improves our owne. And what S.
<hi>Paul</hi> said in the Resurrection, is also true in this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>That is not first which is spirituall, but that which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
and then that which is spirituall.</hi> The graces and gifts
of the Spirit are postnate, and are additions to art and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
God directs our councels, opens our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
regulates our will, orders our affections, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
us with objects, and arguments, and opportunities,
&amp; revelations <hi>in scriptis,</hi> and then most when we most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
our owne endeavours, God loving to blesse all the
means, and instruments of his service, whether they be
naturall or acquisite.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> But whosoever shall looke for any other gifts of the
spirit besides the parts of nature helped by industry and
Gods blessing upon it, and the revelations or the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
of matter in holy Scripture, will be very farre
to seeke, having neither reason, promise, nor experience
of his side. For why should the spirit of Prayer be any
other than as the gift and spirit of faith (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls
it, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13.) acquired by humane meanes using di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
aids? that is, by our endeavours in hearing, reading,
Catechizing, desires to obey, and all this blessed and
promoted by God, this produces faith. And if the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Prayer be of greater consequence, and hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of a speciall prerogative, let the first be proved and
the second but shewne in any good record, and then I
will beleeve it too.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> 4. And the parallel of this argument I the rather
urge, because I find praying in the holy Ghost joyned
with graces, which are as much Gods gifts and producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the spirit as any thing in the world, and yet which
the Apostle presses upon us as duties and things put into
our power, and to be improved by our industry, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113924:7"/>
those are faith (in which I before instanced) and charity.
<hi>Epist. Iud. ver.</hi> 20. <hi>But ye (beloved) building up your selves
in your most holy Faith, praying in the holy Ghost, keep your
selves in the love of God.</hi> All of the same consideration,
Faith, and Prayer, and Charity, all gifts of the Spirit, and
yet build up your selves in faith, and keep your selves in
love, and therefore by a parity of reason, improve your
selves in the spirit of prayer, that is, God by his spirit
having supplyed us with matter, let our industry and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operations
<hi>per modum naturae,</hi> improve these gifts, and
build upon this foundation.</p>
            <p>So that in effect praying in the holy Ghost or with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/>
the spirit is nothing but prayer for such things and in
such manner which God by his spirit hath taught us in
holy Scripture. Holy Prayers, Spirituall songs, so the
Apostle calls one part of prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> Eucharisticall or
thanksgiving, that is, prayers or songs which are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<hi>in materiâ.</hi> And if they be called spirituall for
the efficient cause too, the holy Ghost being the author
of them, it comes all to one, for therefore he is the cause
and giver of them, because he hath in his word revealed,
what things we are to pray for, and there also hath taught
us the manner.</p>
            <p>And this is exactly the Doctrine I plainly gather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/>
from the objected words of Saint <hi>Paul, (The spirit helpeth
our infirmities</hi>) How so? it followes immediately, <hi>For
we know not what we should pray for as we ought:</hi> So that
therefore he is the spirit of supplication and prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

in scripture by Prayers, and Psalmes, and Hymnes, and
spirituall songs, and precepts concerning prayer, set
downe in that holy repository of truth and devotion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalues
that inestimable treasure of the spirit; and if it
be sufficiently done there, he that will multiply his hopes
farther, then what is sufficient, may possibly deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but never deceive God, and make him multiply
and continue miracles, to justifie his fancy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> 5. Better it is to follow the Scriptures for our guide,
as in all things else, so in this particular. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 17, 18.
<hi>Take the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Praying
alwayes with all prayer and supplication in the spirit.</hi> The
Word of God is the sword of the Spirit; praying in the
Spirit is one way of using it, indeed the onely way that he
here specifies. Praying in the Spirit then being the using
of this Sword, and this Sword being the Word of God,
it followes evidently, that praying in the Spirit, is praying
in, or according to the Word of God, that is, in the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
rules, and expresses of the Word of God, that
is, of the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> The summe is this. Whatsoever this gift is, or this
spirit of Prayer, it is to be acquired by humane industry,
by learning of the Scriptures, by reading, by conference,
and by whatsoever else faculties are improved, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
inlarged. Gods Spirit hath done his work sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this way, and he loves not either in nature or grace
(which are his two great sanctions) to multiply miracles
when there is no need.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> 6. So that now I demand, Whether or no, since the
expiration of the age of miracles, does not Gods Spirit
most assist us, when we most endeavour and most use the
meanes? He that sayes, No, discourages all men from
reading the Scriptures, from industry, from meditation,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113924:10"/>
from conference, from humane Arts and Sciences, and
from whatsoever else God and good Lawes provoke us
to by proposition of rewards: But if, Yea, (as most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
God will best crown the best endeavours) then the
spirit of Prayer is greatest in him, who (supposing the
like capacities and opportunities) studies hardest, reades
most, practices most religiously, deliberates most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently;
and then by how much want of means, is worse
then the use of means, by so much <hi>ex tempore</hi> Prayers are
worse then deliberate and studyed. Excellent therefore
is the counsell of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep. Chap. 4. ver. 11. If any man
speak, let him speak as the Oracles of God,</hi> (not lightly then
and inconsiderately) <hi>If any man minister, let him doe it as
of the ability which God giveth:</hi> (great reason then to put
all his abilities and faculties to it) and whether of the
two does most likely doe that, he that takes paines, and
considers, and discusses, and so approves and practices a
forme, or he that never considers what he sayes, till he
sayes it, needs not much deliberation to passe a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>7. Lastly, did not the Penmen of the Scripture, write <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/>
the Epistles and Gospels respectively all by the Spirit?
Most certainly, holy men of God <hi>spoke as they were moved
by the holy Ghost,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> And certainly they
were moved by a more immediate motion, and a motion
neerer to an Enthusiasme, then now adayes in the gift
and spirit of Prayer. And yet in the midst of those great
assistances and motions they did use study, art, industry,
and humane abilities. This is more then probable in
the different styles of the severall Books, some being of
admirable art, others lower and plaine. The words
were their own at least sometimes, not the holy Ghosts.
And if the Fathers and Grammarians were not deceived
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113924:11"/>
by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alse Copies, but that they truely did observe, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to be propriety of expression in the language,
sometimes not true Greeke, who will think those errors
or imperfections in Grammar, were (in respect of the
words I say precisely) immediate inspirations and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of the holy Ghost, and not rather their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of industry and humanity. But cleerly some of
their words were the words of <hi>Aratus,</hi> some of <hi>Epimeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
some of <hi>Menander,</hi> some of <hi>S. Paul, [This speak I, not
the Lord, 1 Cor. 7.</hi>] and yet because the holy Ghost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
their memory, improved their understanding,
supplyed to some their want of humane learning, and so
assisted them that they should not commit an error in
fact or opinion, neither in the narrative nor dogmaticall
parts, therefore they writ by the Spirit. Since then we
cannot pretend upon any grounds of probability to an
inspiration so immediate as theirs, and yet their assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which they had from the Spirit did not exclude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
arts, and industry, but that the ablest Scholler did
write the best, much rather is this true in the gifts and
assistances we receive, and particularly in the gift of
Prayer, it is not an <hi>ex tempore</hi> and an inspired faculty, but
the faculties of nature and the abilities of art and industry
are improved and ennobled by the supervening assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> And now let us take a man that pretends he hath the
gift of Prayer, and loves to pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi> I suppose his
thoughts goe a little before his tongue; I demand then,
Whether cannot this man, when it is once come into his
head, hold his tongue, and write downe what he hath
conceived? If his first conceptions were of God, and
Gods Spirit, then they are so still, even when they are
written. Or is the Spirit departed from him, upon the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113924:11"/>
sight of a pen and Ink-horne? It did use to be otherwise
among the old and new Prophets, whether they were
Prophets of Prediction, or of ordinary Ministery. But if
his conception may be writt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, and being writt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n is still
a production of the Spirit, then it followes that set forms
of Prayer deliberate and described, may as well be a
praying with the Spirit, as sudden formes and <hi>ex tempore</hi>
out-lets.</p>
            <p>Now the case being thus put, I would faine know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/>
what the difference is betweene deliberate and <hi>ex tempore</hi>
Prayers, save onely that in these there is lesse considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and prudence; for that the other are (at least as
much as them) the productions of the Spirit, is evident
in the very case put in this very argument: and whether
to consider and to weigh them, be any disadvantage to
our devotions, I leave it to all wise men to determine.
So that in effect, since after the pretended assistance of
the Spirit in our Prayers, we may write them downe,
consider them, try the spirits, and ponder the manner,
the reason and the religion of the addresse, let the world
judge whether this sudden utterance and <hi>ex tempore</hi>
forms be any thing else, but a direct resolution not to
consider before-hand what we speak.</p>
            <p>But let us look a little further into the mysterie, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
see what is meant in Scripture by <hi>praying with the spirit.</hi>
In what sense the holy Ghost is called the <hi>spirit of prayer,</hi>
I have already shewne, <hi>viz.</hi> by the same reason, as he is
the <hi>spirit of faith,</hi> of <hi>prudence,</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> of <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and the like. But <hi>praying with the spirit</hi> hath besides
this other senses also in Scripture. I find in one place,
that then we pray with the Spirit, when the holy Ghost
does actually excite us to desires and earnest tendencies
to the obtaining our holy purposes, when he gives us
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113924:12"/>
zeale and devotion, charity and fervour, spirituall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and holy importunity. This sense is also in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the objected words of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom. 8. The
spirit it selfe maketh intercession for us with groanings, &amp;c.</hi>
Indeed this is truly a praying in the spirit, but this will
doe our reverend Brethren of the Assembly little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
as to the present Question. For this spirit is not a
spirit of utterance; not at all clamorous in the eares of
the people, but cryes loud in the eares of God with
[<hi>gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anes unutterable,</hi>] so it followes, and onely [<hi>He that
searcheth the heart, he understandeth the meaning of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>]
This is the spirit of the Sonne, which God hath
sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> into our hearts, (not into our tongues) whereby we

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
for mentall Prayer, which is properly and truly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Another praying with the Spirit, I find in that place
of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> from whence this expression is taken, and
commonly used, <hi>I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
with the understanding also.</hi> Here they are opposed, or at
least declared to be things severall and disparate: where
by the way observe, that praying with the spirit, even
in sense of Scripture, is not alwayes most to edification
of the people. Not alwayes with understanding. And
when these two are separated, S. <hi>Paul</hi> prefers five words
with understanding, before ten thousand in the spirit.
For this praying with the spirit was indeed then a gift ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
and miraculous, like as prophecying with the
spirit, and expired with it. But while it did last, it was
the lowest of gifts, <hi>Inter dona linguarum,</hi> it was but a gift
of the tongue, and not to be the benefit of the Church
rectly or immediately.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> By the way onely. If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did so undervalue the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113924:12"/>
praying with the Spirit, that he preferred edifying the
Church a thousand degrees beyond it. I suppose he would
have beene of the sam<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> mind, if this Question had beene

               </gap>h the Spirit and obeying our supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
as he was when it was between praying with the
Spirit and edification of the Church, because (it I be not
mistaken) it is matter of great concernment towards the
edication of the Church to obey our superiours, not to
innovate in publick formes of worsh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p, especially with
the scandall and offence of very wise and learned men,
and to the disgrace of the dead Martyrs, who sealed our
Liturgy with their blood.</p>
            <p>But to return. In this place praying with the Spirit, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/>
no more than my spirit praying. For so S. <hi>Paul</hi> joynes
them as terms identicall, and expressive one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
meaning, as you may please to read <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and
15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, and my Spirit truly
prayeth.</hi> It is the act of our inner man, praying holy and
spirituall Prayers. But then indeed at that time there
was somthing extraordianary joyned, for it was in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
tongue, the practice of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> there
dislikes. This also will be to none of their purposes. For
whether it were <hi>Extempore,</hi> or by premeditation, is not
here expressed, or if it had, yet that assistance extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in prayer, if there was any beside the gift of
tongues (which I much doubt) is no more transmitted
to us, then the speaking tongues in the spirit, or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying
<hi>Extempore</hi> and by the spirit.</p>
            <p>But I would adde also one experiment which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/>
also there addes by way of instance. If praying with the
spirit in this place be praying <hi>ex tempore,</hi> then so is sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too. For they are expressed in the same place, in the

the very words of our prayers. There is no other
way in the world to pray with the spirit, or in the holy
Ghost, that is pertinent to this Question. And of this
last manner the Scripture determines nothing, nor
speakes any thing expressely of it, and yet suppose it
had, we are certaine the holy Ghost hath supplyed us
with all these, and yet in set formes of prayer best of all,
I meane there where a difference can be. For as for
the desires, and actuall motions or incitements to pray,
they are indifferent to one or the other, to set formes or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113924:13"/>
to <hi>extempore,</hi> a. But as to the matter and manner of
prayer, it is cleerly contained in the expresses, and set
formes of Scriptures, and it is supplyed to us by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
for he is the great D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n for the very words. No man can assure me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/>
that the words of his <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayer are the words of
the holy Spirit: it is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eason nor modesty to expect
such immediate assistances to so little purpose, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
supplyed us with abilities more then enough to
expresse our desires <hi>aliunde,</hi> otherwise then by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
dictate. But if we will take <hi>Davids</hi> Psalter, or the
other hymnes of holy Scripture, or any of the Prayers
which are respersed over the Bible, we are sure enough
that they are the words of Gods Spirit, mediately or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
by way of infusion or extasie, by vision, or
at least by ordinary assistance. And now then, what
greater confidence can any man have for the excellency
of his Prayer, and the probability of their being accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
then when he prayes his Psalter, or the Lords prayer,
or another office which he finds consigned in Scripture?
When Gods Spirit stirs us up to an actuall devotion, and
then we use the matter he hath described and taught,
and the very words which Christ, and Christs Spirit, and
the Apostles, and other persons full of the holy Ghost
did use; if in the world there be any praying with the
Spirit, (I meane in vocall prayer) this is it.</p>
            <p>And thus I have examined the intire and full scope of
this Question, and ri<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed their Objection. Now I sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll
proceed to some few arguments which are more extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall
to the nature of the thing.</p>
            <p>It is a practice prevailing among those of our Brethren <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/>
that are zealous for <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayers, to pray their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
over, to reduce their doctrine into Devotion and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113924:14"/>
Lyturgie. I mislike it not for the thing it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, if it were
done regularly for the manner, and the matter were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
pious and true. But who shall assure me when
the preacher hath disputed, or rather dogmatically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
a point of predestination, or of prescience, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency,
or of liberty, or any of the most mysterious
parts of Divinity, and then prayes his Sermon over,
that he then prayes with the Spirit? Unlesse I be sure
that he also preached with the Spirit, I cannot be sure
that he prayes with the spirit, for all he prayes <hi>extempore.</hi>
Nay if I heare a Protestant preach in the morning, and
an Anabaptist in the afternoone, to day a Presbyterian,
to morrow an Independant, am I most sure that
when they have preached Contradictoryes, and all of
them pray their Sermons over, that they doe not all pray
with the spirit ? More then one in this case cannot
pray with the spirit, possibly all may pray against him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> 2. From whence I thus argue in behalfe of set formes
of prayer. That in the case above put, how shall I or
any man else say Amen to their prayers that preach and
pray contradictoryes? At least I am much hindred in
my devotion. For besides that, it derives our opinions
into our devotions, makes every schoole point, become
our religion, and makes God a party, (so farre as we
can) intitling him to our impertinent wranglings. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, I say, while we should attend to our addresses
towards God, we are to consider whether the point be
true or no, and by that time we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acitly discoursed it,
we are upon another point which also perhaps is as
Questionable as the former, and by this time our spirit
of devotion, is a little discomposed and something out
of countenance, there is so much other imployment for
the spirit, the spirit of discerning and judging. All which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113924:14"/>
inconveniences are avoyded in set formes of Liturgy.
For we know before hand the conditions of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and to what we are to say Amen, to which if
we like it we may repayre; if not, there is no harm done,
your devotion shall not be surprized, nor your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
invaded, as it may be and often is in your <hi>extempore</hi>
prayers. And this things hath another collaterall incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
which is of great consideration, for upon what
confidence can we sollicite any Recusants to come to our
Church, where we cannot promise them that the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
there to be used, shall be innocent, nor can we put
him into a condition to judge for himselfe? If he will
venture he may, but we can use no argument to make
him choose our Churches, though he should quit his
owne.</p>
            <p>3. But againe, let us consider with sobriety. Are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/>
those prayers and hymnes in holy Scripture, excellent
compositions, admirable instruments of devotion, full of
piety, rare and incomparable addresses to God? Dare
any man with his gift of Prayer pretend, that he can <hi>ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tempore</hi>
or by study make better? Who dares pretend
that he hath a better spirit then <hi>David</hi> had, or then the
Apostles and Prophets, and other holy persons in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whose Prayers and Psalmes are by Gods Spirit
consigned to the use of the Church for ever? Or will it
be denyed but that they also are excellent directories
and patterns for prayer? And if patternes, the neerer we
draw to our example, are not the imitations and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
the better? And what then if we took the
samplers themselves, is there any imperfection in them,
and can we mend them and correct <hi>Magnificat?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a just proportion and commensuration, I argue so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>
concerning the primitive and ancient formes of Church
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113924:15"/>
service, which are composed according to those so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
patternes, which if they had remained pure as in
their first institution, or had alwayes beene as they have
beene reformed by the Church of England, they would
against all defiance put in for the next place to those
formes of Liturgy which <hi>Mutatis mutandis</hi> are nothing
but the words of Scripture. But I am resolved at this
present not to enter into Question concerning the
matter of prayers. But for the forme this I say fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> 4. That the Church of God hath the promise of the
spirit made to her in generall, to her in her Catholicke
and united capacity, to the whole Church first, then to
particular Churches, then in the lowest seate of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegory
to single persons. Now then I infer, if any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
persons will have us to beleeve without all possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of proofe (for so it must be) that they pray with the
Spirit, (for how shal they be able to prove the spirit actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to ab<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de in those single persons) then much rather
must we beleeve it of the Church, which by how much
the more generall it is, so much the more of the spirit she
is likely to have: and then if there be no errors in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Church hath the advantage and probability on
her side, and if there be an error in matter in either of
them, they faile of their pretences, neither of them have
the spirit. But the publick spirit in all reason is to be
trusted before the private, when there is a contestation,
the Church being <hi>Prior &amp; potior in promissis,</hi> she hath a
greater and <hi>prior</hi> title to the spirit. And why the Church
hath not the spirit of prayer in her compositions as
well as any of her children, I desire once for all to
be satisfied upon true grounds either of reason or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:113924:15"/>5. Or if the Church shall be admitted to have the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, and the spirit of prayer given unto her by virtue of
the great promise of the spirit, to abide with her for
ever, yet for all this she is taught to pray in a set forme
of prayer, and yet by the spirit too. For what thinke
we? When Christ taught us to pray in that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
modell, the Lords Prayer, if we pray that prayer
devoutly, and with pious and actuall intention, doe we
not pray in the Spirit of Christ, as much as if we prayed
any other forme of words pretended to be taught us by
the spirit? We are sure that Christ and Christs Spirit
taught us this Prayer, they onely gather by conjectures
and opinions, that in their <hi>extempore</hi> formes the spirit
of Christ teaches them. So much then as certainties are
better then uncertainties, and God above man, so
much is this set forme (besides the infinite advantages in
the matter) better than their <hi>extempore</hi> formes in the
forme it selfe.</p>
            <p>6. If I should descend to minates and particulars, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/>
could instance in the behalfe of set forms, that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to <hi>Moses</hi> a set form of prayer and benediction to
be used when he did blesse the people. 7. That <hi>Moses</hi>
composed a song or hymne for the children of Israel to
use to all their generations. 8. That <hi>David</hi> composed
many for the service of the tabernacle. 9. That <hi>Solomon</hi>
and the holy Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> brought them in and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
them in the ministration of the temple. 10. That
all Scripture is written for our learning, &amp; since all these
and many more set forms of prayer left there upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
it is more then probable that they were left there
for our use and devotion. 11. That S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist
taught his Diciples a forme of prayer. 12. And that
Christs Disciples begged the same favour, and it was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113924:16"/>
granted as they desired it. 13. And that Christ gave
it not onely <hi>inmassâ materiae,</hi> but <hi>in forma verborum;</hi> not
in a confused heap of matter, but in an exact composure
of words, it makes it evident, he intended it not onely
<hi>proregula petendorum,</hi> for a direction of what things we
are to aske, but also <hi>proforma orationis,</hi> for a set forme of
Prayer, In which also I am most certainly confirmed
(besides the universall testimony of Gods Church so
attesting it) in the precept which Christ added, <hi>When ye
pray, pray after this manner:</hi> and indeed it points not the
matter onely of our prayers, but the forme of it, the
manner and the matter of the addresse both. But in the
repetition of it by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> the preceptive words seem
to limit us, and direct us to this very forme of words,
<hi>When ye pray, say, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> 14. I could also adde
the example of all the Jewes, and by consequence of
our blessed Saviour, who sung a great part of <hi>Davids</hi>
Psalter in their Feast of Passeover, which part is called
by the Jewes the great <hi>Hallelu-jah,</hi> it begins at the 113.
Psalme, and ends at the 118. inclusively. And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
mentions it as part of our blessed Saviours devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of his Disciples, that they sung a Psalme.
15. That this afterward became a Precept Evangelical,
that we should praise God in Hymnes, Psalmes, and
spirituall songs, which is a forme of Lyturgie, in
which we sing with the spirit, but yet cannot make
our Hymnes <hi>ex tempore,</hi> (it would be wild <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tuffe if we
should goe about it.) 16. And lastly, that a set-forme
of worship and addresse to God was recorded by Saint
<hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apoc. 15.</note> and sung in heaven, and it was composed out of the
songs of <hi>Moses, (Exod.</hi> 15.) of <hi>David, (Psal.</hi> 145.) and
of <hi>Ieremy, (Chap.</hi> 10. 6, 7.) which certainly is a very
good precedent for us to imitate, although but revealed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113924:16"/>
to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> by way of vision and extasie. All which
and many more are to me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as so many arguments of the
use, excellency, and necessity of set-formes of Prayer for
publike Lyturgies, as and of greatest conveniencies, even
for private devotions.</p>
            <p>17. And so the Church of God in all Ages did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/>
it. I shall not multiply authorities to this purpose,
for they are too many and various, but shall onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
two great instances of their beliefe and practice in
this particular. 1. The one is the perpetuall use and
great Eulogies of the Lords Prayer, assisted by the many
Commentaries of the Fathers upon it. 2. The other is
that solemne forme of benediction and mysticall prayer
(as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> calls it, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Trinit. c.</hi> 4.) which
all Churches (and themselves said it was by Ordinance
Apostolicall) used in the Consecration of the blessed
Sacrament. But all of them used the Lords Prayer in
the Canon, and office of Consecration, and other pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
taken from Scripture, (so <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> testifies, that
the Consecration is made <hi>per preces verbi Dei,</hi> by the
prayers taken from the Word of God) and the whole
Canon was short determined and mysterious.</p>
            <p>Who desires to be further satisfied in this particular,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
shal find enough in <hi>Walafridus Strabo, Aymonius, Cassander,
Flacius Illyricus, Iosephus Vicecomes,</hi> and the other Ritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
and in the old offices themselves. So that I need
not put you in mind of that famous doxologie of the
<hi>Gloria Patri, &amp;c.</hi> nor the <hi>Trisagion,</hi> nor any of those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
hymnes used in the ancient Church, so known<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and frequently, that the beginning of them came to
be their name, and they were knowne more by their
owne words, then the Authors inscription.</p>
            <p>At last when some men that thought themselves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> I will not now instance in the vaine-glory that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
to these <hi>ex tempore</hi> formes of prayer, where the
gift of the man is more then the devotion of the man:
nor will I consider that then his gift is best, when his

gift (as who is not apt to doe it?) he will be sure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his prayer, till a suspicious and scrupulous man
would be apt to say, his prayer pressed hard upon that
which our blessed Saviour reprehended in the Pharisees,
who thought to be heard for their much babling. But
these things are accidentall to the nature of the thing.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113924:17"/>
And therefore though they are too certainly consequent
to the person, yet I will not be too severe, but preserve
my selfe on the surer side of charitable construction,
which truly I desire to keep, not onely to their persons
whom I much reverence, but also to their actions. But
yet I durst not doe the same thing, even for these last
reasons, though I had no other.</p>
            <p>But it is objected, that in set formes of Prayer, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/>
and confine the blessed Spirit; and in conceived
formes, when every man is left to his liberty, then the
Spirit is free, unlimited and unconstrained.</p>
            <p>I answer, either their conceived formes (I use their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/>
owne words, though indeed the expression is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificiall)
are premeditate and described, or they are
<hi>ex tempore.</hi> If they be premeditate and described, then
the Spirit is as much limited in their conceived formes,
as in the Churches conceived forms. For as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
it is all one who describes and limits the forme,
whether the Church, or a single man does it, still the
Spirit is in constraint and limit. So that in this case they
are not angry at set formes of Prayer, but that they doe
not make them. And if it be replyed, that if a single
person composes a set forme, he may alter it if he please,
and so his spirit is at liberty. I answer, so may the
Church, if she see cause for it: and unlesse there be
cause, the single person will not alter it, unlesse he doe
things unreasonable, and without cause. So that it will
be an unequall and a peevish quarrell to allow of set
formes of prayer made by private persons, and not of
set formes made by the publike spirit of the Church.
It is evident, that the Spirit is limited in both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
            <p>But if by [<hi>Conceived formes</hi>] in this objection they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:113924:18"/>
meane <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayers (for so they most generally
practice it) and that in the use of these the liberty of the
spirit is best preserved. To this I answer, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>ex tempore</hi> or premedita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e will be wholly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to this Question of limiting the spirit. For there
may be great liberty in set formes, even when there is
much variety; and there may be great restraint in <hi>ex
tempore</hi> prayers, even then when it shall be called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
to use set formes. That the spirit is restrained,
or that it is free in either, is accidentall to them both;
for it may be either free or not free in both as it may
happen.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> But the restraint is this, that every one is not left to
his liberty to pray how he list, (with premeditation or
without, it makes not much matter) but that he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
unto by the spirit of another. But if it be a fault

spirit of the Lords People, when they are tyed to his
forme? It would sound of more liberty to their spirits,
that every one might make a prayer of his owne, and all
pray together; and not be forced or confined to the
Ministers single dictate, and private spirit. It is true, it
would breed confusions, and therefore they might
pray silently till the Sermon began, and not for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding

to avoid the disorder of a popular noyse restraine the

us this liberty must be in formes of prayer? And if
so, whether also it must be in publike prayer, and will it
not suffice that it be in private? And if in publike prayers,
is not the liberty of the spirit, sufficiently preserved in
that the publicke spirit is free? That is, the Church hath
power upon occasion to alter and increase her Letanyes.
By what argument shall any man make it so much as
probable, that the holy Ghost is injured, if every private
Ministers private spirit shall be guided (and therefore by
necessary consequence limited) by the authority of the
Churches publick spirit.</p>
            <p>4. Does not the Directory that thing which is here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/>
called restraining of the spirit? Does it not appoint eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

For as for the matter, it is all there described and
appointed, and to those determined senses the spirit
must assist or not at all, onely for the words he shall take
his choyce. Now I desire it may be considered sadly
and seriously: Is it not as much injury to the spirit to
restraine his mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er, as to appoint his words? Which
is the more considerable of the two, sense or Language,
Matter or Words? I meane when they are taken singly
and separately. For so they may very well be (for as
if men prescribe the matter onely, the spirit may cover
it with severall words and expressions, so if the spirit
prescribe the words, I may sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that true in the various interpretations of the same

words of Scripture.) So that in the greater of the two,
the Spirit is restrained when his matter is appointed, and
to make him amends for not trusting him with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without our directions and limitations, we trust him
to say what he pleases, so it be to our sense, to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
A goodly compensation surely!</p>

or though it had been lesse then either, and been
onely a Directory for the matter, still it is a thing which
our Brethren in all other cases of the same nature are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
perpetually to call a restraint; Certainly then
this pretended restraint, is not such formidable thing.
These men themselves doe it by directing all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and much of the manner, and Christ himselfe did
it, by prescribing both the matter, and the words
too.</p>

of the Spirit, are made by the Spirit himselfe. For
I demand, when any Assembly of Divines appoint the
matter of Prayers to all particular Ministers as this hath

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, is that appointment by the Spirit or no? If no,
then for ought appeares, this Directory not being made
by Gods Spirit, may be an enemy to it. But if this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
be by the Spirit, then the determination and
limitation of the Spirit, is by the Spirit himselfe, and
such indeed is every pious and prudent constitution of
the Church in matters spirituall: Such as was that of S.
<hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians, when he prescribed orders for
publique proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113924:19"/>
that he bound them to hold their peace, he permitted
but two or three to speak at one meeting, the rest were
to keep silence, though possibly six or seven might at
that time have the Spirit.</p>
            <p>7. Is it not a restraint of the Spirit to sing a Psalme in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/>
meeter by appointment? Cleerly as much as appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
formes of Prayer or Eucharist. And yet that we see
done daily, and no scruple made. Is not this to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
in judgement, and inconsiderate of what wee
doe?</p>
            <p>8. And now after all this strife, what harme is there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/>
in restraining the spirit in the present sense? What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
what law, what reason or revelation is against
it? What inconvenience in the nature of the thing? For
can any man be so weak as to imagine a despite is done
to the spirit of grace, when those gifts to his Church
are used regularly and by order? As if prudence were
no gift of Gods spirit, as if helpes in government, and the
ordering spirituall matters were none of those graces
which Christ when he ascended up on high gave unto
Men. But this whole matter is wholly a stranger to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and never seen in Scripture.</p>
            <p>For Divinity never knew any other vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l? That calls us to a new

               </gap>ue, what meanes Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
by saying <hi>The spirits of the prophets must be subject to the
Prophets?</hi> What greater restraint then subjection? if
subjected, then they must be ruled, if ruled, then limited,
prescribed unto, and as much under restraint as the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the superiour Prophets shall judge convenient.
I suppose by this time this objection will trouble us no
more. But perhaps another will.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="56"/> For why are not the Ministers to be left as well to their
liberty in making their Prayers as their Sermons? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
the Church may it she will, but whether she doth
well or no let her consider. This I am sure, there is not
the same reason, and I feare the experience the world
hath already had of it, will make demonstration enough
of the inconvenience. But however the differences are
many.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/> 1. Our prayers offered up by the Minister, are in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
and in the name of the people, and therefore great
reason they should know beforehand, what is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
that if they like not the message, they may refuse
to communicate, especia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly since people are so divided
in their opinions, in their hopes, and in their faiths: it
being a duty to refuse Communion with those prayers
which they thinke to have in them, the matter of sinne
or doubting. Which reason on the other part ceases,
for the Minister being to speak from God to the people,
if he speakes what he ought not, God can right himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

however is not partner of the sin, as in the other case, the
people possibly may be.</p>
            <p>2. It is more fit a liberty be left in preaching than <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="58"/>
praying, because the addresse of our discourses and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
are to be made according to the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and capacity of the audience, their prejudices are to
be removed, all advantages to be taken, and they are to
be surprized that way they lye most open [<hi>But being
crafty I caught you,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>] and
discourses and arguments <hi>ad hominem,</hi> upon their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
principles and practices may more move them
than the most polite and accurate that doe not comply
and wind about their fancies and affections. S. <hi>Paul</hi> from
the absurd practice of being baptized for the dead,
made an excellent argument to convince the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
of the Resurrection. But this reason also ceases in
our prayers. For God understandeth what we say sure
enough, he hath no prejudices to be removed, no infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be wrought upon, and a fine figure of Rhetoricke,
a pleasant cadence, and a curious expression move not
him at all; no other twinings and complyances stirre
him, but charity, and humility, and zeale, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which all are things internall and spirituall. And
therefore of necessity there is to be great variety of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
to the people, and permissions accordingly, but
not so to God, with whom a <hi>Deus miserere</hi> prevailes as
soone as the great office of 40. houres not long since in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other prayers spun
out to a length beyond the extension of the office of a
Pharisee.</p>
            <p>3. I feare it cannot stand with our reverence to God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="59"/>
to permit to every spirit a liberty of publike addresse to
him in behalfe of the people. Indeed he that is not fit
to pray, is not alwayes fit to preach; but it is more safe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113924:21"/>
to be bold with the people then with God, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
be not so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it. In that there may be indiscretion, but
there may be impiety and irreligion in this. The people
may better excuse and pardon an indiscretion or a rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
(if any such should happen) then we may venture
to offer it to God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> 4. There is latitude of Theologie, much whereof is
left to us, so without precise and cleere determination,
that without breach either of faith or charity, men may
differ in opinion; and if they may not be permitted to
abound in their owne sense, they will be apt to complain
of tyrannie over consciences, and that men Lord it over
their faith, In Prayer this thing is so different, that it is
imprudent and full of inconvenience to derive such
things into our prayers which may with good profit be
matter of Sermons, Therefore here a liberty may well
enough be granted, when there it may better be denyed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="61"/> 5. But indeed if I may freely declare my opinion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
I think it were not amisse if the liberty of making Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
were somthing more restrained than it is, and that
either such persons only were intrusted with the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for whom the Church her selfe may safely be respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,
that is, to men learned and pious, and that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

was as ably and religiously performed as now it is,
But in this prescribe nothing. But truely I thinke the
reverent. Divines of the Assemby are many of my mind
in this particular, and that they observe a liberty indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to some persons to preach, which I thinke they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113924:21"/>
had rather should hold their peace, and yet thinke the
Church better edified in your silence than, their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>6. But yet me thinks the argument objected, if it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="62"/>
were turned with the edge the other way, would have
more reason in it: and instead of arguing [<hi>Why shall no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y with the spirit,
why also do they not preach with the spirit? &amp; if praying
with the spirit be praying <hi>extempore,</hi> why shall they not
preach <hi>extempore</hi> too, or else contesse that they preach
without the spirit, or that they have not the gift o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching?
For to say that the gift of prayer, is a gift <hi>ex

is to become vaine and impertinent. <hi>Quis enim
discrevit?</hi> Who hath made them of a different conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
I mean as to this particular, as to their efficient
cause. Nor reason, nor revelation, nor God, nor man.</p>
            <p>To summe up all. If any man hath a mind to exercise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="63"/>
his gift of Prayer, let him set himselfe to worke, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
books of Devotion, (we have great need of them
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> so apparent need, that the
Papists have made it an objection against us) and this his
gift of Prayer will be to edification. But otherwise, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it is more fit for ostentation, then any spirituall
advantage. For God heares us not the sooner for our

may become a hindrance, as in the cases before i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And I am sure if the people be intelligent, and can
discern they are hindred in their devotion, for they dare
not say <hi>Amen</hi> till they have considered, and many such
cases will occur in <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayers, that need much
considering before we attest them. But if the people be
not intelligent, they are apt to swallow all the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113924:22"/>
which may multiply in so great a licence; and
therefore it were well that the Governors of the Church

them, before they say <hi>Amen,</hi> which judgement cannot

for under the Directory there will be as different
religions, and as different desires, and as differing formes
as there are severall varietyes of men and manners under
the one half of heaven, who yet breath under the same half
of the Globe. But I aske again, what benefit can the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
receive by this forme, or this no forme, for I know not
whether to call it. Shal the matter of prayers be better in
all Churches? Shall God be better served? Shall the word
of God and the best pat<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ernes of prayers be alwayes exactly
followed? It is well if it be, but there is security given us
by the Directory, for the matter is left at every mans dispose
for all that, and we must depend upon the honesty of every
particular for it; and if any man proves a Heretick, or a
Knave, then he may introduce what impiety he please, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the publick formes of Gods worship; and there is no law
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113924:23"/>
made to prevent it, and it must be cured afterwards if it
can; but before-hand it is not prevented at all by the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
which trusts every man. But I observe, that all the
benefit which is pretended, is, that it will make an able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
which I confesse I am very much from beleeving,
and so will every man be that considers what kind of men
they are that have been most zealous for that way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Prayer. I am sure that very few of the learnedst, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

in the Scooles of the Prophets. And that I may di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mans person, we see Tradesmen of the most illiberall arts,
and women pretend to it, and doe it with as many words
(and that's the maine thing) with as much confidence, and

               </gap>sse, and spirit, as the best among them. And it is
but a small portion of learning that wil serve a man to make
conceived formes of prayer, which they may have easily
upon the stock of other men, or upon their owne fancy, or
upon any thing in which no learning is required. He that
knowes not this, knowes nothing of the craf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I would faine see any authority, or any reason, or any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
for that. I am sure ignorant men offer him none of
the best sacrifices <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and learned men will be sure
to deliberate, and know, God is then better served, when
he is served by a publike, then when by a private spirit. I
cannot imagine what accruements will hence come to the
publike: It may be some advantages may be to the private
interests of men. For there are a sort of men whom our
blessed Saviour noted, who doe <hi>devoure widowes houses, and
for a pretence make long prayers.</hi> They make prayers, and they
make them long, by this meanes they receive double ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
for they get reputation to their ability, and to their
piety. And although the Common<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

length, yet we see that most of these men, they that are
most eminent or would be so, make their prayers longer,
and will not lose the benefits which their credit gets, and
they by their credit, for making their prayers.</p>
            <p>Adde to this that there is no promise in Scripture, that he
who prayes <hi>ex tempore</hi> shall be heard the better, or that he
shall be assisted at all to such purposes, and therefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novate
in so high a matter without a warrant to command
us, or a promise to warrant us, is no better then vanity in
the thing, and presumption in the person. Hee therefore
that considers that this way of prayer is without all manner
of precedent in the primitive Church, against the example
of all famous Churches in all Christendom in the whole
descent of 15. ages, without all Command and warrant
of Scripture, that it is unreasonable in the nature of the

               </gap> prudence and the best wisdome of humanity,
because it is without deliberation, that it is innovation in a
high degree without that authority, which is truly &amp; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
and ancient right, to command and prescribe to us
in externall formes of worship, that it is much to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of the first reformers, of our religion, that it gives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the Papists, to quarrell with some reason
and more pretence against our Reformation, as being by
the Directory confessed to have beene done in much blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and therefore might erre in the excesse as well as in
the defect, in the throwing out too much, as casting off too
little, which is the more likely, because they wanted zeal to
carry him farre enough. He that considers the universall
difformity of publike worship, and the no means of union, no
Symbol of publick communion being publickly consigned,
that all heresies may with the same authority be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our prayers, and offered to God in behalf of the people,
with the same authority that any truth may, all the matter
of our prayers being left to the choice of all men, of all

perswasions, and then observes that actually there are in
many places, heresie, and blasphemy, and impertinency, &amp;
illiterate rudenesses put into the devotions of the most So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
dayes, and the most publike meetings, and then last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that there are divers parts of Liturgie, for which no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
at all is made in the Directory, and the very admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the Sacraments left so loosely, that if there
be any thing essentiall in the formes of Sacraments, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
may become ineffectuall by want of due words,
and due ministartion. I say he that considers all these things
(and many more he may consider) will finde that partticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
men are not fit to be intrusted to offer in publike with
their private spirit, to God, for the people, in such solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
in matters of so great concernment, where the honour
