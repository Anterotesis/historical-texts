            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE under-written Ambaſſador of the States General of the United <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> Your good friends and Allies, having had the honor of ſeveral Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with Your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and therein made known to You ſuch Orders as he hath from time to time received from his Maſters upon occaſion of, and concerning divers affairs, and eſpecially theſe following: To wit,</p>
            <p>Seeing it is underſtood and perceived, that Veſſels of War are fitting and preparing on both ſides, which if they go forth to Sea and meet there together, might by ſome miſunderſtanding fall foul upon one another; Your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> would therefore be pleaſed to keep back Your Fleet, and not ſuffer it to go to Sea, as their Lordſhips offer on their part to do; the whole intent and deſign tending one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99135:3"/>
to the ſafety of both parties, and the prevention of the foreſaid ſiniſter encounters.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Whereas their Lordſhips have been informed, that Captain <hi>Holmes</hi> with the Veſſels under his Command hath now again (as heretofore) done very great and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous injuries to the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> by taking divers of their Veſſels upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> as alſo by making himſelf Maſter of ſome places and Forts belonging unto them, and namely amongſt others of <hi>Capo Verde,</hi> &amp;c. which is directly contrary, not onely to the Treaty laſt concluded between Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> and the States of the United Provinces, but alſo to mutual Amity and good neighbourhood: The ſaid Ambaſſador did therefore in the name of his Superiors, demand reſtitution of the ſame, and that reparation might be made of the damages and intereſts, which the ſaid Company and other Subjects of their Lordſhips, who were concerned, have ſuffered thereby; as alſo that the like proceedings and violences might be prevented for the future by an expreſs Order.</p>
            <p>In the third place, That their Lordſhips being from day to day confirmed by certain intelligence coming from that Coaſt, that the foreſaid action of Captain <hi>Holmes</hi> had not onely been effected in the manner above ſpecified, but alſo that he was intended to carry on his deſign further, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king incurſions and ſeizing upon all the Coaſt, and that for his better ſucceſs therein, he expected a notable ſupply of Ships from <hi>England,</hi> as the whole matter may be proved by the Teſtimony and Depoſitions of credible perſons newly come from thence: Which actions being without right, reaſon and equity, and which conſequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be endured, nor looked upon with a good eye, Your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> was entreated that it might be Your good Pleaſure to command as well the ſaid Captain <hi>Holmes,</hi> as others who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99135:3"/>
were in that engagement, or are held to have been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, not only to reſtore the foreſaid Forts and Veſſels ſo taken, and to repair the damages thereby ſuffered (as reaſon requires) but alſo that the Ships which by report are now ready to ſet Sail, or which may be fitting for that end, may by Your <hi>Majeſties</hi> expreſs Command be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited and charged not to do or cauſe any other injury or damage to the ſaid Company, or to any other the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the United Provinces.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Foraſmuch as the poorand afflicted Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches in the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont</hi> have repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that after the agreement made with his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſome while ſince, they are again over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed &amp; ruined by exactions &amp; charges required of them to defray the expences of the Army which the ſaid Duke had commanded againſt them, which charges amounted to ſo high a ſum, that it was impoſſible for them to make it up, for the reaſons more at large alledged in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance; Therefore they have deſired the interceſsion of the States General with Your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that Your Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in the Court of <hi>France</hi> may have order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from his Moſt Chriſtian <hi>Majeſty</hi> (as being Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his ſaid Royal Highneſs and them) as much favour and comfort to thoſe poor afflicted Churches as can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly by any means be obtained.</p>
            <p>And finally, conſidering that the Veſſels coming from the United Provinces into the Rivers, Streams and Roads of this Kingdom, are ſtopped there under pretence that there be Perſons and Commodities on board which come from places infected with the Plague, or at leaſt ſuſpected to be ſo, by which means the freedom of Trade and Paſſage is obſtructed and diſturbed, to the great prejudice of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of both Nations: The ſaid Ambaſſador there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſiſted thereupon, that the ſame might be remedied,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99135:4"/>
or at leaſt that the ſtrictneſs of thoſe Orders might be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated in ſuch meaſure as in reaſon ſhall be found conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; And that the rather, becauſe, by the mercy of God, all the Provinces in general are not infected with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion.</p>
            <p>To all that is above ſaid, Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath been pleaſed to anſwer in effect, to wit, upon the firſt point, touching keeping of the Fleet from going to Sea, That the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which were fitted and prepared on Your <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſide being no way extraordinary, but onely for common and cuſtomary uſe, and without deſign of bringing any dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or inconvenience upon the inhabitants of the United Provinces, the ſaid Veſſels could not be kept from going to Sea, becauſe Your <hi>Majeſties</hi> Honour was engaged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; Nevertheleſs that You would give ſuch Orders to the chief Commander of Your ſaid Fleet, that their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſhall have no cauſe to apprehend any ſiniſter encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from it.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond, touching the action of Captain <hi>Holmes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> thought good to anſwer thereunto, That You had received no information of it, and that having given no Order for his ſo doing, You would cauſe repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made, if the matter proved to be true, and that the ſaid Captain <hi>Holmes</hi> ſhould be puniſhed according as the caſe ſhould require: Nevertheleſs adding thereunto afterwards at another Audience, that the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had likewiſe done much damage to Your <hi>Majeſties</hi> Subjects upon the ſaid Coaſt, pretending to be Maſters thereof to themſelves alone; which thing ought to be conſidered alſo in its proper ſeaſon, judging it unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unjuſt that the Trade of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon that Coaſt ſhould continually be diſturbed and hindred.</p>
            <p>And as to the third, Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> was pleaſed to ſay
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99135:4"/>
as before, That You had received no information of <hi>Holmes</hi> his actions in thoſe parts; and for ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Ships which are ready to ſet Sail towards the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> that they were not in a condition to make any attempt there, being onely Merchant-men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which there was added but one Man of War for their Convoy.</p>
            <p>For what regards the poor <hi>Piemontoies,</hi> That You were ſenſibly touched with the miſerable condition of thoſe Churches and People, and for that reaſon Your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> had already given Order to Your Ambaſſador in <hi>France</hi> to contribute unto their relief and comfort in Your name; But foraſmuch as at preſent there occurr ſome new difficulties concerning the ſaid Churches, Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> would adviſe more particularly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, concerning the Merchants Ships which come from the United Provinces into this Kingdom, and are ſtopped without permiſsion to Land any where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſuſpected to come from ſome place infected with the Sickneſs, there being no diſtinction made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Provinces and Cities really afflicted with the ſaid Contagion, &amp; thoſe which are not ſo at all; That Your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> having an extraordinary apprehenſion of that diſeaſe, had great reaſon to uſe all poſsible precaution againſt it; Notwithſtanding, that the buſineſs ſhould alſo be thought upon more fully.</p>
            <p>All which Points aboveſaid having been repeated by the ſaid Ambaſſador at his laſt Audience, and inſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made, that according to their Lordſhips deſires Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> would be pleaſed to explain Your Self in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to put the minds of his Superiors out of perplexity and diſquiet; and Your <hi>Majeſty</hi> having to that purpoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99135:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deſired, that all ſhould be comprized in a <hi>Memorial</hi> for<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Anſwer to be given thereunto in Writing: The ſaid <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial</hi> (May it pleaſe Your <hi>Majeſty)</hi> is here moſt humbly preſented, with like prayer, that ſuch Order may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken therein, as that by a favorable anſwer (which the ſaid Ambaſſador expects from Your <hi>Majeſty)</hi> he may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to give his Maſters content.</p>
