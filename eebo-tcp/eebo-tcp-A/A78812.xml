            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>His Majeſties gratious Proclamation to the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>VVeſtminſter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEREAS amongſt other Arts uſed by the Promoters of this horrid and deſperate Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt Vs, great Induſtry and Subtility hath been applyed to corrupt Our Subjects of Our Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> firſt by engaging them in Factions and Tumults to awe the members of both Our Houſes of Parliement who would not conſent to their ſeditious Deſignes; then by perſwading them to Loanes and Contributions for the maintenance of the Army now in Rebellion againſt Vs, upon pretence that the ſame was raiſed for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Our Perſon, the Proteſtant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and Priviledge of Parliament (WHEREAS in truth it is for the deſtruction of them all) by their yeelding obedience to, and executing the pretended Ordinance of the <hi>Militia:</hi> and laſtly by infuſing into them a deſperate ſenſe of their own Condition, and that We are ſo much incenſed againſt them for the premiſes, that We intend to plunder, and give up the wealth of thoſe Our Cities, as a prey to Our Souldiers: We do hereby declare, That We are yet far from being ſo much incenſed againſt thoſe Our Cities, as theſe men deſire to be believed, and in truth have endeavoured to make Vs: but We beleive that thoſe Tumults were contrived by the Perſons whom We haue formerly accuſed of that practice, and raiſed out of the meaneſt and pooreſt People of thoſe Our Cities and Suburbs, without the privity and conſent of the beſt and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall Gi.izens and Inhabitants, and that the Loanes and Contributions which have been ſince raiſed (though they have paſſed more generally than We expected from the duty and ſobriety of men of fortunes and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) have beene wreſted and extorted from them by threats and menaces, and feare of plundering and violence. And therefore We do hereby offer Our free and gracious Pardon to all the Citizens and Inhabitants of Our ſaid Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for all Offences concerning the premiſes committed againſt Vs before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of this Our Proclamation (except all thoſe Perſons whom We have excepted in Our Declaration of the 12 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and except Alderman <hi>Fulke</hi> and Captaine <hi>Manwaring,</hi> againſt all which We ſhall proceed according to the Rules of Law, as againſt Traytors and Stirrers of ſedition againſt Vs) and We do aſſure them in the word of a King, that no violence ſhall be offered by Our Army, or any part of it to any of them, not doubting but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour will henceforward be ſuch, that VVe ſhall not be compelled to bring Our Army againſt them. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that this Our Grace ſhall not extend to any Perſon, who after the publiſhing this Our Proclamation ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume by Loane or Contribution to aſſiſt the ſaid Army of Rebels to aſſemble and muſter themſelves in Armes without Authority derived from Vs under Our hand, or to enter into any Oath of Aſſociation for the aſſiſtance of the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> how ſpetiouſly ſoever the ſame be pretended for Our ſafety, for ſince the encounter on Sunday 23. of this Moneth, where they uſed all poſſible meanes and malice to have deſtroyed Vs, and where it pleaſed God to give Vs ſo great a Victory over them (though with the loſſe of many worthy men) no man can be ſatisfied in the miſchiefe and malice of their Rebellion, ſhall take Armes by vertue of any pretended Ordinance, or ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any Oath of aſſociation againſt Vs, or without Our Conſent, ſhall be eſteemed by Vs as an Enemy to the publique Peace, a Perſon diſaffected to Vs, the Religion and Law of the Kingdome, and ſhall accordingly receive condigne puniſhment; of which We give them timely notice, that they may proceed accordingly at their perills. And to the end that they may receive all poſſible and particular aſſurance from Vs of Our gratious Intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, We ſhall be willing that ſuch a number of grave and ſubſtantiall Citizens be imployed from Our ſaid City to Vs, as ſhall by them be thought fit, who may propoſe ſuch things to Vs on their behalfe as ſhall be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to which We ſhall give a gracious and juſt Anſwer. And we do aſſure them and all the world, that as the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and Imputations upon Vs concerning Our favouring of Papiſts have been groundleſſe, and maliciouſly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Authors of this Rebellion to beget a miſunderſtanding between Vs and Our Subjects, ſo all the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons We have made in Our ſeverall Declarations for the ſuppreſſion of Popery, and the maintenance of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of England, and for the defence of the Laws of the Land, and the juſt Priviledges of Parliament ſhall be as inviolably obſerved by Vs, as We expect bleſſing from the Almighty God, and obedience from Our Subjects.</p>
