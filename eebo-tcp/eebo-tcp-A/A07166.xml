         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20764:14"/>
of the water without corke, and the other is with
the flote or corke, to caſt in your bayted hooke without a
corke, it will ſinke to the bottome, and then the yéele will
haue it as ſoone as the Pyke: and if he cannot ſwallow it,
he will byte away the baite by little and little: therefore to
lay from the bottome is beſt for the Pyke, ye ſhal caſt your
bayted hooke and line with a corke, of what depth ye luſt,
for ſo it will not ſinke to the bottome.</p>
                     <p>Alſo to lay for the yéeles, ye ſhall baite your hookes with
menowes, gogins, or loches, great wormes and ſuch like.
And to ſticke pooles in the bankes, with lines at the endes
ſo that your baites may lie on the bottome of the water,
for there the yéele will ſooneſt take it, but lay not nigh roots
of trées or ſuch, for they will wrappe them ſo, ye ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
come by them.</p>
                     <p>Alſo let your lines be of good great packthréeke, ſticking
the ſaide poles or pinnes of wood in the bankes, and your
lines to be of two or thrée fatham, ſome more, ſome leſſe:
&amp; for your proch hooke to baite him with the great worme,
or the menowe is beſt, or with a Loch, or ſmall Gogin, ſo
if a great yéele come, he will ſwallowe it hole. Thus much
for laying of hookes for the Pyke and Yéele.</p>
                     <p>Alſo to take yéeles in winter, ſome haue vſed to lay in
pondes and running waters, faggots of hay, with a bough
of Willow put in the middeſt, and bayted with ſome gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage
of foule or beaſtes, bound with two bondes, and to
plucke it vp (after it hath lame two or thrée daies) with
hooke or corde, and you ſhall haue yéeles therein: when it
is a lande do but cruſh it with your foote and the yéeles will
come out if there be any. If ye lay it in the middeſt of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
you may plucke it into your boate. Thus you may

the fiſher men, a wele for to take him made with a double
teme or tonuell, and againſt the vtmoſt teme within is ſet
an yeirne like a gredyeirne with foure hooles ſtaying and
ſliding vpon two round ſtickes, which muſt be ſet vpright
in the wele before the teme, to holde vp the yeirne: which
two ſtickes muſt be faſt bound to the wele, both aboue and

ſmall Oziar muſt be made with a round knot, and ſo put
downe vpon the ende of the nethermoſt Oziar in the midſt

rodde or gore rodde, for thoſe are the beſt. Theſe Otter
Weles are made at Twyford, by ſides Reading. There
be two of the Gootheriches which liues much by making

Creuis, Loches, Culles, and Trowtes lying in
holes of the banke. They will ſoone deſtroy much other fiſh
and ſpaune in ſhallow riuers and brookes, to kill them it is
hard to doe: but where as ye ſhall ſée their path on bankes
ſides, there ſet a deadfall, for they do range abroad a nights
like other Rats, and will be where as is corne milles, and
fulling milles, to eate corne, and gnaw clothes, and liues
much like to other Rattes, and will pill oziar barkes and
ſuch like. Alſo to take them in weles is hard, except the
weles lie ſhallow, and nigh the toppe of the water by the

the holes where they haunt, which bordes muſt
haue a great hole in the middeſt, and ſet iuſt againſt her
comming in or out, faſt pinde to the bankes: then make a

                     <head>To preſerue ſpawne in ſpawning time.</head>
                     <p>A Chiefe way to ſaue ſpawne of fiſh, in March, Aprill,
and May, is thus, ye ſhall make fagots of wheate,
or rie ſtrawe, all whole ſtraw not bruiſed, or of réede, binde
theſe faggots together with thrée bondes, and all about
thereon ſticke of young branches of willowe. Then caſt
them in the water among wéedes, or by the bankes, and
put in each faggot two good long ſtakes, driuen faſt to the
ground, and let your fagots lie couered in the water halfe
a yeard or more. So the fiſh will come a ſhed their ſpawne
thereon, and then it will quicken therein, ſo that no other
fiſh can come to deſtroy or eate it, and as they waxe quicke
they will come foorth and ſaue themſelues. Thus much
for the preſeruing of ſpawne in the ſpring and ſpawning
time.: this is a good practiſe to preſerue the ſpawne of all
ſcaled fiſh. Theſe fagots ye may make and lay in all riuers,
poundes, or ſtanding waters. Your ſagots had néede to
be a yeard and a halfe long, and bound with three bandes
not hard, two bandes a foote from the endes, and an other
bande in the middeſt, and lay them as I haue afore decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Alſo ſome doe vſe to hedge in corners in riuers, and
pondes with willow, and thereon fiſh doe caſt their ſpawne
and ſo bréedes.</p>

                     <p>
                        <figure/>
The Sea-pie is a foule that vſeth the ſeas, and bréedes
much in Ilands in the ſea, and liues moſt by fiſh &amp; wormes,
and where as they vſe in freſh riuers, they deſtroy much
fiſh, young frie, and ſuch as ſwimmes nigh the toppe of
the water, and will be in ſhallow places of the water: and
there they haunt to take and féede on them. Therefore
the fiſher men haue inuented a way howe to take them,
which is: ye ſhall lyme two ſmall Oziars, and binde the
ends that are next the bayte, almoſt croſſe wiſe. Then take
an other ſhort ſticke, and binde the one end vnto your ends
of croſſe twigges as ye may ſée afore, and put that ſhort
ſticke through the fiſh or bayte. Then lay it on ſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
leafe, ruſhes, or ſuch like in the midſt of the riuer, and
as ſoone as they ſhall ſée it, they will take and flie away
with it in their bylles, and ſoone they ſhall be lymed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                     <p>The other way of laying theſe lymed twigges is, ye
ſhall put a ſmall ſhort ſticke in the bayte, as yee may ſée a
fore. And at the hinder ende tye a thréed an intch long, and
to that thréed tie your lymed twigges, and when ſhe takes
and flies away with it, ſhe cannot flie farre but ſhe will be
lyined, for the twigs will turne and touch her wings, and
then ſhe will fall. Thus ye may take many Sea-pies,
both in ſommer and winter, and the like way ye may take
both Crowes and other Pyes, to take the Kyte therewith,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20764:17"/>
he will hardly be lyined, becauſe he takes the bayte in his
féete, and the other takes it in their billes. Thus much
here for the taking of the Sea-pie.</p>

The ſlymie fiſh is the Tench, the Seacod, and the Yéele,
and yet they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for a good féeding meat for man,

the freſh riuer is tryed a good and holſome meate, you ſhall

                     <p>It is a good thing to haue plentie of freſh water fiſh, in
riuers and pooles, and ſtanding waters: and a great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
for man ſometimes to take with his angle a diſh of fiſh
in thoſe waters whereas fiſh is plentie and well preſerued,
not to vſe any other engins, but with the hooke: and by

and ſuch as are deuourers of fiſh, as bow nets, caſting nets,
ſmall trammels, ſhoue nets, and draught nets: which are
deſtroyers of fiſh before they are growen to any bigneſſe.
Theſe are not méete to be vſed but of certaine Gentlemen
in their ſeuerall waters, I would wiſh no running waters
ſhould be let to any fiſher man, without order what meſh,
what nets, he or they ſhall vſe to fiſh with, and in what

                     <p>Alſo it ſhall be good for all Gentlemen and others, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the gouernment of any riuers, brookes, or ſtanding

There is a kinde of fiſh in Holand, in the fennes beſides
Peterborrow, which they call a poult, they be like in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

as they may be with ſmall charge. They haue ſuch plentie
in the fenne brookes, they féede their hogges with them. If

THe fiſhes called Loches, and the other called Millars-thumbes

of féeble perſons hauing an ague, or other ſickneſſe. Theſe
fiſh delight to be in ſandie grauell in riuers and brookes, and
they are very eaſie to be taken with ſmall trauell, in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the ſtones where they lie vnder, for they cannot ſwim
faſt away. Therefore in certaine ſhallow riuers &amp; brookes,
they do vſe to bréede, and ſaue them ye may in laying round
heapes of pebble ſtones or flint, in ſhallow places of the
ſaide riuers and brookes, halfe a foote déepe of water or leſſe.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20764:23"/>
Like as there is a ſhallow riuer running from Baream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtede
to Cheſtum, and ſo to Chaue: alſo by Croyden and
other places, wherein they might bréede of the ſaide fiſh
great ſtore, if they were ſo giuen. The like riuer runnes

Which fiſh among the ſaide heapes of ſtones doth

ſet downe: which ſheweth the maner of laying them round
in the bottome, the circuit of two yeardes about, or as yée

maintenance and bréeding of Culles and Loches. Alſo it
is euident in other Countries, the great care they haue in
preſeruing their fiſh, eſpecially in the ſpring: as in France,
no fiſher men or other, ſhall lay any engins in riuers or
brookes in the night, as flewes, ſtalles, buckes, kéepes,
weles, and ſuch like, from mid March, to mid May: for
then the fiſh doeth ſhed their ſpawne among wéedes and
buſhes, nor ſhall not beate the waters or brookes with any
plonging poales, nor yet the fiſher men to fiſh at no time,
with any net vnder foure inches maſh, becauſe they ſhall
not kill the ſmall fiſh before they are well growen, vppon
paine of forfaite and loſſe of all ſuch engins. There is alſo
prohibited, that no fiſh ſhall be taken and ſolde in markets,
which are out of their ſeaſon: as the Lampre and Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pornes,
which are venemous in the Sea before they be
ſcoured in freſh water, and not in ſeaſon from mid March
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20764:23"/>
to mid September, for they will (being out of ſeaſon) looke
ruſſet and ſpeckled vpon their bellies. Alſo Oyſters and
Muſkles, are not good from mid March, to mid September:
and likewiſe Salmons and Trowtes, are in ſeaſon from
mid March to mid September, and after waxe out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Smelts not in ſeaſon from mid March to mid Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or after. Cockles and ſuch are not kindly but in the
monethes of March, Aprill, and May: all the reſt of the
yeare not holeſome to be eaten or ſolde. Moreouer Darce,
Roch, Perch and ſuch like, are not kindly to be kilde from
mid March, to the end of May: for in theſe times they doe
caſt their ſpawne, and then they will be rough and broken,
ſcaled and pilde for a while, after they haue ſo caſt their

nor yet good of liking. All theſe afore mentioned with
all other which are out of ſeaſon, are forbid to be taken and
ſolde in markets, or otherwiſe priuely eaten, vpon the like

I would wiſh that all ſtoppe nets, and drags with caſting
nets, were baniſhed in all common riuers through this
Realme for thrée moneths: as in March, Aprill, and May,
wherein they take fiſh out of ſeaſon as well as others, with
great ſpoyles of ſpawne, both of great and ſmall fiſh, for
they vſe ſuch nets with ſmall meſh, that kils all fiſh afore
they come to any growth and good ſeruice for the common
wealth. Who ſo euer doe preuent ſuch, they ſhall doe good
to the common wealth. And water Bayles which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to ſée ſoo ſuch nets in riuers, and running ſtreames
(which is thought) they neglect their duties, for they let
the fiſher men vſe what nets they liſt, as the voyce goes:
and Gentlemen which owes the waters lets them alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,

for Crowes and Sparrowes, as hereafter
ſhall be declared.</head>
                     <p>YE ſhall firſt make your trenches for your nette, and
ſtaues, according to the length of each thereof, and
your ſayd trenches and ſtaues, to be without the ends
of your net. Firſt piune downe the backe line of your nette
in the trench, with foure ſmall hooked pinnes, ſo done, then
meaſure thrée yeardes from the further end of your net, and
there knocke downe a ſtake, and tie your draging line ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at.
But ſet your ſtake ſo that your line, and net may fall
ſtraight when he is drawen: then knocke downe in the
two vppen endes of your ſtaffe trenches, two hooked pins
to holde your two ſtaues, as ye may ſée in their places.
Then meaſure from the néere end of your backe line, fiue
yeardes towarde your hande, and there knocke downe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
ſtake, and faſten your pull thereat, and drawe your
line through it, and pull your line ſo farre as ye will drawe
your net, and there you muſt knocke down an other ſtrong
ſtake with a hole thorow a foote aboue the ground, &amp; there
tie your drawing line to a ſhort ſticke to drawe by when ye
will, and tie your line ſo tight it may come ſtiffe in ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
your net. Then bent it, and put your line in the
notch of your ſurther ſtaffe, and faſten it to the hooked pin
in the trench, till ye haue bent the other ſtaffe in the néere
trench. Then gather vp your net, and lay it vnder your
line in the trench, ſo done: couer your net and ſtaues, with
ſome ſhort ſtrawe or chaffe, and couer your drawing line
with fearne or ſuch like. Then baite your ſhrape nie the
backe line, with offall corne, or chaffe mixt with oates,
ſéedes or ſuch like: and let it ſo remaine thrée or foure daies,
if ye will, without laying your nette, ſo they will be the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20764:47"/>
bolder to come when your net is layde, and the more
number will knowe, and not ſeave the nette. Alſo your
ſtaues for the Sparrowe net commonly muſt be twelue
handfuls long, or nigh foure foote: and the caſting ſtaues
for your Rooke net, may well be a handfull longer. The
length betwéene your ſtaues and trenches for your Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
net muſt be two and twentie foote, or according to
the length of your net. And ſo for your Rooke net. Your
backe line may be a ſmall line, but your drawing line had
néede be ſtrong, and ſomewhat bigger than a halpeny hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
to way downe the net. Some doe vſe to lay ſtones,
and cloddes by, (if he drawe alone) to lay them on the out
ſides of the nette, while hee takes or killes the Crowes.
Wherefore if theſe nets were vſed in each pariſh thorough
England, according to the ſtatute: there would not be the
tenth Crowe aliue, which is now in this Realme, with
in theſe fewe yeares, and as ſome doe iudge, the Crowes
and birdes doe eate and ſpoyle as much graine yearely, as
would goe nigh to finde all the people and cattell of the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
ſhiere in England for one yeare. For it is thought they
deuour &amp; ſpoyle yéerely in and for each pariſh in this Realm
of this graine, viij. buſhels. There is counted two &amp; fiftie
thouſande pariſhes, ſo then there is two and fiftie quarters
of graine deſtroyed yearely by Crowes and ſuch like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a number of other pultrie about mens houſes deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Crowes and Kytes, and chiefely it is thought, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the negligence of ſlouthfull huſbandes, which yearely
toyles and labours to ſowe corne, and regardes not after
the ſauing of the ſame, or yet to wage or giue to other (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſtatute) that would in winter and other
times be glad to take paine to take &amp; deſtroy them. Thus
I haue declared touching the deſtruction of corne by crows
and ſuch like, and the profite and gaine that would come
thereby, in vſing the ſaide nettes in each pariſh thorough
the Realme which nets may well be vſed all the winter,
and alſo from March till Midſommer or ſomewhat after.
Ye may alſo baite your ſhrape, with fleſh, or ſome carrion,

and ſo ye may take Kytes, fleſh Crowes, Rauens, and ſuch
like, when ye ſée cauſe. The laying your nette is eaſle, but
to make him caſt well, is all in the ſetting the tayle pinne,
and placing the pully ſtake, in drawing your vpper line.
Alſo in Iuly and Auguſt ye may well vſe the lime buſh, and

                     <p>YE ſhall take of <hi>Nux vomica,</hi> ſo called, which ye ſhall
buy at the Apothecaries, they are gathered in the ſea,
and are as broad as a péece of foure pence, and a quarter of
an inch thicke or more. Thoſe which are the whiteſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
are counted for the beſt, when ye will ocupie any, doe
grate, or cut one ſmall in thinne ſlices, then beate it into
powder if ye can, the finer it is the better, and the ſooner
will make the Crowes or Pyes to fall. Put of the ſayde
powder into a péece of fleſh, and ſo lay it abroad, and yée
ſhall ſoone ſée Pie, or Crowe or Rauen take it. Then muſt
ye watch hun a while after, and ye ſhall perceiue him to
fall downe, then muſt ye follow to take him. But if yée
let him remaine one quarter of an houre, he will recouer
againe, for this <hi>nux vomica</hi> it doth but make them drunk,
and dyzie for a time. The Kyte I haue not ſéene taken,
for he will caſt it vp againe.</p>

take a ſmall ſtring that muſt be tide in the midſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hoope,

wreath of haire, and thorow a hole in a pinne of wood ſet in
the ground before the yrne pin, and let the knot of the ſame
ſtring, reſt in the ſayd hole. Then fill the ſaid hole with an
other ſhort pinne of wood made blunt, putting it ſlight into
the hole, to ſtay the knot of the ſtring that kéepes downe
the net, and on that ſhort pinne, make a hole, or ſlit, &amp; put
a thorne with a baite theron: and when any thing do touch
the baite, the ſhort pinne will ſoone fall, and the ſtring ſlips
through the hole, and ſo the net turnes ſuddenly vpon the
fowle. Thus much for ordering this kinde of net.</p>
