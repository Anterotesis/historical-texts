            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Have now a long time taken notice of much difference and contention about the morality of the fourth Commandement, but I never gave my ſelfe to looke into the bottome of it till now. I ever conceived it for the ſubſtance to be Morall; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, what ſhould it make among the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which all account the Law morall, in diſtinction both from the law judiciall, and the law ceremoniall given by <hi>Moſes</hi> unto the Jewes. Theſe ten Commandements the Lord ſpake from the top of mount Sina, in the hearing of all the people; and by way of preparation to ſo notable a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as to meet with God, and to heare him ſpeake unto them, two dayes were given them <hi>to ſanctifie themſelves</hi>

Yet this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it hath from God, that immediatly after the Creation, the Lord reſting on the ſeventh day from his works, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it.</hi> And <note place="margin">Gen. <hi>2. 3.</hi>
               </note> therefore Doctor <hi>Andrewes,</hi> ere he died Biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,
<pb facs="tcp:66015:5"/>
in his patterne of Catecheticall doctrine (I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cite it under his name, becauſe it is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to bee his) and as I have heard upon divers good grounds, treating upon this Commandement; and having propoſed this queſtion; <hi>But is not the Sabbath a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and ſo abrogated by Chriſt?</hi> Makes anſwer to it in this manner, <hi>Doe as Chriſt did in the cauſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce; look whether it were ſo from the beginning; Now the beginning of the Sabbath was in Paradiſe, before there was any ſinne, and ſo before there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any Saviour, and ſo before there was any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or figure of a Saviour. And if they ſay, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured the reſt that we ſhall have from our ſinnes in Chriſt, we grant it, and therefore the day is changed, but no ceremony proved.</hi> And yet we are not ignorant, how Papiſts have practiſed to raze the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo out of the Law given on mount Sina, as if that alſo were out of date, being (as they conceive) but of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive nature at firſt, ſo little evidence doe they finde for it by the light of Nature; and now the world is growne ſo wiſe, that they know how to worſhip God by Images, without committing any idolatry at all; though this myſtery of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſtate is not thought fit to be communicated unto the vulgar. But doe we not all acknowledge the light of Nature to be much corrupted ſince the fall of <hi>Adam?</hi> how much more our judgement of morall things; wherein <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> confeſſeth that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> perſwaſion. And if way be given to mens wanton wils for the gratiſying of corrupt affections, more breaches than theſe are like to be made in the Decalogue. I have heard that Cardinall <hi>Cuſanus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke to juſtifie the ſin of Sodome. Sure I am, amongſt the Lacedemonians wives were common: And <hi>Brennus</hi> that Ancient Invader of other Nations made profeſſion,
<pb facs="tcp:66015:6"/>
that he knew no other Law of Nature but this, that <hi>The weaker ſhould be in ſubjection to the ſtronger;</hi> like as King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> in his death-bed, being demanded, who ſhould ſucceed him in the Kingdom, made anſwer, even <hi>He whoſe ſword is the longeſt. Carneades</hi> I thinke was the man, who having on a day made a ſingular ſpeech in commendation of Juſtice; afterwards diſcourſed as elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the contrary, ſhewing that there was no juſtice at all by the law of nature; every naturall thing ſeeking to maintaine it ſelfe by the deſtruction of others. So the fire maintaines itſelfe by the combuſtion of each combuſtible thing whereunto it approacheth; and the water overflowes all naturally, and beats downe all dammes, it can, to make roome for it ſelfe. And the greateſt Beaſts maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by preying on thoſe that have no power to reſiſt them. The more cauſe have wee to bleſſe God for giving us the Law Morall in writing, which grew ſo miſerably defaced in the hearts of men. And that herein the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Sabbath is mentioned among the reſt, this hath ever ſatisfied mee, and aſſured that the ſubſtance thereof is Morall; and that accordingly wee ought to inure our ſelves to the ſanctification of the Sabbath, though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we find in our ſelves no greater reluctation to any Commandement than to this: Pardon me if I judge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by my ſelfe in this particular. Nay, upon this very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration have we not the more cauſe to ſtrive againſt this inteſtine corruption of ours? His Majeſty is much deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in hunting; it is a recreation mixt with manly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, well becomming a King; but I he are he never uſeth to hunt on the Lords day. And ſo much the rather ſhould the Lords Sabbaths be deare unto us, becauſe the goodneſſe and mercy of God appeares no where more, than in giving us his Sabbaths; calling upon us thereby to reſt from the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him (and God knowes, a Chriſtian ſoule finds no reſt any where but in him) and to walke with him in holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:66015:6"/>
as he is pleaſed to walk in the midſt of us, as <note n="a" place="margin">Hoſ. <hi>11. 9.</hi>
               </note> the Holy One of Iſrael: ſo to draw us away from worldly cares and pleaſures, to the entertaining of heavenly and holy cares, to enrich our ſelves with the knowledge of God, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create our ſoules in the Lord, as hee ſolaceth himſelfe in us, according to that, <hi>Hee tooke his ſolace in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe</hi>

The Lord pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his Tabernacle amongſt us here on earth, and we are as it were taken up into the mount of God, there to be transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured before him. When the Lord appeared unto <hi>Jacob</hi> in a viſion by night, when he fled from his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> and he ſaw a ladder erected between heaven and earth, and the Lord on the top of it, the Angels aſcending and deſcending by it; when he awoke, <hi>How dreadfull</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is this place;</hi>

               <hi>The Lord was here, and I was not a ware; ſurely it is no other than the houſe of God, and the gate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And are not our Temples the houſes of God? are they not the very gates of heaven? In our ſolemne aſſemblies is not aladder erected betweene earth and heaven? is not the Lord on the top of it, and are not we <hi>humbled at his feet to heare his Word?</hi> The gracious inſtructions which we <note place="margin">Deut. <hi>33. 3.</hi>
               </note> receive from him, are they not as ſo many Angels deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto us; the gracious motions that ariſe in our hearts, upon meditation of his Word, of thankeſgiving to him, of rejoycing in him yea, of ſorrowing for our ſins, are they not as ſo many Angels aſcending to him? Our teares have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motion, one naturall, downwards, another ſpiritual, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for the Lord <hi>puts them into his bottels:</hi> the hairs of our head are numbred, how much more the ſighes of our

heart, and groanes of our ſpirit? And have we not great cauſe to inure our ſelves betimes thus to ſabbatize with God, as he ſabbatizeth with us? that we may be the fitter to keepe our eternall Sabbath with him: (for ſo is our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe repreſented unto us) in the enjoying of him for ever, and being filled with his glory; which <hi>Auſtin</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Yet I willingly confeſſe, that in my obſervation, two things there are, which ſeeme to be of great moment, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the morality of the fourth Commandement: <hi>1.</hi> The change of the day. <hi>2.</hi> The generall opinion of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pronouncing in an indefinit manner the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to be ceremoniall. Yet notwithſtanding, the regiſtring of it in the Decalogue, which is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted the Law morall, I ſay, this conſideration hath even prevailed more with mee, to accompt the ſubſtance thereof morall. Nevertheleſſe for the honour I owe, and reſpect I beare to Antiquity, I have endevoured to underſtand the Antients aright, and to enquire in what reſpect they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted it ceremoniall. For to my underſtanding, the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the reſt, or the ſervice of the day, eſpecially unto us Chriſtians is meerely morall. But as concerning the reſt it ſelfe, it may be, ſome ceremoniality may be found therein, eſpecially conſidered in conjunction with the time appointed for the worſhip and ſervice of God. And herein I thanke God, I have found good ſatisfaction unto my ſelfe, at laſt; how I ſhall ſatisfie others I know not. And when ſometimes I had waded thorow the Epiſtle to the Romans
<pb facs="tcp:66015:7"/>
unto the fourteenth Chapter; there occaſion was given me to conſider further of this controverſie, ſo farre, as a few dayes would give libertie to provide my next Sermon: and therein I made uſe of <hi>Hoſpinian,</hi> and of <hi>Pererius,</hi> and no more as I remember; but in <hi>Pererius</hi> I came acquainted with <hi>Toſtatus</hi> his Arguments, directed againſt the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inſtitution of the Sabbath from the Creation, which till then I imagined had been generally received without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; according to that which the ſtory of Geneſis at firſt ſight ſeemes to commend unto us. And by this occaſion my mind working hereupon in my meditations, I thought fit, for opening a way, to the better clearing of the truth, to diſtinguiſh three things, in ſubordination, the latter to the former. <hi>1.</hi> The firſt was a time in generall to be ſet apart for Gods ſervice. <hi>2.</hi> The ſecond was the proportion of this time. <hi>3.</hi> The third, the particularity of the day according to the ſpecified proportion. <hi>1.</hi> The firſt ſeemed tome of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty by the very light of nature, to as many as know God, and acknowledge him to be their Creator: and this I tooke, and doe take to be the higheſt degree of morality in this precept, and herein hitherto I have found no oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>2.</hi> As touching the ſecond, by light of nature we are ſomewhat to ſeeke, as whether one day in a weeke or more; or one day in a month or more; or one day in a yeare or more, ought to be ſet apart for the ſolemne worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. So that herein it is fit we ſhould expect dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from God, the Lord of the Sabbath. <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe the ſervice of the day is his, and it ſeemes fit he ſhould cut out what proportion of time he thinkes convenient. <hi>2.</hi> For the maintenance of uniformitie therein; and leſt otherwiſe there might be as many diviſions hereabouts, as there are Churches in the world, and contentions alſo conſequently, each ſtanding for their owne election. For reaſon of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturall nature is very various, and therein commonly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb facs="tcp:66015:8"/>
beares the greateſt ſway, and drawes the judgement to comply with it. But when God hath determined a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine proportion of time, it may be we ſhall find great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie therein, even to naturall reaſon, and farre more than in any other. D. <hi>Field,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Broad</hi> reports, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, that to one who knowes the ſtory of the Creation, it is evident by light of nature, that one day in ſeven is to be conſecrated to Gods ſervice. And <hi>Azorius</hi> the Jeſuit in his morall Inſtitutions acknowledgeth that <hi>It is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Part. <hi>2.</hi> lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>to reaſon, that after ſix work dayes, one day ſhould be conſecrated to divine worſhip.</hi> The leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of dayes is into a weeke, the next greater diviſion is into a month, the next into a yeare. Now by light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſeemes farre more reaſonable, that one day in ſeven ſhould be imployed in Gods ſervice, than one day in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. And if a ſeventh part of our time be to be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto God, better a ſeventh day, than a ſeventh part of every day, becauſe the worldly occupations of each of thoſe dayes, muſt needs cauſe miſerable diſtraction. Thus reaſon may diſcourſe in probable manner, when God hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us to open a way unto us. Certainly, when God hath once determined the proportion of time, it is ſo farre from being accounted morall, as perpetuall, and ſtill to hold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till God himſelfe ſhall alter it. <hi>3.</hi> As for the particularity of the day according to the forenamed proportion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſhould be farre more to ſeeke, were wee left unto our ſelves; time conſiſting in a continuall flux and ſucceſſion, one part afore, and another after. As namely, ſuppoſing one day in ſeven is to be conſecrated to Gods ſervice; yet wee ſhall ſtill be to ſeeke, which day of the ſeven is to be ſet apart for an holy uſe. And no marvell; for in it ſelfe it is nothing materiall. For a proportion of ſervice being required with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a certaine compaſſe, ſo it be done within that compaſſe, every Maſter reſts ſatisfied with his ſervants worke. But
<pb facs="tcp:66015:8"/>
as for difference in the proportion, every one accounts that a matter of great moment. God himſelfe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth this; therefore to whom he gives but little, at their hands he expects but little; to whom hee gives much, of them he expects much, as our Saviour teacheth. And Saint <hi>John</hi> exhorts Chriſtians ſo to carry themſelves in the Lords ſervice, <hi>that they may receive a full reward.</hi> Yet <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2</hi> Iohn. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> both for our aſſurance that our ſervice ſhall be acceptable with God (for of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat</hi> who made Iſrael to ſin, we reade, that <hi>Hee offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed of his owne heart,</hi> which latter clauſe undoubtedly is added by way of exprobration) as alſo to prevent divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by reaſon of different opinions thereabouts, and as different courſes therin; it is fit that herein we ſhould wait for the Lords direction, and deſignation of the particular day. And even this alſo was ſo ordered by God himſelfe, and that in great congruitie, as appeares to as many, as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtory of the Creation. For the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſpatched all his workes in ſix dayes, and reſting on the ſeventh, commanded man to imitate him. For in this reſpect it was, that at the firſt <hi>the Lord bleſſed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day and ſanctified it:</hi> and ſome thouſand of yeares after gives this reaſon, why after ſix dayes of labour, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth being <hi>the Sabbath of the Lord our God,</hi> no manner of worke ſhould be done therein: which being once thus ordered by the Lord of the Sabbath, it muſt be in force of perpetuall obſervation, as a requiſite determination of the morality of this Law; and not of an alterable nature, ſave only by the ſame authority whereby it was ordained. Now to my underſtanding, by the fourth Commandement it is cleare: Firſt, that God commanded ſome time to bee ſet apart, and ſanctified unto his ſervice. Secondly, that
<pb facs="tcp:66015:9"/>
the proportion of this time he hath defined to be one day in ſeven. Thirdly, that the particular day under this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was deſigned to be the ſeventh, and that unto the Iews in correſpondencie to the ſeventh day from the firſt creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where in God commanded them to reſt from all their workes, like as on that day the Lord reſted from his works. And I thinke, there is no queſtion amongst Chriſtians, but that all this ought to be religiouſly obſerved by the people of God, untill the Lord himſelfe manifeſt his pleaſure for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, and no farther, in any particular, than God ſhall manifeſt his pleaſure for alteration. As for example. Firſt for the time, then for the reſt, laſtly, for the ſervice of the day itſelfe. Firſt, If God hath not manifeſted his will for any alteration, of ſetting apart ſome time for divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; we muſt ſtill continue to ſet ſome time apart for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice. Likewiſe, if God hath not manifeſted his pleaſure, to have the proportion of time altered, which hath bin originally allotted unto his ſervice; we muſt not preſume to allow a leſſe proportion of time for his ſervice, than hath been formerly preſcribed by him. Only both <hi>Gomarus</hi> and <hi>Rivet</hi> concur in this, that we may allow more; and that in reaſon, it is ſit now under the Goſpell to allow more time for Gods ſervice, rather than leſſe, in compariſon to that which he would have allowed him under the Law. And as for the particularity of the day, if God hath manifeſted his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to have it altered, it muſt be altered, (as in caſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to have been ceremoniall, in reſpect of the reſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thereon) and another in the ſeven ſubſtituted in the place thereof; and that according to Gods direction, and not otherwiſe. Secondly, ſo as touching the reſt of the day commanded upon Mount Sinaunto the Jewes (not ſo unto <hi>Adam</hi> upon the Creation; but onely wee reade that <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it,</hi> which ſanctification yet on mans part drawes a reſt with it) if there be found a juſt diſtinction betweene a reſt morall, (ſo
<pb facs="tcp:66015:9"/>
far forth as the ſanctification of the day requireth) and a reſt ceremonial, of a more rigorous nature, and that prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſomething in Chriſt; it will follow herehence that the reſt morall ſtill continueth, together with the ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the day, as much as ever, and that the rigorous reſt muſt fall and be aboliſhed. Thirdly, ſo in the laſt place, as touching the ſervice of the day; whatſoever was preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto the Jewes thereon as ceremoniall, is at end; as namely the Sabbath ſacrifice which doubled the daily ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Only the publique miniſtery of the Word and Prayer, as morall, ſtill continueth, together with our Sacramentall ceremonies which Chriſt hath given unto his Church, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and the Lords Supper; and therefore the Lords day was called by the Ancients <hi>the day of light,</hi> in reference unto Baptiſme, Baptiſme being called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, illumination, the firſt worke of grace, and the day of Bread, in reference to the Lords Supper. Now all this I hope to make appeare, before I give over this taske which I have taken in hand. And I was the more confirmed in my meditations, when I heard by one of my Auditors, a Divine, that in this doctrine of mine concerning the Sabbath, as touching the ſubſtance of that which was delivered by me, I nothing differed from the opinion of D. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> whoſe diſcourſe on that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at that time I had not been acquainted with. But ſince I finde that <hi>Sect. 8.</hi> of that his Lecture, he profeſſeth that <hi>the Jewiſh reſt cannot ſtand with our Chriſtian libertie;</hi> I ſay ſo too, and withall endevour to give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the abrogation thereof. Further, the ſame Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Doctor profeſſeth, That <hi>we only are ſo farre to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from worke, as it is an impediment to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch duties as are then commanded.</hi> I am not only of his opinion herein, but withall deſire no more than this to be granted for the maintenance of the morall reſt of the fourth Commandement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66015:10"/>
But I have obſerved ſome to deny any thing in the Iewiſh Sabbath to have been ceremoniall, yet will not have that fourth Commandement morall, but poſitive rather, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching both the obſervation of one day in ſeven, and as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the particularity of the day. And therefore they deny it to be morall, becauſe it hath not evidence by light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But was it evident to the Jewes by light of nature, that the God of their Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and that brought them out of the land of Aegypt, was the true God of the world, and that therefore they ought to have no other gods but him? Is it evident by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that God is not to be worſhipped by an Image? Or if naturall evidence hereof faile us in this ſtate of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein we are, ſhall theſe lawes be denied to be the morall Law of God? yet I nothing doubt but the proportion of time allowed for Gods ſervice, much more the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the day appointed thereunto, is alterable at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God. And ceremonials, I confeſſe, are in ſuch a ſenſe poſitive, or rather more than poſitive; namely, ſuch as not only may, but muſt like ſhadowes fly away when the body of them comes in place. And yet I find that <hi>Cajetan</hi> in this point confounds ceremoniall with poſitive; though I think he would not call it ceremoniall, unleſſe he conceived, that this which he cals poſitive, had ſome ceremoniality in it. But their reaſon whereupon they deny the ceremoniality of it, in my judgment is not ſufficient. <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe they ground it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſuppoſition very queſtionable, namely, that the Sabbath was inſtituted before the fall, which ſome deny, and that with very great probability in my judgment. <hi>2.</hi> Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is not good. For though it were no ceremony at the firſt; yet others ſay it might be afterwards, and give inſtance in the rain-bow, which though in courſe of nature extant before, yet was not a ſigne till after the Flood: and though I know ſome who would not admit of this inſtance, yet the
<pb facs="tcp:66015:10"/>
Theſis ſeemes very poſſible; and clearely of ſuch a condition was matrimony, ordained without all queſtion before the fall. <hi>3.</hi> What is that which they ſay is not ceremoniall? is it the ſervice of the day in the ſanctifying of it? None that I know, maintains that to be neceſſarily ceremoniall. Or is it the reſt of the day? Obſerve well, and you ſhal find no reſt expreſly commanded at the firſt, but only it is ſignified, that God dedicated it to his ſervice; which yet, I confeſſe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, draws after it a reſt from all works oppoſite or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimentall to the ſanctification of it. <hi>4.</hi> Thus they take little care to ſatisfie the Fathers, who generally concurre in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the ceremoniality of it. And we are too weak in theſe dayes, to beare up an opinion in flat contradiction to the Ancients, and to keepe our ſelves blameleſſe. Yet Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Andrews</hi> (Biſhop of Wincheſter, ere hee died) in his pattern of Catechetical doctrine profeſſeth againſt the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniality of it; but ſo as acknowledging it to prefigure the reſt we ſhall have from our ſins in Chriſt, and that therefore the day is changed, though (as he thinks) the ceremony not thereby proved. Yet <hi>pag. 241.</hi> having propoſed ſuch a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Whether we muſt obſerve the Sabbath as the Jewes did, not to kindle a fire, nor to dreſſe any meat on that day,</hi> anſwereth thus; <hi>We ſay No; for this was but ceremoniall, and belonged only unto them. 5.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground (to wit, upon the denying of the ceremonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the particular day) they will hardly be able to juſtifie the abrogation of it. For albeit, they find ſome ground for obſervation of the Lords day, yet no ground at all for the abrogation of the ſeventh. And that which is only poſitive, muſt ſtill continue, till it be abrogated by as good authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as whereby it was made. <hi>1.</hi> And wee find the practiſe of the Church for the obſervation of both ſome hundreds of yeares continued. <hi>2.</hi> And it ſeemes congruous to reaſon in the judgement of thoſe, who oppoſe both the inſtitution of it
<pb facs="tcp:66015:11"/>
forthwith after the creation, and the morality of one day in ſeven, that wee ſhould conſecrate to Gods ſervice rather more dayes than fewer.</p>
            <p>And ſurely to diſcover as good ground, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſervation of the Lords day now, as for obſervation of the ſeventh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, is the greateſt difficulty that I find in this argument, if not inſuperable; whereof yet wee ſhall find our ſelves in greater meaſure eaſed, if we can ſhew manifeſt evidence for the abrogation of the ſeventh, which was ſabbaticall to the Jewes. Now firſt, this is clearly performed by acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ceremoniality of it, which yet I doe not affect ſhould be acknowledged without proofe. Secondly, thus alſo the Fathers ſhall fairely be ſatisfied. Thirdly, and the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lords day in the place therof advanced. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, eſpecially if the ceremoniality be ſo cleared, as plainly to manifeſt, that the body thereof was Chriſt, which is a very hard taske to performe of all other ceremonies, yea, of all other Sabbaths or any other Sabbath ſave of the weekely Sabbath. But of all theſe, to wit: <hi>1.</hi> Of the originall inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it. <hi>2.</hi> Of the morality of one day in ſeven, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to be obſerved. <hi>3.</hi> Of the authority of the Lords day, introduced into the place of the ſeventh, by more than Eccleſiaſticall or Humane conſtitution, we ſhall ſpeak more by occaſion of the ſeverall paſſages in this diſcourſe, which comes to be examined, ſo to make way to enquire about the ſanctification of the Lords day, whether in oppoſition as much to worldly ſports and paſtimes (or more rather) as to the works of our calling. For to the conſideration hereof we are now driven; it being now held that they who ſpeak or write againſt ſuch ſports and paſtimes upon the Lords day, our Chriſtian Sabbath, doe oppoſe truth. Now whether we do oppoſe truth in ſtanding for the ſanctification of the Lords day, and maintaining theſe paſtimes ſpecified to be an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment thereunto; we deſire to commend our ſelves to the
<pb facs="tcp:66015:11"/>
judgement of every Chriſtian conſcience, upon conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our reaſons herein repreſented. Our Savior commands us <hi>to give unto Caeſar that which is Caeſars, and unto God the things that are Gods;</hi> and wee hold our ſelves bound to hearken unto his voice, as we hope to be ſaved by his grace. And becauſe in ſome caſes it may bee doubtfull, what belongs unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and what belongs unto God, by reaſon of the darkneſſe of our underſtanding, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our judgement; it behooves us ſo much the more to labour in the inveſtigation of this difference, and carefully looke unto it, that under colour of giving unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars,</hi> we doe not give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is not <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and not give unto God that which is Gods: and under colour of giving unto God that which is Gods, we doe not give unto God that which is not Gods, and not give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars.</hi> And albeit D. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> his Lecture was neither delivered (as I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) by word of mouth, nor afterwards ſet forth in print to ſtrengthen ſo ſharpe proceedings againſt the Miniſters of God as now are in courſe; yet ſeeing it hath been of late tranſlated and publiſhed in Engliſh, with a Preface, to the juſtifying of the ſame proceedings, even then (as it ſeemes) intended; and that neither according to any Law or Canon that we know of; therefore I am driven, (who otherwiſe, I am verily perſwaded, ſhould never have ſet hand unto this worke, but left it unto others, who are better verſed in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall and paſtorall Divinity than my ſelfe) to give my ſelf to the examination, both of the Preface, and of the Booke it ſelfe: for we labour, as it were, for life under the burthen of it; and this is ſet forth, as it ſeemes, to promote our condemnation.</p>

Hence was it that <hi>Irenaeus, Iuſtin Martyr, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> men of renowne for learning in the primitive times (three of which are cited in the text of this following diſcourſe, and the fourth quoted in the margin) affirme for certaine, that never any of the Patriarches before <hi>Moſes</hi> Law did obſerve the Sabbath: which queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they muſt have done, had that Law been moral, and dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by nature, as now ſome teach us. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5.

In a book prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not long ago I hear, there is alleaged a paſſage of one of the <note n="“" place="margin">Theodoret.</note> Fathers, for the free uſe of ſcripture by all ſorts of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar people; and it is tranſlated alſo into Engliſh, belike, for the benefit of the common people, but in a ſecond edition the Greeke ſentence is <note n="“" place="margin">and by inquiry I find it true</note> ſaid to be reteined, but the Engliſh tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation quite omitted. Did the Author report of gratifying the people thus, and quench his care of providing for their benefit? This obſervation is none of mine, but accidentally brought unto my hands by one of ſome qualitie, by occaſion of mutuall communication betweene us. But ſince, I heare the Author hath made amends for that another way. For having in the firſt edition profeſſed, that <hi>Popiſh errours are not damnable in themſelves,</hi> which with what reſpect it ſhould bee delivered <hi>for the benefit of the common people,</hi> amongſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, I know not; in the ſecond edition it is corrected thus, <hi>popiſh errours are not damnable in the iſſue.</hi> But where corrected? not in the text, (that continuing the ſame ſtill, that <hi>ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours are not damnable in themſelves)</hi> but among the <hi>Errata</hi> at the end of the booke, although the Author was warned of the ſtrangeneſſe of that aſſertion (as I heare) and that in contradiction to the doctrine of the Biſhop of Canterbury in his Treatiſe of Councels, profeſſing that the Papiſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the cup from the <note n="*" place="margin">people.</note> people, is a damnable errour. Here is brave jugling in the Text to comply with ſome, and in the <hi>Errata,</hi> to provide againſt afterclaps for himſelfe, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66015:14"/>
with others, and betray deep diſſimulation in both, enough to make ſome man (when ſuch courſes are diſcovered) to be abhorred of al. But toproceed, the Tranſlator doth not ſay, he hath performed this taske fot the benefit of himſelfe, yet he plainly deales upon an advantagious argument. But if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie ſhall be pleaſed out of his gracious diſpoſition (whereof he hath given many remarkable documents) to vouch ſafe to receive information concerning the honor of the Lords day, in way of a juſt and neceſſary Apologie, which wee are driven to make, I truſt (through Gods goodneſſe (in whoſe hands are the hearts of Kings) it ſhall bee neither advantagious to him, nor diſadvantagious to us; and his Majeſtie may perhaps bee found to abſolve us in the Court of his owne conſcience. But what is that <hi>benefit of the common people,</hi> whereof this Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is ſo zealous? I gueſſe it is in freeing them from ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that hereafter they may not bee ſo peeviſhly fooliſh, as out of any Cabaliſmes of conſcience, to forbeare their may-games; and uſuall dancings on the Lords day; yet ſome, and they no ſmall ones, as I have heard, do profeſſe them no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to be allowed then as they may be done to the praiſe and glory of God. Which calls to my remembrance what a Scotchman ſometimes ſaid, as he was going in one of London ſtreets, and ſpying one of his acquaintance on the other ſide: for calling him aloud by his name; O Sir, ſaith he, when ſhall we meet at a Taverne, to give God thanks for our deliverance out of the Ile de Re? But how comes that to bee accounted ſuperſtitious, which all the Biſhops of the land, and the whole Kingdome accounts the prophanation of the Sabbath, not to ſpeake of particular Biſhops, though as great for learning and place, as Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> who in his patterne of catecheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doctrine, tells us of ſome, who on the Lords day, <hi>vacant nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, ſpectaoulis, theatris, choreis,</hi> and approves the ſtiling of ſuch a Sabbath, <hi>Sabbatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aurei vit uli, the Sabbath of the golden Calf;</hi> I make bold to tranſlate it for the benefit of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people; and B. <hi>Downham</hi> beſtowes the like denomination upon ſuch a Sabbath. Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> over and above cites <hi>Auſtin</hi> for the like ſaying, but that is more then any quotation of his doth make good, for ought I find hitherunto. But whatſhould I alleage one or two Doctors opinions hereupon though
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66015:14"/>
never ſo great, when an whole Kingdome ſtands for the ſame in my judgement, even the Kingdome of England, as may appeare by the Act of Parliament 1. <hi>Caroli,</hi> concerning the Sabbath. The introduction there unto, manifeſteth three grounds whereupon they proceed to make that Act. 1 That there is nothing more acceptable to God, then his holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice. 2 That the due ſanctification of the Lords day, is a great part of Gods holy woſhip and ſervice. 1 That men are very prone to prophane it. Now to prevent this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the Sabbath, many things are there prohibited; and one amongſt the reſt is this, that none ſhall come forth out of his own pariſh about any ſports or paſtimes; whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that to come out of a mans pariſh on the Lords day, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any ſports or paſtimes is to prophane the Sabbath. For to prevent the prophanation of our Chriſtian Sabbath and to maintaine the ſanctification thereof is this law made. Now to come out of a mans owne pariſh about what buſineſſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, no wiſe man will ſay that it is to prophane the Sabbath; but according to the nature of the buſineſſe, whereabout hee comes forth of his owne pariſh, ſo ſhall hee bee found, either to prophane the Sabbath, or not to prophane it. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, for a man to come forth of his owne pariſh to heare a ſermon, no man I thinke, will ſay, that it is to prophane the Sabbath. In like manner, to come forth of his owne pariſh, into an other pariſh to fetch a Phyſitian or Surgeon in caſe of neceſſitie, no man will ſay that this is to prophane the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, becauſe the buſineſſe about which hee comes is not to prophane the Sabbath. But for a man to come out of his own pariſh to buy or ſell, to trade or traffique, no neceſſitie urging thereunto, this is to prophane the Sabbath; becauſe in ſuch ſort to trade on the Sabbath day, is to prophane the Sabbath. In like ſort, for a man to come out of his owne pariſh about any ſports or paſtimes, is therefore to Prophane the Sabbath in the judgement of the Parliament, becauſe the keeping and performing of theſe ſports and paſtimes, is a manifeſt profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sabbath in the judgement of the King and his Parliament. Now if all ſports and paſtimes on the Lords day bee a prophanation of the Lords day our Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; it followeth that may-games and moricings, and

dancings, at ſuch times uſuall, are alſo a manifeſt profanation of the Sabbath. And herein wee ſpeake, as I conceive, in his Majeſties meaning, asſiſted with the great Councell of his Kingdome, the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and the Houſe of Commons: and whoſoever ſhall account it ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition to ſay ſo, ſhall therewithall charge his royall Majeſtie, and all the Lords both Spirituall and Temporall; and in a word, the whole Parliament with ſuperſtition. Yet if it were onely the benefit of the common people, that this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator did intend, I for my part ſhould bee content to ſuffer him to enjoy the honour of ſeeking the benefit of the people; onely admoniſhing the people commited to my charge, to conſider well whether there bee any ſuch benefit to bee reaped thereby as is pretended. And ſeeing Saint <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts us to <note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</note> give diligence, <hi>that wee may bee found of Chriſt in peace,</hi> when <hi>hee comes in flaming fire to render vengeance on all them that know not God, nor obey not the Goſpell of Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Let every one examine himſelfe, whether hee could bee content to bee taken dancing about a may-pole on the Lords day, when the Lord, even the Lord of the Sabbath ſhall come, and that to be found of him in this condition, were to bee found of him in peace. But ſeeing this tranſlation, and eſpecially the Preface of this Author tends to the promoting of the moſt rigorous cenſures againſt many; it ſtands us upon to plead our owne cauſe, and to labour herein as for life: even in examination ofthe doctrine here delivered, that wee may finde upon how juſt ground it proceeds; otherwiſe wee may bee juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of all: and in the cenſures that paſſo upon us whether of Excommunication, or Suſpenſion, or Deprivation, finde none to plead our cauſe, or to commiſerate us. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing I obſerve in this title, is the paſſage of Scripture here mentioned, as juſtifying the doctrine here delivered out of <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. 27. <hi>The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</hi> Now none of us makes queſtion but that <hi>the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was made for man:</hi> Nay wee nothing doubt but that all the dayes of the weeke were made for man, that is, for the good of man, but the Sabbath for the beſt good, not the baſeſt good of man in following his worldly pleaſures. The ſix dayes of the weeke are given us to labour in our ordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66015:15"/>
for the maintenance of ourlife temporall: but the ſeventh is ſanctified by God, that is, dedicated to holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes in the ſervice of God, and to inure us to recreate our ſelves and to delight in the Lord; that as his ſoule takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in us, ſo our ſoules might be accuſtomed to take pleaſure in him; and to make his Sabbaths our delight, to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate them as glorious unto the Lord. It is true, there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other end of the Sabbath, and that was <hi>ut vires recolligeret,</hi> to recollect his ſtrength which had been ſpent and waſted in the ſixe dayes of labour; whence it followes evidently, that when a man was hungry as the diſciples were, when they plucked the eares of corne, they were not bound by any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Sabbath to abſtaine from ſuch a courſe, whereby a mans ſtrength would become more and more weakned and impaired. Not that theſe things were commanded on the Sabbath day, but permitted; as is often ſignified by the word <gap reason="foreign">

But this Tranſlator deſires, as it ſeemes, from the generalitie of mans good to ſeale up an opinion in the minde of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that the Sabbath was made not onely for the ſervice of God, and for the promoting of a man in the knowledge and feare of God, but for the furthering of his carnall pleaſures alſo. But never was it knowne that our Saviour juſtified any libertie to ſuch courſes on the Sabbath: Neither were any ſuch things, as it ſeemes in courſe, in the dayes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos,</hi> who reprehends them for ſaying, <hi>Am.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>When will the Sabbath be gone,</hi> that they might returne to their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſes?

And therefore this text is moſt unſeaſonably and impertinently alleaged by the Tranſlator to ſerve his turh, being farre more fit to croſſe his purpoſes, then any way to promote them. So from the conſideration of the title, I come to the preface.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Of any Miniſter or Paſtor in the Church of England that  maintaines us Chriſtians to be obliged to the obſervation and ſanctification of the Jewiſh Sabbath, or of any Sabbath that is <hi>a ſhadow of things to come, the body whereof is of Chriſt,</hi> I never heard or read. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Yet for ſome hundred yeares in the Primitive Church, not the Lords day onely, but the ſeventh  day alſo was religiouſly obſerved, not by <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> onely, but by pious Chriſtians alſo, as <hi>Baronius</hi> writeth and <hi>Gomarus</hi> confeſſeth, and <hi>Rivet</hi> alſo, that we are bound in conſcience under the Goſpell, to allow for Gods ſervice a better proportion of time, than the Jewes did under the law, rather than a worſe. And further it is well knowne, that beſides the weekely Sabbath, there was variety of obſervation of times amongſt the Jewes, and divers of them called Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths alſo, as ſome think, not one whereof was mentioned in the Decalogue, or pronounced by the Lord from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> as the fourth Commandement was, for the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the weekly Sabbath. So that this Praefacer every way ſheweth miſerable looſeneſſe in his diſcourſe. And if <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> how wretched heretickes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever did ſtill inforce the ſanctification of the Jewiſh Sabbath, (whoſe wretchedneſſe yet conſiſted not ſo much in inforcing this, as in inforcing all the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes;</hi> the Jewiſh Sabbath long after <hi>Cerinthus</hi> continuing to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by many pious Chriſtians, as <hi>Baronius</hi> obſerveth &amp; others, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth oppoſe all ſuch doctrine and practiſe in theſe paſſages of his here mentioned: did not this Author know that upon theſe very paſſages of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts and Socinians, as vile heretickes as <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus,</hi> and <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> for their blood have gone ſo farre, as not onely to overthrow the obſervation of the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but the ſanctifying of the Lords day alſo. The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66015:17"/>
of the law ceremoniall ſtanding ſtill in force (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the opinion of the heretickes mentioned) is I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, a dangerous point, and ſuch as not onely ſeemed (as this Praefacer minceth it, out of what degree of wiſdome or providence I know not) to confirme the Jewes <hi>in their incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie,</hi> but indeed juſtly might confirme them; nor onely occaſion, but juſtly cauſe alſo others, to make queſtion of our Saviours comming in the fleſh; not ſo the obſervation of the ſeventh day to ſanctifie it, for ought this Author hath hitherto manifeſted, or throughout this preface of his doth manifeſt; and the ſanctification of this day is apparantly commanded in the moral law ſpoken from Mount Sinai. And thoſe Chriſtians who a long time kept this ſeventh day holy as well as the Lords day, had no opinion of any danger at all in this their obſervation. And it ſtood the ancient Fathers upon to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the obſervation of the law ceremoniall. Yet what ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi> againſt theſe heretickes, to whom this Author in the firſt place referreth us? All that hee delivers againſt the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians in reference to this particular is onely this: <hi>They ſay that wee ought to bee circumciſed, and that other like precepts of the Law are to bee obſerved.</hi> I tranſlate it for the benefit of the common people. Of the <hi>Ebionites</hi> thus, <hi>They obſerve the carnall commandements of the Law, to wit, Circumciſion of the fleſh and the reſt, from whoſe burthens wee are freed by the new Teſtament.</hi> Of <hi>Appollinaris</hi> and his ſect this way, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> hath juſt nothing: but <hi>Danaeus</hi> who collects out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors alſo the hereticall opinions of the <hi>Apollinariſts</hi> in the laſt place writes thus of them: <hi>After the laſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Sabbaths, Circumciſion, Iewiſh diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of meates, and all other legall ceremonies ſhall have place, yea alſo there ſhall bee a Temple amongſt us.</hi> And is not this wilde ſtuffe, in reference to the ſanctification of the Lords day, now in queſtion amongſt us?</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Now let the Reader judge with what modeſty it is avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, That <hi>Hence it was that</hi> Irenaeus, Juſtin Martyr, Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,  <hi>and</hi> Euſebius, <hi>doe affirme for certaine, that never any of the Patriarches before</hi> Moſes <hi>Law did obſerve the Sabbath;</hi> D. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> ſaith not that <hi>Hence it was;</hi> neither hath this Author gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the leaſt evidence hereof. Sure I am, that in thoſe Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66015:17"/>
dayes Chriſt was not as yet come in the fleſh, but rather to come long after their dayes; and conſequently though it be a dangerous courſe in theſe dayes to lay any ground of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition that Chriſt is not already come, but as yet to come; yet this was of no dangerous condition at all in the dayes of the Patriarchs, becauſe in their dayes Chriſt was not come, but to come long after. D. <hi>Prideaux</hi> begins with <hi>Tertullian</hi> by this Author tranſlated thus, <hi>Let them</hi> (ſaith he in a particular Tract againſt the Jewes) <hi>aſſure me if they can, that</hi> Adam <hi>ever kept the Sabbath: or</hi> Abel <hi>when he offered unto God his accepted ſacrifice, had regard thereof; or that</hi> Noah <hi>kept the ſame, when he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in preparing the Arke againſt the Deluge; or finally that</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>in offering his ſonne</hi> Iſaak; <hi>or that</hi> Melchiſedech <hi>in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Prieſt-hood tooke notice of it.</hi> Now I appeale to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſober mans judgement, whether to put the Jewes in thoſe dayes to ſhew this, be to affirme for certaine, <hi>That never any of the Patriarches before</hi> Moſes <hi>Law did obſerve the Sabbath.</hi> It is true indeed, we have no particular relation of the obſervation of the Sabbath in that Booke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and this <hi>Tertullian</hi> knew full well; and againe it is as true that there is no teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ought to the contrary. In the Booke of <hi>Ioſuah</hi> in like ſort there is not any mention of the obſervation thereof (any more than in the Booke of <hi>Iudges,</hi> of <hi>Ruth,</hi> of the two Bookes of <hi>Samuel)</hi> but rather ſomething to the contrary, to wit, in the ſiege of <hi>Iericho,</hi> and marching round about the walls of <hi>Iericho</hi> ſeven dayes together. But yet in generall we reade in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that when God had finiſhed all his works in ſix dayes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the ſeventh, he <hi>therefore bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it;</hi> and whether this hath not greater evidence, that even then God ordered, that that day ſhould be ſanctified, than that the meaning ſhould be, that therefore God ordered this two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and certaine yeares after, I appeale to every Chriſtian to judge betweene us. And if God did then order it, which could not be otherwiſe than by command, how could <hi>Adam</hi> be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant hereof; and if he knew as much, how improbable is it, that he and his, at leaſt <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoſh,</hi> and his pious poſterity ſhould not obſerve it? And if a time had not been ſet apart even in <hi>Adams</hi> dayes for divine ſervice, how improbable is it, that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> ſhould concurre at the ſame time, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66015:18"/>
their offerings unto the Lord; and if not at the ſame time, how could <hi>Cain</hi> diſcern that <hi>Abels</hi> offering was reſpected and accepted of God, when his was not? Yet for certaine, it was obſerved before <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, if by the Law we underſtand the Law given on mount Sina, as appeares manifeſtly <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. And withall it is thereby evident, that from the beginning of the world untill that time, the diſtinction of the yeare into weekes was obſerved, otherwiſe it were impoſſible to know, which day was the ſeventh in correſpondencie to the ſeventh from the Creation, (ſave by particular revelation whereof we reade nothing) now that being unknowne, the reaſon of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the ſeventh day by an holy reſt, drawne from Gods reſt on the ſeventh, that is, the laſt day of the firſt weeke from the Creation had been utterly void, and nothing at all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And this diſtinction of time into weekes was obſerved from all Antiquity by the Gentiles, as hath been confirmed by <hi>Wallaeus</hi> and <hi>Rivetus,</hi> with the helpe of <hi>Claudius Salmaſius,</hi> that learned Antiquary; and likewiſe that the ſeventh day was a Feſtivall even among the Gentiles. And albeit divers others of the Ancients are alleaged to the ſame purpoſe, as affirming that the Patriarches did not obſerve the Sabbath, as namely <hi>Euſebius,</hi> ſaying, <hi>They had no Circumciſion of the body, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Sabbath, as we have not.</hi> And <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> in <note place="margin">Eccleſ.

Now <hi>Hospinian</hi> is of opinion that theſe paſſages of the Ancients are to be underſtood of the rigorous obſervation of the Sabbath among the Jewes; I adde, or in reference to the other Sabbaths commanded in the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> or laſtly in reference to the manner of ſolemnizing them among the Jewes, who we know had a peculiar Sacrifice ordained for the Sabbaths; and this I prove by theſe reaſons. Firſt, they deliver this as a thing well knowne; for they take
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66015:18"/>
no paines to prove it. Now conſider, what ground could they have for the cuſtome of the Patriarchs before the Flood, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that the teſtimony of <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 2. 3. is far better evidence for the keeping of a weekly Sabbath, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall way only, than any they could bring to the contrary. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, then againe, could they have better grounds for the practiſe of thoſe ancient Patriarchs both before, and after the Floud than the Jewes themſelves? I preſume none will be ſo immodeſt as to affirme this; and if they had any ſuch evidence, it ſtood them upon to produce it, eſpecially in dealing againſt the Jewes. Thirdly, they deliver this as a thing undeniable by the Jewes themſelves, with whom they deale in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: but the Jewes had no ſuch faith, as to beleeve that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Patriarchs never obſerved the weekly Sabbath. For none are of this opinion but ſuch as thinke that paſſage <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. of Gods bleſſing the ſeventh day and hallowing it, was not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of that preſent time, as if then God ordained it ſhould be ſanctified, but only by way of anticipation for the time to come. But this was not the opinion of the Jewes, <hi>Manaſſeth Ben Iſrael</hi> a moderne Rabbin, in his booke intituled <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler, Conciliator,</hi> according to the argument of that his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which is to reconcile places of Scripture, in ſhew diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing; and that upon enquiry into all the Rabbins both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and later; in his 36. Queſtion upon <hi>Exodus,</hi> writes thus, as out of the opinion of the Ancients; thoſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt remember that thou waſt a ſervant in Egypt,</hi> obſerve how he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds them; <hi>Ac ſi diceret, cogita in Aegypto, ubi ſerviebas, eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ipſo Sabbato per vim te coactum ad labores; as if he ſhould ſay, thinke (with thy ſelfe) that in Egypt where thou ſervedſt, thou waſt by force conſtrained to labour, on the very Sabbath:</hi> Evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſting not out of his owne particular opinion, but as out of the generall opinion of their ancient Rabbins, that the Sabbath and the obſervation thereof was a duty in the very dayes of the Patriarchs. And in the end concludes thus: <hi>Igitur Deus benedictus cupiens Sabbatum, cujus ſanctimoniam tantis document is approbaverat, in aeternum ab omnibus coli, decem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptis illud inſeruit, quo ſcientes praecepta aterna eſſe, etiam hoc in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ea habendum intelligerent.

of Chriſtians, in celebrating the Lords day; his words are theſe; <hi>Quia enim mori ſe &amp; reſurgere ſimulat, haberi in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratione vult diem Dominicum;</hi> that is, <hi>Becauſe he counterfeits himſelfe to die and riſe againe, therefore he will have the Lords day to be had in veneration.</hi> Where by the way obſerve two things; 1. The practiſe of Chriſtians in <hi>Gregories</hi> dayes, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all worke on the Lords day. 2. That Antichriſt would imitate Chriſt, as in pretending to dye and riſe againe: ſo in commanding the Lords day to be kept holy. A ſhrewd evidence that both <hi>Gregory,</hi> and the whole Church in thoſe dayes, were of opinion that the Lords day was of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; which Antichriſt perceiving would conforme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the better to promote his owne counſailes. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he would command the Jewes Sabbath to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved alſo, was <hi>Quia populum Judaiz are compellet, ut exteriorem ritum revocet, &amp; ſibi Iudaeorum perfidiam ſubdat;</hi> therefore <hi>coli vult Sabbatum.

And marke it well, <hi>that none ought to be waſhed</hi> lavari, <hi>on the Lords day;</hi> which this Author tranſlates thus, <hi>No nor ſo much as waſh upon the Sunday.</hi> What not ſo much as waſh their hands or their face? here indeed were ſtrange ſuperſtition. I willingly profeſſe I was not a little moved at this his Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing anſwerable to <hi>Gregories</hi> reſolution, which is this; <hi>If any deſire to be waſhed pro luxuria &amp; pro voluptate,</hi> that is, <hi>out of a luxurious dispoſition and for pleaſure; we doe not permit this to be done on any day. But if the bodies neceſſity require it, we doe not forbid this on the Lords day.</hi> Now I doe not find that any man uſeth to waſh hands or face out of any luxurious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither doe I know in what ſenſe the neceſſity of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can require it. For the neceſſity of the body in this place,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66015:22"/>
ſeems to me to be ſpoken in reference to the recovery of a mans health, requiring no time to be neglected. Hereupon I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſwaded, that by <hi>Lavari</hi> in <hi>Gregory,</hi> is to be underſtood a mans going into the Bath; which may be done out of a luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſpoſition, and meerely for pleaſure. Then againe, the neceſſity of the body may require it, and according to theſe different caſes it is by <hi>Gregory</hi> both permitted on the Lords day, to wit, in caſe of neceſſity, and denyed on any day, in caſe it be done only to ſatisfie a mans luſts: And I find a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Latine phraſe, betweene <hi>Lavare to waſh,</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vari to be waſhed,</hi> and that out of <hi>Varro</hi> his eight booke of the Latine tongue. For the active is of uſe, when a part only is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, as it is rightly ſaid, I waſh my hands and my feet. But the paſſive is in uſe only when the whole body is waſhed, as in the Bath. <hi>Quare &amp; in Balneis non rectè dicunt lavi, ſed lavor.

                  <p>It ſeemes this Author is not of their opinion, who thinke thoſe times wherein <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> lived, about the yeare 1126. to have been darker times than the dayes of <hi>Gregory;</hi> though ſome paſſe ſuch cenſure on thoſe times, accompting them times of darkneſſe, hee is more wiſe than to concurre in opinion with them; and it is a part of his wiſedome (as it ſeemes) to affect, that the world ſhould take notice of ſo much, namely, that he puts it upon ſome only to cenſure thoſe times, as times of darkneſſe Now who are thoſe ſome? not Papiſts I preſume, but Proteſtants rather; and what true Proteſtant can he name that thinkes otherwiſe? we have cauſe to feare that too many for their advantage, can be content to veile themſelves under the vizard of Proteſtants, when in heart they are Papiſts nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it poſſible, (I ſhould thinke) that any other but ſuch, ſhould thinke any better of thoſe times, than as of times of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66015:23"/>
darkneſſe. It is very likely, this Author is not of opinion, that the man of ſinne is yet revealed, or any ſuch time the Apoſtle prophecyeth of 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. of giving men over to illuſions to beleeve lyes, for not receiving the love of the truth. I much doubt whether he beleeves that Rome is the whore of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, whereof Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. though he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of that whore of Babylon, that it is that City, which in his dayes did rule over the Kings of the earth: yet in that which he accounts light, he can be content to concurre with <hi>Calvin,</hi> in denying the morality of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as touching one day in ſeven to be ſanctified unto the Lord. But whatſoever this <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> was, whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to have drawne too deepe on the lees of Judaiſme, hee avoucheth no teſtimony hereof, but only D. <hi>Prideaux</hi> his joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Petrobruſians</hi> with the Ebionites, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Now <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> profeſſeth that which is directly contrary, of the Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruſians; as whom he joynes with the Anabaptiſts, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Feſtos dies omnes ad ceremonias Iudaeorum pertinere, &amp; prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea nullos eſſe debere apud Chriſtianos, quum ceremoniae veteris Teſtamenti omnes Chriſti adventu ſint impletae, &amp; ideo ſublatae. Quorum etiam ſententiae Anabaptiſtae hodie ſuffragari videntur. That all Holidayes belong to the ceremonies of the Iewes, and that therefore none ſuch are to be obſerved by Chriſtians, ſeeing all the ceremonies of the old Teſtament are fulfilled, and abrogated by the comming of Chriſt. And the Anabaptiſts now adayes ſeeme to be of the ſame opinion.</hi> In the third Tome of the Councels ſet forth by <hi>Binius,</hi> and 2. part, there is an enumeration of his opinions in five particulars, and that, as it ſeemes by the cloſe, out of <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis;</hi> not one of them is any thing a kin to thoſe Sabbatarian fancies, which this Prefacer inſiſts upon. <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis,</hi> as it ſeemes, was the man that moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this <hi>Petrus de Bruis.</hi> Againſt his errors he wrote a book in forme of an Epiſtle on theſe points. 1. <hi>Of the Baptiſme of children.</hi> 2. <hi>Of the authority of the booke of the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi> 3. <hi>Of the authority of the Epiſtles of Saint</hi> Paul. 4. <hi>Of the authority of the Church.</hi> 5. <hi>Of the authority of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 6. <hi>Againe, of the baptiſme of children.</hi> 7. <hi>Of Temples, Churches, and Altars.</hi> 8. <hi>Of the veneration of the holy Croſſe.</hi> 9. <hi>Of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, and of the truth of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:66015:24"/>
10. <hi>Of prayers for the deceaſed.</hi> 11. <hi>Of praiſing God by Hymnes and muſicall inſtruments.</hi> Thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> relates the heads of that diſcourſe of his; not any of which, for ought I perceive, ſavoureth of any ſuch Sabbatarian fancie, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor driveth it unto. At length I got into my hands <hi>Bibliothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Cluniacenſis,</hi> and therein the writing of <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis</hi> againſt the <hi>Petrobruſians.</hi> Upon all which, one <hi>Andreas Puer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetanus Turonenſis,</hi> hath written certaine notes, wherein upon theſe words in the Preface <hi>Contra haereſes Petri de Bruis,</hi> hee writes thus; <hi>Of this Peter of Bruis who gave name to the Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruſian heretiques, no mention is found, neither in the hiſtorians, who write the ſtory of thoſe times, nor with them, who then, or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, contrived the Indices of haereſies and hereſiarches. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus à Caſtro (as I thinke) was the firſt, who after this our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, remembred him, lib.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Baptiſma. haereſ.</hi> 5. <hi>and writes that he was a French man of the province of Narbon. Although</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Guido <hi>writes that Pope</hi> Calixtus <hi>the ſecond, in the yeare</hi> 1128. <hi>on the eight of the Ides of Iune held a Councell at Tolouſe with Cardinals, Archbiſhops, Biſhops and Abbats of the Province of Gothia, Gaſcony, Spaine, and hither Britany. In which Councell, amongst other things ordered there, all thoſe haeretiques were damned and driven out of the Church, who counterfeiting a ſhew of religion, did condemne the Sacrament of the Lords body and blood, the Baptiſme of children, and all Eccleſiaſticall Orders, and the bands of lawfull marriages. All which hereſies as invented by</hi> Peter Bruis, <hi>and propagated by</hi> Henry <hi>his ſucceſſour, our</hi> Peter <hi>in this Treatiſe of his doth purſue.</hi> So that this whole ſtory ſeemes very obſcure; and yet the two latter points mentioned by this <hi>Andreas,</hi> I doe not find to be any of the opinions laid to the charge of <hi>Peter Bruis</hi> by thoſe that were contemporary with him. For <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis</hi> reduceth all his hereſies (as hee calls them) but to theſe five heads. 1. <hi>He denyes that children before they come to the age of underſtanding can be ſaved by the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and that anothers faith can profit him, who cannot uſe his owne; becauſe by their opinion, not another mans faith but his owne with Baptiſme ſaveth him, the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, that whoſoever ſhall beleeve, and bee baptized, hee ſhall be ſaved; but whoſoever will not beleeve ſhall be damned.</hi> 2. <hi>That there ought not to be any fabricke of Temples or Churches, that</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:66015:24"/>
                     <hi>ſuch as are made, ought to be throwne downe; that holy places for prayers are not neceſſary for Chriſtians, becauſe as well in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne as in the Church, as well in the Market-place, as in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; before an Altar, or before a ſtable God doth heare being called upon, and heareth them who are worthy.</hi> 3. <hi>He commands holy croſſes to be broken in peeces and burned, becauſe the repreſentation of ſuch an inſtrument, whereupon Chriſt was ſo direfully tortured, and cruelly ſlaine, is not worthy of any veneration or ſupplication; but in revenge of Chriſts torments and death, to be diſgraced with all manner of ignominy, and to be hewen in peeces with ſwords, and burnt with fire.</hi> 4. <hi>He doth not only deny the truth of the Lords body and blood daily, and continually to be offered in the Church by the Sacrament; but determines it to be altogether nothing, and that it ought not to be offered unto God.</hi> 5. <hi>He mocks at the ſacrifices, prayers, almes, and other good workes, which the faithfull that are living performe for the faithfull that are departed, and maintaines that they are nothing profitable to one that is dead.</hi> Now in all this I find nothing at all that ſavoureth of any Jewiſh opinion concerning the obſervation of the Sabbath. And more than that; when I conſider the matter of theſe Articles for the moſt part, and the courſe of thoſe times to make worſe of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions (who ſpake or wrote againſt the ſuperſtitions of thoſe times) then there was juſt cauſe, I begin to ſuſpect that this <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <hi>Bruis</hi> might be an honeſt man, and more orthodox than they who procured his death. And is it not wonderous ſtrange, that none of the Hiſtorians of thoſe times ſhould make any mention of him? And that may be the reaſon, why we finde no mention at all made of him in the Booke of Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents. And <hi>Philip Mornay</hi> in his <hi>myſterium iniquitatis,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 309, 310.</note> makes an apologie for this <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> as being a pious man, and thereupon hated, and finally martyred by the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of any Sabbatarian ſpeculation (as this Prefacer calleth it) that <hi>Fulco</hi> the French Prieſt lighted on, this Author gives no evidence. For as for <hi>Roger Hoveden,</hi> I doe not finde, that he attributes any ſuch unto him. He writes much in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, as that <hi>The Lord magnified him in the ſight of Kings,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fol.</hi> 448. <hi>pag.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>and gave him power to give ſight to the blind, to cure the lame, the blind, and others of their diſeaſes. That Harlots and Uſurers,</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:66015:25"/>
                     <hi>were by his preaching taken off from their lewd courſes. That hee foretold the Kings of France and England, that except they gave over their hoſtility the ſooner, one of them ſhould ſhortly dye of an evill death.</hi> But of any Sabbatarian ſpeculation hee was addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto I finde no mention. It is true, King <hi>Richard</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time called him ſimply Hypocrite, not <hi>notable Hypocrite,</hi> as this Author expreſſeth it, affecting rather to ſpeake with a full mouth, than according unto plaine truth. And is it much if Kings take liberty to call men as they think good, eſpecially when they are provoked by them, as King <hi>Richard</hi> was by this Prieſt, as appeares by the ſtory which is well worth the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to obſerve both the preſent wit of that King, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Prieſts with Princes in telling them their faults in thoſe dayes of yore. For on a day that Prieſt <hi>Fulco</hi> came to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and in very bold manner ſpake to him thus: <hi>I tell thee O King as from Almighty God, that thou make ſpeed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow in marriage thoſe three wretched daughters, that thou haſt, leſt ſome worſe thing befall thee. Thou Hypocrite, quoth the King, thou lyeſt againſt thine owne head, for I have no daughter at all. Truly I doe not lye, quoth the Prieſt, for as I ſaid, thou haſt three wicked daughters, one of them is Pride, another Covetouſneſſe, the third Luxury.</hi> When the King heard this, he called his Earles and Barons that were about him, and ſaid, <hi>Heare the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this hypocrite, who ſaith I have three wicked daughters, and commands me to marry them. Therefore I beſtow my Pride upon the proud Templers; my Covetouſneſſe upon the Monkes of the Ciſtercian Order; and my Luxury upon the Prelates of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> Who though they profeſſed ſingle life, yet as Mr. <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> obſerves in a like caſe of popiſh Prieſts, did not profeſſe continencie, they might be luxurious enough, and that not only in wayes naturall, but in wayes unnaturall alſo. This was a biting anſwer of the King, which the Hiſtorian no way liked, and therefore he cryes out in a poeticall ſtraine, <hi>O nimis indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num miſeris inferre cachinnum.</hi> But throughout no mention at all of any Sabbatarian ſpeculation that <hi>Fulco</hi> was poſſeſſed with. Indeed of <hi>Eustachius,</hi> who was one of his followers, we reade afterwards, <hi>fol.</hi> 457. <hi>p.</hi> 2. what wonderous workes were wrought by him, and what were the effects of his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching among them, namely, that <hi>In London and divers other</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:66015:25"/>
                     <hi>places in England, they would no more preſume to make the Lords dayes their market dayes. And that in every Church there ſhould be a lampe, or ſome light burning continually before the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and that Citizens and others would have an Almes veſſell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their table, to lay aſide therein ſome proviſion for the poore.</hi> And that hereupon the Devill raiſed up againſt him ſome Miniſters of iniquity, <hi>who ſaid unto him, It is not lawfull for thee to put thy ſithe into anothers harveſt; to whom he anſwered, The harveſt is great, but the labourers are few. Therefore the foreſaid Abbat being thus rebuked by the miniſters of Satan, hee would no longer trouble the Prelats of England with his preaching, but returned unto his owne home in Normandy from whence hee came.</hi> Seven leaves after this, we find in the ſame Author, to wit, <hi>fol.</hi> 466. <hi>p.</hi> 2. That <hi>this Abbat of Flay returned into England, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Word of God from City to Citie, forbade all to make the Lords dayes their market dayes. For he ſaid that this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for obſervation of the Lords day came from heaven.</hi> So that this ſpeculation of his was dominicall rather than Sabbatari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. And the mandate concerning this, is there ſet downe at large, pretended to have come from Heaven to Jeruſalem, and to have been found on the Altar of Saint <hi>Simeon</hi> in <hi>Golgotha;</hi> which whether it were feigned by him, or by others, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by him on the faith of others, the Author ſpecifies not. But at the end thereof he ſhewes how that this Predicant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to York, was there honourably entertained by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and Clergie, and whole people of that Citie; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit theſe things, you will ſay, were acted in times of darkneſſe; yet this Prefacer ſeemes to be of another opinion, though lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleaſed with <hi>Euſtachius</hi> his Sabbatarian ſpeculation. Here alone is mention made of the bounds he ſet to the obſervation of the Lords day, namely, that it was to continue from Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day three of the clock in the afternoone, untill the Sun-riſing on Munday, in which time he would have them doe nothing but that which was good, and if they did, to amend their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors by repentance. A very reaſonable motion in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if he had extended it to all the dayes of the weeke, yea, and houres too, I ſee no cauſe why for this hee ſhould be cenſured either as an hypocrite, or heretique. But as for the ſtrictneſſe of obſervation here mentioned, as namely, That
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66015:26"/>
                     <hi>during the foreſaid time, it was not lawfull to doe any kind of work what ever, no not ſo much as to bake bread for the Sundayes eating; to waſh or dry linnen for the morrowes wearing.</hi> I finde no ſuch thing preſcribed by <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> in the relation made by <hi>Roger Hoveden;</hi> and if <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> hath any ſuch, ſurely hee tooke it not out of <hi>Roger Hoveden;</hi> from whom yet this Prefacer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes he tooke that which he writes hereof. Nay it is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradictory to the Tenet of <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> as who determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the obſervation of the Lords day to begin at three of the clock in the afternoone of the Eve preceding, in which time is found ſpace both to bake bread for the Sundayes eating, and to waſh or dry linnen for the morrowes wearing, if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinder not. And as for the extenſion of the dominicall obſervation thus farre, in reſpect of the bounds thereof; I find no other doctrine preached by <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> than by the Lawes of the Kings who governed this Land, was ordained long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, even before the conqueſt. For not only King <hi>Ina</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>That no man lay or ſpirituall, free or bond, ſhould labour on</hi>

                     <hi>the Sunday:</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the elder with <hi>Gythrum</hi> the Dane, made a law <hi>againſt all labour, buying and ſelling upon the Sabbath. Item, for no execution to be done on the Sunday:</hi> but amongſt King <hi>Edgars</hi> lawes, one was, <hi>That the Sunday ſhould be kept ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Saturday at noone, till Munday in the morning.</hi> King <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus</hi> alſo commanded <hi>celebration of the Sabbath from Saturday at noone, till Munday morning, forbidding markets, huntings, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and Court-keeping's during the ſaid ſpace.</hi> And it ſeemes to be the generall practiſe of Chriſtendome to allow (or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand rather) a preparation for the ſanctifying of the Lords day; as appeares by the obſervation of Evening prayers, the day before, warning whereunto is uſually given at three of the clocke, by the ringing of a bell, or as in ſome places eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the winter ſeaſon, an houre ſooner, and ſchollars accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly give up ſchoole, and preſent themſelves at Evening prayer.

                     <hi>which of the profane day is added as a little Sabbath.</hi> And as for the ſtrict abſtinence from dreſſing of meats on Saturday, which this Author imputes to <hi>Euſtachius</hi> as his doctrine, but without all ground that I know: we are ſo farre from any ſuch Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian ſpeculation, that none of us (in my knowledge) doe think it unlawful to dreſſe meats on the Lords day. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Prefacer addes that <hi>they had miracles in ſtore pretended to be wrought on ſuch as had not yeelded to their doctrine, thereby to countenance the ſuperſtitious and confound the weaks.</hi> What one of an hundred in reading this would not imagine, that <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> wrought theſe miracles for the countenancing of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrictneſſe: whereas yet on the contrary, neither doth it appeare, that he taught or obtruded upon them any ſuch ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, preaching onely againſt marketting on the Lords day. Neither were thoſe ſtrange accidents which here are called mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, any miracles wrought by him: But the Monke, <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Hoveden</hi> writes, That <hi>the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whom wee muſt obey rather than men; who by his Nativity, Reſurrection, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and ſending the Holy Ghoſt upon his Diſciples, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance this day, which we call the Lords day, and dedicated (as) moſt celebrious; ſhewed miracles of his power, upon ſome tranſgreſſors of the Lords day in this manner. On a certaine Saturday after three of clocke, a certaine Carpenter of Beverlac, as he was making a woodden peg, contrary to the wholeſome admonitions of his wife, fell to the ground, taken with a palſie.</hi> The like ſtory followeth of a woman, which this Author, according to the Monks phraſe, is content to call Miracles. Now when we heare of as ſtrange a thing as this to have fallen out not long ſince in Bedfordſhire; as namely, a match at Foot-ball, being appointed on the Lords day in the afternoone; while two were in the Belfrey, and one of them tolling a bell to call the company together, there was heard a clap of thunder and lightning, ſeene by ſome ſitting in the Church-porch, as it came thorow a darke lane towards the Church, and flaſht in their faces who ſate in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porch, and ſcared them; thence it went into the Church, and turning into the Belfery, tript up his heeles who was tolling the bell, and ſtruck him ſtarke dead; and the other with him blaſted in ſuch manner, that ſhortly after he dyed; we doe not call this a miracle, though we count it a remarkable judgement
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66015:27"/>
of God, and ſuch as deſerves to be conſidered, and ſeriouſly laid unto heart by all, to admoniſh them to take heed, that they be not found in like manner profaners of the Lords day. In like ſort when upon freſh relation we heare of the like ſport at Foot-ball on the Lords day, at a place called Tidworth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Evening prayer in the Church-yard, and that therein one had his legge broken, which thereupon gangrened, ſo that forthwith he died thereof; we doe not call this a miracle; only it calls to our mind that of the Prophet, <hi>The Lord hath ſo done his marvellous works, that they ought to be had in remembrance.</hi> And we find that ſuch like judgements have been obſerved by Chriſtian Emperours, thereupon moved more ſtrictly to give in charge the obſervation of the Lords day, as <hi>Ludovicus Pius</hi> by name, as thus, <hi>Didicimus quoſdam in hoc die opera ruralia ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes fulmine interemptos, quoſdam artuum contractione multa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, quoſdam viſibili igne abſumptos, ſubito in cinere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſolutos, poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliter occubuiſſe. Proinde neceſſe eſt, ut primum Sacerdotes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; Principes, cunctique fideles huic diei debitam obſervatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem atque reverentiam devotiſſimè exhibeant; We have knowne ſome buſied in workes of husbandry on this day, to have beene ſlaine with lightning, ſome puniſhed with the contraction of their limbes, ſome with viſible fire conſumed, on a ſudden turned into aſhes, and ſo to have periſhed, as by way of puniſhment. Wherefore it is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty that in the firſt place Prieſts, then Kings, Princes, and all faithfull perſons, moſt devoutly exhibite due obſervation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence unto this day.</hi> The other miracles mentioned by the Monke are of another nature; as of a cake bak't on the hearth on Saturday after three a clocke in the afternoone, and how that part of it reſerved to the morning, and being then broken, blood came out of it, and another of the like nature; and two more. I ſay, theſe are of <hi>Roger Hovedens</hi> relation, not of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtachius</hi> his preaching; whom the Monke relates to have been in great eſteeme of the Clergie in thoſe dayes, and to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed much with many of the people, though for the generall he could not bring them off from their marketing on the Lords day. Yet what are theſe to be talkt of in compariſon to thoſe which are compriſed in two bookes of miracles, written by <hi>Cluniacenſis?</hi> and albeit thoſe times may be accounted times of darkneſſe, in compariſon of ages fore-going, yet this Prefacer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66015:27"/>
is ready to make anſwer, that that is but the opinion of ſome. But whereas hee ſaith, That <hi>this ſtrange opinion is now revived and publiſhed;</hi> firſt I deſire to know his meaning. For as for a preparation to the Sabbath, and that to begin from about three a clock in the afternoone, the whole Kingdome obſerves it; as for the ſtrict obſervation thereof, here mentioned, I have ſhewed that <hi>Euſtachius</hi> ſpeakes of no ſuch thing. If hee did, what is that to thoſe who ſuffer for ſtanding for the ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Sabbath, againſt thoſe who would have the Lords day, at leaſt in part to be a day of ſports and paſtimes? Can he ſhew this to be their opinion? If he can, why doth he not? And if from three a clock on Saturday in the afternoone, people doe prepare for the Lords day, and abſtaine from ſuch workes, diſpatching both their baking bread, and other works in the morning, what danger or detriment is hereby likely to ariſe either to our faith or manners? What danger either to Prince, Church, or State?</p>

                  <p>BUt to proceed. Immediately upon the Reformation of  Religion in theſe Weſterne parts, the Controverſie brake out a freſh; though in another manner than before it did. For there were ſome, of whom <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeakes, who would have <note place="margin">

Affirming it to croſſe the doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who in the text before remembred, and in the fourteenth to the <hi>Romans</hi> did ſeeme to them to cry downe all ſuch difference of dayes and times as the Church retained. To meet which vaine and peccant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, <hi>Calvin</hi> was faine to bend his forces, declaring how the Church might lawfully retaine ſet times for Gods ſervice, without infringing any of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> commandements.</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, as commonly the exceſſe is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant than the defect; there wanted not ſome others, who thought they could not honour the Lords day ſufficiently, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they did affix as great a ſanctitie unto it, as the Jewes did
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66015:28"/>
unto their Sabbath. So that the change ſeemed to be onely of the day; the ſuperſtition ſtill remaining no leſſe Jewiſh than before it was. Theſe taught, as now ſome doe, <hi>moralem eſſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us diei obſervationem in hebdomada,</hi> the keeping holy to the <note place="margin">

As for himſelfe, ſo farre was he from favouring any ſuch wayward fancie, that as <hi>Iohn Barklay</hi> makes report, he had a conſultation once, <hi>de tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenda ſolennitate Dominica in feriam quintam,</hi> to alter the Lords day from Sunday to Thurſday. How true this is, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay. But ſure it is that <hi>Calvin</hi> tooke the Lords day to be an eccleſiaſticall and humane conſtitution only, <hi>Quem veteres in locum Sabbati ſubrogarunt,</hi> appointed by our Anceſtors to ſupply the place of the Jewiſh Sabbath, and (as our Doctor tells us from him in his ſeventh ſection,) as alterable by the Church at this preſent time, as firſt it was, when from Saturday they tranſlated it unto the Sunday. So that we ſee, that <hi>Calvin</hi> here reſolves upon three Concluſions. Firſt, that the keeping holy one day in ſeven, is not the morall part of the fourth Commandement. Secondly, that the day was changed from the laſt day of the weeke unto the firſt by this authority of the Church, and not by any divine Ordinance: And thirdly, that the day is yet alterable by the Church, as at firſt it was.</p>

                  <p>Thus at length this Prefacer obſerves, that look upon what Scripture paſſages ſome did contend the Jewiſh Sabbath to be ceremoniall, and accordingly to be abrogated by the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt: Upon the very ſame grounds o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers contended againſt the obſervation of all Holy dayes, even of the Lords day alſo, as if that were Jewiſh. This is the courſe of the Anabaptiſts, unto whom <hi>Wallaeus</hi> addes the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians; and <hi>Hospinian</hi> the Petrobruſians.

And <hi>Cyrill</hi> long agoe upon conſideration of our Saviours apparitions on that day, and then againe the eighth day after, makes bold to conclude, that <hi>Iure igitur ſanctae congregationes die octavo in Eccleſiis fiunt, By right</hi>

                  <p n="2">2 Obſerve by the way this authors ſpirit, he accompts it more exorbitant to thinke, that the obſervation of the Lords Day is preſcribed unto us by Divine authority, or the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious obſervation of one day in ſeven, then to maintaine that none at all is to be ſet apart to religious worſhip by Divine authority. And to this purpoſe he premiſeth a generall rule, <hi>that commonly the exceſſe is more exorbitant then the defect;</hi> yet I never heard, that prodigality was cenſured as worſe then covetouſneſſe, in oppoſition to liberality; or raſhneſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted worſe then cowardlineſſe, in oppoſition to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: or ſuperſtition worſe then prophaneneſſe, in oppoſition to true Religion. As for <hi>the ſanctity of the day</hi> in <hi>Calvins</hi> phraſe, which this Author calls <hi>Sanctity affixed to the day;</hi> ſhall I ſay this Prefacer underſtands it not? it is incredible; more likely he is to pervert <hi>Calvins</hi> plaine meaning; not out of exceſſe in the way of ſuperſtition, but out of a leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant defect. For <hi>the ſanctity of the day,</hi> in <hi>Calvins</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is, when <hi>Religione quadam feriando, myſteria olim com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendata</hi>

                     <hi>recolere ſe ſomniabant, by reſting in a religious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they thought as it were dreaming, that they obſerved certaine myſteries of old recommended unto them.</hi> As appeares in his ſect. 33. Of the 8. Chap. Of his ſecond booke of inſtitutions; and ſuch indeed was the ſanctity of the day in the Jewiſh obſervation thereof. This religion, this holineſſe <hi>Calvin</hi> will have to be at an end; and that the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. and <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. diſputed againſt them who would have that holineſſe, that religion to continue ſtill: not againſt them, who will have one day in the weeke ſet apart, thereon to reſt from manuall workes, <hi>as they are avocations from holy ſtudies and meditations.</hi> And in the former caſe, he doth not ſay, as this author in a mincing manner feynes him to ſay, to wit, that <hi>So the change ſeemed to be only of the day;</hi> but in plaine termes, that <hi>this were no other then to change the day, and that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely of the Iewes; ſiquidem manet nobis etiamnum par myſterii in diebus ſignificatio, quae apud Iudaeos locum habebat, if ſo be there yet remaines with us a myſterious ſignification equally in the daies, ſuch as had place amongſt the Iewes.</hi> Now this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nothing concernes any of our proteſtant Divines, who mainteine the obſervation of one day in ſeven as neceſſary, in reſting from manuall workes, onely as they are impediments to the ſervice of God. Nay that one day in ſeven was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Jewes for any myſterious ſignification conteyned therein, or by the Patriarchs either, or by <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe, in whoſe dayes even from the firſt, the ſeventh day was ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, ſet apart for the ſervice of God, in the opinion of <hi>Calvin,</hi> to this day, I never heard or read. This latter clauſe <note place="margin">This is to bee underſtood of one day in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven indefinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For as for the reſt of the ſeventh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely that is acknowledged to have beene myſterious.</note> in <hi>Calvin,</hi> which containes the condition, whereupon this cenſure of his paſſeth upon thoſe that ſo ſtand for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of one day in ſeven, this Prefacer ſlily concealeth; though <hi>Calvins</hi> cenſure be not paſſed abſolutely, but merely upon this condition. Thus indeed to ſtand for the neceſſary obſervation of one day in ſeven, namely, as conteyning ſome myſterious ſignification, were <hi>to exceede the Iewes in a groſſe and carnall ſuperſtition of a Sabbatiſme.</hi> As touching the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſome time ſet a part for Gods holy worſhip, and ſervice, <hi>Calvin</hi> profeſſeth <hi>that the ſame neceſſity lieth upon us Chriſtians, for reliefe whereof the Lord appointed the Sabbath</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 32.</note>

                     <hi>to the Iewes, and that it pleaſed our moſt provident and tender Father to provide for our neceſſity, no leſſe then for the neceſſity of the Iewes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is apparent that God commanded the Jewes to ſet one day in ſeven apart for the ſervice of God, and doth it not manifeſtly follow herehence, that the Lord would have us alſo ſet apart one day of the weeke for his ſervice? And <hi>Calvin</hi> concludes that Section thus, <hi>Why then doe we not obey that reaſon, which we ſee to be impoſed upon us by the will of God?</hi> And therefore <hi>Wallaeus</hi> ſaith that <hi>Calvin delivered not theſe words,</hi> whereupon this Prefacer grateth ſo much, <hi>againſt his own Colleagues</hi> or fellowes in the reformation, <hi rend="margQuotes">with whom he never contended in this argument, but againſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Papiſts &amp; ſchoolemen, who thought, they had provided ſufficiently for themſelves, for Chriſtian liberty, and for the edification of the Church; by teaching that the taxation of the ſeventh day as ceremoniall was aboliſhed, &amp; yet that one day in ſeven, and by name the Lords Day, was to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, after ſuch a manner, and to ſuch an end, as the Jewes obſerved their Sabbath: by which Doctrine, way was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to ſuperſtition in this dayes obſervation. His words are plainely directed againſt ſuch when he ſaith; <hi>Thus vaniſh the toyes of falſe Prophets, who poſſeſſed the people in former times with a Iewiſh opinion.</hi>
                     </hi> And againe, <hi>But that is no other thing then in contempt of the Jewes to change the day, and in mind to retaine the ſame ſanctity of the day: if ſo be there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines unto us,</hi> (to wit by their opinion) <hi>an equall myſterious ſignification of dayes, to that which had place among the Jewes.</hi> Now ſaith <hi>Wallaeus, This agrees not to be ſpoken of any of the reformed, but of Sophiſters and Papiſts, who urge new my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and new ſignifications, and holineſſes in their holy daies, as it is well known. Bellarmine lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>of the veneration of Saints writes againſt our Divines, that the feaſts of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are kept, not only in reſpect of order and policy, but alſo by reaſon of a myſtery; and that holydays are truly more holy and ſacred then other dayes, and a certaine part of Divine worſhip.</hi> This Prefacer is content to make uſe of <hi>Iohn Barclayes</hi> report concerning <hi>Calvin,</hi> namely <hi>that he had a conſultation once de tranſferenda ſolennitate dominica in feriam quintam; of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:66015:30"/>
                     <hi>the dominicall ſolemnity unto the Thurſday.</hi> Had it beene unto Friday, which is the <hi>Turkes</hi> feſtivall, then it would have wondrouſly well ſerved <hi>Raynolds</hi> his turne in his <hi>Calvino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turciſmus.</hi> For it concerned that author to inquire diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all <hi>Calvins</hi> courſes, that ſtood any way in conformity with the courſes of the <hi>Turkes:</hi> neither doe I thinke there could be deviſed any more remarkable then this. <hi>How true this is</hi> this Prefacer <hi>cannot ſay,</hi> but whether he doth not licke his lips at it I know not. But it is apparent, he would have the Church endued with ſuch authority, as to change the ſolemnity of the Lords Day, to any day in the weeke, and conſequently even to Friday; and I doe not doubt but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reaſon might be deviſed for it by politique heads, as namely, to hold the <hi>Turkes</hi> in better correſpondency unto Chriſtianity. Now if <hi>Calvin</hi> had at any time a conſultation hereabouts (which cannot be underſtood of <hi>Calvins</hi> ſingle and proper conſultation with himſelfe; for then how could the relator be privy to it without revelation; and we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, that three may keepe counſaile when two be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) ſurely there were many that could give teſtimony hereof, to wit as many, as whoſe heads he uſed in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation. And who would not expect, that ſome one of theſe at leaſt, ſhould be produced to teſtifie ſo much either by word or writing? As for <hi>Barcley,</hi> he hath his name <hi>ab urſae ungula, from the claw of a Beare;</hi> give we him leave to bee a biter, a tearer. His father was a man of ſome note and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and one that had the opinion to deſerve well of Kings by his booke <hi>Contrá monarch machos;</hi> and thereby he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe to King <hi>Iames,</hi> being alſo a Scotchman. But King <hi>Iames</hi> might thinke better of him then there was cauſe, all things conſidered. For he maintaines, that in two caſes Kings may ceaſe to be Kings, and to this acknowledgement he finds himſelfe maſtered in part by a rule of the civill Law, (and he was a Civilian) which is this, <hi>Servus habitus pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derelicto may chooſe a new Father.</hi> At the firſt reading I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the Doctrine it ſelfe, being of an harſh accent, and dangerous conſequence; and much more in conſideration of the reaſon given, which by interpretation and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation may draw a very long tayle after it. And it may ſeeme
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66015:30"/>
ſtrange, that none have taken any paynes either to refute it, or cleere it, I meane in publique. Yet I ſpeake it onely in reference to the compaſſe of mine owne reading. In private it may be ſome have dealt upon it, and my ſelfe in particular, when I dealt in my Sermons upon the thirteenth to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> I have been often urged to ſet forth thoſe Meditations of mine and to make them publike; but I have alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the motion, they being but homely Sermons, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to a Countrey auditory, neither doe I finde my ſelfe that way fitted for a better audience; I can take ſome paynes in writing controverſies, but I cannot take paynes in making a Sermon, and when I have taken moſt, I finde I have leſſe edified my people, though perhaps better pleaſed my ſelfe. Yet having not long ſince underſtood of a Court di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Puritans; namely that ſome of them are good men, onely they cannot conforme to the ceremonies of the Church; but other there are, who though they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, yet are antimonarchicall Puritans: This conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath taken a deepe impreſſion in me, and brought me to debate with my ſelfe, whether it were not fit to publiſh thoſe poore Meditations of mine, if for nothing elſe, yet to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate our reputation, who at the pleaſures of too many are oppreſſed in the World; and to repreſent to publique view, <hi>Our Countrey faith concerning Monarchies.</hi> For if we be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted antimonarchicall, no mervaile if ſome courſe be taken ſooner or later to roote us out. And this I might make a Prodromus to a greater worke, in anſwer to a booke entitled <hi>Deus &amp; Rex,</hi> a peſtilent piece of worke, and as it is thought written by one barefoote a Jeſuite, conteyning a refutation of a certaine book of one of our divines inſcribed <hi>God and the King</hi> written by Doctor <hi>Mockeſt,</hi> a booke ſo well pleaſing to King <hi>James,</hi> that as we have heard, his Majeſty thought fit that children ſhould be catechized in it. This being afterwards tranſlated into Latine by Doctor <hi>Harris,</hi> now Warden of the Colledge by Wincheſter, hath beene now many yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, anſwered by a Papiſt who conceales his name, and that in a very unhappy manner. And a wonder of wonders it may ſeeme, that ſo vile a piece hath paſſed ſo long unanſwered; eſpecially conſidering that heretofore great Biſhops chaplens
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:66015:31"/>
were wont to bee imployed in anſwering Papiſts, and this was the ordinary way of their preferment. I confeſſe there are certaine myſteries therein, which perhaps are as ſcarre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowes to deterre men from taking Pen in hand to refute it. For the author of this, would beare the World in hand, that hee who wrote the booke intituled God and the King, and was a Puritan; and that none but Puritans doe ſtand for the abſoluteneſſe of Kings in ſuch ſort as it is there maintained. And that it is merely a plot to ruinate monarches, by advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their abſoluteneſſe ſo high; dealing with them herein, as <hi>Hercules</hi> did with <hi>Antaeus;</hi> for obſerving that as often as he threw him to the ground, he roſe up with greater ſtrength, for the earth being his mother, as often as he fell into her boſome ſhe inſpired new vigour and ſpirit into him; therefore he would throw him down no more, but lifting him up from the Earth into the Aire, there hee held him betweene his armes, untill he had cruſht his breath out of his body, and ſo made an end of him. In like ſort, it is there ſaid, that Puritans finde it their onely meanes to ruine monarches, by advancing their abſolutneſſe in ſo unreaſonable a manner: that when the people ſhall underſtand it aright, they will bee ſo provoked hereby, that they will ſtreyne the uttermoſt of their power to roote out all Monarchies. Nevertheleſſe all this is but a ſquib, making a great noyſe but doing no hurt; yet ſufficient to ſcare any man in theſe times, conſidering how <hi>Funeſtous</hi> a condition it is, to come under the ſhadow of the very name of Puritan. And the Papiſts, and all that are popiſhly affected rejoyce in this, as in nothing more. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth <hi>Hoc Ithacus velit &amp; magno mercentur Atreidae.</hi> But ſee my unfortunate condition; after I had reſolved to make it my next worke to labour in this argument: and after I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched my firſt worke of pleading for the ſupreame abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God in Heaven; in the next place to try my ſtrength what I could ſay for the ſecondary abſoluteneſſe of Kings and Monarches here on Earth; I am ſodenly driven to intermit all other buſineſſes formerly in hand, and to travaile in a new argument, and to ſtrengthen my ſelfe againſt the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and thunders, that may breake over our heads we know not how ſoone; for wee ſee examples before our eyes of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66015:31"/>
in this kind, and how ſoone our owne turne may come to ſuffer in the ſame kinde it is uncertaine unto us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to returne to <hi>Iohn Barcley:</hi> wee have heard that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before his death commended him to the Patronage of King <hi>Iames,</hi> who accordingly had him attending in his Court ſomewhile with intent to preſerre him: untill on a ſodaine his minde was changed, having receaved intelligence, that this Gentleman playd falſe with him, living in his Court but as an eſpie and intelligencer, to diſcover what he could of his Majeſties affayres unto Queene mother of <hi>France;</hi> which mooved King <hi>Iames</hi> ever after, and that moſt juſtly, to abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him. Now ſuch a one, if he could not proove true and loyall unto his naturall Prince, can it bee expected, hee being of a popiſh ſpirit, ſhould carry himſelfe truely and honeſtly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Iohn Calvin? But ſure it is</hi> (in this Prefacers judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>that Calvin tooke the Lords Day to be an Eccleſiaſticall and humane conſtitution, only appointed by our Anceſtors to ſupply the place of the Iewiſh Sabbath, and as our Doctor tells us alterable by the Church at this preſent time as firſt it was, when from the Saturday they tranſlated it unto the Sunday.</hi> For proofe here of this Prefacer alleageth nothing but that out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Veteres ſubrogarunt diem dominicum in locum Sabbati; The Ancients ſubrogated the Lords Day in place of the Sabbath:</hi> But he takes no notice of that which immediately followes in <hi>Calvin;</hi> as a reaſon of the former thus; <hi>For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Lords Reſurrection is found the end, and accompliſhment of the true reſt, which the ancient Sabbath ſhaddowed, by the very day which ſet an end to ſhadowes, Chriſtians are admoniſhed not to ſtick unto the ſhadowing ceremonie.</hi> Where obſerve, Firſt, as touching the perſons noted by <hi>Veteres</hi> the <hi>Ancients,</hi> firſt; and then by <hi>Chriſtiani Chriſtians.</hi> Are not theſe the Apoſtles as much as any other? and they in the firſt place, as wee beſt knew what that was, which did ſet an end to ſhadowes; and accordingly to give notice of the pregnant ſignification of the Day of the Lords Reſurrection? and therefore, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. Hee doth intirely referre this to the Apoſtles, as whom he confeſſeth, <hi>conſtrayned by the Iewiſh ſuperſtition to have abrogated the Sabbath, and in the place thereof ordeyned the Lords Day.</hi> Secondly obſerve that the accompliſhment of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66015:32"/>
that which was ſignified by the Jewiſh Sabbath he aſcribes to the Reſurrection. And Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> Biſhop of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in his ſpeech delivered in the Starre Chamber in the caſe of <hi>Traske</hi> profeſſeth that, <hi>It hath ever beene the Churches doctrine that Chriſt made an end of all Sabbaths, by his Sabbath in the grave. That Sabbath (ſaith he) was the laſt of them.</hi> And that Chriſts Reſurrection brought with it a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a new Creation requires a new Sabbath. And hee alleageth <hi>Auſtin</hi> Ep. 119. ſaying, <hi>The Lords Day was declared to Chriſtians by Chriſt his Reſurrection, and from thence began to have its feſtivity.</hi> But that at this time <hi>Calvin</hi> ſhould thinke it alterable by the Church, no colour of proofe is brought; and moſt unreaſonable it is, for any to conceave the Sabbath to be as alterable now, as in the Apoſtles dayes it was, when from the Saturday they tranſlated it unto the Sunday.

So that unleſſe this Prefacer can deviſe a third Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and maintaine withall the reſt on the Lords Day to bee as ceremoniall, as the Jewes reſt on the ſeventh Day was, there is no colour, why the Chriſtian Sabbath on the Lords Day, ſhould bee as alterable now, as the day of the Jewiſh Sabbath was. As for the 3. concluſions which hee ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi> reſolves upon; the firſt whereof hee ſaith to be this, <hi>that one day in ſeven is not the morall part of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi> I ſay, <hi>Calvin</hi> avoucheth no ſuch thing; and <hi>Wallaeus</hi> ſhewes, that generally the friends of <hi>Calvin</hi> maintained the contrary; between whom nevertheleſſe and <hi>Calvin</hi> it was never known that there was any contention her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. And already I have ſhewed how unſhamefaſtly this Prefacer abuſeth <hi>Calvin</hi> in alledging one halfe of his ſentence, and leaving the other part quite out, ſo making <hi>Calvin</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver that abſolutely, which he affirmes onely conditionally. The ſecond reſolution which he obtrudes upon <hi>Calvin,</hi> is, that <hi>the day was changed from the laſt day of the weeke to the firſt, by the authority of the Church, and not by any divine ordinance.</hi> It is true, <hi>Calvin</hi> ſayth not, that the day was changed by divine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66015:32"/>
ordinance, neither doth he ſay that it was changed by the authority of the Church; but in plaine termes profeſſeth that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Comment in</hi> 1. <hi>ep. ad cor. cap.</hi> 16.</note> the Apoſtles changed it in one place; and that admonition was given for the change of it, by the conſideration of the Day of Chriſts Reſurrection in another, to wit <hi>Inſtitut. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. Sect. 36. Now let every ſober conſcience conſider, whether that day which was firſt ordained by authority Divine, the apoſtles would alter by leſſe authority, then authority Divine; eſpecially conſidering that Chriſts redemption of the World, is the reſtauration of the World; which is as a new Creation; and as the Lord reſted the ſeventh day from the workes of Creation; ſo the day of Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, was the day of his reſt from the worke of redemption; ſo that ſtill the day of the Lords reſt is the day of our reſt; not indeed the day of the Lord our Creators reſt, that ceaſing as being ceremoniall, as before hath beene ſhewed out of Doctor <hi>Andrewes;</hi> but the day of the Lord our Redeemers reſt, which brought with it a new Creation, is now the day of our reſt. And who was nearer or dearer unto <hi>Calvin</hi> then <hi>Beza?</hi> whoſe words upon <hi>Revel.</hi> 1, 10. are to this effect, <hi>He calls that the Lords Day, which Paul calls the firſt of the Sabbaths</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>&amp; Acts</hi> 20. 7. <hi>on which day it appeares that even then were made the more frequent aſſemblies by Chriſtians, like as the Iewes came together in their Synagogues on the Sabbath Day; wherby it may appeare that the fourth precept of ſanctifying the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, as touching the day of the Sabbath and legall rites, was ceremoniall; but as touching the worſhip of God, is of the morall Law, unalterable, and perpetually to continue in this life. And that day of the Sabbath continued in force from the creation of the World, to the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, which being as it were another Creation of another ſpirituall World (as the Prophets ſpeake) then for the Sabbath of the former world or ſeventh day, was aſſumed the firſt day of this new World; the holy Ghoſt without doubt dictating thus much to the Apoſtles.</hi> As for the third &amp; laſt reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he pins upon <hi>Calvins</hi> ſleeve, namely <hi>that the day of reſt to be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to the Lord, is yet alterable by the church as at firſt it was;</hi> neither that firſt alteration is by <hi>Calvin</hi> ſayd to be made by the <hi>church,</hi> but expreſſely by the apoſtles; &amp; they admoniſhed hereof by the day of Chriſts reſurrection; and <hi>Beza</hi> profeſſeth that our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66015:33"/>
Chriſtian aſſemblies on the Lords Day are of <hi>Apoſtolicall and Divine tradition.</hi> And obſerve I pray how Biſhop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> pleades for Epiſcopall authority, as by Divine right, in his anſwer to the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter Moulin. An eſt apoſtolicum factum aliquod, jure non apoſtolico? Apoſtolico au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, id eſt, ut ego interpretor, Divino. Nec enim aliquid ab apoſtolis factum, non dictante hoe iis ſpiritu Sancto &amp; Divino. Is there any fact of the Apoſtles, by right not apoſtolicall? But by apoſtolicall, that is (as I interpret it) by Divine. For neither was there any thing done by the Apoſtles, which the holy and divine Spirit did not dictate unto them.</hi> Shall this be of force for the inſtitution of Biſhops, and ſhall it not be of force for the inſtitution of the Lords Day, as by Divine right? But put the caſe it were ſo in every particular of <hi>Calvin,</hi> as this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer avoucheth; how comes it about that our adverſaries practiſe to choake us with the authority of <hi>Calvin?</hi> ſhall we beurged to yield to the authority of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who are reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uſually as <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and ſo nicknamed?

                  <p>That <hi>Calvin</hi> hath any where ſo determined this Prefacer hath not prooved, but ſhamefully diſmembred him, thereby to make him to deliver ſomething abſolutly which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers onely conditionally, and that in oppoſition unto Papiſts, who will have the Lords Day to be kept not onely <hi>for order and policy ſake but by reaſon of ſome myſtery;</hi> and this <hi>Calvin</hi> profeſſeth to be Jewiſh. <hi>Aquinas</hi> his words are theſe, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere aliquod tempus deputatum ad vacandum Divinis, cadit ſub praecepto morali: ſed in quantum in hoc praecepto determinatur ſpeciale tempus in ſignum creationis Mundi, ſic eſt praeceptum ceremoniale. To have ſome time deputed (wherein) to reſt for. things Divine, falls under the morall precept. But for as much as in this precept is determined a ſpeciall time in ſigne of the Creation of the World, ſo it is a praecept ceremoniall.</hi> Where I doe obſerve firſt, that this ceremoniality is apparently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the ſeventh day, and that conſidered <hi>as a ſigne of the Creation,</hi> and not to one day in ſeven. And this indeed may well be the concurrent opinion of Schole Divines. As for <hi>Abulenſis,</hi> of what authority is he to preponderate any one of our Divines? nay, I appeale to every humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whether no more be morall in this precept, then to ſet ſome time apart for Gods ſervice. For what? is it nothing materiall, whether we ſet apart for divine Service, one day in a weeke, or one day in a month, or one day in a yeare, or one day in twenty yeares, or one day throughout the whole courſe of a mans life? what conſcience can be found ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriate as to juſtifie this? If ſo, then let him proceed and ſay, it is nothing materiall whether wee conſecrate unto God one houre in a day, or one houre in a weeke, or one houre
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66015:34"/>
in a month, or one houre in a yeare, or but one houre through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole courſe of a mans life. So that I preſume every ſober man by the very light of nature, will be driven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that not only ſome time ought to be ſet apart for Gods worſhip (as the Schoolemen commonly teach) but that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient proportion of time ought to be deſtinated unto this. Now let reaſon itſelfe judge, whether any more convenient proportion of time can be deviſed for this then the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one day in ſeven. And herein let us oppoſe <hi>Azorius</hi> to <hi>Toſtatus</hi> (if <hi>Toſtatus</hi> doe oppoſe the morality of one day in ſeven, which is more then I finde) a Papiſt to confront a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt; who plainly affirmeth, <hi>Rationi maximè conſentaneum</hi>

To which I anſwer, firſt that herein is ſuppoſed ſomewhat wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about there is much queſtion, namely that <hi>Adam</hi> fell not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeventh Day. Yet <hi>Pererius</hi> profeſſeth that <hi>it was an opinion well knowne, and confirmed by the conſent of many and thoſe noble and illuſtrious authors, that Adam fell the firſt day wherein he was oreated.</hi> This ſayth he, <hi>ſeemes to have been the opinion of Irenaeus;</hi> and <hi>Cyrillus</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> are cited as approovers of it. He addes, that <hi>Moſes Baroephas</hi> in his booke
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66015:36"/>
of Paradice both prooves it, and avoucheth it as the opinion of many others, and eſpecially of <hi>Philopenus</hi> in his oration, which he wrote of the tree of Life, and of <hi>Ephrem</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and of <hi>Jacobus Sabugenſis</hi> in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſts Paſſion. To whom may bee added, ſaith <hi>Pererius, Diodorus the Biſhop of Tharſis, as he is cited in the chaine of interpreters upon Geneſis, upon thoſe words of the third chapter, we do eate of every tree in Paradiſe. Toſtatus</hi> himſelfe as this author writes, was ſometimes of the ſame opinion, though afterwards he changed his minde; and conceaved as more likely, that <hi>Adam</hi> fell on the Sabbath Day; which <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> approves not, though that was the opinion of the author of the Daraſh amongſt the Jewes, as <hi>David Kimchi</hi> writes upon that <hi>Pſalme,</hi> whoſe title is, <hi>A pſalme for the Sabbath;</hi> and that ſo by ſinning he profaned the Sabbath. This opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Toſtatus</hi> and the Jewes, <hi>Pererius</hi> doth not approve: but the reaſon he gives for his diſſenting from them, in my judgement is very weake. For that it runnes, <hi>becauſe the Lord bleſſed that Sabbath Day and ſanctified it, reſting from all his workes which he had made, therefore it was not agreeable, that on that day, ſo ſevere a judgement of the Divine vengeance ſhould be exerciſed.</hi> Now I ſay, this reaſon is very weake. For we commonly ſay, <hi>the better day, the better deed;</hi> and undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>the Lord is holy,</hi> as <hi>in all his workes,</hi> ſo in the execution of condigne vengeance. <hi>In this he delights, as in the execution of</hi>

                        <hi>mercy.</hi> And it is uſually the Lords courſe, even on the Lords Day, to recompence the wayes of the wicked upon their own heads, in the profanation of his Sabbaths. Secondly, it may ſeeme ſtrange, that <hi>Pererius</hi> ſhould ſerve himſelfe with this reaſon, namely, of <hi>the Lords bleſſing the ſeventh day and ſanctifying it,</hi> ſeeing he profeſſeth himſelfe to be of <hi>Toſtatus</hi> his opinion, interpreting theſe words by way of anticipation, and referring them to the giving of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sina.</hi> Others were of opinion, that <hi>Adam</hi> continued is long in Paradiſe, as Chriſt lived here on Earth. But this opinion <hi>Pererius</hi> thinkes no way probable. Others deviſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe for the ſpace of forty dayes, anſwering to our Saviours faſting forty dayes; but this he ſayth hath no ſhew of probability. His own conjecture is, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66015:36"/>
                        <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and was turned out of Paradiſe that day ſenight after he was created: and the grounds of his conjecture are in my opinion, as frivolous as any. As firſt, when he ſaith that eight dayes ſpace was ſufficient to have experience of the happineſſe of that ſtate. For why not as well ſome dayes more or ſome dayes leſſe? nay rather, by continuance in the ſame ſtate, we grow leſſe and leſſe ſenſible of the happineſſe thereof. And the happineſſe of a ſtate is beſt known by the contrary, according to that rule, <hi>Carendo magis quàm fruendo quid quidque ſit cognoſcimus.</hi> As for the agreement herein which he conceites between <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, as <hi>who is thought of many to have been conceaved in the Virgins wombe on the ſixt day of the weeke, and on the ſame day of the weeke was indeed crucified upon the croſſe;</hi> who ſeeth not that this conveniency had been found as well on that day fortnight, or on that day three weekes, and ſo in <hi>Infinitum,</hi> as on that day ſenight? As ridiculous appeares to be his pretence of complying thus with the antients, whoſe opinion was, that <hi>Adam</hi> fell the ſame day wherein he was created, which he would apply to that day ſenight after. For why not as well to that day three weekes after, or that day a month after, and ſo in <hi>Infinitum?</hi> But let us conſider <hi>Pererius</hi> reaſons whereby he undertakes to ſhew the unlikelihood of <hi>Adams</hi> falling the firſt day. The firſt is drawn from the forme of <hi>Adams</hi> temptation, thus, <hi>why doe you not eate of every tree of paradiſe?</hi> which ſuppoſeth as he ſaith, that they had already eaten of every other Tree in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; and <hi>Eves</hi> anſwer, he ſaith, ſeems to confirm this in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>we eate of the fruit of the Trees in the Garden. But of the fruit of the Tree which is in the mids of the Garden, we eate not;</hi> what is the meaning of <hi>we eate,</hi> but this, <hi>we are wont to eate,</hi> quoth <hi>Pererius.</hi> Yet forthwith he himſelfe enervates this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, confeſſing that the meaning may be this, <hi>It is lawfull for us to eate.</hi> And I willingly confeſſe, that no argument ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to me ſo plauſible as this, namely that they had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taſted of every fruit of the Garden beſides this: for it ſeems very likly, that not till then they were wel prepared for ſatans temptation. And it ſeemes unlikely they would offer to taſte of the fruit forbidden untill they had taſted of all the reſt; then indeed and not til then, the commendation of that as of a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66015:37"/>
more excellent fruit then any of the reſt, might the better al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure them both to touch and taſte. But as <hi>Pererius</hi> propoſeth it, it hath no force; for as much as he corrupteth the Text, the Divells words being not ſuch as theſe, <hi>why doe yee not eate of every tree of paradiſe?</hi> but running thus; <hi>Yea? hath God ſayd yee ſhall not eate of every tree in the Garden?</hi> or as <hi>Piſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> takes it for a concluſion of a larger diſcourſe; <hi>yea in as much as God hath ſaid, ye ſhall not eate of the fruit of every tree in the Garden,</hi> ſo giving a reaſon to proove what he objected, namely that God envyed their happineſſe. As for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which before I have given, they may be anſwered thus. If the benefit of this fruit had been of the ſame kinde with the benefit of others, and onely in degree of excellency above them, then were it no way likely they ſhould begin with this. But ſeeing it was pretended to be of a farre different kinde by Satans ſuggeſtion, not ſo much for ſatisfying the appetite of ſenſe, as for ſatisfying the ſpirituall deſire of the ſoule <hi>in knowing good and evill,</hi> which the very denomination of the Tree given by God himſelfe did fairely intimate; and this being cunningly improoved by Satan to be a Divine condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in making them like unto God; this conſideration might well allure forthwith without all further ſtay to have experience of other fruit. Secondly why might they not have taſted of the fruites of other Trees, without any neceſſity of nature urging them, and yet without any luxury at all, but only to acquaint themſelves with the condition of thoſe good Creatures which God had provided for them? Yet again conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that this experience made to no other end, ſhould ſo ſenſibly have brought home unto them the goodneſſe of God, in that ſtate of holineſſe and integrity, that it would have exceedingly confirmed them in their obedience to God, and made the motion of the Serpent at firſt hearing diſtaſtfull, and to chooſe to be like unto God in obedience, and thereby in conformity to his holy will, then in forbidden knowledge. And beſides, the taſting of all ſo ſoone, can hardly be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Luxury or waſt: therefore I reſt in my firſt anſwer. <hi>Pererius</hi> his next reaſon caryeth a great deale of ſhew, but in ſubſtance leſſe forcible. Certainly the making of the beaſts of the Earth, and of man, might be done in as ſhort a time as it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66015:37"/>
pleaſed God to have it; eſpecially conſidering the opinion of ſome antients, that all things were made together, and that in a ſhort ſpace; ſo mans placing in Paradiſe, and the beaſts brought unto him by God, might be ſoone diſpatched: and ſurely <hi>Adams</hi> naming of them coſt him no ſtudy; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly all this was done before the creating of <hi>Eve;</hi> ſo that all this might be done before noone, and ſpace enough allowed for the Divells conference with <hi>Eve,</hi> and his ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her, and her ſeducing <hi>Adam.</hi> The making of them aprons to hide their nakedneſſe caryeth the greateſt ſhew of requiring longer time; but he who wanted not wit to name the beaſts ſo congruouſly to their natures, wanted not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to cover themſelves with fig-leaves. As for the Doctors alleaged by him for his opinion; I doe not finde that any of them is expreſſe, or by conſequent direct for that, whereunto they are alleaged; but the inferences made from their wordes are meerely conjecturall. For when hee writes, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in the firſt booke of his antiquities; and <hi>Baſil</hi> in his Homily of Paradiſe; and <hi>Damaſeen</hi> in his ſecond booke of orthodox faith and 10. Chapter. <hi>ſeeme to be of this opinion;</hi> his ground is only this, becauſe as he ſaith, <hi>they write that the Serpent in paradiſe did often come to our firſt parents and converſe with them very gently and familiarly, and that thereupon the Divell tooke hint to inveagle the Woman.</hi> Now this is but a conjecture of theirs; neither doe they ſay that he was wont to conferre with them; yet all that they ſpeake of may very well be fulfilled in a few houres. That which to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he alleageth out of <hi>Auſtin de civit. dei lib.</hi> 11: <hi>c.</hi> 21. is onely this, <hi>The Apple on the tree forbidden, we are to believe it to be ſuch, as the reſt of other trees, which now they had found to be without hurt;</hi> hence it ſeemes <hi>Pererius</hi> would inferre, that before the Divells temptation they had taſted of them all; but <hi>Auſtins</hi> ſpeech is indefinite, and verified, in caſe they had taſted but of ſome; and <hi>Eve</hi> might have taſted of ſome, <hi>Adam</hi> of other ſome; If it be further urged, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> delivers it as a reaſon to ſhew how hereby they were made more pliable to yield to Satans temptation: I anſwer that by taſting ſome, yea and without taſting any, they might be well aſſured they might be taſted of without hurt, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66015:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that which God had forbidden them; and the taſting of all without hurt was no tolerable reaſon to perſwade that in like manner they might taſt of the forbidden fruit without hurt; the Lord having profeſſed unto them, that <hi>In the day they did eate thereof, they ſhould die the death. Pererius</hi> addes that <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his twentieth Booke of the City of God, and 26. Chapter, <hi>doth not obſcurely give to underſtand, that albeit he thought Adam continued not long in paradiſe, yet that he continued there longer then one day.</hi> But I finde no ſuch thing in the place quoted by him. But I gueſſe the paſſage he aimes at, is that wherein hee diſcourſeth of thoſe words of the Prophet <hi>Malachy Mal.</hi> 3. <hi>And the ſacrifice of Iudah and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem ſhall pleaſe the Lord as in the dayes of old, and in former yeares;</hi> and he inquires, what time that is, which is ſignified by this phraſe, <hi>as in the dayes of old, and in the former yeares.</hi> And firſt he ſaith, that perhaps thereby may be ſignified, the time wherein our firſt parents were in Paradiſe. And to this he referres that of <hi>Eſay Eſ.</hi> 65. <hi>According to the dayes of the Tree of life, ſhall be the life of my people.</hi> And who ſaith hee, knowes not, what that place was where the Lord planted the Tree of life? But then to the contrary he diſcourſeth thus, <hi>If a man ſhall ſay thoſe dayes of the Tree of life to be the dayes of the Church of Chriſt which are now current, and that Chriſt himſelfe is prophetically called the Tree of life—and that theſe firſt men lived not any yeares in paradiſe, from whence they were ſo ſoone ejected, that they begate no ſonne there, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time cannot be underſtood by this phraſe of Malachy (as in the dayes of old and former yeares)—I paſſe by this queſtion:</hi> to wit, of the meaning of the Prophet <hi>Malachy.</hi> Now had <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſimply ſayd that our firſt parents continued not many yeares in Paradiſe, there had beene ſome colour, as if he thought, <hi>Adam</hi> had continued ſome few yeares, or one yeare at leaſt, in Paradiſe. But neither doth <hi>Auſtin</hi> deliver this as his owne opinion, but as the diſcourſe of others; and that to proove that the words mentioned in <hi>Malachy,</hi> cannot denote the time of <hi>Adams</hi> being in Paradiſe; for as much as they ſpeake of many yeares; but <hi>Adam</hi> continued not yeares in Paradiſe, which is proved by this, that he was driven from thence before he had begotten any ſonne; which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66015:38"/>
if it be referred to the conception of a child, as in reaſon it ſeemes to be, who ſeeth not that one day, or a night might have ſufficed for that? So that all things conſidered, this place rather makes againſt <hi>Pererius</hi> then for him. In like ſort, that which he alleageth out of <hi>Gregory</hi> is onely this, that <hi>Man in paradiſe was accuſtomed to the words of God, and converſed with the ſpirit of the bleſſed Angells;</hi> ſuppoſe it were ſo, and with God himſelfe, ſo long as he continued in the ſtate of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (yet I hope they will give way to the temptation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan) yet how little or how long that time continued is not ſpecified. Conſider we now the reaſons to the contrary, delivered partly by <hi>Pererius</hi> himſelfe, partly by Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> upon <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Who on the third Chapter of that booke propoſeth them in this order. Firſt, <hi>the Angells that fell, preſently after their Creation ſinned, as our Saviour ſaith, that the Divell did not ſtand or continue in the truth Iob.</hi> 8. 44. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Auſtin conſenteth, Factus continuò ſe à luce veritatis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertit, as ſoone as he was made, preſently he turned aſide from the light of the truth: So it is likely that man alſo—</hi>And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the inference from Angels to men in this particular, ſeemes to proceede from that which is leſſe likely to that which is more likely. If the angells of themſelves fell ſo ſoone, how much more likely is it, that both Satan would ſet himſelfe with the firſt, to tempt them, and being tempted leſſe ſtrange it is that they ſhould fall. But concerning the angells defection, it doth not follow, either by our Saviours phraſe, or <hi>Auſtins</hi> phraſe that either of them believed they fell ſo ſoone. But whenſoever that was propoſed unto them, which was the triall of their obedience; had they approoved of it and ſubmitted unto Gods Will, that had beene or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon undoubtedly had followed their confirmation, as it was u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> after the firſt inſtant of his Creation. Secondly, Doctor
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66015:39"/>
                        <hi>Willets</hi> ſecond argument is this; <hi>Our Saviour ſaith that the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iob.</hi> 8. 44.</note> 
                        <hi>Devill was a murtherer from the beginning, not of the World, but of mans Creation, therefore at the very firſt he ſet upon them.</hi> But that phraſe <hi>from the beginning</hi> doth not tie us to any ſuch exact calculation. Thirdly, <hi>the ſubtilty of the Divell doth inſinuate as much, who would then aſſault them, when they were leaſt able to reſiſt, before they by experience were confirmed iu their obedience.</hi> In this I confeſſe there are two particulars of very momentous conſideration. Firſt, the Devills ſubtilty to ſet upon them, before they were poſſeſſed and taken up with an holy walking with God. Secondly, that continuance in an holy walking with God could not but confirme them, and make them more ſtedfaſt therein, having as yet no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the fleſh in them to make reſiſtance, and to ſuſpect every motion that ſhould ariſe to withdraw them from it. Fourthly, and <hi>it was fit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that man ſinning ſhould be caſt out of paradiſe before he had fully taſted of the pleaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, leſt he afterward might be tormented with the loſſe, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temted to returns.</hi> This reaſon my palate doth not reliſh ſo well; the more <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be tormented with the loſſe of paradiſe, the better it ſhould be for him in my judgement, rather then worſe. And as for attempting to returne, I cannot conceave how he ſhould be ſo vaine as to preſume to evacuate Gods judgements, and then againe of any ſuch paradiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Adams</hi> baniſhment therence, wee read nothing. Fiſtly, <hi>And it is cleare</hi> (ſaith Doctor <hi>Willet) by the Serpents firſt on ſet, hath God ſayd ye ſhall not eate of every Tree? that they had not yet taſtea of any fruit, but at the very firſt the forbidden fruit was offered, before their appetite had beene ſerved with any other.</hi> But firſt I doe not finde, that the Text mentioned hath any ſuch importment; Secondly, this ſuppoſeth, that the taſt of other fruits would have beene apt to hinder the courſe of Satans temptations; but how? in reſpect of giving ſo good content and ſatisfaction, yea but this ſatisfaction was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to the ſenſuall appetite; but the Tree forbidden in the very name of it (whence Satan tooke advantage to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his temptation) ſeemed to promiſe ſatisfaction in a far different kinde, namely to the ſpirituall appetite of the minde. 6. <hi>Adam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>had not yet eaten of the Tree of life, as it</hi>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:66015:39"/>
                        <hi>is evident verſe</hi> 21. <hi>But if they had ſtayed any time in paradiſe it is not unlikely, but they ſhould have taſted of the tree of life, it being in the heart of paradiſe.</hi> This at firſt ſeemed to me very conſiderable; but upon after thoughts not ſo. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it aſſured not life, but upon obedience and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obedience the taſting thereof (if acceſſible in that caſe) would have ſtood him in ſmall ſtead. 7. <hi>Likewiſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſeeing preſently after the Creation they were bidden to encreaſe and multiply, it is no other like but the man ſhould have known his wife in paradiſe, if they had ſtayed there ſo long, and ſo they ſhould have gotten children without ſin.</hi> This reaſon is not to be deſpiſed; although to ſtay a day or two in Paradiſe was not to ſtay there long. But conſidering that then they might company together without all ſinne ſo much as in thought, or circumſtance of act, (the want whereof makes even acts naturall in this condition of ours, ſhamefull unto us) why ſhould they deferre the propagation of mankinde; eſpecially conſidering that the child conceaved in the ſtate of innocency ſhould have beene without ſinne. 8. The eighth reaſon is in effect the ſame with that of <hi>Broughtons; If Adam had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the firſt day, the Lion had eaten Graſſe;</hi> this in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a moſt inſipid reaſon. Firſt, becauſe God had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that all beaſts at the firſt ſhould live by Graſſe <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 30. Secondly, In the arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> Lions muſt have eaten Graſſe or Hay, or elſe have ſtarved, they had no power to prey upon their fellow paſſengers. Thirdly, if Lyons and Beares at firſt had lived by pray, even after <hi>Adams</hi> fall, what had become of the reſt of Gods Creatures, <hi>Imbelles damae quid niſi praeda ſumus?</hi> Laſtly it is well knowne that in theſe dayes, in new England, Beares doe live by Graſſe, and their fleſh for mans meate is accompted better then Veniſon 9. <hi>Never any man on Earth, Chriſt only excepted, kept the Sabbath without ſin: the Apoſtle ſaith, he that is entred into his reſt hath alſo ceaſed from his own works, as God did from his, Hebr.</hi> 4 10. <hi>It is the reſt only of Chriſt, where there ſhall be a ceſſation from all the works of ſin. But that reſt which Adam ſhould have kept in paradiſe was not Chriſts reſt: therefore he kept no reſt there without ſin, he fell then before the Sabbath.</hi> This argument I confeſſe ſeemes to be very ponderous and ſavoury, as built upon the Apoſtles
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66015:40"/>
diſcourſe <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. But the propoſition is not ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For to ceaſe from a mans owne workes (as they are taken from ſinnes) is evidently competent to none but ſuch as have formerly ſinned, which cannot agree to <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency. Yet it cannot be denyed, but that <hi>Adam</hi> continued in innocency and without ſinne untill his fall. And ſo long reſted from ſinne, though not in Chriſt, ſave that to reſt from ſinne ſuppoſeth the precedency of ſinne. But albeit this were granted, it followeth not that he fell before the Sabbath; for he might fall on the very Sabbath, which was the opinion of the author of the Jewes Daraſh, mentioned by <hi>Rabbi David Kimchi</hi> on the 92. <hi>Pſalme.</hi> 10. <hi>That place laſtly makes to this purpoſe, Pſalme</hi> 49. 13. <hi>Adam lodged not one night in honour; for ſo are the words if they be properly tranſlated; the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> which ſignifies to lodge or ſtay all night: and thus diverſe of the Rabbins doe expound this place of Adam;</hi> and be quotes <hi>Rabbi Nathan. R. Menachem,</hi> and <hi>Midras Tehillim.</hi> It cannot be denied but this place is very pregnantly appliable unto <hi>Adam,</hi> as the firſt and chiefeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on whom this truth is verified; as being in the chiefeſt honour that ever man had on Earth, Lord of all the World, and the Father of mankinde, and placed in Paradiſe; and the verbe properly ſignifies <hi>pernoctare, to continue a night.</hi> Onely it is of the future tenſe, which yet to beare the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the time paſt is nothing ſtrange in the Hebrew, though it hath not alwayes <hi>Vau converſivum,</hi> the ſigne of ſuch converſion. And the very word <hi>Adam</hi> is here expreſſed, and we are very apt uſually to accommodate unto <hi>Adam</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all reference to this queſtion, or conſideration of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Hebrew word ſignifying <hi>pernoctare.</hi> But let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to that from whence we have digreſſed. Be it ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> continued in his integrity untill the end of the ſeventh day; doe we not read expreſſely, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>that God tooke the man and put him in the Garden of Eden, that he might dreſſe it and keepe it;</hi> therefore God had worke for him to doe, even in things of this World as well as hee hath for us.

Why then ſhould it be thought ſuperfluous to ordaine ſome dayes for the works of this World, and one day for the ſervice of God? And is it likely that <hi>Eve</hi> was about the ſervice of God, when the Divell aſſaulted her? was ſhee not too neare the forbidden Fruit? it was within her ſight, and the Fruit within her reach. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> They urge that <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from ſervice workes was then in vaine, ſeeing nothing could then be laborious and troubleſome unto him.</hi> I anſwer; though it were no paine to him to keepe the Garden and dreſſe it; yet this muſt needs take up his thoughts while hee was about it, and many a Gentleman in theſe dayes finds leſſe imployment then <hi>Adam</hi> had; will it therefore follow that the obſervation of the Sabbath is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third reaſon is, that <hi>if this Commandement were then given, it ſhould oblige all men; but it is plaine that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles never obſerved it, neither doe we reade the Patriarchs did.</hi> I anſwer, there is no ſoundneſſe in all this. For touching the Gentiles, we have no Hiſtory before the Flood, nor till a long time after; in which ſpace of time, this Doctrine of the inſtitution of the Sabbath being carried onely by tradition, might eaſily bee obliterated. The Scriptures Divine are the moſt ancient Records in the World; but it followes not, that becauſe the Scriptures doe not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord how the Patriarches did obſerve the Sabbath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they obſerved it not; but much rather, becauſe, the Scriptures Record, that <hi>The Lord bleſſed the ſeventh Day, and ſanctified it,</hi> therefore the Patriarches did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. And the truth is, untill the comming of the Iſraelites out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> wee reade not of the Church of God any where but in ſingle Families. Neither doe wee reade of the Patriarches before the Flood or a long time after that they kept any Day conſecrate to GODS Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; will it therefore follow, that thoſe holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66015:41"/>
did ſet no time at all apart for Gods ervice? yet is it generally acknowledged as by the light of nature, that ſome time ought to be ſet apart for Divine ſervice. And formerly I have ſhewed out of <hi>Manaſſes Ben Iſrael,</hi> that whereas the Lord enjoyning to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the obſervation of the Sabbath, bids them remember <hi>that they were ſervants in Egypt;</hi> this the antient wiſe men among the Jewes doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this manner, <hi>Cogita in Egypto ubi ſerviebas, etiam ipſo Sabbato per vim te coactum ad labores; thinke with thy ſelfe, how that in Egypt where thou ſervedſt, that by force thou waſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to worke, even on the Sabbath.</hi> So that the obſervation of the Sabbath was a duty even in thoſe dayes. Obſerve far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that in the fourth Commandement, the Jewes are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to looke unto it, not onely that their children and their ſervants did obſerve the Sabbath, but alſo, <hi>the ſtranger that was within their gates.</hi> Now theſe kinde of ſtrangers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Strangers of the gate,</hi> and thereby diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Strangers of the Covenant;</hi> were ſuch as were not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, though accompted Proſelytes in the firſt degree.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW whereas Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of one day in ſeven as neceſſary, differeth in opinion from his two Collegues Doctor <hi>Thyſius,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Walaeus,</hi> and not ſo onely, but directs himſelfe (after <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus)</hi> to take into conſideration the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments propoſed by doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> for the morality of one day in ſeven, and to accommodate an anſwer thereunto: I thinke it fit, not to omit the diſcuſſion of that anſwer of his; and that in ſuch ſort that I may carry my ſelfe correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to his ingenuous behaviour herein.</p>
                     <p>The firſt argument of <hi>Walaeus</hi> is this, <hi>if by the force and analogy (of the fourth Commandement) it be not rightly collected that one day of ſeven is to be conſecrated to Divine worſhip, then no certaine number or circle of dayes can be limited (to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid purpoſe) by any Divine precept, ſeeing in no other precept</hi>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:66015:45"/>
                        <hi>is found mention of any other number; and therefore it ſhall be lawfull to chooſe either a thirtieth day, or a fiftieth day without tranſgreſſion of any Divine precept. But this is abſurd.</hi> This argument is of great force; conſidering the difference bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene proportion of time allowed unto Divine Service; and the difference of the day, keeping ſtill the ſame proportion. For every maſter, from the greateſt Prince to the meaneſt houſholder expects that his ſervant ſhould be profitable unto him, and accordingly hee expects a certaine proportion of ſervice to bee performed by him; as namely a good dayes worke for every day; a good weeks worke for every weeke. And in every trade it is well known by them that are ſeene therein, wherein conſiſts a good dayes worke, whereof whoſoever failes, he is accompted but an idle and unprofitable ſervant; but ſo the worke of the day be done, whether he laboureth more in one houre, then in another, he regardeth not. Such in like manner is every ones conſideration of a weekes worke. So likewiſe as touching the ſervice of God, it is nothing materiall as touching the ſubſtance of Gods ſervice what day of the weeke is ſet apart for that. For whether we conſider the advantagious nature of it for ſetting forth the glory of God who is our maker; and as we came from him ſo we muſt be for him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. The ſupreame efficient being ever of duty the ſupreame end; or whether we conſider the profitable nature of it to our owne ſoules in comming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, both touching his nature, touching his counſaile concerning us, and touching his will. For when we deſpiſe him, we deſpiſe him againſt our ſelves; and when wee provoke him, wee provoke him to the confuſion of our owne faces; himſelfe being nothing profited by our ſervice, but our owne ſoules rather, though he be pleaſed to accompt himſelfe glorified thereby: it being his glory to doe us good. This advancement of his glory and our good is no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by ſetting one day in a weeke apart for this then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But betweene the proportion of one day in a weeke, or one day in a moneth, or one day in a yeare, there is a vaſt and momentous difference. For we come to the knowledge of God, and of the myſteries of godlineſſe by ſmall degrees;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66015:46"/>
and in the wayes of holineſſe we clamber as it were up an high and ſteepe hill; and our life is a wayfare, our condition is the condition of travellours; nay our life is a warfare, and the Divell and his angells of darkneſſe goe about continually like ſo many roaring Lyons, and hungry Beares, ſeeking whom they may devoure; So that we travell to Heaven as it were by dennes of Lyons, and over mountaines of Libbards. And will any wiſe man ſay that it matters not much in this caſe, whether we acquaint our ſelves with the Armour of God one day in a weeke, or one day in a moneth, or one day in a yeare to arme our ſelves againſt ſuch ghoſtly and watchfull enemies? Secondly, conſidering that it was never knowne that any maſter from the higheſt to the loweſt, was ſo fooliſh to leave it to his ſervant to cut out what proportion of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he thinkes fit, wherewith to ſatisfie his maſter for his keeping, and for the wages which he expecteth at his hands. Theſe things conſidered; I ſay this firſt argument of Doctor <hi>Wallaeus</hi> is of great evidence and force, and therefore it is to be well weighed and conſidered what anſwer either Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> or any other doth make unto it, and what ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it gives. Now the anſwer that hee makes unto it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not in his owne name, but in the name of another, to wit, in the name of <hi>Gomarus,</hi> and ſuch as concurre with him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To this they anſwer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that it is no inconvenience that there is no certaine number or circle of dayes defined for Gods ſervice by any precept. It is enough that the nature of publique worſhip, in generall comprehended in the fourth Commandement, doth require that not only certaine dayes be obſerved, but that the number of them be ſufficient alſo, nor fewer then the right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church, the ſalvation of men, and glory of God doe require, and that God by not defining it, hath not left unto us a wild licentiouſnes but a prudent liberty. And therefore that it cannot be differred to one day in twenty, or thirty, much leſſe to one of a thouſand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Over and above they note</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that from the morall reaſon of precept it is gathered what number of dayes is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for Divine Service; namely that ſeeing we are eaſed</hi>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:66015:46"/>
                        <hi>of the burden of ceremonies, whereof the Iewes were not, and yet God required one day in ſeven to be kept holy by them, we may be more frequent in Divine offices, but ought not to be leſſe: but yet that GOD hath not preciſely tied Christians to any, that is (as I take it) to any day in the weeke,</hi> whereas it ſhould be to any proportion of time, otherwiſe it is nothing to the preſent purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> addes this of his owne, that <hi>Whereas this alſo is morall that ſome reſt be granted to ſervants and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in charity the labour for ſo many dayes cannot be exacted of them without ſome reſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I reply.</p>
                     <p>Here we have acknowledged, that not only ſome time, but <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1.</note> alſo a ſufficient proportion of time is to be ſet apart for Gods publique ſervice, and that by the very light of nature; for that I conceave to be his meaning, and not with reference to the preciſe Commandement commanding it but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto it as it is morall, and ſo acknowledged by light of nature. For it is apparent that the Commandement in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a ſeventh doth therein require one day in ſeven, and not leave it at randome, what proportion of time, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it. 2. I appeale to every mans conſcience, and that as guided by the very light of nature ſo farre as it may be juſtly thought to be incorrupt, whether it be not more fit the Lord himſelfe ſhould ſet downe what proportion of time he thinkes ſufficient, then that the definition hereof ſhould be left to the ſervant, and that for theſe conſiderations. 1. If it be left unto man, how improbable is it that all the Nations of the World (as Chriſtians are or may be found in all) will concurre in judgement, and if they doe not, who ſeeth not what a way is hereby opened to miſerable diſtraction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, conſider what <hi>Socrates</hi> hath written of different rites in keeping Lent, and in obſerving holydayes. 2. If it be left to man, it is very likely that little enough will be thought ſufficient, ſo burthenſome unto fleſh and bloud is Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and the major part in moſt Nations (if not in all) even of the beſt (as is to be feared) is not truly regenerate. Foras our Saviour tells us though many be called yet but few
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66015:47"/>
are choſen. 3. upon this he concludes it may not be differred to the twentieth day; yet it is well knowne that <hi>Brentius</hi> hath profeſſed it may be differred to the fourteenth upon <hi>Leviticus.</hi> 25. 8. as Doctor <hi>Bownde</hi> alleageth him. Now if ſo great a writer hath beene of opinion that from the ſeventh it may be put off to the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. why may not another riſe up and maintaine that from the fourteenth it may bee put off to the twentieth, ſo dangerous it is to forſake that light which God hath given us in his Word; and by way of divination, hunt after a new light of evidence in the counſailes of our owne hearts. In the light of my conſcience it ſeemes moſt abſurd, that it ſhould be left to the ſervant to cut out what proportion of ſervice he thinkes good unto his maſter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is well that both he and <hi>Gomarus</hi> thinke we are bound to cut out a better proportion of Gods Service then was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the <hi>Iewes</hi> rather then a worſe: yet <hi>Brentius</hi> as great a writer as any of theſe, thinkes otherwiſe, as wee have heard. 3. doth only our freedome from the yoke of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies requires this? and not much more. 1. the love of God revealed unto us in Chriſt in the dayes of the Goſpell. 2. the encombrance of Gods Truth with errors, and hereſies, and thoſe very dangerous ones. 3. and in a word the ſtrong op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that in theſe daies of the Goſpell is made, and will be made more and more as the end of all things doth approach, both unto faith and holineſſe. It is noted to be the ſinne of Chriſtendom not to receave the love of the truth. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. And of theſe latter times <hi>Paul</hi> hath propheſied, that men ſhould be lovers of pleaſures more then lovers of God. 3. as for this opinion of <hi>Gomarus</hi> and <hi>Rivetus;</hi> I am glad they are ſo farre convicted of truth in this argument as to profeſſe, that we ought to keepe holy rather more dayes then fewer; But why then doe not the ſtates of <hi>Holland</hi> under whom they live (if they be of the ſame opinion) make it good by practiſe? And the <hi>French-Churches</hi> alſo; But they want example in antiquity for this. Who ſeeth not that this is delivered onely to ſerve turne, and helpe at a dead lift, when no other way is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſhift off the Argument?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And laſtly whereas he grants (with <hi>Calvin)</hi> that after
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66015:47"/>
ſo many dayes (to wit after ſix, for no other number was ſpecifyed) reſt muſt bee granted to ſervants on the ſeventh; doth not this evidently convince that that day muſt bee our Chriſtian Sabbath? For what? ſhall the maſters keepe one, and the ſervants another? or ſhall the ſervants not give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſervice of God on the day of their reſt, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the day of their labour in the workes of their proper callings? obſerve I pray how at every turne the light of Gods direction doth meete with us, to keepe us in the good wayes of the Lord, if we will not wilfully ſhut our eyes againſt it. Now let that ſeventh day which is our Chriſtian Sabbath be well obſerved, firſt; and then let the ſtates take what order they ſhall ſee good, for the obſervation of another day alſo. Yet we finde by experience, that hardly are men able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a poore living by labouring hardly ſix whole dayes in the weeke. I come to the ſecond which <hi>Rivetus</hi> recapitulates in briefe thus.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It is drawn from the number of ſix dayes allowed for worke, which number cannot conſiſt, unleſſe it be terminated in reſt, and in ceſſation on the ſeventh.</hi> To this <hi>Rivetus</hi> anſwereth, <hi>that the ſix dayes of labour are in reference to the ſeventh of reſt; the determination of which ſeventh day being now taken away a man may worke on any day, ſo long as ſome day be choſen (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Divine conſtitution or humane, and reaſonable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) for Divine Service, which may be in ſuch ſort, that fewer dayes ſhall be left for worke.</hi> But conſider.</p>
                     <p>What more reaſonable diſpoſition humane, then that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reſpon.</hi> 1.</note> which is conformable to conſtitution Divine? now it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that God required of the <hi>Jewes</hi> one day in ſeven; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it ever knowen to bee abrogated; the particularity of the day is abrogated, not the proportion of time; ground we have for the one by the ceremoniality of it, no colour of ground for the other; nor did ever I thinke any man ſet his wits on worke to deviſe a ceremonialitie of one day in ſeven.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But what? ſhall the morality of reſt granted to ſervants, be altered alſo under the Goſpell? did <hi>Calvin</hi> any where teach this? may not maſters exact as many dayes worke of their ſervants under the Goſpell as under the Law? hath not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66015:48"/>
Chriſt deſerved at the hands of ſervants to be as ſerviceable to their maſters as ever? Laſtly are thoſe dayes of the World ſuch as wherein a labouring man may maintaine himſelfe, by the labour of five dayes in a weeke as well as by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of ſix? A long time I have found it obſerved by traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiquers in the World, that nothing is more cheape then mens labours; a notable evidence how unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants wee have beene unto God, and therefore hee makes the labour of our hands and ſweate of our browes to afford very unprofitable ſervice unto us. Can theſe Divines make the World more favourable to crafts-men, and bring their commodities in better requeſt then they are; if they could, let them then change the morality of fervants reſt, and for one in ſeven allow them one in three, or foure, or five; their maſters will bee the more eaſily brought to entreat their conſciences to condeſcend. Or if Kings had power to make the commodities of their owne Country more worth, and the commodities of other Countries leſſe worth (which upon due conſideration will bee found as needfull equally) then place might bee made for this. Till then let us bee content with <hi>Calvines</hi> morality of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in reference to ſervants reſt, namely one day after ſix; and therewithall conſider whether our Chriſtian Sabbath muſt not bee confined to that day as the onely day of reſt for ſervants; and I hope wee ſhall not thinke it fit to allow one Sabbath for the maſters, and another for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The third is drawne from the examples of the Apoſtles and the apoſtolicall Church, who in place of the (Iewes) Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, obſerved the firſt day of the weeke without variation: therefore by force of the precept, one day in ſeven is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſtill. Never any hath beene found to change this; therefore that which hath beene kept from the beginning of the VVorld, and ſhall continue to the end, is to bee taken for ſuch as by the Analogy of Gods Commandement binds all men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Rivetus</hi> anſwereth, <hi>that the conſequence is not</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:66015:48"/>
                        <hi>firme; for as much as Chriſtians obſerved the Lords Day not of neceſſity by reaſon of any binding praecept, but of free choiſe. Yet was</hi> it wiſely done of them, leſt by a greater change they might offend the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And that it might be a free monument of their maintaining the weekly remembrance of Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
                     <p>Hee ſayeth they did it freely; but of things freely <note place="margin">Reſp.</note> done without any conſcience of duty obliging, it was never knowne that ſo univerſall a concurrence was found as the obſervation of the Lords Day. Nay Philoſophers obſerve that things freely done as often come to paſſe to the contrary. Againe then it was free for them to obſerve one day in fourteene as well as one in ſeven, as <hi>Breatius</hi> profeſſeth, and conſequently as well one in twenty, which <hi>Rivetus</hi> denies. Nay it ſtood them upon to change the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, leſt men by univerſall and perpetuall practiſe might bee confirmed in an opinion of the neceſſity of that which is not neceſſary. It is apparent that as the Lords Day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law was one day in ſeven; So the Lords Day in the Goſpell was and ſtill is one Day in ſeven. And both himſelfe and <hi>Gomarus</hi> are driven to profeſſe, that we may not allow a leſſe proportion then one in ſeven to Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And I appeale to every conſcience, to judge by the very light of nature; whether the Lord requiring of the <hi>Jewes</hi> one day in ſeven to bee conſecrated unto him, it doth not manifeſtly follow that wee Chriſtians can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no leſſe then one in ſeven; and whether it bee not fit that the Lords Day ſhould bee our holy Day; and as for the allowance of more in a weeke then one, let them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade their owne Churches thereunto firſt, and then it will bee time enough for us to hearken unto them. And what ſhould move them to illuſtrate the memory of Chriſts Reſurrection weekly? whereas they contented themſelves with a yearely memoriall (if at all they obſerved any ſuch) of his Nativity, Paſſion and Aſcenſion, and ſending downe of the Holy Ghoſt. Why doth hee not conſider that the day of the weeke onely whereon Chriſt roſe is called the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66015:49"/>
Lords Day in Scripture, whereon Iohn the beloved Diſciple received from his loving Lord, and maſter, that Divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his concerning things to come.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>If the number of ſeven, (that is, the obſervation of one day in ſeven) in this Commandement be changeable; then as ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, or as politicall: not as ceremoniall; for then the Church ought not to obſerve it. Nor as politicall; for in the morall Law precepts politicall are not given.</hi> And to this <hi>Rivetus</hi> anſwereth, <hi>that the obſervation of the ſeventh day is ceremoniall: and that the Primitive Church kept it not, neither did the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church keepe it, nor doe we keepe it as ceremoniall; but another ſeventh day, for Eccleſiaſticall policy ſake, not civill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When hee ſaith <hi>we keepe another ſeventh day;</hi> he implieth <note place="margin">Reſpon.</note> that by the ſeventh formerly mentioned hee meant that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular day of the weeke which the <hi>Iewes</hi> kept; and that wee indeed acknowledge to bee ceremoniall; but in this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of <hi>Wallaeus,</hi> hee manifeſtly corrupts his adverſaries argument, which is plainly directed againſt the ceremonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of one day in ſeven indefinitly conſidered, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ceremoniality of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſeventh. Yet when he ſaith <hi>the Primitive Church did, and we doe keepe a ſeventh, but not as ceremoniall;</hi> hee ſpeaks to the point; but his words following have no coherence herewith: ſo that hee may ſeeme to ſhuffle miſerably in this, affecting to decline that which he is not able to anſwer. But take wee him at the beſt, he muſt ſay that the obſervation of one day in ſeven was ceremoniall, if hee ſpeakes to the purpoſe. Now let him ſhew us if he can, the ceremoniality of one day in ſeven, and how Chriſt was the body of it; nothing more common then to affirme that the <hi>Iewes</hi> Sabbath was ceremoniall hand over head, without any diſtinction of the ſanctification of the day, and the reſt; much leſſe diſtinguiſhing betweene the reſt of one day in ſeven, and the reſt of the ſeventh. At length I found a faire way opened for the explication of the ceremoniality found in the reſt on the ſeventh day. But as for any ceremoniality in the reſt of one day in ſeven; never (I thinke) any man ſet his wits on worke to deviſe that. Laſtly,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66015:49"/>
after ſuch a ceremoniality is deviſed, wee will conferre whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reaſon ſuch a thing ought to bee ſtill obſerved as was ceremoniall unto the <hi>Iewes;</hi> and why may wee not as well obſerve circumciſion with the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> who obſerve it only in conformity to Chriſt, who was circumciſed?</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe <hi>Rivetus</hi> brings arguments alſo to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to prove that the obſervation of one day in ſeven, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell is not neceſſary, but free: it is fit we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them alſo to prove what force is in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rivet.</hi> 1.</note>If by force of the Commandement a ſeventh day is to be kept, then that day is to be kept which the Commandement  hath defined, which is the Sabbath of the <hi>Iewes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer by denying the conſequence, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting <note place="margin">Reſpon.</note> my ſelfe with a bare deniall, I prove it to bee incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent. For whereas God in commanding the ſeventh hath therewithall commanded one in ſeven, and withall ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied which of the ſeven ſhall bee reſted on and ſanctified unto his ſervice: If it may bee made appeare that the particularity of reſt on the ſeventh day be abrogated; and no colour can be brought for the abrogation of the proportion of time; to wit, of keeping one day in ſeven; it will evidently appeare herewithall, that this conſequence of Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound. Now this wee prove to bee moſt true; foraſmuch as the <hi>Jewes</hi> reſt on the ſeventh day was ceremoniall profiguring Chriſts reſt on that day in his grave; as both the fathers of old and moderne Divines both Papiſts, and Proteſtants, both Lutheranes, and Calviniſts have acknowledged; but never any man was found to deviſe a ceremoniality of reſting one day in ſeven; they may as well give themſelves to deviſe a ceremonality in the ſetting apart of ſome time in generall for Gods holy worſhip and ſervice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now this puts me in minde of another way clearely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the inconſequence of <hi>Rivetus</hi> his argument thus. If it will follow that in caſe wee are bound to ſuch a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time by vertue of this Commandement, therefore wee are bound alſo to keepe the ſeventh day: Then it will follow as well, that becauſe wee are bound to ſet apart ſome time for the ſervice of God by vertue of this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66015:50"/>
(as all confeſſe) therefore we are bound alſo to keepe ſuch a proportion of time as is here ſpecified, and the ſeventh day alſo which is here particulated; For like as God doth not command ſuch a proportion of time in ſpeciall, but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the obſervation of the ſeventh day; in like ſort neither doth God Command a time in generall to bee ſet apart for his ſervice, but by commanding of ſuch a proportion of time in ſpeciall, and ſuch a Day in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>

                           <hi>Rivet.</hi> 2.</note>2. His ſecond argument runnes thus: if the obſervation of  every ſeventh day bee morall it muſt bee knowne by light of nature, but ſo it is not. Therefore it is not morall; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not politicall, it muſt bee ceremoniall; and therefore doth nor oblige by force of Law morall. To this I anſwer firſt.</p>

For I doe not thinke it poſſible for the wit of man with any colour of reaſon, to deviſe a ceremoniality to be conſtituted in the obſervation of one day in ſeven, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it indefinitly as wee doe, the body whereof can bee found in Chriſt; for of ſuch ceremonies wee ſpeake, that as ſhadowes are to flee away when the body comes in place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Neither doth it follow that becauſe it is not morall nor politicall, therefore it is ceremoniall; for ſome will ſay that it is poſitive as touching the defining of ſome particular ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to the performance of a morall duty. As for example, not to go further then the matter in hand for inſtance; it is generally confeſſed, to be a morall duty by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inſtinct, that ſome time is to bee ſet apart for Gods ſervice; but of our ſelves wee are to ſeeke of the proportion of time; it is fit for none ſo much as for God himſelfe our Creator, and conſequently our great Lord and maſter to define what proportion of time ſhall be allowed for his ſervice; now this they call poſitively morall, as belonging to the execution
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66015:50"/>
of a morall duty. Yet indeed not ſo much a circumſtance thereof in proper ſpeech as the ſpecification of the generall concerning the circumſtance of time.</p>

Yet to draw nearer to the morality of it; what? ſhall  nothing bee morall that is not knowne to bee ſo, by light of nature, for what I pray? is not our nature now corrupt? nay hath not <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> profeſſed that matter of morality is not capable of demonſtration, but onely of <gap reason="foreign">

Nay how is it knowne by the light of nature, that ſome time is to bee ſet apart to the worſhip of God that made us; but upon preſuppoſition that God is knowne to bee our Creatour? and is this knowne by the light of nature? How came <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> then the greateſt Philoſopher that ever was, and his whole ſchoole, how I ſay came they to be ignorant of it? but upon preſuppoſition of the Hiſtory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion knowne unto us, Doctor <hi>Feild</hi> ſpares not to profeſſe as Maſter <hi>Broad</hi> reportes him, that by light of nature it is known that one day in ſeven ought to bee conſecrated to Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? Yet I am not forward to ſay ſo much, but rather with <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that now from the Creation God hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted that one day in a weeke is to bee appo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rtioned for his ſervice; and with <hi>Azorius</hi> that it is moſt agreeable to reaſon, <note place="margin">

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. I come to his third argument which is this, the neceſſity  of one day in ſeven cannot conſiſt with that liberty which the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. Let no man judge you in meate and drinke, or in the part of a day, or of Sabbaths, which are ſhadowes of things to come. Which they expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by a ſimilitude. As nature requires meates and drinke, but Chriſtian liberty is not tied to choiſe of meates according to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Lawes: ſo reaſon dictates that ſome time is to be ſet apart for Gods publique worſhip, but the Goſpell freeth us from the neceſſity of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:66015:51"/>
To this I anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By granting the concluſion; for the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Sabbath <hi>Chriſtians</hi> obſerve not. 2. but one day in ſeven they alwayes <note place="margin">Reſpon.</note> have obſerved, a manifeſt evidence that they never conceaved this to be any impeachment to their Chriſtian liberty. And no marvell; for they manifeſtly perceaved that God required this proportion of time under the Law, and from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World; how much more ſhould we be carefull to performe no leſſe under the Goſpell? And indeed reſt on the ſeventh day did pregnantly repreſent before hand Chriſts reſt that day, and that day alone full and whole in the grave. But as for any ceremoniality to be found in the ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time, to wit, as one day in ſeven, never any man deviſed any ceremoniality therein more then in the time in generall, which all confeſſe by the very light of nature is to be conſecrated unto God. So that we have no need of Doctor <hi>Rivetus,</hi> his anſwer to helpe us in the ſolution of this his argument. And whereas he conceaves our Chriſtian liberty to be impeached if any proportion of time be obſerved of neceſſity by force of precept, and of free choiſe. 1. This is as much as to ſay that our liberty is impeached, if we ſuffer our Lord and maſter, to preſcribe unto us his ſervants what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of ſervice we ſhall performe unto him, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have him leave it to the ſervant to cut out unto him as little, or as much as he thinkes good, yet we do not deny but he may allow unto him more; all that we ſtand for is that we ought not to allow him leſſe under the Goſpell, then he required under the Law; and then he required from the beginning of the World. 2. I marvell that Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> doth not obſerve how herein he contradicts himſelfe; for hath he not formerly reſted in this anſwer of <hi>Gomarus,</hi> that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the fourth Commandement, we muſt allow unto him dayes ſufficient for his ſervice; and that theſe dayes muſt be rather <hi>Frequentiores</hi> then <hi>Rariores,</hi> more rather then fewer; and if it be no prejudice to our Chriſtian liberty to be tyed, and that by vertue of the fourth Commandement, to allow unto him a better proportion of time, for his ſervice, then that of one day in ſeven, how can it bee prejudiciall to our
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66015:51"/>
Chriſtian liberty to allow unto him this, and that by vertue of the fourth Commandement.</p>
                     <p>Now whether Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> his anſwers to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Wallaeus,</hi> or his owne arguments to the contrary bee <note place="margin">

And that this is as free from all colour of ceremoniality as any of the other two. The firſt was that ſome time is to be ſet apart for Gods Service; now this generall is not commanded there but as contained in the ſpeciall, to wit, the proportion of one day in ſeven. Both of them being equally contained in the particularity of the ſeventh day in that Commandement expreſſed. And as for the morality of reſt to bee allowed to ſervants after ſix dayes of labour; this doth clearely draw with it the confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the time appointed for Gods Service to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one day in ſeven; unleſſe the day of reſt for ſervants ſhal not be the day conſecrated to the exerciſes of piety. And I much wonder that Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> a man of ſuch judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perſpicacity doth not obſerve this. The only way to helpe this anomaly is in plaine termes to profeſſe that ſome reſt is to be allowed to ſervants by their Maſters, but in what proportion, that is not defined, but left at large to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Maſters. And as for ceremoniality in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of one day in ſeven, never any man deviſed any ſuch thing more then in the ſetting apart of ſome time in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for Gods Service, all confeſſing this to be a duty known by the very light of nature. But I doe not finde that <hi>Calvin</hi> hath any other meaning then that we are not ſo tied to one day in ſeven, but that more time then this may be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Divine Service; which as I have diſputed before, ſo now I am the more confirmed herein, Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting this to be his opinion alſo, as well as it was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Gomarus;</hi> For in this he reſts, as may appeare by his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66015:52"/>
anſwer to the firſt argument of Doctor <hi>Wallaeus.</hi> Neither is it true that <hi>Calvin</hi> did cenſure them who ſimply maintained, that the obſervation of one day in the weeke doth ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as morall; but that ſo maintained it as in reference to ſome myſterious ſignification; as Doctor <hi>Wallaeus</hi> hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and the words immediatly following in <hi>Calvin</hi> doe evince, which are theſe; but this is no other thing then in contumely of the <hi>Jewes</hi> to change the day, and in heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſame holineſſe of the day. Here commonly the alleagers of <hi>Calvin</hi> to the ſame intent that Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> doth, uſe to make a period; as if <hi>Calvin</hi> delivered this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely; whereas <hi>Calvin</hi> propoſeth it onely conditionally, as appeares by the other halfe of the ſentence thus. If ſo bee there remaine yet unto us a ſignification in the dayes equally myſterious, to that which had place among the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And though I marvell not at others who dealing in this argument diſmember <hi>Calvins</hi> ſentence, ſo to make him to deliver that abſolutely which hee delivers onely conditionally; yet I cannot ſufficiently marvell that <hi>Rivetus</hi> of rough impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhould do ſo too, eſpecially conſidering the good paines that Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> hath taken to cleare <hi>Calvins</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this point.</p>
                     <p>Neither is Maſter <hi>Robert Low,</hi> in his effigiation of the true Sabbatiſme, of any ſuch authority as to counterpoiſe the concurrent teſtimonies of ſo many of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines to the contrary; not to ſpeake of the multitude of outlandiſh Divines whom Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> muſtereth up, concurring in the ſame opinion, and whereas hee ſaith as Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> reports him, that ſome great men, who vehemently contend, that the perpetuall ſanctity of manners doth require, that one day in ſeven ſhould be celebrated, have more authority then reaſon; I may bee bold to ſay that they who with him have hitherto oppoſed the Doctrine we maintaine, what authority they have I know not, but as for their reaſons, they are of ſo hungry a nature; that hereby they manifeſt that nothing but affection and their private ends they have, to beare them out in this. And whereas I doubt not but <hi>Rivetus</hi> hath brought on the Stage the beſt reaſons hee could picke both out of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66015:52"/>
maſter <hi>Robert Low,</hi> and out of <hi>Gomarus;</hi> let every indifferent perſon judge of them as they deſerve; though I verily thinke that nothing but his affection to <hi>Calvin,</hi> to hold up his credite, and reputation hath carried him all along; and yet either my ſelfe, and <hi>Walaeus</hi> myſtake <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Rivetus</hi> miſerably myſtaketh him.</p>
                     <p>But as for our reaſon, we call all the World to judge of it; God did require one day in ſeven to be ſet apart for his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſervice under the Law; how much more doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire as good a proportion of time under the Goſpell? Nay from the beginning of the World he hath required it, and to this day both <hi>Iewes,</hi> and Chriſtian <hi>Gentiles</hi> have obſerved the ſame proportion. Againe God in his morall Law hath required this, and that not as ceremoniall, never any man hitherunto having ſet his wits on worke to deviſe any cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniality herein; neyther was it ever knowne that God abrogated this proportion of time to be allowed unto him for his ſervice; therefore it continueth ſtill as a morall Law to bind us, and ſhall continue untill God himſelfe ſet an end unto it: now let maſter <hi>Lowes</hi> reaſons be compared with theſe in every indifferent conſcience, and let them have that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which they deſerve, becauſe being well conceited of the ſtrength of his reaſons, hee ſenſibly complaines of his want of authority. It ſeemes Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third was a man of more authority then reaſon. For hee maintaines in <hi>Cap. licet. de feriis,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> relates it, that both the old and new Teſtament have in ſpeciall manner appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſeventh day for man to reſt thereon, and hee takes it out of <hi>Suarez. de relig. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. but <hi>Rivetus</hi> cannot aſſent unto him, if he delivers this of any morall inſtitution; yet that it was ſo appointed by the fourth Commandement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Iewes</hi> it cannot bee denied; and that not as ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall; for we have ſeene how odly <hi>Rivetus</hi> hath carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in comming to ſpeake of the ceremoniality. For to make this good hee flyes to the particularity of the ſeventh day; and if the ceremoniality thereof, bee enough to inferre the ceremoniality of ſuch a ſpeciall proportion of time as of one day in ſeven; it may ſuffice as well to conſtitute a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66015:53"/>
ceremoniality in the generall, namely in this that ſome time is to be ſet apart for Gods Service, which yet all account to bee morall by the very light of nature.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Zanchy</hi> hath no better argument to prove that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue</hi> as given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> doth not pertaine to us but onely ſo farre forth as it agrees with the Law of nature; then by inſtancing in the Sabbath, which the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were not bound to ſanctifie: it ſtands <hi>Rivetus</hi> upon to oppoſe him as much as any, who maintaines that the Law concerning the ſanctifying of the Sabbath was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and who brings diverſe authorities to prove the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it generally by the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> This I ſpeake upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his reply to <hi>Gomarus</hi> taking exception againſt ſomewhat in this argument delivered by him in his explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Decalogue. But I hope the morall Law ſhall be ſufficient to binde us Chriſtians if no other way, yet by this argument of proportion. If God required of the <hi>Iewes</hi> under the Law that one day in ſeven ſhould bee ſet apart to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: how much more doth it become us Chriſtians to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as good a proportion of time for his ſervice under the Goſpell? This I ſay ſhall ſuffice untill <hi>Rivetus</hi> anſweareth it, which never will be, for he as good as confeſſeth that we are bound to allow God for his ſervice, rather a better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time then a worſe. And as for Doctor <hi>Prideaux,</hi> I nothing doubt but he will cleare us from Judaiſme in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus; as who Sect. 7. profeſſeth that if they (againſt whom he diſputes) required no more, but the Analogy, the equity or the reaſon of that Commandement, we would not ſticke to yeeld unto it. And whereas <hi>Rivetus</hi> addes that the argument which hee annexeth ſeemes to him of great weight, namely that hee who ſtickes to the Commandement muſt exactly obſerve it: And that therefore into the place of the ſeventh from the Creation, no day is to bee ſubſtituted. But this argument I have anſwered before, all for the moſt part grant ſome ceremoniality in that Commandement; now if reſt on the ſeventh be found to bee ceremoniall, but not the reſt of one day in ſeven in an indefinite conſideracion; it will follow herehence, that the ſeventh muſt not be obſerved as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66015:53"/>
accompliſhed in Chriſt; and that the proportion of time is ſtill to continue, as indeed by experience wee finde it veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in each. For the obſervation of the ſeventh is ceaſed as prefiguring Chriſts reſt in his Grave, but the obſervation of one day in ſeven ſtill continueth unto this day.</p>

                  <p>Next for the ſecond Theſis, that the alteration of the day  is onely an humane and Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution, the Doctor ſheweth in the firſt Section, the generall conſent of all ſorts of <hi>Papiſts, Jeſuites, Canoniſts,</hi> and Schoolemen; of ſome great <hi>Lutheranes</hi> by names, and generally of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant or <hi>Arminian</hi> Divines in their confeſſion, whoſe tendries in this point, wee may conceave with reaſon, not to bee different from the Doctrine of the <hi>Belgicke</hi> Churches, in that foure profeſſors of <hi>Leyden,</hi> in their examination or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of that confeſſion, have paſſed them over without note or oppoſition. To theſe beſides are added diverſe of our own, <hi>Et è noſtris non pauci,</hi> as hee ſpeakes it in the generall, that is, as I conceave his meaning ſuch as are neither of the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> nor of the <hi>Arminian</hi> party: of which ſince he hath inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in none particularly, I will make bold to borrow two or three teſtimonies, out of the tractate of <hi>Gomarus</hi> before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.

                  <p>In this <hi>Section,</hi> the Prefacer makes a greater bluſter by farre then in the former. For to except againſt the proportion of time, as of one day in ſeven to be ſet apart for the ſervice of God in theſe dayes of the Goſpell, is ſo unreaſonable a courſe, and that not onely in the judgement of a Chriſtian conſcience, but even in the judgement of a naturall man, that I cannot eaſily deviſe any thing more unreaſonable. For whereas all confeſſe that by the very light of nature ſome time ought to bee ſet apart for the ſervice of God; and not ſo onely, but that a fit, and competent proportion of time is to bee conſecrated to holy uſes, as <hi>Gomarus</hi> acknowledgeth, though one of the moſt eager oppoſers of the morality of the Sabbath, that hitherto have beene knowne. Albeit this convenient proportion of time cannot bee ſo convincingly concluded upon by the light of nature, as to draw all to an unanimous conſent thereunto; yet after God himſelfe hath gone before us herein by <hi>bleſſing the ſeventh day and ſanctifying it;</hi> and that upon the ground mentioned both <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. and in the fourth Commandement; henceforth as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66015:54"/>
God hath manifeſted, that one day in ſeven is to be ſet apart; I may ſay conſequently, that one day in ſeven is that fit proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of time which is to be ſanctified to Gods holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice, and that God hath now manifeſted as much ever ſince the Creation. And (herupon as I imagin) <hi>Azorius</hi> the Jeſuite in his inſtitutions is bold to conclude, that this courſe is moſt agreeable unto reaſon. Now if the Lord under the Law did require ſuch a proportion of time to be ſequeſtred from profan uſe to Divine, at the hands of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> can it enter into the heart of a ſober man, that God ſhould require leſſe of us Chriſtians under the Goſpell, then he did require of the Jewes under the Law? Or that God hath now left it to the liberty of the Church, whether they will ſet apart the proportion of one day in ſeven or leſſe, to bee ſpent in Gods worſhip? If wee conſider the ſervice of the day, as whereby God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, undoubtedly God hath deſerved more ſervice at our hands under the Goſpell, then hee did at the hands of the <hi>Jewes</hi> under the Law; for as much as the love of God to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde was never ſo revealed in former times, as in theſe latter times; <hi>So God loved the World that he gave his only begotten Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> And hereupon undoubtedly it is that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our profeſſeth, that from the time of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> the Kingdome of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. To ſuch an height of devotion hath the Love of God manifeſted in his Sonne inflamed his true ſervants; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Iohn, We love him becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> Againe if wee conſider the ſervice of that day, as ſuch wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our ſoules are profited and promoted in faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, never was there more need then in theſe dayes of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a better proportion of time unto God Service, rather then a worſe; and that in each reſpect. For the truth of God was never ſo encombred with oppoſitions before the comming of our Saviour in the fleſh as it hath beene ſince. No heretiques (to ſpeake of) were knowne to trouble the peace of the Church, in thoſe former times in compariſon to the multitude of hereſies that have beene broached ſince, and began to bee ſet on foote in the very dayes of the Apoſtles; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſing that even then the myſtery of iniquity
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66015:55"/>

And whereas Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſhould come privily bringing in damnable hereſies even denying the Lord that bought them; Saint <hi>Iude</hi> tells them to whom hee writes, that ſuch were already crept in turning the grace of God into wantonneſſe, and denying God the onely Lord, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> after the ſame manner, little children (ſaith hee) it is the laſt time, and as you have heard that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall come, even now there are many <hi>Antichriſts.</hi> And no marvaile; for as much as the myſteries of godlineſſe concerning the Trinity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and incarnation of the Sonne of God (whereat carnall wits are ſo apt to ſtumble) were never ſo punctually and diſtinctly expreſſed in the books of the old Teſtament, as now they are particularly delivered in the writings of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts.</p>
                  <p>So that had wee in theſe dayes two Sabbaths in a weeke inſteed of one, all were little enough to inſtruct our people, and ſtrengthen them againſt the oppoſitions made by men of carnall mindes, and thereby to keepe them in the right way of Gods ſaving truth. And no leſſe neceſſitie is there for the keeping of them in the wayes of holineſſe, ſuch is the degenerate condition of the World; Long agoe it is that the ſevere judgement of God, had its courſe in giving men over to illuſions to beleeve lies, and all for not receiving the love of the truth, as much as to ſay for the profaneneſſe of the Chriſtian World, in not making it their care to walke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their calling, worthy of the Goſpell; whereunto the Apoſtle ſo often exhorts Chriſtians. So that if at any time it were requiſite to ſet one day in ſeven apart for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, ſurely by the very dictate of common reaſon, it is moſt requiſite in theſe latter dayes of the Goſpell. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering the rage, and fury of Satan in oppoſing the Kingdome of Chriſt more now than ever, becauſe he knoweth hee hath but a ſhort time. As for the alteration of the day (the ſame proportion of time ſtill continuing) from the ſeventh to the firſt day of the weeke, that I confeſſe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſeemes not at firſt ſight to have the like evidence. But whereas this Prefacer contends for the alteration of the day,

The <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> upon the firſt of the <hi>Revel.</hi> and 10. verſe doe obſerve that <hi>the Apoſtles, and the faithfull abrogated the Sabbath which was the ſeventh day, and made holy day for it, the next day following, being the eighth day in compt from the Creation, and that without all Scriptures, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of Chriſt that we read of: yea (which is more) not only otherwiſe then was by the Law obſerved, but plainly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than was preſcribed by God himſelfe in the ſecond Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, yea otherwiſe than he ordained in the firſt Creation when he ſanctified preciſely the Sabbath day, and not the day following. Such great power did Chriſt leave to his Church, and for ſuch cauſes gave he the Holy Ghoſt to be reſident in it, to guide it into all truthes, even ſuch as in the Scripture are not expreſſed. And if the Church had authority and inspiration from God, to make Sunday (being a working day before) an everlaſting holy day, and the Saturday that before was holy day, now a common work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, why may not the ſame Church preſcribe and appoint the other feaſts of</hi> Eaſter, Whitſontide, Chriſtmas, <hi>and the reſt? for the ſame warrant ſhe hath for the one, as ſhe hath for the other.</hi> Now to this Doctor <hi>Fulk</hi> makes anſwer after this manner. <hi>The Apoſtles did not abrogate the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Sabbath, but Chriſt himſelfe by his death, as he did all other ceremonies of the Law, that were figures and ſhadowes of things to come, whereof he was the body, and they were fulfulled and accompliſhed in him, and by him. And this the Apoſtles knew both by the Scriptures, and by the Word of Chriſt, and his holy Spirit. By the Scriptures alſo they knew that one day of ſeven was appointed to be obſerved for ever during the World, as conſecrated and hallowed to the publike exerciſe of the Religion of God; Although the ceremoniall reſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:66015:57"/>
                     <hi>day according to the Law were abrogated by the death of Chriſt. Now for the preſcription of this day before any other of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they had without doubt either the expreſſe commandement of Chriſt before his aſcenſion when he gave them precepts concerning the Kingdome of God, and the order and government of the Church,</hi> Acts 1. 2. <hi>or elſe the certaine direction of his Spirit, that it was his will and pleaſure it ſhould be ſo, and that alſo according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And obſerve how in the words following he falls in upon the ſame reaſon of the change of the day which of old was mentioned by</hi> Athanaſius <hi>(formerly rehearſed) herein by</hi> Beza, <hi>Doctor</hi> Andrews, <hi>D.</hi> Lake, as I have already ſhewed. <hi>Seeing there is the ſame reaſon of ſanctifying the day in which our Saviour Chriſt accompliſhed our redemption, and the reſtitution of the world by his reſurrection from death, that was of ſanctifying the day in which the Lordreſted from the creation of the world.</hi> And after many lines nothing neceſſary to be recited, he comes to the compariſon made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Lords Day and other Feſtivalls, ſaying: <hi>Although the Church in dayes or times which are indifferent, may take order for ſome other dayes or times to be ſolemnized for the exerciſes of Religion; or the remembrance of Chriſts nativity, reſurrection; aſcenſion, or the comming of the holy Ghoſt, may be celebrated either on the Lords Day, or any other time: yet there is great difference between the authority of the Church in this caſe, and the preſcription of the Lords Day by the Apoſtles for the ſpeciall memory of thoſe things are indifferent of their nature, either to be kept on certaine daies, or left to the diſcretion of the Governours of the Church. But to change the Lords Day, or to keepe it on Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, Tueſday, or any other day, the Church hath no authority. For it is not a matter of indifferency, but a neceſſary preſcription of Chriſt himſelfe, delivered to us by his Apoſtles.</hi> And againe, in the next place: <hi>The cauſe of this change, it was not our eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that either we have, or ought to have of our redemption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our creation, but the Ordinance of God, who, as firſt he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the reſt from creation for the glory of that weeke: ſo now alſo he ſanctifieth the day of the reſtitution of the world for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the accompliſhment of our redemption.</hi> Thus wee have not onely authority Humane, but authority Divine for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Day, and that by the teſtimony of more Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66015:57"/>
antient and late, than this Prefacer makes ſhew of amongſt farre meaner names. Yet he doth immodeſtly abuſe Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> in putting it upon him, that in the fifth Section, <hi>he maintaines the alteration of the day to be onely an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Eccleſiaſticall inſtitution.</hi> For, in that Section, he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſeth them, who would derive the Divine authority (which they ſtand for) of the alteration of the Day from the old Teſtament: but as for thoſe who derive the Divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereof from the new, they, hee confeſſeth, doe carry themſelves herein more warily, the other more weakly, and them alone he diſputes againſt in that Section. In the ſixth Section, he comes to the deriving thereof from the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and firſt he challengeth them, who boaſt that they have found the inſtitution of the Lords Day in the new Teſtament expreſſely, to ſhew the place. Then in the often diſputations of our Saviour with the Phariſees about their ſuperſtitious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Sabbath Day, he demands where is the leaſt ſuſpicion of the abrogation of it; or any mention that the Lords Day was inſtituted in the place thereof? And indeed, the time hereof was not yet come; onely the death of Chriſt ſetting an end to ceremonies. Then he demands whether the Apoſtles did not keepe the Jewiſh Sabbath? now, I doe not find they did, although they tooke occaſions of their meetings on that day to diſpute with them, and to inſtruct them in the Faith of Chriſt. Then he demands, whether the Primitive Church did not deſigne as well the Sabbath as the Lords Day to ſacred meetings? I find in <hi>Baronius,</hi> that <hi>Orthodoxi Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron. tom.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 517.</note> did, and the occaſion alſo, to wit, in deteſtation of the <hi>Marcionites;</hi> yet without any ſuch reſpect, it had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange, conſidering, that even now adayes Saturday is counted halfe holy day; and that the Jewes had a preparation for the Sabbath, in ſuch ſort, that on their behalfe, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made a reſcript, that no Jewes ſhould be compelled to make good their ſuretiſhips (as much to ſay, they ſhould not be <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron. tom.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 148.</note> arreſted) either on the Sabbath dayes, or after three a clocke of the day going before. Hereupon (which is yet a very weake ground in my judgement) he ſaith, that Papiſts inferre, that the Lords Day is not of Divine inſtitution; he doth not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66015:58"/>
make any ſuch inference himſelfe. Yet notwithſtanding (he confeſſeth that) even in the Church of Rome, <hi>Anchoranus, Panormitane, Angelus</hi> and <hi>Sylveſter</hi> (all which this Prefacer conceals very judiciouſly for his owne advantage) have ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet themſelves againſt theſe luke-warme Advocates, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Divine authority of the Lords Day. And I find, that <hi>Azorius</hi> in his inſtitutions, makes mention of them to the ſame purpoſe, and addes, that <hi>Sylveſter</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>hanc eſſe opinionem communem, that this is the common opinion.</hi> And after this, Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> in that Section, diſputes for the Divine inſtitution thereof, rather than againſt it. After this he takes notice of <hi>Pauls</hi> fact, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. and diſputes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence for a cuſtome to celebrate on the firſt day of the weeke their publike meetings; and confeſſeth, that the Fathers, and all Interpreters almoſt, doe ſo conceive it: though withall he profeſſeth hee ſees not how from a caſuall fact (ſo he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, upon what ground I know not) a ſolemne inſtitution may be juſtly grounded; yet that which went before, in ſome oppoſition whereunto this is delivered, pleaded not for a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne inſtitution, but for a cuſtome onely; although upon due conſideration, it may be found, that ſuch a cuſtome (if that be granted) could not otherwiſe proceed originally than from a ſolemne inſtitution: It is enough if they ordained that on that day the Churches ſhould be aſſembled for publique worſhip; which <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſſely profeſſeth, as formerly I have ſhewed, neither doth it appeare in reaſon how it could be otherwiſe, ſuch aſſemblies being univerſall and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to this day: Is it credible ſuch univerſall agreement ſhould come to paſſe caſually? if it did, yet their continuance of it without diſlike, doth manifeſt their joynt Apoſtolicall approbation, who we know were guided by the Spirit of God: and even in their time was the firſt day of the weeke, called the Lords Day. So that in all this I find no incoherence, much leſſe notable. Indeed, in the firſt of the <hi>Corinth. chap.</hi> 16. 2. he doth not order that the firſt day ſhould be ſet apart for Gods ſervice, but rather ſuppoſeth it, and that not onely at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but in the Churches of <hi>Galatia:</hi> how improbable is it that this uniformity ſhould be among them, unleſſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66015:58"/>
from ſome authority ſuperiour to the Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: then comming to conſider the denomination of the Lords Day, and concluding it to be the firſt day of the weeke, and therewithall concluding that ſixth Section: the ſeventh Section he begins thus; what then? Shall we affirme that the Lords Day is founded in Divine authority? and anſwers the queſtion thus: For my part (without prejudice to any mans opinion) I aſſent unto it, however the arguments like me not, whereby the opinion is ſupported, and ſo he proceeds in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of that which was affirmed by him, in the laſt place, concerning his private diſlike of ſome particular courſes taken to juſtifie it. He oppoſeth, I grant, expreſſe inſtitution; but if by juſt conſequence it may be deduced, it ſerveth our turne, both in the generall and in particular at this time and in this place, to diſcover the immodeſt and unreaſonable carriage of this Prefacer, who would obtrude the contrary opinion upon Doctor <hi>Prideaux,</hi> as it were, in deſpite of him; And indeed, it is thought that hee owed him a ſpight, and to pay that hee owed him, hee came to this tranſlation. But herein the Doctors honour is eaſily preſerved in the deſpight of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer; yet ſee a greater degree of impudency in this Prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. For he puts upon the Doctor, as if hee had ſhewed the alteration of the day to be onely an humane and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inſtitution, by the generall conſent of all ſorts of Papiſts, Jeſuits, Canoniſts and Schoole-men of ſome great <hi>Lutherans</hi>

And amongſt them that maintaine it, one, to wit, <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> profeſſeth it to be <hi>opinionem communem,</hi> not one avouched as affirming the contrary. And as for the great <hi>Lutherans</hi> this Author ſpeaketh of, loving to ſpeake with a full mouth, they are but one, and that <hi>Brentius,</hi> who is ſaid to affirme it to be a civill ordinance, and not a commandement of the Goſpel; a very ſtrange phraſe (in my opinion) to call it a civill ordinance; the ordinance being in force many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres before the Church of God had any civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own, and being in the Apoſtles dayes how could it be leſſe than Apoſtolicall? undoubtedly, not ſo much civill
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66015:59"/>
as Eccleſiaſticall. Wee grant willingly we have no expreſſe precept for it, yet <hi>Auſtin</hi> is bold to ſay (as wee have heard) that <hi>Apoſtoli ſanxerunt,</hi> yet <hi>Gomarus</hi> allegeth no paſſage out of <hi>Brentius</hi> to this purpoſe. But <hi>Melancthon</hi> ever (as I take it) accounted of better authoritie than <hi>Brentius,</hi> profeſſeth, as <hi>Walaeus</hi> reports him, that <hi>conſentaneum eſt Apoſtolos hanc ipſam ob cauſam mutaſſe diem,</hi> in plaine termes aſcribing the change of the day to the Apoſtles: As for the Remonſtrants, what authority have they deſerved to have with us, who are ſo neere a kinne to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who uttterly profeſſe againſt all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Lords Day. But the foure profeſſors of <hi>Leiden,</hi> have paſſed over this of theirs without note or oppoſition. And was not <hi>Walaeus</hi> one of the foure? yet what his opinion is himſelfe hath manifeſted to the world; yea, and his collegue, <hi>Thyſius</hi> alſo, yet no cauſe had they to oppoſe in this, when the other profeſſed it to be a laudable and good cuſtome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the patterne of the Primitive Church; and can the Primitive Church exclude the Apoſtles, and not rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them? And is it probable, that the Primitive Church preſcribed it to the Apoſtles, and not rather the Apoſtles to the Church? <hi>Tilenus</hi> calls it <hi>Eccleſiae conſuetudinem,</hi> not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it to be inſtituted by the Apoſtles, nay, elſewhere hee affirmes this, or rather that it was inſtituted by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. So little cauſe had theſe profeſſors to quarrell with this phraſe of the Remonſtrants, having weightier matters in hand wherein to oppoſe them. What if <hi>Bullenger</hi> call it <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae conſuettudinem;</hi> ſo doth <hi>Tilenus de praecept.</hi> 4. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 29. yet <hi>Theſ.</hi> 24. he profeſſed it to be not onely obſerved by the Apoſtles, but that it may ſeeme alſo to be inſtituted by Chriſt himſelfe: <hi>Bullenger</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſponte receperunt,</hi> to wit, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to an expreſſe Precept, as appeares by that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followeth; <hi>Non legimus eam ullibi praeceptam, we doe not reade it any where commanded. Urſine</hi> alleged in the next place clearely profeſſeth in the very place quoted by <hi>Gomarus,</hi> that God it is who hath abrogated the obſervation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, but he addes, that he left it free to the Church to chooſe other daies, which (Church) upon a probable cauſe, choſe the firſt day, which was the day of Chriſts reſurrection.

Whence it is evidently concluded, that the Apoſtles did not thinke it indifferent, therefore though it were left to their liberty, in as much as no Commandement was given to them thereabout for ought wee reade, yet by the ſpirit of God, they were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make choyſe of this day, and that in reference to ſuch a worke on that day, as the like on no other. Not that the ſanctifying of a reſt on this day would make us more holy, then the ſanctifying of a reſt on any other day: but onely in reference to ſome ſpeciall worke of God on that day: upon which conſideration the ancient Fathers doe generally inſiſt; and Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> after them doe joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rely, and not <hi>Beza</hi> onely. Secondly, That both <hi>Urſine</hi> and <hi>Paraeus</hi> call this a probable reaſon onely: now give me leave to inſiſt upon this, and try whether I cannot ſhew that this reaſon is more then probable. And that firſt <hi>à Poſteriori.</hi> For let us ſoberly conſider how came it to paſſe that not onely the day whereon Chriſt roſe, but anſwerably hereunto the Day of the weeke, to wit, the firſt Day of the weeke was accompted by the Apoſtles, and ſo commonly called the Lords Day; and generally knowne to Chriſtians by that name: otherwiſe S. <hi>Iohn</hi> had not beene ſo well underſtood in his <hi>Revelation chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. Is it not apparent that Chriſts riſing did ever after give the denomination of the Lords Day, to the firſt day of the weeke? Againe the day of Chriſts Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66015:60"/>
upon the Croſſe, is not called the Lords day; and why the day of the Reſurrection rather? ſurely becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that <hi>Chriſt was declared mightily to be the Sonne of God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>by the ſpirit of ſanctification in his Reſurrection from the dead.</hi> Hereby then was he manifeſted to be the Sonne of God, the very Lord of Glory; and is not this reaſon more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, why it ſhould bee called the Lords day? Secondly conſider, that day of the moneth or that day of the yeare whereon the Lord roſe, wee no where finde that it was uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called the Lords Day, but onely that day of the weeke; not the day of the weeke wherein hee aſcended into Heaven, but the day of the weeke wherein hee roſe. Now the Jewes Sabbath was called the Lords Sabbath, the Lords holy Day, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 58. 13. <hi>If thou ſhalt turne away thy foote from my Sabbath from doing thy will on my holy Day.</hi> Hath the Lord a Day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell, but no Sabbath, no holy Day? what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable conceite were this? that hee ſhould have an holy Day, one in every weeke under the Law; and none under the Goſpell? Now if the Lord hath a day that is peculiarly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his under the Goſpell, and that day is in the Scripture ſtyled the Lords Day; I appeale to every Chriſtian conſcience, whether the ſanctifying of this day as holy to the Lord, ought not by more then probable, yea even by neceſſary reaſon, come in place of the ſanctifying of the ſeventh day as an holy reſt to the Lord in the dayes of old. Otherwiſe we ſhould have two different dayes in the weeke, the one called the Lords Day, the other the Lords holy Day; or no holy day at all though wee have the Lords Day. Laſtly conſider the very definition of a thing probable, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes to be ſuch as ſeemes ſo in the judgement of moſt, or in the judgement of moſt of the wiſeſt, or of ſome few provided they are wiſer then the reſt; but the ſanctifying of the firſt day of the weeke to the Lord, that is, the Lords Day to the Lord, hath ſeemed fit not to ſome of the wiſeſt onely in the Church of God, but to all, even to all the Apoſtles, yea and Evangeliſts and Paſtors, and teachers in their dayes and to the whole Church, for 1600. yeares ſince; and ſhall wee call the reaſon moving them hereunto onely probable? 2. yet all
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66015:60"/>
this is but <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> which yet for the evidence of it, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume moſt ſufficient for the convicting of every ſober &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian conſcience of that truth, to the demonſtration whereof it tends; I come to give a reaſon hereof <hi>à priori.</hi> The firſt creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the wiſedome of God (who proceeds not merely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto probable reaſon) drew after it a Sabbath day, the ſeventh day where on God reſted. But if God vouchſafeth us a new creation in the ſame congruity, may wee not juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a new Sabbath? Now, the Apoſtle tells us plainly, that old things are paſſed away, and that all things are become new, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. and this he brings in upon ſhewing what Chriſt hath deſerved at our hands, in as much as he died for us, and roſe againe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. the end whereof was this, that he might be Lord both of quicke and dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. and concludes, that <hi>whoſoever is in Chriſt, is a new creature,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. And how are we in Chriſt, but by faith? <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. And what is the object of this our faith? let the ſame Apoſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer us, <hi>If thou confeſſe with the mouth the Lord Ieſus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in thine heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> ſo that this faith in Chriſts reſurrection, is to us the beginning of a new creature. And Chriſts reſurrection <hi>Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> calls <hi>naſcentis mundi primordium.</hi> And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaith, That as the Sabbath was the end of the firſt creation; ſo the Lords Day is the beginning of the ſecond creature. And this is it that Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> doe worke upon for the celebration of the Lords Day as by Divine inſtitution. But I am not a little ſenſible of ſome appearance of incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty riſing hereupon. Almighty God did not thinke it fit, that the firſt day of creation ſhould be our Sabbath, but the ſeventh from the creation, as whereon himſelfe reſted; but in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond creation, the firſt day is made our Sabbath. To this I anſwer two things; the firſt is this: if man ſhould not reſt unto God till the ſecond creation is finiſhed, hee ſhould not reſt at all in this world. And the ſixe dayes being the dayes of Gods worke; the ſeventh was the firſt of mans worke, which God would have to be an holy worke moſt convenient where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to take livery and ſeaſin of the world. For, albeit God commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to dreſſe the garden and keepe it, when
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66015:61"/>
he placed him in it; yet it is nothing probable it had need of dreſſing ſo ſoone as it was made; and no mention of reſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded at the firſt; onely it is ſaid, that becauſe God reſted that day from all his works, therefore he bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it. This I deliver to ſave the expreſſion of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> 2. But in my judgement, there is an exact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity betweene reſt and reſt in each creation. For, as God reſted the ſeventh day from the worke of creation; ſo Chriſt reſted the firſt day of the weeke from his worke of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was the meritorious cauſe of the new creation. For Chriſts dying, and continuing under the power of death, for a certaine time, I may juſtly reckon as one worke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; in which time hee ſuffered ignominy, not onely from the reproach of the world, but from the weakneſſe of his ſervants faith, whoſe voyce was, <hi>wee thought it had been he, who ſhould have redeemed Iſrael.</hi>

                  <p>As for <hi>Zanohy,</hi> in the place cited by <hi>Gomarus;</hi> hee confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>hunc diem ex traditione Apoſtolica eſſe, &amp; optimo jure ab Eccleſia retentum. That the Lords Day is (to be obſerved) by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall tradition, and by the beſt right retained by the Church—</hi>this the Prefacer in his wiſedome omitted; indeed hee ſaith, we no where reade that the Apoſtles commanded it: but left it free; but take with you the reſt, <hi>ita liberum, ut omnino ipſe dies ſanctificandus ſit, niſi charitas aliud poſtulat. In ſuch a manner free, that</hi> omnino, <hi>undoubtedly the day it ſelfe ought to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unleſſe charity require otherwiſe.</hi> I conceive his meaning is, and the meaning of all that uſe this language, that wee are to keepe it by no other obligation (not of ſpeciall comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement) than the reaſon of the day doth miniſter unto us, it being the day that the Lord hath made, joyfull to Gods Church by the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead; and in this ſenſe they ſay it doth not bind mens conſciences, to wit, as a Precept doth, whether we know the equity of it or no. And it were very ſtrange, that Chriſtians in keeping any holy day in the weeke, ſhould not make choice of the Lords Day for that, without any expreſſe commandement. <hi>Anetius</hi> ſaith no more than <hi>that Chriſtians changed the Sabbath unto the Lords Day;</hi> and can any man doubt, but that the Apoſtles
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66015:61"/>
were meant hereby? For which is moſt likely, that the practice and judgement of others was a leading cauſe to the Apoſtles, or rather that the judgement and practiſe of the Apoſtles was a leading cauſe unto all others? <hi>Simler</hi> hath no more but this, that he calls it <hi>the cuſtome of the Church,</hi> ſo doth <hi>Tilenus,</hi> yet he propoſeth it as <hi>likely to have had its inſtitution from Chriſt. Paraeus</hi> in the very place cited by <hi>Gomarus,</hi> aſcribeth the change of the day to the Apoſtolicall Church, and expreſſely ſaith, that the Apoſtle commanded the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to meet together the firſt day of the weeke, and make their collections. I wonder the Prefacer omits <hi>Cuohlinus,</hi> was it becauſe that which others call <hi>conſuetudinem Eccleſiae,</hi> hee calls <hi>conſuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Apoſtolicam?</hi> In the laſt place, <hi>Bucer</hi> is named by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer, but <hi>Gomarus</hi> is well content to omit what is delivered by him. But to the contrary, I will not forbeare to ſet downe what I find in his booke <hi>De Regno Chriſti, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. For having formerly deſcribed what are the true workes of holy reſts, added upon the backe of it; <hi>Eapropter, For this cauſe the Lords Day was conſecrated by the Apoſtles themſelves to theſe kind of actions. Which ordinance of theirs (inſtitutum</hi> he calls it) <hi>the antient Churches obſerved moſt religiouſly.</hi> Then he ſhews the cauſe why they changed the day: 1. The firſt reaſon given is, <hi>to teſtifie that Chriſtians are not obliged to the Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogie of</hi> Moſes <hi>law:</hi> 2. The ſecond is, <hi>to celebrate the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſts reſurrection, which was performed on the firſt day of the weeke.</hi> So that not one of the Authors mentioned by him makes any thing for him. And if the paſſages of the ſixe mentioned by him, and related by <hi>Gomarus</hi> did make any thing for him; we have no leſſe of the ancient Fathers to the contrary, as namely, <hi>Athanaſius, Cyril, Euſebius, Auſtin</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, to whom adde <hi>Sedulius operis Paſchalis, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. <hi>The glory of the eternall King illuſtrating</hi> (the firſt day of the weeke) <hi>with the trophy of his reſurrection, primatum cum religione conceſſum dierum cenſuit retinere cunctorum; thought good it ſhould have the primacy of all dayes granted unto it with religion:</hi> that is, with an holy celebration thereof.

As on the ſeventh day God reſted from the ſix dayes worke of creation, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of which benefit, the Sabbath was inſtituted in the old Teſtament: ſo in the firſt day of the weeke, after Chriſt by his death and paſſion had accompliſhed the myſterie of our Redemption, he returned gloriouſly as a conqueror from the dead, in remembrance of which benefit, the firſt day of the weeke is celebrated in the new Teſtament. 2. As in the old Teſtament the Sabbath was inſtituted, that it might be a memoriall of their deliverance out of Egypt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 15. So in the new Teſtament, the Lords Day is a memoriall of our ſpirituall deliverance out of the kingdome and captivity of Satan, procured unto us by the reſurrection of Chriſt, a type whereof was that deliverance of the children of Iſrael out of Egypt. 3. By Chriſts death and reſurrection, were abrogated Leviticall ceremonies and legall ſhadowes, amongſt which the Sabbath is reckoned, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. Therefore the change of the Sabbath into the Lords Dav, is a publique teſtimony that Chriſtians are freed from legall ſhadowes, and that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of dayes, which in ancient time was ordained Adde to him <hi>Melanchthon,</hi> alleged by <hi>Walaeus, pag.</hi> 265. affirming, that the Apoſtles for this cauſe changed the day, that in this particular they might give an example of the abrogation of

the ceremoniall Lawes of Moſaicall policy. As for our Popiſh Divines for which he referres us to Doctor <hi>Prideaux,</hi> it is apparent that more of them are alleaged for the <hi>jus d vinum,</hi> of the celebration of the Lords Day, then for the contrary; &amp; one of them, <hi>Silveſter</hi> by name, profeſſeth expreſly that his opinion, was the common opinion which was for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution of it.

For hee conſiders Chriſts reſurrection to bee as it were a ſecond crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a World ſpirituall, and thereupon doubts not but that the ſpirit of God did ſuggeſt unto them the change of the ſeventh day into the Lords day, as to bee conſecrated to Divine Service. 4. <hi>Iunius</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. writes that the cauſe of the change of the day was the reſurrection of Chriſt, and the benefit of inſtauration of the Church in Chriſt. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of which benefit ſucceeded to the commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Creation, not by humane tradition, but by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Chriſt himſelfe, and his inſtitution. 5. <hi>Piſcator</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 10. It is to bee obſerved that the circumſtance of the ſeventh day, in celebrating the Sabbath is aboliſhed by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66015:63"/>
Chriſt; as who for that day ordained the firſt day of the weeke, which wee call the Lords Day, and that in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Lords Reſurrection performed on that day. And upon <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 2. He makes this obſervation, <hi>By oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this ſtory, it is fit to conſider what was the religion of the Sabbath in the new Teſtament, and what place it hath at this day among us Chriſtians, and how it is to be obſerved. And firſt we muſt hold that the Sabbath is abrogated, by Chriſts comming as touching the ſeventh or laſt day in the week, and that in the place thereof is ordained the firſt day, which we call the Lords Day, becauſe on that day the Lord roſe from the dead, and ſhewed himſelfe alive to his Diſciples, and divers times ſpeaking with them of the Kingdom of God: aod ſo by his own example conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that day to Church aſſemblies, and for the performance of the outward ſervice of God. The reaſon of the abrogation is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ceremoniall reſt obſerved in the Law, was a type of that reſt, which the Lord made in his grave, as is perceived by the words of</hi> Paul Col. 2. 16. 17. <hi>Now of the apparitions of the Lord,</hi> S. John <hi>teſtifies</hi> Chap. 21. <hi>where he ſhewes how firſt he appeared to them gathered together on that very day whereon he roſe. And againe eight dayes after. Now that in theſe dayes he ſpake unto them of the Kingdom of God</hi> Luke <hi>ſhewes,</hi> Acts 1. 3. <hi>Whence it was undoubtedly that the Apoſtles obſerved that day by the Lords or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, to keep their Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies thereon—as it appeares they did</hi> Acts 20. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 2. <hi>And hence it was without doubt, on the Lords day</hi> John <hi>was in the ſpirit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved the</hi> Revelation. To the ſame purpoſe is that which Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> alleageth out of Piſcators</p>
                  <p>Aphoriſ. 18. <hi>It may be doubted concerning the Lords Day, whether it be appointed by God for his ſervice in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. My opinion hereof is this; although we read no expreſſe Commandement concerning it, yet that ſuch an inſtitution may be gathered from the example of Chriſt and his Diſciples. For on that day whereon the Lord roſe from the dead (therefore called the Lords Day) he ſhewed himſelfe alive to his Diſciples, and ſpake to them of the Kingdom of God. And</hi> Paul <hi>on that day in an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the faithfull met together to celebrate the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, preached to them on that day,</hi> Acts 20. 7. <hi>and that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>

                     <hi>at</hi> Corinth <hi>were wont to meet on that day for publique prayer, appeares</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 2. <hi>Now it cannot be doubted but</hi> Paul <hi>ordained that day amongſt them, as alſo the manner of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Lords Supper, and that according to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt,</hi> Math. 28. <hi>the laſt, Teach them (to wit, as many as receave the Goſpell) to keep all thoſe things which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded unto you.

Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> in like manner Biſhop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> in his Starre Chamber ſpeech in the caſe of <hi>Traske;</hi> hee not onely profeſſeth, that the Sabbath <hi>had reference to the old Creation, but in Chriſt we are a new Creature, a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo to have a new Sabbath; and that this new Sabbath is the Lords Day declared unto us by the reſurrection of Chriſt, for which he alleageth</hi> Auſtin Ep. 119. <hi>ad Ianuarium.</hi> But alſo for the confirmation of it ſaith it is deduced plainly by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; adding that theſe two onely the day (of the weeke whereon Chriſt roſe) and the Supper, are called <hi>the Lords, to ſhew that the word Dominicum is taken alike in both.</hi> Nay hee goes farther, as namely to alleage not onely practiſe but precept alſo for it; from the firſt of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Come to conſider ſomewhat in <hi>Walaeus,</hi> whoſe diſſertation of the Sabbath, from the firſt hath liked mee ſo well, and the ſpirit which it breathes throughout; that I doe not affect to differ from him; but rather heartily deſire there may bee little or no difference betweene us, and I hope in the end there will be found little or no difference of importance betweene us, eſpecially in this point of the inſtitution of the Lord Day whether it be divine or humane, and as for the originall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Sabbath, namely as from the beginning of the World, and as touching the morality of one day in ſeven; therein I concurre with him really and affectionately. And as touching the quality of the inſtitution; I approve his learned paines in vindicating thoſe three places of the new Teſtament, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. and <hi>Re.</hi> 1. 10. from the interpretation that ſome give of them, to quaſh the evidence which they import for the obſervation of the firſt day of the weeke, commonly called the Lords Day, even in thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66015:66"/>
and Apoſtolicall dayes of the Chriſtian Church. And I joyne with him, <hi>pag.</hi> 167. in admiring, that after ſo many accurate prejudices of the reformed Churches, concurring in the ſame tranſlation &amp; interpretation of thoſe places which we embrace; yet ſome ſhould be found to take ſo unhappy paines, as to quaſh the evidence of them which they ſeem to us plainly to import. A manifeſt argument in my judgement, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of that day, as in place of the Jewes Sabbath, in the very days of the Apoſtles, doth even convince their conſciences, that it can ſavour of nothing leſſe than Apoſtolicall inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which, becauſe they doe impugne, therefore they deſire to impugne the uſe thereof as nothing ſo antient as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Apoſtles themſelves. For conſider, I pray, how ſhould the converted Jewes come to change their Sabbath, if not by order from the Apoſtles themſelves, whoſe doctrine it was that Chriſt came to ſet an end to all ceremonies? And as for the ſubſtitution of a day in the place of it, that all did joyntly concurre herein without any dependance of ſome up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the judgement of others; what ſtrange ſtrength of convicting evidence muſt there needs be in the reſurrection of Chriſt, to draw them hereunto farre beyond Almighty Gods reſting on the ſeventh day from his worke of creation? What could be deviſed to inferre greater morality by the very light of nature than this, which ſhould be ſo forcible to move all to concurre herein, and that with the firſt. But if they received it, ſome from others, how improbable it is, that the Apoſtles ſhould receive it from the Churches, and not rather the Churches from the Apoſtles? Then conſider, we no where reade of any difference here-abouts among the Apoſtles, counting <hi>Paul</hi> amongſt them, who received from the Lord after his aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into heaven what he delivered unto others. How then came it to paſſe, that they all ſo throughly, and at the firſt, agreed herein? If, as having received it from the Lord, then the caſe is cleare, that it is of moſt Divine inſtitution: But if onely as drawne hereunto by the conſideration of Chriſts reſurrection on that day, being guided by the Spirit of God infallibly to order as other things, ſo the time of Divine ſervice, to prevent the danger of diviſion and confuſion upon juſt ground; even
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66015:66"/>
this is enough to manifeſt the ſtrength of evidence which the Lords reſurrection carrieth with it, as to convince them, ſo to appoint, and to convince others of the reaſonableneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſeeing all Churches did ſo univerſally and ſo earely yeeld thereunto, and ſince that time ſo conſtantly perſevered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The reſurrection therefore of Chriſt, is nothing inferiour to the Lords reſt on the ſeventh to draw us to the ſanctifying thereof: And the Apoſtles ordering it in this manner eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as his extraordinary Miniſters, is anſwerable to the Lords Commandement for the ſanctifying of the ſeventh, eſpecially that very commandement by juſt analogie having force alſo in this: And albeit <hi>Walaeus</hi> ſaith no more, <hi>pag.</hi> 174. of thoſe three places, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 10. than that the whole Church reformed hath conſtantly gathered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence <hi>Diet Dominicae uſum,</hi> the uſe of the Lords Day: yet both <hi>pag.</hi> 183. he doth manifeſtly imply the Apoſtles to have inſtituted it, where he ſaith, that <hi>quae ab ipſis Apoſtolis inſtituta non ſunt,</hi> ſuch things as have not beene ordained by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, were never in that manner obſerved in all Chriſtian Churches throughout the world, as the obſervation of the Lords Day. And before, <hi>pag.</hi> 172. he concludes, that the firſt day of the weeke was by the Apoſtles ſubſtituted in the place of the ſeventh, and commended to the Church, and that <hi>poteſtate ſingulari,</hi> by ſingular power; and as they were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Miniſters of Chriſt, put in truſt by his Spirit, to be faithfull in giving Precepts (marke this well) not onely touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith and manners, but alſo <hi>de Eccleſiae</hi>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66015:67"/>
conſideration of that which he delivers about the juſtification hereof, from <hi>pag.</hi> 152. where he acknowledgeth that among the ancient Writers and Doctors of the reformed Church, there have beene ſome who have referred the celebritie of this day to the fact and inſtitution of Chriſt. At the firſt, by <hi>Chriſts fact</hi> in this place I underſtood Chriſt apparitions to the Apoſtles, as they were aſſembled together on this day. But upon better conſideration and ponderation of the paſſages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged by him out of <hi>Auſtine</hi> and <hi>Cyril,</hi> I thinke rather that by Chriſts fact he means Chriſt reſurrection, or perhaps, btoh the one and the other. For the ſentence taken out of <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath reference to the one, and that out of <hi>Cyril,</hi> to the other. And Doctor <hi>Lake</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> in his <hi>theſ.</hi> 36. <hi>de Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bato,</hi> referres unto both; this firſt day Chriſt ſanctified not onely by his reſurrection, but by ſundrie apparitions before his aſcention, by ſending them the Holy Ghoſt. But the latter ſeem to depend on the former. And therefore, that learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in his defence of that <hi>Theſis</hi> 36. writes thus: <hi>I ſay not, that the Apoſtles imprinted any holineſſe upon the firſt day of the weeke, it was Chriſts reſurrection that honoured that day, which I ſay the Apoſtles were to reſpect, not arbitrarily, but neceſſarily, you may perceive the reaſon in my Theſis; you cannot obſerve from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world any other inducement to the inſtitution of feaſts but Gods worke done on the day.</hi> Now, neither <hi>Auſtin</hi> nor <hi>Cyril</hi> ſpeake of any inſtitution made by Chriſt. <hi>Euſebius,</hi> I confeſſe, doth intimate ſuch an inſtitution, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, and ſo doth <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſeeme to expreſſe as much, and <hi>Sodulius</hi> after him; but I am apt to conceive that they meant no other thing hereby, than that the conſideration of Chriſts reſurrection by the ſuggeſtion of Chriſts Spirit, ſhould move the Apoſtles to ordaine and eſtabliſh the celebration of this day unto the Chriſtian world. <hi>Junius,</hi> in my judgement, ſeemes to have no other meaning, when he profeſſeth the cauſe of the change of the day to be the reſurrection of Chriſt, and the benefit of inſtauration of the Church in Chriſt; it is true, he ſaith afterwards that the Lords Day ſucceeded the ſeventh, <hi>(Chriſti obſervatione atque inſtituto, by Chriſt obſervation and ordinance;</hi> but I underſtand thereby no other ordinance than
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66015:67"/>
is beſpoken by Chriſts reſurrection on the day and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the day. For anon he tells us, that the Lords Day was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>Chriſti facto, exemplo, inſtituto<expan>
                              <am>

                           </expan> Apoſtolorum, &amp; vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Eccleſiae obſervatione conſtantiſſimâ; by Chriſts fact, example, and by the ordinance of the Apoſtles;</hi> unleſſe <hi>inſtituto</hi> there, be to be referred to that which goes before, and ought to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from <hi>Apoſtolorum</hi> which comes after by a comma, though it be not. But let this be the opinion of <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Piſcator,</hi> which, perhaps, we may meet with ſome more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for than hitherto: Neither doe I ſee any neceſſity of expreſſing concerning every thing they taught, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it of the Lord; Neither doe I thinke fit to conclude, that whatſoever they ordered, they ordered by Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. But conſider, there is a great difference between things ordered by them: ſome were concerning particulars, others for the Church univerſall. Some ordered by them for a certaine time, other things to continue to the worlds end. The ordinance of the Lords Day concerned the whole Church; and to this day no Church throughout the world hath thought fit to alter it, a notable evidence that the Church generally hath conceived it, as an ordinance of the Apoſtles intended to continue to the worlds end.</p>
                     <p>The ingenuity of Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> is to be commended, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing ingenuouſly, that hee propoſeth his arguments not as neceſſary, but as probable, onely to inferre the inſtitution of the firſt day of the weeke to be obſerved by Chriſtians in place of the ſeventh, I would thoſe that oppoſe him would carry themſelves with the like ingenuity: nothing inferiour is the ingenuity of Doctor <hi>Walaeus, pag.</hi> 156. profeſſing that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion touching Chriſts inſtitution of the Lords Day, ſeeing it hath ſo great Divines as favourers thereof, is neither to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of novelty, nor eaſily to be deſpiſed as falſe, provided, that they themſelves doe not propoſe it as neceſſary, but as probable, nor inveigh againſt ſuch as are of another opinion or condemne them. Now, let us ſee upon what grounds he preferres the ſecond opinion, making the inſtitution of the Lords Day to depend upon Apoſtolicall authoritie before it. Therefore, firſt he urgeth, that the Apoſtles have given no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66015:68"/>
commandement as being charged thereto by Chriſt, nor Chriſt himſelfe. In briefe, thus neither Chriſt hath any where in Scripture commanded it, nor doe the Apoſtles any where ſignify that hee did: I anſwer, the Apoſtles doe not uſe to ſignify that what they deliver in particular was given them in charge by Chriſt; ſometimes they doe, but this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to the hundreth part of that they doe deliver. And it may bee by S. <hi>Iohns</hi> calling it the Lords Day, compared with that which our Saviour delivers in the Goſpell, pray that your flight bee not in the Winter, nor upon the Sabbath day; and with the denomination of the <hi>Jewes</hi> Sabbath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Old Teſtament the Lords holy day, wee ſhall finde ſufficient intimation of Chriſts inſtitution. Eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the queſtion is but of the circumſtance of a particular day, not of the proportion of time; and withall the analogy of the day of Chriſts Reſurrection to the day of the Lords reſt from Creation. And whereas the Doctor further ſayth, that it ſeemes not likely that Chriſt ſhould not command it, if he meant to binde us to the obſervation of any day, as a part of his worſhip and ſervice: Now I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what the worthy Doctor meanes to thruſt in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>as a part of Gods Worſhip.</hi> If the Apoſtles might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it as he thinkes they did, yet not as a part of Gods worſhip; why might not Chriſt command the obſervation of that day, yet not as a part of his worſhip? I am not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that when God at the firſt ſanctifyed the ſeventh day, hee made the obſervation of that day a part of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And it is ſtrange that the circumſtance of time ſhould bee an homogeneall part of Gods worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is true, the reſt on that day commanded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards might bee, and was as a ceremony preaching ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto them. All that is to bee conſidered in time pertaining to Gods Worſhip is the proportion of it; as whether one day in a weeke bee moſt fit, or one day in a moneth bee ſufficient; and this is of momentous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether wee conſider the advancing GODS Glory thereby, or our owne good, in a greater or leſſer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, But the particularity of the day in ſeven whether
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66015:68"/>
firſt or laſt or middlemoſt, this conſideration in my judgement is of no moment. Only for the avoyding of diſſention, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion we have neede of authoritative ſpecification, and that God did not define at the firſt without congruous reaſon, to ſtill all motion tending to alteration; and if we have as fayre evidence under the Goſpell for our Sabbath, as the Jewes had for theirs; wee are by Gods goodneſſe as much freed from diſſenſion and confuſion as they, and nothing the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſuperſtition, as making the obſervation of the day a part of Divine worſhip; which never was but in the way of prefiguration of ſomewhat in Chriſt, which kind of pedagogy is now quite out of date, neither is there any place for it in the obſervation of the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> his ſecond argument is, becauſe thoſe places of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. &amp; <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. in which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle takes away all difference of dayes can hardly bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with this opinion, or if Chriſt himſelfe not by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample onely, but by an ordinance commanded unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the obſervation of this day, it cannot bee imagined as it ſeemes, that any liberty ſhould now remaine in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of this day; for that which Chriſt hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is not left under Chriſtian liberty any more then the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the ſeventh day from the Creation was left free to the Jewes; when God not onely by his example, but alſo by precept ſeparated it from all other dayes to his ſervice. To this I anſwer, 1. I finde no liberty at all left to the Church to change the day, by the Doctors owne grounds, for hee holds it to bee invariable <hi>p.</hi> 168.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Hee profeſſeth the change of the day cannot bee attempted without the greateſt ſcandall of the Church, <hi>p.</hi> 169. Now what ſober Chriſtian would affect liberty to bee ſcandalous? 3. others who acknowledge the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the day by Apoſtolicall inſtitution, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to bee changeable and left to the liberty of the Church, doe withall maintaine that the Apoſtles did not command it as extraordinary Miniſters of Chriſt: but Doctor <hi>Waleus p.</hi> 172. acknowledgeth the inſtitution of it made by the Apoſtles as Miniſters extraordinary. 4. the Doctor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66015:69"/>
that the Apoſtles were entruſted by the Holy Ghoſt to give precepts concerning the good government of the Church, and that in this particular caſe, to make knowne to all Chriſtians every where what day in the weeke ought to be kept holy, and that by vertue and analogy of the fourth Commandement, and withall to prevent diſſenſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion amongſt the Churches thereabouts. 5. and laſtly hee joynes the precepts concerning this with precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faith, and manners; and this hee doth without ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying any the leaſt difference; nay, the word <hi>precepts</hi> is once propoſed as ſubſervient indifferently as to faith, and manners, ſo alſo to the well ordering of the Church, and that in this particular, of notifying unto all what day of the weeke is it to bee ſanctified to Gods Service. As for the places <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. I anſwer, that if wee made the obſervation of the day as it denotes a circumſtance of time, any part of Gods Service, or for ſome myſterious ſignification contained therein, then indeed wee ſhould carry our ſelves in contradiction to the places mentioned: but ſeeing we obſerve times onely out of reſpect to order and policy, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the edification of the Church; and God having always required one day in ſeven to be ſet apart for this, even when there was not ſo great need, nor had God manifeſted his love to mankinde in ſuch ſort as in theſe latter dayes; and of our ſelves wee are to ſeeke, of the particularity of the day under a fit proportion of time from the beginning of the World rquired, and hereupon were we left to our owne judgements, a way would bee opened to miſerable diſſenſion and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; what cauſe have wee to bleſſe the Lord for marking out a day to us with ſuch notable characters to make it our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and to honour it by his appearance amongſt his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles when they were aſſembled together both that day, and that day ſenight after; as alſo by his Apoſtles to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, and eſtabliſh it in ſuch ſort, that for 1600. yeares the obſervation thereof hath continued unto this day? which order of the Apoſtles doth carry pregnant preſumption that it proceeded originally from the inſtitution of Chriſt. The neceſſity of the Church Chriſtian requiring the ſpecification
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66015:69"/>
of the day for the preventing of diſſenſion, and confuſion as much as ever the neceſſity of the Jewiſh Church required the like; and over and above by reaſon of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement wee have now better evidence to conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence the obſervation of the Lords Day, by the congruity that Chriſts Reſurrection hath to the Lords reſt from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; better means I ſay to conclude ours, then they without a Commandement to inferre the obſervation of their ſeventh: forſtill the day of the Lords reſt is made the day of our reſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that which is alleadged in the third place, that both ancient and late writers doe maintaine that wee cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Lords Day, not as any part of Divine worſhip, nor as abſolutely neceſſary. For the firſt of theſe wee willingly grant; for as much as wee conceave the obſervation of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. by the Jewes was no otherwiſe a part of Divine worſhip, then as it was a ceremony and ſhadow, the body whereof was Chriſt prefigured thereby: and it is well knowne that no Chriſtians obſerve it in any ſuch Notion. But the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof wee hold to bee abſolutely neceſſary, and ſo doth Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> in holding it to bee invariable, and that it cannot bee altered without the greateſt ſcandall. And Doctor <hi>Lake</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath,</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> profeſſeth it to bee not, <hi>liberae obſervationis,</hi> but <hi>neceſſariae.</hi> And if it were free, then not to uſe this freedome at all doth manifeſtly give way to ſuperſtition in taking that for a thing neceſſary which is not, though not as touching the ſubſtance of Gods worſhip and ſervice, yet as touching a circumſtance thereof, ſuch as is the circumſtance of time. As for expreſſe precept, if hee meanes a precept expreſſely written, no man (I trow) ever ſtood for that, but if hee meanes a precept given by Chriſts expreſſe charge to his Apoſtles, no man that I have met with, ſaith more hereupon, then Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> ſeemes to affirme himſelfe; in ſaying that <hi>they were entruſted by the Holy Ghoſt as extraordinary Miniſters, that they ſhould bee faithfull ad tradenda praecepta, to give praecepts of faith and manners, and of the good government of the Church, and right order, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in this that might be known to all what day in the weeke was to be ſet apart for Gods ſervice; both by vertue and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>

                        <hi>of the fourth Commandement, and to praevent diſſenſion, and confuſion among the Churches;</hi> Neither doe we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any other celebrity of the day then this; and therefore doe no more affront <hi>Hierome</hi> then Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> himſelfe. As for feſtivall dayes in <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> I ſee no cauſe why as touching that they ſpeake thereof, the Lords Day ſhould bee comprehended under them: and as for apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall precept, concerning this Doctor <hi>VValaeus</hi> is as expreſſe as any. And it is not credible to mee, that the Apoſtles ſhould make ſuch an invariable ordinance to the Church, and not bee verily perſwaded that it was the Will of God the Father, and of God the Sonne it ſhould bee ſo: whether manifeſted by Chriſts particular charge unto them; or by comparing Chriſts Reſurrection with the Lords reſt from the workes of Creation. Otherwiſe in my judgement they had never called that day the Lords Day.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, he excepts againſt the argument drawne from Chriſts Reſurrection; denying that therehence it followes that that day was to bee conſecrated to God. But herein hee oppoſeth all the ancients; neither doe I thinke hee can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage any one that doth not hereon build the obſervation of the Lords Day; which nuiverſall concurrence doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly argue to be more then probable: <hi>Auſtin</hi> as <hi>Waleus</hi> alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him profeſſeth not as his peculiar opinion, but as he took it generally received without contradiction: <hi>that Dies Dominicus Chriſtianis reſurrectione Domini declaratus eſt;</hi> and that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſcitatio Domini conſecravit nobis diem Dominicum.</hi> And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> plainly takes notice of the analogy it hath to the fourth Commandement; (and analogy Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> grants, and I wonder hee takes no notice of it here) by comparing the ſecond Creation with the firſt Creation; and ſo Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> profeſſeth that the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires a new Sabbath, eſpecially ſeeing the old muſt bee abrogated as ceremoniall. But the analogy I confeſſe may be differently ſhaped; <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſhapes it thus, <hi>that the</hi> Jewes <hi>Sabbath was the end of the firſt Creation; and that the Lords Day is a beginning of the ſecond Creature;</hi> to wit, as the day of Chriſts reſurrection; in reference whereunto the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66015:70"/>
Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Old things are paſſed, behold, all things are become new.</hi> And I conceive reaſon to juſtifie <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in making the beginning of the new creature to be our Sabbath, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the end of the firſt creation, to wit, becauſe the ſecond creation hath no end in this world: Againe, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were made but the immediate day before the ſeventh, and the ſeventh he was to ſpend in rejoycing in Gods works; ſo Chriſts death was the worlds redemption; and immediately after, to wit, with Chriſts riſing, it was as fit we ſhould Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batize with God for joy of our Redemption. Otherwiſe the analogie (which Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> grants, but doth not expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate) may be conceived thus. The ſeventh day of the weeke was the Lords reſt from the worke of creation, the firſt day of the weeke was the Lords reſt from the work of redemption, in the morning thereof riſing from his grave; and in reſpect of Chriſts reſurrection on this day, what colour hath any other day of the weeke comparable hereunto, to make it fit to ſtand in competition with this. Yes, ſaith D. <hi>Walaeus,</hi> the Thurſday may, and that in conſideration of Chriſts aſcenſion on that day; yet Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> well knowes, that that day of the week was never thereupon called the Lords Day, either by the Apoſtles, or by the Church, as the day of our Saviors reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was. Againe, conſider Chriſts reſurrection and aſcenſion are to be computed but as one compleate motion; ſave that he was to ſtay ſome time by the way here on earth for the confirming of his Diſciples faith, and giving them commiſſion for preaching the Goſpel, and order to wait at Jeruſalem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they were endued with power from on high to carry the glad tidings of ſalvation all the world over. So Chriſts dying and continuing under the power of death, is but one worke of Redemption. He confeſſeth, that Chriſts reſurrection afforded an argument to the Church Apoſtolicall, to prefer this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others (very well, even before the day of his aſcention) for religious aſſemblies, as al the ancients teſtifie. But it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not therefore, that Chriſt by this his fact did inſtitute the ſame day to the ſame end. Now, this is a very ſtrange phraſe, by his fact on the day to inſtitute the day to ſuch an end. Tis well knowne facts doe not inſtitute otherwiſe than as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66015:71"/>
may be concluded that ſuch a day is to be kept; and in this ſenſe he doth as good as confeſſe, that Chriſt by his fact, did inſtitute; for the Apoſtolicall Church did hereupon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this day, as he confeſſeth all the ancients doe teſtifie. And did they not inferre this there-hence alſo, as moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Will of God? Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> proceedeth thus: <hi>So God in the creation of the world reſted the ſeventh day; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God had propoſed this reſt of his as an example, and confirmed it by precept, never had the Church of the old Teſtament beene bound as from heaven to the weekly obſervation thereof.</hi> To this I anſwer, that the like may be ſaid of the obſervation of one in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet ſeeing God did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand this proportion to the Jews, without any new commandement, we can inferre that ſurely God requires as good a proportion of us Chriſtians. In like manner, ſeeing God commanded unto them the day of his reſt from creation, we without any the like commandement, may better inferre that Chriſts reſting day from the worke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption ought to be our reſt, than they could, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ought to betheir reſt. 2. Man could not poſſibly have knowne how many dayes God was creating the world, ſo to know what day he reſted, that they might conforme unto him in their reſt; unleſſe God had revealed it unto them; but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God had revealed it, and withall had called it his holy day, and it were knowne unto them that one day in the weeke muſt be ſet apart as Gods holy Day, in this caſe I appeal to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian conſcience whether this were not ſufficient to conclude that ſurely the day of the Lords reſt, being his holy Day, ought to be the day of our reſt, and our holy day. Now, thus the caſe ſtands with us Chriſtians; we know what day our Saviour roſe, having finiſhed the worke of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; we know the Jewes Sabbath is abrogated; we know the proportion of one day in ſeven remaines ſtill to be conſecrated as an holy day to the Lord; we know the Lord preſcribed to the Jewes for their Sabbath his reſting day from the creation; which is called his holy day: And in like manner we know, that under the Goſpel, the firſt day of the weeke being the day of our Saviours reſurrection, is called by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Lords Day; as for Eaſter and Pentecoſt, the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66015:71"/>
caſe is nothing like; thoſe feſtivalls being not of ſingle dayes, but of whole weeks, once in a yeere, yet this proportion we find betweene them and the weekely Sabbath. There are in a yeere ſeven times ſeven weeks, and a fraction leſſe than halfe a ſeven; ſo that the memory of the creation was ſeven times in a yeere celebrated more than the memory either of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of Egypt, or, of their reaping the fruits of the land of Canaan, the one farre ſurmounting the other, yet their Eaſter began the day of the yeere whereon they came out of Egypt. And Doctor <hi>Lake,</hi> Biſhop of Bath and Wells, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 41. <hi>de Sabbat.</hi> profeſſeth, that <hi>God ſets out the day by the worke he doth on the day, the worke I ſay done, doth difference a day from a day:</hi> and Theſ. 43. <hi>Now then, when God doth any remarkable worke, then will he be honoured with a commemoration day for that worke. If the worke concerne the whole, by the whole Church; and by a part, if it concerne a part:</hi> and Theſ. 44. And <hi>his Will is underſtood often by his Precept; but when we have not that, the practice doth guide the Church,</hi> 45. <hi>This is a Catholique rule, obſerved in the inſtitution of all ſacred feaſts, both Divine and Humane,</hi> 46. <hi>The worke of the day is the ground of hallowing the day, whether it be weekely, monethly, or yeerely, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars evince in Scripture and hiſtory.</hi> The very light of nature doth give teſtimony unto this, as appeareth by the common practice of the heathens; as to give ſome inſtance hereof, what is the originall of the obſervation of the Fryday, as a feſtivall day amongſt Mahumetanes? ſurely this; on that day <hi>Mahumet</hi> fled from Mecha to Jethrib, and ſo that day is accounted the firſt day of his kingdom, and from thenceforth it was ordained to be the firſt day of their yeere and of their weeke. So then the Will of God, in the judgement of this reverend Divine, is manifeſted not onely by Precept, but by his Worke. And yet I know none ſpeakes more of Precept in this particular, than Doctor <hi>Walaeus,</hi> as I have often alleged him, <hi>pag.</hi> 172.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, I grant <hi>Iunius</hi> went too farre, in affirming that Chriſt did obſerve the ſame every weeke betweene his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and aſcention; but neither doth the contrary appeare by Scripture; undoubtedly the two firſt he did, and it is not manifeſt that the three following he did not; and though
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:66015:72"/>
                        <hi>Cyril</hi> inferres here-hence the reaſonableneſſe of our Chriſtian aſſemblies on this day, yet wee doe not; but as Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> concludes that which hee concludes not from any one place, but from many places together, that do we; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it any thing to the purpoſe that Doctor <hi>Walaeus</hi> obſerves of Chriſts appearing on other dayes, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. 24. once, which was at a fiſh meeting. And as little materiall is it, that at ſuch other times of his meetings he ſpake of the kingdome of God.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, On like ſort Chriſt ſending down the Spirit on his Apoſtles on the day of Pentecoſt, hath not ſo much force conſidered alone, but onely in a conjunct conſideration with Chriſts reſurrection on that day: And like as after his death he aroſe on that day manifeſting himſelfe mightily thereby to be the Sonne of God, ſo after his aſcenſion into heaven, he came downe by his Spirit on that day, the ſeventh, firſt day of the weeke after his reſurrection, manifeſting thereby as <hi>Peter</hi> ſignifieth that he had obtained the diſpenſation of the Spirit. We doe not ſay the Spirit was on the day of Pentecoſt ſent downe, becauſe it was the Lords day; But being ſent down on that day, as the Law is confeſſed to have beene delivered on that day, this tends to the marking out of that day more and more, for manifeſtation of the power of Chriſt. That day they receiving power from on high by the deſcending of the holy Ghoſt upon them, whereby they were inabled to preach the Goſpel. And that day of the weeke which is ſet apart for Divine ſervice as our Chriſtian Sabbath; as that day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Holy Ghoſt doth ordinarily come downe upon his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the miniſterie of his Word, and celebration of the Sacraments, and putting up of our joynt prayers unto him for the ſanctifying and edifying Chriſt body which is the Church: and even in this reſpect that day hath a farre better congruitie to the day that is to be ſet apart for Divine ſervice, than any other day in the week beſides. The day of his aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he departed from them as touching his preſence corporall, but on the day of Pentecoſt he came downe upon them as touching his preſence ſpirituall; and ſo he doth ſtill in our Sabbath exerciſes on the Lords day, though not in ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary a manner, yet no leſſe effectually to that edification and ſanctification of our ſoules.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:66015:72"/>
Seventhly, And whereas ſome urged that if Chriſt himſelfe had not inſtituted this day after his reſurrection, the moſt Primitive Church ſhould have beene left deſtitute of a certaine day of Gods worſhip, to wit, from the time of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the firſt conſecrating of the Lords Day, which they take to be abſurd, and I confeſſe, it ſeems unlikely that the Apoſtles tooke upon them to order ought untill they received the Spirit on the day of Pentecoſt, that being the day they were to receive power from on high, to execute the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. to teach all nations; till which time they gathered no Churches. For the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the former reaſon, it is added; That the Jewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was now aboliſhed by Chriſts death and reſurrection. This I doe not deny, but the Apoſtles might very well be ignorant hereof as yet, as not having received the Spirit as yet; yea, &amp; after the receiving it, we find they challenged <hi>Peter</hi> for going to the Gentiles to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. to this argument ſome anſwer, as <hi>Walaeus</hi> ſaith, that the daies between Chriſts aſcenſion and the comming downe of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, were ſpent in continuall meetings of the Apoſtles and other Diſciples. But from the day of Pentecoſt, the Lords day thenceforth obſerved. This anſwer reacheth not unto the daies interceding betweene Chriſts reſurrection and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention. And when I conſider Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> his diſcourſe, grounded, as he profeſſeth, upon univerſall obſervation (and which I find no reaſon to reſiſt) namely, <hi>that the worke of the day commends the day:</hi> If ever any day deſerved to be feſtivall to any, ſurely the day of our Saviours reſurrection deſerved to be feſtivall unto them, to rejoyce in the Lord thereon, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath</hi>

                           <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 118. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>made, let us be glad and rejoyce therein;</hi> the ancient Fathers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating the place thereunto. The two verſes immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preceding, carrying in the forehead of them a manifeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto Chriſt as the proprietary of their meaning. 22. <hi>The ſtone which the builders refuſed, is become the head of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> 23. <hi>This is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi> Now when was this manifeſted, namely, that <hi>the ſtone which the builders refuſed became the head of the corner,</hi> but by Chriſts
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66015:73"/>
Reſurrection from the dead, being thereby mightily declared to bee the Sonne of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and was there ever worke more marvellous in the eyes of Gods Servants, then the Reſurrection of Chriſt, eſpecially conſidering the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate condition of his Diſciples? <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 21. <hi>We truſted it had beene he, that ſhould have delivered Iſrael.</hi> The women departed from the Sepulcher, though with feare, by reaſon of the conſternation receaved from Angelicall preſence, their countenance being like lightning, yet with great joy by reaſon of the newes they heard from them of Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; upon the noiſe whereof (for they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to carry word of it to his Diſciples,) the Apoſtles as it ſeemes were gathered together; and in the evening after hee had ſhewed himſelfe to his Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> Chriſt preſented himſelfe in the midſt of them. Eight dayes after they were met together, and <hi>Thomas</hi> with them who being abſent the time before, gave out ſpeeches of peremptory incredulity concerning his Reſurrection; therefore then and not till then alſo the dores being ſhut, Chriſt came before them, and calls unto <hi>Thomas</hi> to ſee his hand, and to put his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into his ſide. Theſe apparitions of our Saviour twice on the firſt day of the weeke might well adde ſomewhat to the confirmation of them in the feſtivity of this day; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever betweene his aſcenſion, and the day of Pentecoſt they had their meetings, yet how improbable is it they ſhould put no difference; betweene ſuch a feſtivall and other dayes of the weeke. A ſecond anſwer <hi>Walaeus</hi> gives, namely that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, that from the day of Pentecoſt it was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the Lords Day ſhould bee obſerved: but that at the firſt the Apoſtles together with the Jewes obſerved their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath not as a ceremony of the Old Teſtament, but as a free circumſtance of divine worſhip, as for a while they retey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Circumciſion and difference of meats; which they gave over, after the Jewes were found obſtinately to refuſe the Goſpell. So that in theſe mens judgements the Lords Day was no feſtivall to the Apoſtles, till by occaſion of the Jewes obſtinateneſſe, a proper occaſion for the inſtitution of a new feſtivall. And give mee leave to differ from them in yoking
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:66015:73"/>
Circumciſion and difference of meats with the Jewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, neither of them prefiguring Chriſt as to come, like as the Jewes Sabbath did, prefiguring his reſt that day in the grave; as the ancients have conceived it, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction that I know. Had they permitted ſacrifices for a time, their compariſon had beene more congruous. I ſee no reaſon to withhold me from concurring with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and in him with all the ancients, for ought I know to the contrary, that <hi>Dies Dominicus Reſurrectione Domini declaratus eſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianis, &amp; ex illo coepit habere feſtivitatem ſuam,</hi> yea with the very words of Scripture <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 22. <hi>The ſtone which the builders refuſed is become the head of the corner</hi> 23. <hi>This is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi> 24. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi> Neither is it credible to mee that the Apoſtles were ignorant of it or of its application, to the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, from the very day thereof. <hi>Hereſbachius</hi> upon theſe words, <hi>Haec dies quam fecit dominus.</hi> They are (ſaith hee) the words of the people exulting in the Kingdome of <hi>David,</hi> moſt of all of the glorious Reſurrection of Chriſt, which of all others was moſt glorious to mankinde: as whereon Chriſt redeemed us in a triumphant manner, from the Tyarnny of Satan, and from everlaſting death, and reſtored unto us everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſſe. <hi>Arnobius</hi> interprets it of the Lords Day.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, the laſt argument, and which hee acknowledgeth of greateſt moment is that, which is taken out of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 10. Where the firſt day of the weeke is called the Lords Day, whence they conclude, that it is of the Lords inſtitution. And indeed Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in his Starre Camber ſpeech profeſſeth, that this denomination is given onely to the firſt day of the weeke, as called in Scripture the Lords day, and to the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt, as called the Lords Supper, and that to ſhew that the word <hi>Dominicum (the Lords)</hi> is to bee taken alike in both. In the ſame ſenſe wee call the Prayer which our Saviour taught his Diſciples the Lords Prayer. But let us heare <hi>Walaeus</hi> his anſwer, that we may conſider it. This conſequence
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66015:74"/>
(ſaith hee) is not neceſſary, for it may bee called the Lords, not onely that which is of his inſtitution, but even that which is made to the remembrance, or in the honour of him, or for his worſhip, as the ancients ſpeake, as the altar of the Lord, and feaſt of the Lord are often ſo called. And that in this ſence it was taken of the ancients it appeares by this, that the ancient Fathers both <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> called <hi>Temples</hi> by the name of <hi>Dominica,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. That which wee urge is the language of the Holy Ghoſt, now throughout the holy Scripture, it is not the language of the Holy Ghoſt, to call either Altars the Lords Altars, or Feaſts the Lords Feaſts, but ſuch as are of the Lords inſtitution. Neither doe the fathers (in my obſervation) call the firſt day of the weeke the Lordsday o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then in reference to Chriſts Reſurrection, as the cauſe of the feſtivall nature thereof. Temples indeed they call <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> as conſecrated to the Lord; but the denomination is not to diſtinguiſh it from other Temples; as the Lords Day hath its denomination to diſtinguiſh it from other dayes. But the day of Chriſts Reſurrection being called the Lords Day not as ſuch a day in the yeare, but as ſuch a day in the weeke, this to my underſtanding doth manifeſtly inferre the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of it into the place of the Lords day of the weeke amongſt the Jewes. Both ancient and moderne Divines doe hold it lawfull to conſecrate other dayes to the ſervice of of God, ſuch as wee uſually call holy dayes. But never any man (I thinke) was found that durſt call any of them <hi>Diem dominicum</hi> the Lords Day. Adde to this, wherefore doth our Saviour ſay, that the ſonne of man is Lord of the Sabbath, but plainely to conclude herence, that hee can diſpenſe with it, hee can abrogate it, and bring another into the place of it? and none hath power for this but hee who is Lord of the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, when he ſaith, pray that your flight be not in the winter nor on the Sabbath day, what is the reaſon hereof, but <hi>religio Sabbati?</hi> as all confeſſe <hi>the religious obſervation of the Sabbath;</hi> and did they underſtand any other religion of the Sabbath but as from Divine inſtitution?

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66015:75"/>
to prove that he maintained the day to be alterable, is nothing to the purpoſe, and as little doe they make for it which hee allegeth out of <hi>Muſculus.</hi> To find out what <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſaith hereupon, I turne to his <hi>Examen</hi> of the counſell of Trent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning feſtivalls; There <hi>pag.</hi> 154. <hi>col.</hi> 2. he ſaith, that Chriſt, to ſhow that he kept the Jewes Sabbath freely, and not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie;- againſt the opinion of neceſſity, touching the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Moſaicall Sabbath, hee taught both by word and deed. By word, in ſaying, that the <hi>Sonne of man is Lord of the Sabbath;</hi> and by his deeds, as in healing on the Sabbath day, and defending his Diſciples in plucking the eares of corne. Now, hereby I take it to be manifeſt, and acknowledged by <hi>Chemnitius</hi> that none hath power to abrogate the Sabbath, but he that is Lord of the Sabbath. And ſeeing even Chriſtians were to have their Sabbath, as appeareth by thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>pray that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day,</hi> which is delivered of the time about the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Temple by <hi>Titus;</hi> at what time <hi>Paul</hi> had ſuffered martyrdome divers yeeres before, by whoſe writings it doth appeare that the Lords Day was kept in place of the Jewes Sabbath, both by the practice of the Apoſtles, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Galatia and Achaia, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> acknowledgeth from the force of thoſe places, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. and <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 10. in the next columne it followeth, that the Lords Day was the Chriſtian Sabbath, and ſo to this day continueth, and conſequently, that none hath power to alter it, but hee that is Lord of the Sabbath, which is Chriſt himſelfe, it being accordingly called the Lords Day. Therefore if any pretend that Chriſt hath delegated this power of his unto the Church, it ſtands upon them to make it good. But <hi>Chemnitius</hi> proceeds, <hi>pag.</hi> 155. <hi>col.</hi> 1. and ſhewes how the Apoſtles at the firſt tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their weak faith, who without ſuperſtition obſerved dayes Moſaicall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and that ſuch as were ſtronger in faith, after the abrogation of the old Teſtament, judged all dayes to be equall in themſelves, and none more holy then another. We willingly grant as much, and adde the reaſon hereof; to wit, becauſe the holineſſe of the day preferred before his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes conſiſted in ſome myſterious ſignification which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66015:76"/>
unto Chriſt as to come; all which kind of ſhadowes, the body being come, are now vaniſhed away. Hee proceeds, ſaying. The Apoſtles alſo manifeſted by their example that in the new Teſtament it was free to come together, either every day, or what day ſoever they thought good, to handle the Word and Sacraments, and to the publique or common exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of piety. So the Sabbath day, and other feſtivall dayes they taught. All this wee willingly grant, but here-hence it followeth not, that one day of the weeke was not of more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary obſervation for the exerciſes of piety than another. Farther (ſaith he) that they might manifeſt that the exerciſes of Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies were not tied to certaine dayes: they daily perſevered in the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and in breaking bread, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and 5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Now we willingly acknowledge that we Chriſtians are not ſo bound to one day in the weeke, as namely, to the Lords Day, as that we may not have our holy aſſemblies more often than once, but onely ſo, that we may not keep them leſſe often, nor omit the celebration of the Lords Day: like as the Jews might not omit the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their weekely Sabbath, though ſometimes many dayes together beſides were kept holy by them. So we Chriſtians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo having our Sabbath as our Saviour ſignified we ſhould have when he ſaid, <hi>Pray that your flight be not in the Winter, nor on the Sabbath day;</hi> which Sabbath of ours, wee keepe on the Lords Day; though we may keep other days holy, yet we may not omit this; and if any ſhall take upon them to alter this Sabbath, we may be bold to demand of them <hi>quo warranto,</hi> by what warrant from the Lord of Sabbath? But <hi>Chemnitius</hi> proceeds thus: <hi>Now, whereas afterwards the falſe Apoſtles did ſo urge thoſe free obſervations of the Moſaicall Sabbath, and other feaſts, as by law, and with opinion of neceſſity, as to condemne their conſciences who obſerved them not. Paul forbad the obſervation of them.</hi> All which we willingly acknowledge, but that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they began firſt to ordaine another day in the weeke for their Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies and exerciſes of piety, which yet <hi>Chemnitius</hi> proves not, I leave it to the indifferent to judge; by comparing his opinion with that of <hi>Auſtins,</hi> who profeſſeth, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> well knew, <hi>that the Lords Day was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:66015:76"/>
                     <hi>unto Chriſtians by the Lords reſurrection, and from thence began to have its feſtivity,</hi> alleged by <hi>Chemnitius</hi> himſelfe, <hi>p.</hi> 156. eſpecially conſidering the reaſon moving the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereunto, which <hi>Chemnitius</hi> confeſſeth to have been on that day the Lord roſe from the dead. And ſeeing all feſtivals, as Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> obſerves, have beene obſerved in regard of ſome great worke done on ſuch a day for the good of man; whether ever any day brought forth a more wonderfull or more comfortable worke to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind than the firſt day of the weeke, which was the day of our Saviours reſurrection from the dead, let the Chriſtian world judge. This day <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſaith, ſeems to be called by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Lords Day, <hi>which appellation all antiquity did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards retaine</hi> and uſe: <hi>yet notwithſtanding</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we doe not read that the Apoſtles did impoſe upon mens conſciences in the new Teſtament the obſervation of that day by any Law or Precept, but the obſervation was free, for order ſake.</hi> Let us duly weigh and conſider this, together with the reaſons following: <hi>Calvine</hi> diſtinguiſheth the obſervation of a day for order ſake, and the obſervation of a day for ſome myſterious ſignification ſake: had <hi>Chemnitius</hi> thus diſtinguiſhed, we would have ſubſcribed thereunto, and confeſſed, that now adayes wee obſerve no day for any myſterious ſignification ſake, but onely for order ſake. And thus under the Goſpel wee are freed from obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of daies for myſteries ſake, not free from obſervation of one certaine day in the weeke for order ſake. As for his phraſe <hi>of impoſing the obſervation of the Lords day upon mens conſciences;</hi> this phraſe is moſt improper and unſeaſonable, in this caſe; it is onely proper and ſeaſonable in caſe the thing impoſed be of a burthenſome nature, like unto that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes of, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. ſaying, <hi>Now therefore, why tempt yee God to lay a yoke on the Diſciples neckes which neither our Fathers nor we were able to beare?</hi> Such indeed was the yoke of circumciſion; which provoked <hi>Zippora</hi> (according to common opinion) driven to circumciſe her ſonne to ſave her husbands life, to throw the fore-skin at her husbands feet calling him a bloody husband for urging her thereunto. But what burthen is it (ſave unto the fleſh) to rejoyce in the Lord, to ſabbatize with him, to walke with him in holy meditation? Was it no
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66015:77"/>
burthen to the godly Jewes to conſecrate one day in ſeaven to the exerciſes of Piety under the Law; and ſhall it bee a burthen to us in the time of the Goſpell? Or can it bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved to bee a greater burthen unto us to keepe our Chriſtian Sabbath on the Lords Day, then on any other day of the weeke? was there ever any day of the weeke markt out unto us with a more honourable or more wonderfull worke to draw us to rejoyce in the Lord thereon, then the firſt day of the weeke whereon our Saviour roſe, by his Reſurrection to bring life and immortality to light? yet we confeſſe we reade of no Law nor Precept for this in the new Teſtament, but, we reade that ever under the Goſpell wee muſt have a Sabbath to obſerve, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 20. And wee know, and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> knew full well, that it belongs to the Lord of the Sabbath to change it, and conſequently to ordaine it, and that it was changed, and the Lords Day obſerved generally in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles dayes, none that I know makes queſtion of; and how could this bee, but by the Apoſtles ordinance; and is it likely they would take upon them this authority without a calling? And why ſhould that day of the weeke (and not that day of the yeare) bee called the Lords Day, if not for the ſame uſe under the Goſpell that the Lords Day, was of under the Law, eſpecially that day under the Law (which was the Jewes Sabbath) being now abrogated? and laſtly wee finde it manifeſtly ſpoken of the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 24. <hi>This is the day that the Lord hath made, let us rejoyce and be glad in it:</hi> yet laſtly wheras <hi>Chemnitius</hi> will have it free, and hee hath already manifeſted that hee ſpeakes of it in this ſenſe, as not to be ſo tied to this day, but that we may obſerve other dayes; wee willingly grant that in this ſenſe it is free. Now let us conſider his reaſon following. <hi>For ſaith hee, if we are freed from the Elements, which by God himſelfe in the old Teſtament were ordained, and commanded, how ſhould we be tyed by the decrees of men?</hi> But alas this reaſon of his hath no proportion: the Elements hee ſpeakes of were but ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes the body whereof is Chriſt, and now Chriſt is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, they were wont to bee called not onely <hi>Mortua</hi> but <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifera.</hi> Yet the obſervation of one day in ſeven ſtill continues
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66015:77"/>
to bee the Commandement of God delivered not to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as ceremonies were, but by word of mouth proclaimed on mount <hi>Sina;</hi> and naturall reaſon ſuggeſts unto us that wee muſt allow unto Gods ſervice as good a proportion of time under the Goſpell, as hee required of the Jewes under the Law. Now if one day in ſeven muſt bee ſet apart in common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, what day is to bee preferred for this before the Lords Day, the day of Chriſts reſt from the worke of redemption in ſuffering the ſorrows of death; as the day of the Lords reſt from the Creation was appointed to the Jewes for their Sabbath; And this Reſurrection of Chriſt bringing with it a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Shall wee preferre the Saturday the Jewes feſtivall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, ſhall wee preferre the Friday the day of the Turkes feſtivall before it? ſhall wee affect power and liberty to make any other day in the weeke the Lords holy day, rather then that the Word of God commends unto us for the Lords Day in the time of the Goſpell?</p>
                  <p>This I ſuppoſe may ſuffice for anſwering the reſt alſo, whenſoever their ſuffrages ſhall bee brought to light, for I preſume none of them hath ſayd more then <hi>Chemnitius</hi> hath done. <hi>Azorius</hi> the Jeſuite profeſſeth of two things in this argument, that they are moſt agreeable to reaſon. Firſt, that after ſix worke dayes one entire day ſhould bee conſecrated to God, 2. that the Lords Day ſhould bee it. Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> in anſwer to the Remiſh Teſtament profeſſeth that <hi>to change the Lords Day and keepe it on Munday, Tueſday, or any other day, the Church hath no authority. For it is not a matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, but a neceſſary preſcription of Chriſt himſelfe delivered to us by his Apoſtles.</hi> This was printed in the dayes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and dedicated unto her Majeſty; what Biſhop as gouernour in this Church of <hi>England</hi> hath ever beene known to take exception againſt this? Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> (Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter)</hi> in his ſtarre Chamber ſpeech in the Caſe of <hi>Traske</hi> profeſſeth <hi>that the Sabbath</hi> (to wit of the <hi>Iewes) had reference to the old Creation, but in Chriſt we are new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, (As the Apoſtle</hi> S. Paul <hi>ſpeakes) a new Creation, and ſo to have a new Sabbath. And this</hi> he ſaith <hi>is deduced plainly.</hi> 1. <hi>by practiſe,</hi> 2. <hi>by precept, that theſe two onely, the firſt day</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:66015:78"/>
                     <hi>of the weeke, and the Sacrament of the Supper are called the Lords, to ſhew that</hi> Dominicum <hi>(the Lords) is alike to be taken in both:</hi> So that give power to the Church to alter the one, and you may as well give power to the Church to alter the other. He ſhewes alſo, it was an uſuall queſtion put to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>Dominicum ſervaſti?</hi> Haſt thou kept the Lords Day? And their anſwer was this, <hi>Chriſtianus ſum, intermittere non poſſum.</hi> I am a Chriſtian, and I cannot intermit it. Laſtly, he allegeth the Synod of Laodicea, <hi>Can.</hi> 29. acknowledged in that of Chalcedon, 133. that Chriſtian men may not Judaize, not make the Saturday their day of reſt, but that they are to worke on that day, giving their honour of celebration to the Lords Day. Doctor <hi>Lake,</hi> Biſhop of Bath and Wells in his Theſis of the Sabbath—39. <hi>The Church hath received it</hi> (the Lords Day) <hi>not to be liberae obſervationis</hi> (of free obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) <hi>as if men might at pleaſure, accept or refuſe it,</hi> 40. <hi>But to be perpetually obſerved to the worlds end: For, as God onely hath power to apportion his time: ſo hath he power to ſet out the day that he will take for his portion. For he is Lord of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> 46. <hi>The worke of the day is the ground of hallowing the day, whether it be weekely, monethly or yeerely, as particulars evince in Scripture and Hiſtory.</hi> 47. <hi>No man can tranſlate the works, therefore no man can tranſlate the day. This is an undoubted rule in Theologie.</hi> Adde unto theſe <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Piſcator,</hi> who maintaine the ſubrogation of the Lords Day into the place of the Jewiſh Sabbath, to have beene made by the ordinance of Chriſt; and <hi>Beza</hi> acknowledgeth it to be <hi>traditionis Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicae &amp; verè divinae.</hi> Doctor <hi>Brownde</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Sabbath, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 47. having recited the opinion of <hi>Iunius,</hi> referring the inſtitution of the Lords Day to Chriſts ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as who roſe from the dead on that day; addeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto after this manner. <hi>Like unto the which, becauſe nothing can ever fall out in the world comparable unto it in glory and power; therefore this day muſt continue in his firſt honour of ſanctification unto the end of all things, and no day be ſet up like to it, or it changed into any other day, leſt the wonderfull glory of that thing be darkned, and the infinite power of it weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I meane, the glorious and mighty worke of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

And this is it that is alleged as a reaſon of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of this day in the Apoſtles conſtitutions: It is called the Lords Day, becauſe it declares unto us Chriſt crucified and</hi>

                        <hi>Conſt. Apoſt. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 37.</note> 
                     <hi>raiſed up againe, and it is worthily commended to be kept as the Lords Day, that wee might give thankes unto thee, O Lord Chriſt, for all theſe benefits: for, ſay they, there is that grace beſtowed upon us by thee; Qua ſua magnitudine omnia beneficia obſcurat, which by the greatneſſe, and, as it were, by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it doth obſcure and darken all other. So that though the day was once changed upon theſe conſiderations, nay, they being ſuch as they be, it could, not but be changed: yet forſomuch as the like cauſe can never be offered unto men to move them to enter into this conſideration, therefore the day muſt not onely not be changed any more, but it muſt not ſo much as enter in mens thoughts to goe about to change it. And therefore I doe ſo much the more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell at him, who ſaith, That the keeping holy of the Lords Day is not commanded by the authority of the Goſpel, but rather received into uſe by the publique conſent of the Church: And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; The obſervation of the Lords Day is profitable, and not to be rejected; but yet it is not to be accounted for a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Goſpel, but rather for a civill ordination. And that the Church might have appointed but one day in ten, or foureteene for the publique reſt and Gods ſervice.</hi> Laſtly, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Perkins</hi> maintaines the ſame (not to mention Doctor <hi>Willet,)</hi> and that by divers reaſons, in his caſes of conſcience, which, becauſe they are modeſtly anſwered by Doctor <hi>Rivet,</hi> in his commentary upon the Decalogue, I thinke good in this place to take them into conſideration.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heir firſt Argument ſaith he, is taken from the appellation of the Lords Day; I ſuppoſe,  faith Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> it is called the Lords Day, as the laſt ſupper of Chriſt is called the Lords Supper for two cauſes. Firſt, as God reſted the ſeventh day after the creation, ſo Chriſt having finiſhed the worke of the new creation, reſted on this day from the work of Redemption. Secondly, as Chriſt did ſubſtitute the laſt ſupper in roome of the paſſeover, ſo hee ſubſtituted the firſt day of the weeke in roome of the Jewes Sabbath to be a day ſet apart to his owne worſhip. To this Doctor <hi>Rivet</hi> anſwereth after this manner. <note place="margin">Rivet. Anſw.</note>Firſt, hee denies  that there is the ſame reaſon of the Lords ſupper &amp; the Lords Day, and that for two reaſons; firſt becauſe we have a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt inſtitution thereof, and Chriſts Precept for the obſerving of it. Not ſo of the Lords Day. Secondly, if there were a Precept for keeping the Lords Day, yet were it Eccleſiaſticall and ſo mutable. For men may chooſe daies for the worſhip of God, as touching the particularity of this day or that. But the inſtitution of the Sacraments is of Divine authority by the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66015:79"/>
conſent of all. To this I replie that Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> corrupts Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> his anſwer in the propoſing of it; for he ſayth not the ſame is the reaſon of the Lords Supper, and of the <note place="margin">Repl.</note> day which wee call the Lords Day; but ſuppoſeth, and that moſt modeſtly, that either of them being called the Lords, they are called ſo in the ſame Notion. That like as the Lords Supper is ſo called becauſe he inſtituted it; ſo the firſt day of the weeke is called the Lords Day, becauſe hee inſtituted the obſervation of it. And this Doctor <hi>Thyſius</hi> collegue to Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> maintaines as well as Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in his ſpeech againſt <hi>Traske;</hi> ſaying that both theſe, to wit the firſt day of the weeke, and Chriſt laſt Supper are called the Lords, to ſhew that <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> (the Lords) is alike to bee taken in both. For what reaſon can bee given why the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, not according to the day of the yeare wherein hee aroſe, but according to the day of the weeke wherein hee aroſe, ſhould bee called the Lords Day, but to ſignifie, Firſt, that it was to ſucceed in the place of the Lords Dayunder the law, which was the Jewiſh Sabbath. 2. And that it was the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God and not of man, onely that it ſhould bee conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to his ſervice. For conſider, wee have many other dayes conſecrated by the Church unto Divine ſervice, which yet were never called the Lords Dayes; And the Lords Day and the Lords feaſts in the Old Teſtament, and in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Holy Ghoſt are no other then ſuch that are of the Lords inſtitution. Secondly, Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> omits the maine force of Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> his argument, or at leaſt ſlightly paſſeth it over, which is this. <hi>As God reſted the ſeventh day after the Creation, ſo Chriſt having ended the worke of the new Creation reſted on this day from his worke of redemption. Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> of old conſiders a firſt and a ſecond Creation; and ſo accordingly a firſt and a ſecond Sabbath: our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſpeakes of a Chriſtian Sabbath, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 20. and what ſhould that bee but the Lords Day under the Goſpell? And <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> worke upon the ſame. And I wonder that men ſhould thinke the Sabbath ſhould bee altered, and another brought into the place of it by any
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66015:80"/>
other authority then of him who is Lord of the Sabbath. And as Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> obſerves in all feaſts both Divine and humane that wee reade of in Scripture, the worke of the day was the ground of hallowing the day. And never was known to the World a more wonderfull worke in the way of grace, and mercy, then Chriſts Reſurrection from the dead, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting thereby the redemption of the World as then wrought by him How doth Chriſt take upon him to alter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments but as Lord of the Sacraments? and apparently he ſhewes that upon the ſame ground hee takes upon him power to diſpenſe or change the Sabbath, as hee is Lord of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. But what is his ground to deny the parity of reaſon here? meerely his owne prejudicate conceit <hi>that the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Day, is not ſo great as the obſervation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi> The contrary whereunto (ſaith he) <hi>omnes refugimus we all avoyd.</hi> But who and how many are thoſe all? what one of the ancients can hee produce to have thought as hee thinks? Hee may as well ſay according to the current of his private opinion, that wee under the Goſpell are not as much bound to the obſervation of one day in ſeaven as the Jewes were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law. It is true, that rigorous reſt enjoyned to the Jewes wee utterly diſclaime as well as hee; againe the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the day wee make no part of Gods worſhip nor to have any myſterious ſignification, as the Sabbath had to the Jewes. Wee acknowledge no other uſe of this day then for order and policy ſake; in which caſe wee judge it farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord ſhould preſcribe it, then wee unto our ſelves, leaſt if there were twenty dayes in the weeke, there would bee twenty differences amongſt Chriſtians about the ſetting apart of one day in the weeke for Divine Service.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> his ſecond argument is this, <hi>The Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>every firſt day of the weeke made a collection for the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Perkins.</note> 
                        <hi>poore,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 2. <hi>and this collection for the poore in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church followed the preaching of the Word, Prayer and the Sacraments as a fruite thereof,</hi> Acts 2. 42. <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the</hi> Corinths <hi>to doe this as he had ordained in the Churches of</hi> Galatia: <hi>whereby he makes it to be an Apoſtolicall, and therefore a Divine Ordinance. Yea that very Text doth in ſome part</hi>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:66015:80"/>
                        <hi>manifeſt thus much, that it is an ordinance and inſtitution of Chriſt that the firſt day of the weeke ſhould be the Lords Day. For</hi> Paul <hi>commandes nothing but what he receaved from Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> alledgeth the anſwer of Doctor <hi>Prideaux,</hi> demanding how that we contend for his inferred <note place="margin">Rivets Anſ. Reply.</note> herehence? we anſwer, the generall practiſe of the Church in the Apoſtles dayes argues it manifeſtly, that this order was eſtabliſhed by the joynt conſent of the Apoſtles; otherwiſe it is incredible it ſhould have beene ſo univerſally receaved, and perſevered in as it hath beene to this day. Secondly, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Jewes Sabbath was by divine authority, the abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof and ſubſtituting another day in the place thereof could bee done by no leſſe authority then Divine; which alſo wee conceave to bee fairely repreſented by the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Chriſtian Sabbath, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> calling it the Lords Day. Secondly, he ſheweth what <hi>Gomarus</hi> anſwereth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; but this anſwer himſelfe taketh off in this very place in part, and much more in his reply to <hi>Gomarus.</hi> But theſe places being granted to denote the firſt day of the weeke in the Apoſtles dayes ſet apart to Divine Service; hee ſayth it followes not herehence that <hi>it is called the Lords Day, as deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to Gods Service, much leſſe that ſo it was by Divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Yet <hi>Walaeus</hi> thinkes it his ſafeſt courſe to ſay tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lords Day as deſtinated to Gods Service, as before wee have heard, ſo to avoyd (as hee thinkes) the implication of Divine Ordination. But to him I have anſwered before. And Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> in my opinion doth not wel conſider that not the day of the yeare, but the day of the weeke, whereon Chriſt roſe, is called the Lords Day by S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> Like as the Sabbath in the Old Teſtament is called the Lords Day: which which if he had, and withall conſidered how ſtrange it were for us to ſet any day in the weeke apart for the exerciſes of Piety rather then the Lords Day; I am perſwaded hee would not have contented himſelfe with this anſwer. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many other holy dayes have beene and are ſet apart for Divine Service, yet never were called any one of them the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>He talkes of a bare cuſtome of the Church, for it; a thing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66015:81"/>
incredible that both Jewes and Gentiles throughout all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould ſo univerſally concurre without the guidance of ſome authorative conſtitution or ſome generally convincing evidence by the very light of common Chriſtian evidence or both. And as for liberty left to the Church hereabout, it ſeemeth ſo unreaſonable unto my poore judgement, that if it were, it ſhould become us by earneſt and hearty prayer to ſeeke unto God to take that liberty from us and bee pleaſed himſelfe to guide us by ſome manifeſt ordinance, to prevent diſſenſion and confuſion; yet well fare Doctor <hi>Rivetus;</hi> hee will not have this liberty extend any further then provided that ſome reaſon and neceſſity ſhould urge the changing of the day; for in the next columne hee profeſſeth that a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe of the change and abrogation of the day can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee given.—The obſervation of other dayes and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the Sabbath as well as the Lords Day by ſome in the Primitive Church, is no evidence at all, that it was indifferent unto them, whether they would obſerve the Lords Day or no.</p>
                     <p>The third argument <hi>Rivetus</hi> omits: the fourth is this. <hi>That</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Perk.</note> 
                        <hi>which was prefigured, in that it was prefigured was preſcribed: But the Lords Day was prefigured in the eighth day, wherin the children of the Iewes were circumciſed—therefore it was preſcribed to be kept the eighth day. This the ancient Fathers, by name</hi> Cyprian <hi>and Auſtin have reaſoned and taught.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> anſwers by denying the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Rivet. Anſw.</note> and ſaying, <hi>that no probable reaſon can be brought to prove that day was prefigured by the eighth day wherein children were circumciſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed that day being the eighth day after birth doth <note place="margin">Reply.</note> not ſo conveniently denote the firſt day of the weeke. But Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> his argument hath another part farre more principall drawne from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 22. 23. 24. Which Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> relates after this menner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The day of the Reſurrection was prefigured by that day, wherein</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Perk.</note> 
                        <hi>the Stone which the builders refuſed was made the head of the Corner. But that day was the Sabbath Day, therefore by the Sabbath was prefigured the Lords Day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:66015:81"/>
To this he anſwers, by denying that the Sabbath day was the day wherein the builders refuſed that ſtone; <hi>For the Scribes, Phariſes and rulers of the people did alwayes reject Chriſt, and not</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rivet. Anſw.</note> 
                        <hi>the Sabbath day onely. And if</hi> Auſtin <hi>and</hi> Cyprian <hi>before him apprehended any ſuch figure, that was by way of accommodation onely, not that herein they acknowledged any proper figure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For anſwer whereunto I ſay firſt; that Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers <note place="margin">Reply.</note> not this ſimply of the Sabbath day, but of the Sabbath of the new Teſtament, as much as to ſay, the firſt day of the weeke whereon Chriſt roſe; For this was the day wherein the ſtone which the builders refuſed, was made the head of the corner; and of this day the Prophet ſpeakes, when he ſaith, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, let us be glad and rejoyce in it.</hi> That like as the Jewes had cauſe to make that day feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall and to rejoyce therein, wherein God advanced <hi>David</hi> to the kingdome, <hi>who was as a ſtone, refuſed before by the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> in like ſort, Chriſtians had as great cauſe, nay, farre greater, to keepe that day feſtivall, and to rejoyce therein, when God raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and gave all power unto him, and making him the head of his Church, as being now manifeſted to be the ſonne of God, who was before as a ſtone deſpiſed and refuſed of the builders, but as on this day was made the head of the corner. And not <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> onely, but <hi>Ambroſe</hi> upon the Pſalmes ſo underſtands it, and <hi>Arnobius</hi> alſo upon the Pſalmes, as <hi>Hereſh bachius</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. And Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> is too blame in conſtruing <hi>Perkins</hi> in ſuch manner, as if he ſhould confine the builders rejection of Chriſt to the Sabbath day, whereof there is no colour in Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> but that which he inſiſts upon is this, that the day wherein Chriſt (formerly rejected by the builders) was made head of the corner, was the day of Chriſts reſurrection, and of this day it is ſaid by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, let us rejoyce and be glad in it;</hi> Which is moſt remarkable for the juſtification of our celebration of the Lords Day, as by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Divine authority. Eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what Biſhop <hi>Lake,</hi> that learned and pious, and moſt rationall Divine hath obſerved, that alwayes the worke of the day is the ground of hallowing the day, and for proofe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66015:82"/>
hee appeales to the due conſideration of all feſtivalls in the obſervation thereof, whether Divine or humane. Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> his words are theſe (but I know not how Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> might be deceived by a miſ-tranſlation of them) <hi>The day of Chriſts reſurrection was prefigured by that day wherein the ſtone which the builders refuſed was made the head of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> Pſal. 118. 24. <hi>and in that it was prefigured, it was appointed by God. For then it appeared to be true which</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid of Chriſt, that God had made him both Lord and Chriſt,</hi> Act. 2. 36. And whereas he ſaith the Fathers doe ſo conſtrue the place by way of accommodation, that hath place onely when the Text it ſelfe doth not ſo accommodate it. But the Text it ſelfe in this place doth manifeſtly evince, that this is ſpoken in reference to the day of Chriſts reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>The laſt reaſon of Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> is this: <hi>God is Lord of times and ſeaſons, and therefore in all equity, the altering and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Perkins.</note> 
                        <hi>thereof is in his hands, and belongs to him alone,</hi> Act. 1. 10. <hi>Times and ſeaſons the Father hath kept in his own hands.</hi> Againe, <hi>Chriſt is called the Lord of the Sabbath. And</hi> Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes <hi>is condemned by the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe hee tooke upon him to alter times: Beſides that,</hi> Daniel <hi>ſaith, it is God alone that changeth times and ſeaſons,</hi> Dan. 2. 4. <hi>Now, if it be proper unto</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>God as to create, ſo to determine and diſpoſe of times, then he hath not left the ſame to the power of any creature; And therefore, as the knowledge thereof, ſo the appointment and alteration of the ſame either in generall or particular, belongs not to the Church, but is reſerved to him. The Church then neither may nor can alter the Sabbath Day.</hi>

                        <hi>modeſtiſſimum,</hi> a moſt modeſt writer; ſo he carryeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt modeſtly towards him. But I hope without any breach of modeſty, I may profeſſe, that I find no accurateneſſe in each of his allegations, ſave one, namely, that wherein
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66015:82"/>
Chriſt profeſſeth himſelf Lord of the Sabbath; and it is enough for the preſent, that God reſerves to himſelf power of ordering times for his ſervice; yet it cannot be denied, but God hath left power to his Church, upon good occaſion, to ſet ſome time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for exerciſe of piety. But whereas it is apparant, that God himſelfe tooke upon him the ordering of the time for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and accordingly Chriſt calls himſelfe The Lord of the Sabbath; as he conſtituted it, ſo none but he can abrogate it, and ordaine another in the place of it. Now, whereas D. <hi>Rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> ſaith, that hee hath left this power unto his Church; it ſtands him upon to prove it. We find our Saviour ſuppoſeth us Chriſtians to have a Sabbath after his reſurrection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. as well as the Jewes had before: wee find that in the Apoſtles dayes, the firſt day of the weeke was ſet apart for this; which could not be, but by the joynt conſent of the Apoſtles, we find that the day of the weeke (not the day of the yeere) wherein Chriſt roſe, by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe called the Lords Day, an evident argument, that in his time it was ſo generally received. We find that never any worke of God did give better cauſe to profeſſe, that <hi>The day thereof was the day that the Lord had made, let us be glad and rejoyce therein;</hi> then the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt roſe from the dead, and thereby was declared to be the Sonne of God, even that ſtone which the builders refuſed to be made the head of the corner. And how ſtrange is it, that the Church for 1500. yeeres ſpace ſhould no where offer to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; if in no other reſpect, yet in this, to manifeſt that the Church is indued with ſuch liberty and power, and to prevent the ſuperſtitious obſervation of the day as a thing neceſſary, if it be not neceſſary. Laſtly, if this liberty be ſtill in the Church; in caſe they ſhould exerciſe this liberty, what inconvenience would follow upon the exerciſing of a lawfull liberty? But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit inconvenience would follow hereupon: for ſeeing this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is equally communicated to each particular Church, it will follow, that it is lawfull for our Engliſh Church to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the Munday, the French Church the Tueſday, the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers the Wedneſday, the Germans Thurſday, the Danes Friday, the Swedes the Saturday, and the Polonians the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; what an intolerable ſcandall were this amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66015:83"/>
Thus our liberty opens way to revive the Jewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or to concurre with the Turks, who make Friday their holy day, nay, what ſcandall alſo to all the Heathens through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world? For, ſuppoſe that as the Jewes keepe the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and the Turks their Fryday; ſo other heatheniſh nations according to their ſeverall religions ſhould divide the other daies of the weeke to be hallowed between them; each religion keeping to their own day moſt exactly: When they ſhould find no agreement amongſt Chriſtians, what an intolerable ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall were this unto them, to harden them againſt the profeſſion of the Goſpel, when they ſee ſo little agreement among the profeſſors of it? And what ſhould move us to affect liberty in this which opens a way to ſuch diſſention and confuſion; and not rather rejoyce in this, that to prevent ſuch miſerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, God himſelfe hath marked out unto us the firſt day of the weeke to be the Lords Day, in place of the Jewiſh Sabbath, which was the Lords holy day unto them, by the moſt wonderful and comfortable work that ever was wrought, even the reſurrection of our Lord and Saviour from the dead, thereby manifeſting him to be the Sonne of God, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling that prophecie of old concerning the ſtone which the builders refuſed, and making him the head of the corner on that day; all power being given unto him both in heaven and in earth. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. thus drawing us in the Prophets language to profeſſe and ſay firſt, <hi>This is the Lords doing, and it is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in our eyes:</hi> and ſecondly, to conclude there-hence in the words immediately following; <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, let us be glad and rejoyce in it;</hi> this undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is our Chriſtian feſtivall; this day of the weeke, and not this day of the yeere, (which is remarkable) being called by Saint <hi>Iohn, The Lords Day,</hi> the day wherein Chriſt appeared unto him, and gave unto him the booke of <hi>Revelation,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecrets of his providence to be fulfilled upon the world for the time to come, even till his ſecond comming to deſtroy the world with fire, <hi>and to bleſſe us with new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſſe;</hi> the metropolis of which new world, ſhall be new Jeruſalem. And albeit Doctor <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetus</hi> according to his pious ingenuity which crownes his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66015:83"/>
learning and cathedrall ſufficiencies, profeſſeth, <hi>that what hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath beene ſpoken by him of the choyce and poſſible change of that day; he hath not to any ſuch end ventilated, as to favour their profaneſſe who on holy dayes and chiefely on that day, which by ſo univerſall a conſent even from the beginning of Chriſtianity hath beene conſecrated to ſuch uſe, neglecting Gods Service, not onely refuſe to omit one day in proſecuting workes tending to the uſe of life temporall: but alſo by unneceſſary actions, as by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſports, ſtage playes, by intemperance alſo and riot profane the day, not without reaſon dedicated to the Lord.</hi> Yet what juſt occaſion hereby may bee in all places and like enough is taken in moſt places by this doctrine of his who ſeeth not? For albeit publike authority in ſome places hath by lawes countenanced the ſolemnization of the Lords Day; for which wee of this land have cauſe to bleſſe God ſo as I thinke no Nation more; in conſideration of many Lawes one after another and by degrees made to reſtraine abuſes on that day, as tending to the manifeſt profanation thereof; and by none more then by that act of Parliament in the firſt of King <hi>Charles,</hi> wherein all men are forbidden to come out of their Pariſhes upon that day about any ſports and paſtime, evidently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting hereby (as formerly hath beene proved) that all ſports and paſtimes are prophanations of our Chriſtian Sabbath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on that day, and that in the judgement of the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament conſiſting of the Kings Majeſty the head thereof, with his Lords ſpirituall (all the Biſhops of the Kingdome) and temporal, together with the Houſe of Commons; yet if once it ſhall be receaved according to D. <hi>Rivets</hi> doctrine of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that it is in the power of each Church to ſet apart what proportion of time they thinke fit for Divine Service, and what day they thinke fit, who perceives not that they may if they will, order it in ſuch a manner, as that twiſe a day they ſhall come to Church, and the reſt of the day ſpend as they thinke good, either in the works of their calling, or upon their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: And whence all this zeale (ſo oppoſite to holineſſe in the iſſue) proceeds, I know not, ſave onely to uphold the credit of <hi>Calvin;</hi> who profeſſeth <hi>that he doth not ſo regard the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeaven, as that he would tie any to the ſervitude thereof;</hi>
                        <pb n="144" facs="tcp:66015:84"/>
and yet I have endeavored to ſhew that neither this nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages taken out of his inſtitutions, makes any thing for them. And withall it is a wonder to behold how this of <hi>Calvin</hi> is taken up, and obtruded upon us, by them who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe hate both the name and memory of <hi>Calvin.</hi> And as for Doctor <hi>Rivets</hi> honeſt and pious inſtructions as concerning the duties and our demeanors to bee performed on this day, we may eaſily perceive how little worth they are and how eaſily they vaniſh into ſmoake, after that hee hath in the doctrinall part of the Sabbath layd ſo unhappy a foundation, and that by ſo poore reaſons and meane cariage of himſelfe, that as I verily thinke, throughout all his writings there is not to bee found the like.</p>
                     <p>For conſider whether hee had any hope to ſet ſo much as a face and outward ſhew of probability upon his diſcourſe, unleſſe firſt he had manifeſtly corrupted the adverſaries tenet, as appeares by his propoſing it, <hi>p.</hi> 119. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>By theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and other arguments drawn from Chriſtian liberty, it is ſufficiently deduced that they who maintaine the Sabbath day not ſo much to be taken away as to be tranſlated unto the Lords Day, and ſo changed, and doe indeed thinke it more holy (then another day) and that not onely in regard of ordination, and uſe, but in respect of ſignification and effect doe croſſe ſome without Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which is moſt certaine of the Papiſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed <hi>Walaeus</hi> makes it appeare that <hi>Calvin</hi> writes herein againſt the ſuperſtitious Papiſts. And did <hi>Rivetus</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſethem onely it were well; but it is apparant that hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes not ſo much againſt Papiſts in this argument as againſt Proteſtants, even ſuch as himſelfe. But can hee ſhew of any of them, that they account the Lords Day more holy then any other in reſpect of any myſterious ſignification (for ſo <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> ſpeaks in this place) of effect? undoubtedly he cannot. <hi>We obſerve a day in the weeke only for order and policy ſake Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall:</hi> myſterious ſignifications in dayes were peculiar only to the Jewes. Only we thinke it fit, that to prevent diſſenſion and confuſion, God ſhould marke out that day unto us to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and not leave it unto us, and ſo hee hath; the Scripture calling the firſt day of the weeke the Lords Day; and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ſuch a ground as a greater was never knowne to ground a feſtivity thereupon conſecrated to the exerciſes of piety, even the day wherein the <hi>ſtone that was refuſed by the builders was made the head of the corner; This was the Lords doing, and it is and ever ſhall be marvellous in our eyes,</hi> and gives us cauſe to ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> thereupon: <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will reioyce and be glad in it.</hi> So that all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Apoſtles writings againſt difference of dayes are no more againſt us then againſt Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> himſelfe. Now it is time to returne to our Prefacer. I doe not finde that <hi>Suarez</hi> undertakes to defend the Doctrine of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> (ſuch as here is pretended to bee their Doctrine) but rather oppoſeth it. If ſuch were their doctrine as this Prefacer would faine obtrude upon us, from the authority of the D. diſcourſe which hee tranſlateth. For <hi>Suarez</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>Celebritatem Dominicae diei haberi ex communi uſu &amp; ſenſu Eccleſiae &amp; in ipſa ſcriptura Novi Teſtamenti commendari:</hi> that the celebrity of the day is had by the univerſall uſe and ſenſe of the Church, and is commended unto us in the very Scripture of the New Teſtament; I have endeavoured to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it out of the Old Teſtament alſo; and in expreſſe tearmes, that it is to bee unchangeable <hi>Practicè &amp; moraliter,</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and morally; as Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> acknowledgeth, and withall expoundeth after his underſtanding of it; and Doctor <hi>Rivetus</hi> alſo affirming <hi>this kinde of unchangeableneſſe to ariſe from hence that no ſufficient cauſe can be given of the change and abrogation of it.</hi> This Prefacer and ſuch as are of his ſpirit may doe well to deale plainly, and to profeſſe that it is in the power of the Church to make the Lords Day to ceaſe to be the Lords Day.</p>
                     <p>From their Doctrine pretended by him hee proceedes to their practiſe, profeſſing it to bee devoyd of any the leaſt ſuperſtitious rigour; eſteeming it to be a day left arbitrary, and therefore open to all lawfull and honeſt recreations by which the minde may be refreſhed, and the ſpirit quickened; as in <hi>Geneva</hi> all honeſt exerciſes, ſhooting in pieces, long Bowes, croſſe Bowes are uſed in the Sabbath day, and that both in the morning before and after the Sermon; And truly I doe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:66015:85"/>
not finde my ſelfe prone to cenſure them for any ſuperſtition in this. But this author takes liberty to cenſure them for ſuperſtitious, who thinke theſe courſes unlawfull on the Sabbath Day. I make bold to call the Lords Day our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; becauſe our Saviour plainly gives us to underſtand that wee Chriſtians ſhould have one day in the weeke for our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>Ma.</hi> 24. 20. as wel as the Jewes had; and ſecondly becauſe the booke of <hi>Homilies</hi> profeſſeth that Sunday is our Sabbath. <hi>Nobis non licet eſſe tam diſertis.</hi> We may not be ſo elegant as to cenſure them for proſaning the Lords Day by theſe and ſuch like courſes. Yet the act of Parlament, 1. <hi>Caroli</hi> forbids any man to come out of his Pariſh on the Lords Day, about any ſports and paſtimes; which reſtraint tending to this end, namely to preſerve the Sabbath from profanation, doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly give us to underſtand that to come out of a mans pariſh on that day about any ſports or paſtimes is to profane the Sabbath: and ſeeing as before I have ſhewed, that to come out of a mans pariſh on that day about ſuch a worke as doth not profane the Sabbath, is not to profane the Sabbath, as to heare a ſermon, or to fetch a ſurgeon or Phyſitian to a ſick perſon in caſe of neceſſity; but onely to come out of a mans owne Pariſh about ſuch a worke as doth profane the Sabbath, ſuch a comming out of a mans own Pariſh on that day, and ſuch alone doth profane the Sabbath; hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth evidently that all manner of ſports and paſtimes on that day, are ſo many profanatious of the Sabbath in the judgement of all the Prelates of this Kingdome, and of the whole Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Now let every ſober Reader judge whether my ſelfe as an Engliſh man have not better ground from an act of Parliament to cenſure them of <hi>Geneva</hi> for prophaners of the Sabbath in the caſe here pretended then this Praefacer from the practiſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> by the relation of <hi>Robert Iohnſon,</hi> to conſure us that doe miſlike them herein (if this bee their practiſe) for ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious obſervers of the Sabbath; eſpecially conſidering that hee cannot faſten this cenſure upon ſuch as my ſelfe, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hee muſt paſſe the ſame, upon all Prelates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, together with the Lords temporall, and the whole
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66015:85"/>
houſe of Commons. And as for the exerciſes here mentioned, I finde them to fall wondrouſly ſhort, of that which the author avoucheth, as namely, that they eſteeme the Sabbath to lie open <hi>to all honeſt exerciſes and lawfull recreations;</hi> for I make no queſtion but in this Praefacer his opinion there are farre more exerciſes, and lawfull recreations then that of ſhooting which alone is here mentioned; and whereas ſuch things are permitted in the very morning of the Sabbath, and aſwell afore as after Sermon, I finde no thing anſwerable hereunto in the practiſe of our Church. Neither doe I finde that the exerciſes here mentioned are ſo much accommodated to the refreſhing of the minde and quickning of the ſpirit; as to make their bodies active and expedite in ſome functions which may be for the ſervice of the common Wealth. And lately upon enquiry hereabout I have receaved information, that at <hi>Geneva,</hi> after evening prayer, onely the youth doth practiſe ſhooting in Guns to make them more ready, and expert for the defence of the City, which is never out of danger.</p>
                     <p>They have alſo at foure a Clocke on the Morning both Service and a Sermon for their ſervants, and 2. more in every Church; the one in the fore-noone, the other in the After-noon, beſide <hi>Catechizing</hi> the youth on the Sabbath Day: And Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> wiſhed that ſuch a courſe were generall, as is in his Majeſties Court, to have a Sermon in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the ſervants on the Sabbath day. And I ſee no cauſe to diſſent from <hi>Gerardus</hi> in ſpecifying 4. particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Sabbath is not violated. <hi>Parva, Neceſſarium, Respublica, cum pietaete.</hi> Undoubtedly hunting is as commendable as, (and more generous exerciſe) then any of theſe, and the Kings Majeſty though much delighted herein, yet never uſeth to hunt on the Sabbath Day Morning or Evening. And I have cauſe to come but ſlowly to the believing hereof, becauſe it is <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine concerning the Sabbath, that albeit under the Goſpell we are not bound to ſo rigorous a reſt as the Jewes were, yet that ſtill wee are obliged to abſtaine from all other works, as they are <hi>Avocamenta à ſacris ſtudiis &amp; medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus, Avocations</hi> from holy ſtudies and Meditations;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66015:86"/>
and their Miniſters, I ſhould thinke doe not well if they faile to minde them hereof, unleſſe both they and the people are fallen from <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine in this point, in which caſe I ſee no juſt cauſe why any ſhould choake us therewith, but give us as much liberty to diſſent from him in the Doctrine of the Sabbath as they of <hi>Geneva</hi> take unto themſelves. Againe <hi>Beza</hi> is well knowne to have profeſſed upon, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 10. that the obſervation of the Lords Day is, <hi>traditionis Apoſtolicae &amp; vere Divinae,</hi> and conſequently that the day is not left ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary; neither hath this author proved that the <hi>Presbytery</hi> and ſtates of <hi>Geneva,</hi> both Eccleſiaſticall, and politicall have committed any revolt or apoſtacy thereto from <hi>Beza</hi> in this point. It is well hee acknowledgeth ſome recreation not ſuffered there, as namely dancing; but this hee ſayth they hold unlawfull, which ſimply delivered as by this author it is, is incredible unto mee, neither hath this authors word any ſufficient authority to deliver mee from this incredulity: yet ſome manner of dancing may perhaps bee generally forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the French Proteſtant Churches. <hi>This ſtrictneſſe-</hi>(the Prefacer ſaith) <hi>is noted by ſome to have beene a great hinderer to the growth of the reformed Religion;</hi> which belike is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged ſo much the more with us in as much as it is not hindred; but he quotes no author for that. As for the author he quotes, I have not hitherto found that hee hath arrived to any great authority or credit in the World for the truth of his relations. Neither hath the wiſdome of our Church or ſtate taken any contrary courſe hitherto either by Statute or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to promote reformation amongſt us; what they may doe hereafter I know not; when ſuch ſpirits as this Prefacer may bee ſo fortunate as to ſit neare the ſterne. Whether the French Churches have found it ſo as this Geographer is ſayd to report I know not; but for their judgment herein I muſt expect untill I heare more therof. </p>

are called Chriſtian; yet ſo it is, I skill not how it comes to paſſe, but ſo it is, that ſome among us have revived againe the Jewiſh Sabbath, though not the day it ſelfe, yet the name and thing. Teaching that the commandement of ſanctifying every ſeventh day, as in the Moſaicall Decalogue, is naturall, morall and perpetuall; that whereas all things elſe in the Jewiſh Church were ſo changed, that they were cleane taken away, This day (meaning the Sabbath) was ſo changed, that it ſtill remaineth; and laſtly, that the Sabbath was not any of thoſe ceremonies which were juſtly abrogated at Chriſts comming. All which poſitions are condemned for contrary to the Articles of the Church of England; as in a comment on thoſe Articles peruſed, and by the lawfull authority of the Church allowed to be publique, is moſt cleare and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; which doctrinalls, though dangerous in themſelves, and different from the judgement of the ancient Fathers, and of the greateſt Clerks of the later times, are not yet halfe ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate as that which followeth thereupon in point of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: For theſe poſitions granted and entertained as ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, what can we elſe expect, but ſuch ſtrange paradoxes, as in the conſideration of the premiſſes have beene delivered from ſome pulpits in this kingdome, as <hi>viz.</hi> That to doe any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile worke or buſineſſe on the Lords Day, is as great a ſinne as to kill a man, or to commit adultery; that to throw a bowle, to make a feaſt, or dreſſe a wedding dinner on the Lords Day, is as great a ſinne, as for a man to take a knife and cut his childs throat; that to ring more bells than one on the Lords Day, is as great a ſinne, as to commit murther. The author which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them all, was preſent when the broacher of the laſt poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was convented for it. And I believe him in the reſt; the rather, ſince I have heard it preached in London, that the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> whereby death temporall was appointed for the Sabbath-breaker was yet in force, and that who ever did the works of his calling on the Sabbath day, was to die therefore. And I know alſo, that in a towne of mine acquaintance, the Preachers there had brought the people to that paſſe, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baked nor roſt meat was to be found in all the pariſh for a Sundayes dinner throughout the yeere.

                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſomewhere ſaith, that he who lookes for miracles in theſe dayes for confirmation of the truth, <hi>Magnum ipſe prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium eſt, himſelfe may goe for a monſter;</hi> he doth not ſay; It is a miracle that men ſo ſhould doe. Men may be ſottiſh, even to admiration, and ſuch if this Prefacer proves; we will not ſay it is a miracle: <hi>mira,</hi> wonderful things may be wrought not only by the practice of Satan, but in the very courſes of men, but God is he alone that worketh miracles. He talkes of <hi>unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous concurrence of men of ſeverall perſwaſions otherwiſe in the controverted points of Chriſtian faith, and that both in judgement and practice with him in his way;</hi> he loves to ſpeake with a full mouth, and to make a great noiſe, as the Hogs in Aelian did, when their owner ſhore them; which gave him occaſion to ſay, <hi>That there was a great deale of cry, but a little wooll.</hi> And let the indifferent judge whether the wooll be anſwerable to the noiſe this Prefacer makes. Now, the men of ſeverall perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions whom hee avoucheth are Papiſts, and Proteſtants, and amongſt the Proteſtants, both <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> And hitherto he hath ſpoken of foure particulars; I deſire the reader would take notice of the modeſty of this author in each of them compared with the noiſe here hee makes concerning them; as if he were as much crackt in his braine, as hee who ſtanding upon the key at <hi>Athens,</hi> with a note booke in his hands, ſet downe every ſhip that entred into the road as his, when he was not owner of any one of them. So I ſhall make it appeare, that this Prefacer hath title to none of the ſides he boaſts of for the countenancing of his way in any one of the particulars mentioned. The firſt particular is about the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall inſtitution of the Sabbath; as whether God commanded it immediatly upon the creation.

Sina; And what ſtrength of ſuffrages doth he bring for this amongſt the Proteſtants, whether <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Calviniſts?</hi> Surely not one <hi>Lutherane</hi> that I know; but of others all that he avoucheth by himſelfe are but Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> and <hi>Goma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and by his aſſiſtance, <hi>Vatablus</hi> and <hi>Muſculus;</hi> on the contrary are alleged by <hi>Walaeus:</hi> 1. <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe: 2. <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius:</hi> 3. <hi>Calvin:</hi> 4. <hi>Beza:</hi> 5. <hi>Peter Martyr:</hi> 6. <hi>Bullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi> 7. <hi>Zanchius:</hi> 8. <hi>Urſinus:</hi> 9. <hi>Gualterus:</hi> 10. <hi>Areti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> 11. <hi>Bertramus:</hi> 12. <hi>Mercerus:</hi> 13. <hi>Antonius Fayus:</hi> 14. <hi>Iunius:</hi> 15. <hi>Zepperus:</hi> 16. <hi>Martinius:</hi> 17. <hi>Alſtedius.</hi> The ſame is juſtified by <hi>Rivetus,</hi> who voucheth no leſſe than thirty Writers of note to concurre in this; Now let the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judge on whoſe ſide is the miracle this Prefacer ſpeakes of, in his rhetoricall amplifications, on his ſide, or on ours. Yet not one Engliſh Divine is mentioned, either by <hi>Walaeus</hi> or <hi>Rivetus</hi> amongſt this number. 2. Then as for Papiſts: <hi>Toſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> indeed diſputes againſt this opinion of ours, but his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have anſwered; and <hi>Catarinus</hi> a Popiſh Prelate, as well as <hi>Abulenſis,</hi> is acknowledged by this Author to oppoſe <hi>Toſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in this; neither hath he or Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> undertaken to anſwer him. Onely this Prefacer, after his bold faſhion, ſaith, that <hi>Catarinus</hi> tooke up armes againſt <hi>Toſtatus</hi> with ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, it hath beene manifeſt that for ought doth appeare, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarinus</hi> hath had better ſucceſſe than <hi>Toſtatus;</hi> For <hi>Pererius</hi> takes <hi>Toſtatus</hi> his part, yet all the Rhemiſts on <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 10. doe manifeſt themſelves to take part with <hi>Catarinus,</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi> acknowledgeth as much of <hi>Marius.</hi> And <hi>Rivetus</hi> alſo allegeth <hi>Auguſtinus Steuchus, Genebrard, Iacobus Solianus, Cornelius de Lapide, Emmanuel Sa,</hi> and <hi>Ribera,</hi> all concurring againſt <hi>Toſtatus</hi> and all Papiſts, yea, many of them Jeſuites. Hereby let the reader judge of the modeſty of this Author; and on whoſe ſide the feigned miracle is, on his ſide, or on ours. For it is manifeſt hitherto, that <hi>the men he ſpeakes of, of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall perſwaſions otherwiſe, are by farre, more for us than for him.</hi> But it may be in this particular, his glory is, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are rather for his opinion than for us. But upon what ground? Is it from any evidence of Scripture? nothing leſſe, not one of them building hereupon; and as for evidences, they
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66015:88"/>
bring none, ſave that the Scripture doth not particulate, that the Patriarches of old obſerved the Sabbath. Yet it was not to be held a generall rule, that <hi>Argumentum non valet ab autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate negativè;</hi> the argument drawne from authority doth not hold negatively in matter of fact. Secondly, not onely our Divines, as <hi>Hoſpinian</hi> and <hi>Walaeus,</hi> that the meaning of the Fathers is onely this, that the Patriarches did not obſerve it after a Jewiſh manner, but <hi>Iacobus Salianus</hi> a Papiſt affirmes the ſame particularly of <hi>Tertullian;</hi> as <hi>Rivetus</hi> voucheth him in his anſwer to <hi>Gomarus, pag.</hi> 21. And it may be made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelfe, otherwiſe hee cannot be freed from contradiction, as who plainly manifeſteth his opinion in our ſide, as <hi>Rivetus</hi> citeth him; <hi>pag.</hi> 23. So that the Fathers alleged by our adverſaries, being rightly underſtood, make nothing for them; yet we want not variety of Fathers making expreſſely for us, and againſt them; and that grounding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon expreſſe Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. therefore <hi>The Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day and hallowed it,</hi> which our adverſaries have no other meanes to avoid, than by ſaying that it is ſpoken by anticipation; according whereunto the meaning of <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be thus; becauſe the Lord reſted the ſeventh day from creation, therefore he bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it, but would you know when? to wit, 2000. and 4. or 500. yeeres after. And laſtly, the dividing of times into weekes, proved to be the moſt ancient diviſion of times in the world, received by all nations, and made a feſtivall day thereupon; as many have moſt learnedly proved it, doe juſtifie the ſanctification of the Sabbath to have had its beginning and courſe from the very creation. So that in this particular wee have on our ſide both Scripture and reaſon, and Fathers, and the opinion of men of ſeverall profeſſions, as this author preſſeth it, both Papiſts and Proteſtants, both Lutheranes and Calviniſts; and this Prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer can lay no juſt title to any one of them in this particular. The ſecond point he hath inſiſted upon, is about the morality of one day in ſeven. For this he pretends, onely Papiſts in the firſt place, and not a Father throughout, (and as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> to the contrary hath profeſſed, that God from the beginning hath manifeſted, that on that day in the circle of the week muſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66015:88"/>
be conſecrated unto his ſervice) much leſſe Scripture. And it is apparant that God commanded that the proportion of one day in ſeven ſhould bee allotted to his ſervice; and it was never to bee abrogated, nor ever did any man deviſe any ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniality therein. And to this day it hath continued in the Church of God. To <hi>Toſtatus</hi> wee have oppoſed <hi>Azorius</hi> the Jeſuite; profeſſing that it is moſt agreeable to reaſon after ſix worke dayes to conſecrate one to Gods ſervice. Adde to him <hi>Stella</hi> upon <hi>Luke, Jacobus de Valentia, &amp; Dominicus Bannes.—</hi>As for <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that which hee accounts cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall in the fourth Commandement was expreſſed by him to bee not one day in ſeven, but the particulating of the ſeaventh day: But whereas he goes no farther in illuſtrating the morality of this Commandement then in ſaying that <hi>ſome time muſt be ſet apart for Gods ſervice,</hi> I appeale to every mans conſcience, whether the very light of nature doth not ſuggeſt that not onely ſome time but a convenient proportion of time ought to be conſecrated unto God; and when God hath manifeſted this to bee one day in ſeaven under the Law; doth not the very light of nature ſuggeſt, that wee ſhould ſin againſt God if wee ſhould not allow unto him as good a proportion of time under the Goſpell? And further if the Lords Day, be of Divine inſtitution amongſt us Chriſtians, is it not ſtill the Law of God even unto us, to allow unto him one day in ſeven? Now Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> himſelfe alleageth more Papiſts for this opinion than for the contrary, and one of them, to wit, <hi>Silveſter</hi> profeſſeth it is the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as <hi>Azorius</hi> voucheth him. And as for Proteſtants to ſide with him herein, hee alleageth none but <hi>Gomarius</hi> and <hi>Rivet;</hi> it may ſeeme by his carriage, that <hi>Vatablus</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd <hi>Muſculus</hi> alſo are for him in this, but that is untrue, they are alleaged by <hi>Gomarus</hi> on the firſt point onely as touching the originall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Sabbath. Now <hi>Rivet</hi> is oppoſed herein by his two Collegues, <hi>Walaeus</hi> and <hi>Thyſius;</hi> and whereas he takes upon him to anſwer <hi>Walaeus</hi> his reaſons to the contrary, and repreſent his owne reaſons for his opinion herein; I have taken into conſideration both the one and the other; and I truſt have repreſented the weakneſſe of his diſcourſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66015:89"/>
though otherwiſe a very learned and worthy Divine. Now <hi>Waleus</hi> hath not onely alleadged amongſt the Fathers <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, Clemens Alexandrinus, Euſebius, Auguſtine, Theodoret,</hi> but a multitude of Proteſtant writers, maintaining the morality of one day in ſeaven as <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, Beza, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Zanchius, Junius, Viretus, Danaeus, Fayus, Martinius, Urſinus, Alſtedius, Lornſegius, Feſtus Hommius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Engliſh and Scottiſh writers, whom he might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced more then enough: yea of Biſhops in this Kingdome; as Biſhop <hi>Babington,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Lake,</hi> yea and Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall policy. Now let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders judge by this of the modeſty of this Prefacer in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular alſo, and whether the miracle (as he phraſeth it) be on our ſide in diſſenting from others unreaſonably, or on his rather.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third particular is touching the celebration of the  Lords Day, as whether it bee by authority humane or divine rather: wee ſay it is of divine; hee will have it to be left ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary: yet was it never knowne, that any earthly Maſter did leave the proportion of ſervice, to bee performed unto him, to the pleaſure of his ſervant; neither did God leave it thus from the beginning of the World-untill Chriſt, as hath beene proved.

punctually, as they are alleaged by him. For it is confeſſed that the Church they ſpake of was the apoſtolicall Church; and the cauſe moving them to chooſe this day was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, and whereas ſome two of them call this <hi>Cauſam probabilem;</hi> I have diſcuſſed that, and prooved it to be more then probable. I have ſhewed withall how the ancient fathers have acknowledged it, ſome expreſſely divine, ſome equivalently, and expreſſely apoſtolicall conſtitution or ſanction, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> (whoſe reaſon drawne from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity betweene the firſt creation and the ſecond Creation by vertue of Chriſts death is remarkeable, and followed by many both Engliſh and outlandiſh Divines.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth and laſt particular is the mutability of the day which this Prefacer ſtands for, we on the contrary profeſſing  it to be unchangeable. Now the reſolution of this followeth upon the reſolution of the former; for this, onely names are produced both by the Prefacer and Doctor <hi>Prideaux.</hi> Yet I have endeavored to finde out <hi>Chemnitius</hi> his diſcourſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and enter upon a diſcuſſion thereof. <hi>Bucer</hi> I am ſure, alleag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Rivet,</hi> is nothing for this purpoſe. Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> directly oppoſeth it, Doctor <hi>Andrewes,</hi> Doctor <hi>Lake</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Doctor <hi>Brownde,</hi> Doctor <hi>Willet,</hi> Maſter <hi>Perkins.</hi> The Chriſtian Church anciently being demanded <hi>whether they had kept the Lords Day,</hi> were wont to anſwer; <hi>I am a Chriſtian, I cannot intermit it.</hi> Beſides I have ſhewed in reaſon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſſe both of changing theday, and the intollerable ſcandall that would follow upon it, and the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of not changing it, if it be not of divine inſtitution; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66015:90"/>
how prone wee are through the continuall obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof to conceave that to be a neceſſary duty, and ſo to be plunged into ſuperſtition, ere we are aware, if it prove to be no neceſſary duty.</p>
                  <p>In the next place hee tells us how that ſome amongſt us <hi>have revived againe the Iewiſh Sabbath, though not the day it ſelfe, yet the name and thing. Teaching that the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſanctifying every ſeaventh day as in the Moſaicall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue is naturall, morall and perpetuall; that whereas all things elſe in the Ieuiſh were ſo changed, that they were cleane to be done away, this day (meaning the Sabbath) was ſo changed; that it ſtill remaineth: and laſtly, that the Sabbath was not any of thoſe ceremonies which were only abrogated at Chriſts comming. All which poſitions are condemned for contrary to the Articles of the Church of England: as in a comment on thoſe Articles peruſed and by the lawfull authority of the Church allowed to be publique, is moſt cleare and manifeſt.</hi> Here wee have a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Jewiſh Sabbath brought in, yet not the day; a diſtinction contrived with ſuch wiſedome and perſpicacity as it ſeemes to exceed all humane diſcretion. For I verily thinke that from the beginning of the Primitive Church there was never heard of a Jewiſh Sabbath to be kept, any other then upon their day. The materialls are, firſt that the name Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is retained; and well may it be in my judgement (though ſome entertaine ſublime reaches to the contrary) if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour have any authority with us; who adviſeth his Diſciples to <hi>pray that their flight be not in the Winter, nor on the Sabbath day;</hi> which is ſpoken by him in reference to the time about the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> at what time the Lords Day was come in place of the Jewes Sabbath among the Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and that by apoſtolicall ſubſtitution. And in the very booke of our <hi>Homilies</hi> it is expreſſely ſayd that the Sunday is now our Sabbath. And his Majeſties briefes for collection ſo ſtile it. And in the conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court it was ſo ſtiled by Doctor <hi>Raynolds,</hi> and the motion he made thereabout generally yeelded unto; ſo that the State hitherto ſeemes to be cenſured by this bold Prefacer. The next aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, <hi>that the thing alſo is revived.</hi> But what thing? the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66015:90"/>
Jewes had peculiar ſacrifice both morning and evening which doubled the dayly ſacrifice; this ſurely is not revived. There were beſides two things in the Jewiſh Sabbath; the one was a reſt, the other was the ſanctifying of that reſt; As for the reſt, if that were not, it were no Sabbath. Yet our Saviour calls it a Sabbath, our Church calls it a Sabbath, our State calls it a Sabbath. And <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls us to ſuch a reſt on the Lords Day, as that therein we muſt <hi>tantum Deo vacare, tantum cultibus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinis vacare,</hi> onely reſt to God, onely reſt for divine worſhip. And <hi>Calvin,</hi> who is taken to be no friend of ours in this caſe, profeſſeth, that we muſt reſt from all our works, ſo farre forth as they are <hi>avocamenta à ſacris ſtudiis, &amp; meditationibus,</hi> avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations from holy ſtudies and meditations, but not for any myſterious ſignification ſake, and that herein conſiſts the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the Jewiſh reſt and our Chriſtians reſt; and I am exactly of his opinion for this: As for the ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this reſt, I truſt wee are as much bound to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance hereof, and that in as great meaſure, and with as great devotion under the Goſpel, as ever the Jewes were under the Law; And at the hearing of this Commandement as well as of any other, our Church hath taught us to pray, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keepe this Law.</hi> And I find it wondrous ſtrange, to heare, that ſome ſhould not ſpare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that this was ſhuffled in they know not how; At length wee come to the particular charges: the firſt is, that ſome ſhould teach, that <hi>The Commandement of ſanctifying every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, as in the Moſaicall Decalogue, is naturall, morall, and perpetuall:</hi> and Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> is quoted for this on the Article, <hi>Art.</hi> 7. hee quotes Maſter Doctor <hi>Bownde, pag.</hi> 7. Now truely, it cannot be denied, but that when the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is read unto us in our Congregations, wee are taught to pray unto God, to ſhew ſuch mercy unto us, as <hi>to incline our hearts to the keeping of this law.</hi> And both maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> and this Prefacer are to be preſumed to have ſubſcribed as well as others, and by their ſubſcription acknowledged that this is nothing contrary to Gods Word; that we are as much bound to the obſervation of this Commandement as of any other, and conſequently to keepe the Sabbath, and doe no
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66015:91"/>
manner of worke thereon that may hinder the ſanctifying thereof. Now Maſter Doctor <hi>Bownds</hi> words, (after hee had cited <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaking thus, <hi>I am hic ab initio &amp;c. Here now even from the beginning God hath inſinuated this Doctrine unto us, teaching us in circulo hebdomadis diem unum, that in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a weeke, one whole day is to be put apart for a ſpirituall reſt unto God,</hi> are theſe: <hi>Unto all which may be added, that for profe othat this Commandement is naturall, morall, and perpetuall; that I ſay may be added which was practiſed among the Gentiles, and all the Heathen.</hi> And now Do. <hi>Bowndes</hi> purpoſe unto the <hi>p.</hi> 30. is to be proved only this, <hi>that a Sabbath was from the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtill is to be kept,</hi> and that in the proportion of one day in ſeven; and after that proceeds to prove what day the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath ſhould be kept; his words are theſe <hi>p.</hi> 30. <hi>Now, as we have hitherto ſeene that there ought to be a Sabbath day, ſo it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth that we ſhould heare upon what day this Sabbath ſhould be kept;</hi> and here he ſheweth that this is not left unto the Church, but preſcribed by God himſelfe, as who preſcribed one day unto the Jewes, and another day unto us Chriſtians; but ſtill one in ſeven: The ſame was the opinion both of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall policy. Whereas both Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> and the Prefacer ſo carry the matter, as if by Doctor <hi>Bowndes</hi> opinion we Chriſtians were bound to keepe our Sabbath on the ſame day whereon the Jewes were bound to keepe theirs, which is moſt untrue, though the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement may be indifferently accommodated to our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sabbath as it was unto the Jewiſh Sabbath, ſave onely as touching the reaſon given, which hath expreſſe reference to the creation; but our Chriſtian Sabbath ſtands in reference to the worke of Redemption. Each is the reſt on a ſeventh day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſix dayes of labour, and as they were bound to ſanctifie their ſeventh, ſo are we bound to ſanctifie ours; and as that was reſted on, and ſanctified in remembrance of Gods reſt from the worke of Creation, ſo is ours reſted on in remembrance of Chriſts reſt from the worke of Redemption, ſo that our day of reſt is but tranſlated from the day of the Lord our Creators reſt, to the day of the Lord our Redeemers reſt. And on this ground might the Church juſtly teach us to pray at the hearing of this
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66015:91"/>
fourth Commandement; <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keepe this law.</hi> But like enough, both Maſter <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and this Prefacer might be of <hi>Brentius</hi> his opinion; that it is left indifferent to the Church at this day, to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with obſerving of one day in foureteene, if it pleaſeth them. But this was not the opinion of Pope <hi>Alexand.</hi> the third, who profeſſeth, that <hi>Tam veteris quàm novi Teſtamenti pagina ſeptimam diem ad humanam quiete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpecialitèr deputavit.</hi> Both the old and new Teſtament hath appointed the ſeventh day for the reſt of man, which <hi>Suarez</hi> thus interpreteth, <hi>That is, each Teſtament hath approved the cuſtome of aſſigning every ſeventh day of the weeke for reſt, which is formally to appoint a ſeventh day, though the ſame day materially be not alwayes appointed; and thus it is true, that that ſeventh day in the old Law was the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; but in the new, it is the Lords Day:</hi> now when we ſay the obſervation of one day in ſeven is naturall, our meaning is not, neither was it D. <hi>Bowndes</hi> meaning, that this <hi>proportion of time is knowne by the light of nature, to be that which of duty ſhould be conſecrated unto God:</hi> herein rather it becomes us to wait upon God, and he having defined it; now we ſay nothing can be deviſed by man more agreeable to reaſon than this; <hi>Azorius</hi> the Jeſuit, profeſſing <hi>it to be moſt agreeable to reaſon;</hi> And Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Broade</hi> voucheth him, ſpared not to ſay, that to him who knowes the ſtory of the creation, it doth appeare in reaſon, that one day in ſeven is to be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated unto God; onely let us not looke for reaſon demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative in matter of morality: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> long agoe hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that not demonſtration, but perſwaſion alone hath place in Ethicks; yet we may juſtly call that naturall, which from the originall was common to all nations; and that ſuch was the obſervation of the ſeventh day, the learned have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved. Secondly, if it be not morall, what ſhall it be? Is it judiciall, or ceremoniall? Never any man hitherto deviſed any ceremoniality in the proportion of one day in ſeven; well it may be poſitive; yet ſo, as to this day, from the beginning of the world, this proportion was never altered; and if I ſhould live till the day be altered by any ſober Chriſtian Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I thinke I ſhould live till the comming of Chriſt; which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66015:92"/>
the Chriſtians in <hi>Auſtins</hi> time conceived that it would be on the Lords day. I come to the ſecond charge which is this, <hi>whereas all things elſe in the Iewiſh Church were ſo changed, that they were cleane taken away; this day (meaning the Sabbath) was ſo changed, that it ſtill remaineth;</hi> and for this Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> quotes Doct. <hi>Bownde, p.</hi> 20. onely Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> ſaith, <hi>not that all things were changed,</hi> as the Prefacer doth, <hi>but onely that all Iewiſh things were changed,</hi> now judge whether Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> might not have oppoſed Doctor <hi>Andrews</hi> as well as Doctor <hi>Bownde.</hi> For in his Catechet. doctrine, <hi>pag.</hi> 209. having propoſed this queſtion. <hi>But is not the Sabbath a ceremony, and ſo abrogated by Chriſt?</hi> He anſwers it in this manner: <hi>Doe as Chriſt did in the cauſe of divorce, looke whether it were ſo from the beginning; now the beginning of the Sabbath was in Paradiſe before there was any ſinne, and ſo before there needed any Saviour; and ſo before there was any ceremony or figure of a Saviour. And if they ſay it prefigured the reſt that we ſhall have from our ſinnes in Chriſt, we grant it, and therefore the day is not changed, but yet no cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony proved.</hi> Hee proceeds to prove that it was no ceremony: firſt from the Law; ſecondly from the Goſpel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4. thus: <hi>All ceremonies were ended in Chriſt, but ſo was not the Sabbath; For,</hi> Matth. 24. 20. <hi>Chriſt bids them pray, that their viſitation be not on the Sabbath day: ſo that there muſt needs be a Sabbath after Chriſts death.</hi> Now, what doth Doctor <hi>Bownde</hi> affirme forty yeeres agoe, which Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> did not in his pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of Catecheticall doctrine? I come to the third and laſt: <hi>That the Sabbath was not any of thoſe ceremonies which were juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abrogated at Chriſts comming.</hi> This very point Doctor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> maintaines by divers arguments, as well as D. <hi>Bownde,</hi> which yet is rightly to be underſtood, to wit, not of the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſeventh day from the creation; but of the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of one day in ſeven. So that in M. <hi>Rogers</hi> his <hi>Brentian</hi> judgement in this particular, Doctor <hi>Andrewes,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became Biſhop of Wincheſter, might be accounted a Sabbatarian as well as D. <hi>Bownde.</hi> All theſe poſitions the Prefacer ſaith, <hi>are condemned for contrary to the Articles of the Church of England;</hi> but by whom condemned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> by none but by M. <hi>Rogers;</hi> and by the ſame reaſon he might ſay that the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66015:92"/>
doctrine of Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> was <hi>condemned alſo for contrary to the doctrine of the Church of England,</hi> to wit, by M. <hi>Rogers.</hi> And conſider his abſurd inference from the ſeventh Article of the Church of England; The Article ſaith that <hi>Chriſtians are not bound at all to the obſervation of Iudaicall ceremonies;</hi> Hence he inferres, that they whom he calls, <hi>Our home Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> are adverſaries to this truth in part, namely, in as much as they deny the Sabbath to be a ceremony: But doth our Church affirme the Sabbath to be a ceremony? Nothing leſſe; this M. <hi>Rogers,</hi> of his owne head, layes downe for a principle, namely, that the Sabbath was a ceremony, to obtrude upon us, as if himſelfe had as much authority as a whole Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And D. <hi>Andrewes</hi> takes upon him to diſprove this very point (which <hi>Rogers</hi> ſuppoſeth as a principle) and that by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious arguments: Belike D. <hi>Andrewes</hi> deſerved not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt <hi>the greateſt Clerks of theſe later times,</hi> nor D. <hi>Lake</hi> neither; nor Biſhop <hi>Babington;</hi> And as for the judgement of the ancient Fathers, it appeares what skil the Prefacer hath in them, and what reſpect he beares unto them, by the learning he hath bewrayed in this preface. Had he found in them, how much the forbidding of dancing in their dayes, did hinder the growth of Chriſtian Religion, we ſhould have heard of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, as well as how it hath hindred the growth of the reformed Religion in France out of <hi>Heylins Geography:</hi> yet their doctrinalls (which I have ſhewed to be the doctrinalls of Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> as well as of Doctor <hi>Bownde,</hi> yea, and could ſhew it to be the doctrine of divers other late Biſhops in this Church) <hi>though dangerous in themſelves, not half ſo deſperate as that which followeth thereupon in practice.</hi> Divers particulars whereof he reciteth out of the ſame Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> his preface, to his comment upon the Articles of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. And indeed, this Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> glorieth there, <hi>Pyrgopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynices-like, that he hath beene the man and the meanes that theſe Sabbatarian errours and impieties were brought into light and knowledge of the State;</hi> ſo he ſpeakes; <hi>and that this is a comfort to his ſoule, and would be to his dying day.</hi> And in very deed, the particulars mentioned by him, are very foule; for hee ſaith, <hi>It was preached in a market towne in Oxfordſhire, that to doe</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:66015:93"/>
                     <hi>any ſervile worke or buſineſſe on the Lords Day, is as great a ſinne as to kill a man, or commit adultery.</hi> Secondly, <hi>It was preached in Summerſetſhire, that to throw a bowle on the Sabbath day, is as great a ſinne as to kill a man; that it was preached in Norfolke, that to make a feaſt or wedding-dinner on the Lords Day, is as great a ſinne as for a father to take a knife and cut his childs throat.</hi> I wonder the Prefacer doth not call them miracles; Sommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire is a pretty large County; and there be many market townes in Oxfordſhire; and I doe not doubt but there are many pariſhes in Norfolke; But no particular is here ſet downe, either of perſon or of place; and wee have no better authority for the proofe of theſe imputations than this mans word, which yet undoubtedly was not preſent at theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: for then he would have beene very carefull to expreſſe that, as in the next ſtory hee doth the like. So that in the iſſue, the ſtrength of all comes but to this, that he hath heard it thus reported. Now, I have heard it preached, and that at Saint <hi>Maries</hi> in Oxford, that a man in Bunbury, or thereabouts, having broken a bone, his ſonne refuſed to goe for a Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetter, becauſe it was the Lords Day, and this Sermon, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards comming into print, the party finding himſelfe agrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this ſcandalous report caſt forth of him, repaired to the quarter Seſſions holden at Oxford, and complained to the Juſtices of the wrong that was done unto him; the Preacher of that Sermon being by, and the whole matter being opened, and the contrary juſtified; the preacher profeſſed, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered no more than he had heard, but promiſed the next time that he printed that Sermon, hee would leave that ſtory out. Doctor <hi>Hoskins</hi> of our houſe was preſent at the hearing of this buſineſſe, and brought us word of it. But whether that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ever came to be printed a ſecond time, I know not. In like ſort, I have heard it reported of Maſter <hi>Bolton,</hi> that when one fell into the River on the Sabbath day, he would not ſuffer thoſe that were with him, being neere to runne to helpe him out: I profeſſed at the hearing of it, I knew Maſter <hi>Bolton</hi> ſo well, that it ſeemed uncredible to me, but the reporter profeſſed to deliver it upon knowledge. But if it were ſo, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there be that can beare witneſſe thereunto in the place
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66015:93"/>
where he lived. Lately, it hath beene brought unto mee, that one hath beene heard to lay to my charge behind my backe, that I ſhould ſay, <hi>David</hi> ſinned more in dancing about the Arke, than either in deflouring <hi>Bathſhebath,</hi> or killing <hi>Uriah;</hi> though it is ſuch a compariſon that never entered into my thoughts, how much leſſe to paſſe ſo prodigious a judgement upon the compariſon? In the laſt place, he ſaith, <hi>It was preached in Suffolke,</hi> (and that he could name the man, and was preſent when he was convented before his ordinary for preaching the ſame) that <hi>to ring more bels than one upon the Lords day to call the people unto Church, is as great a ſinne, as to commit murther; this is more particular than the reſt;</hi> and had hee added one thing more, the evidence had been compleat, namely, that as he ſaith, <hi>he was convented for it before his Ordinary,</hi> ſo he was found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of it; which if it were ſo, I wonder he ſhould conceale it; if it were not ſo, of what credit is this his relation? He addes, <hi>that many things to this effect he had read before in the Sabbath doctrine, printed at London for</hi> I. Porter <hi>and</hi> Tho. Man, what this booke was I could not deviſe, but lately have gotten into my hands D. <hi>Bowndes</hi> booke of the Sabbath. I finde by comparing it well, that this is the booke he girds at. Now I finde nothing in him to this effect, though I have gone over moſt of the firſt booke, and in the Index doe not finde any thing that can give me probability in the ſecond booke, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any ſuch effect: and I wonder he ſpared to quote the place where ſuch doctrines are to be found, nothing being more convenient to juſtifie his criminations (than to quote for it ſomething that is to be ſeene in print) and thereby to cleare himſelfe from the ſuſpicion of a malignant. But this Prefacer very judiciouſly believes him throughout, becauſe the <hi>Relator was preſent when the broacher of the laſt poſition was convented for it, yet doth he not ſay he was convicted of it.</hi> And upon what ground he proceeds ſo judiciouſly in believing it is remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to wit, <hi>becauſe himſelfe hath heard it preached in London, that the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>whereby death temporall was appointed for the Sabbath-breaker, was yet in force; and that whoever did the workes of his ordinary calling on the Sabbath day, was to die there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> Now, I profeſſe he ſeemes to me a great deale more poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66015:94"/>
herein than at the firſt I was ware of: For, had hee not believed Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> his report this way, others might have taken as great liberty to believe but their part concerning this. Therefore it ſtood him upon, firſt, to manifeſt his ingenuous facility in believing another, that this might be a ſhooing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne to draw on others by way of the like ingenuous facility to believe him alſo; yet ſuch things may be; for as long as the world laſts, we ſhall be exerciſed with wilde wits, and ſo no doubt we ſhall with tale-tellers too, and ſo much the more in all likelihood the neerer the world approacheth to an end: It hath beene ſo amongſt Philoſophers in <hi>Cicero</hi> his obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it hath been ſo amongſt Schoole-divines; it is ſo amongſt Socinians and Arminians. But let the ſaddle be ſet upon the right horſe, and let every man beare his owne burthen. Now I have made it manifeſt, that the doctrines which he picks out of D. <hi>Bownde,</hi> and ſtiles Sabbatarian doctrines, are the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of D. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> afterwards Biſhop of Wincheſter; I could ſhew them to be the doctrines of many other worthy Prelates that have been of this kingdome; and it may be that if the votes of the Biſhops of this kingdom were taken, the major part would concurre with us, as touching the doctrine of the Sabbath, rather than againſt us.

This hee dedicated to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and over and above hath a ſecond dedication in Latine to Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> and to the biſhop of <hi>London</hi> then being; wherein hee ſignifieth that the one of them was author, the other hortator unto him to perfect this worke of his; and therefore undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came forth with as good approbation as the <hi>Analyſis</hi> of Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> upon the ſecond Chapter <hi>of Gen.</hi> he obſerves that <hi>As the Sabbath kept then upon the ſeventh day in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Creation was of the Lords inſtitution, ſo the Lords Day, is now obſerved by the ſame authority, in remembrance of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and redemption by the ſame.</hi> And this hee delivers in oppoſition to the Rhemiſts; <hi>who count the obſervation of the Lords Day but a tradition of the Church, and Eccleſiaſticall inſtitution,</hi> and having ſpent a whole page in folio upon this argument in the next page thus hee writeth<hi>—I doe wonder then this doctrine of the Sabbath, and day of reſt now called the Lords Day having ſuch evident demonſtration out of the Scriptures and being confirmed by the conſtant and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall practiſe of the Church, in all ages: that any profeſſing the Gospell, ſpecially being exerciſed in the Study of the Scriptures, ſhould gainſay, and impugne theſe poſitions following as erroneous.</hi> 1. <hi>That the Commandement of ſanctifying the Sabbath is naturall morall and perpetuall: For if it be not ſo then all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contained in the Decalogue are not morall, ſo ſhould we have.</hi> 9. <hi>and not.</hi> 10. <hi>Commandements; and then Chriſt ſhould come to deſtroy the Law, and not to fulfill is contrary to our Saviours own words,</hi> Math. 5. 17. 2. <hi>That all other things in the Law were ſo changed that they were cleane taken away, as the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Sacrifices and Sacraments: this day (namely the Sabbath) was ſo changed, that it yet remaines, For it is evident by the Apoſtles practiſe,</hi> Acts 20. 7. 1 Cor. 16. 2.

                  <p>Now the Author that hee intimates as oppoſing theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions hee deſcribes by the title, of his booke in the margent, which is this. <hi>The Catholique doctrine of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>printed at</hi> Cambridge <hi>p.</hi> 37. And the author of his booke I have heard to be Maſter <hi>Rogers,</hi> and it ſeemes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, eſpecially by the 2. firſt poſitions. Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> concludes in this manner, after hee had made uſe of divers allegations for the confirmation of his doctrine in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the fore-mentioned Author, <hi>but theſe allegations are here ſuperfluous ſeeing there is a learned Treatiſe of the Sabbath already publiſhed of this argument which containeth a moſt ſound doctrine of the Sabbath, as it is ſaid in the former poſitions, which ſhall be able to abide the triall of the Word of God, and ſtand warranted thereby, when other humane fantaſies ſhall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh: howſoever ſome in their heate and intemperance are not afraid to call them Sabbatariorum errores, yea hereticall aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a new Iubilee;</hi> S. <hi>Sabbath, more then either Iewiſh or popiſh inſtitution; God grant it be not layd to their charge that ſo ſpeake or write, and God give them a better minde.</hi> About two yeares before this, were ſet forth Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> his caſes of conſcience: wherein hee manifeſteth his concurrence with Doctor <hi>Bownde</hi> in the doctrine of the Sabbath.

That in a Towne of his acquaintance the preachers there had brought the people to that paſſe, that neither baked nor roſte meate was to be found in all the Pariſh for a ſunday dinner throughout the yeare, and hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it with ſuch an Epiphonema. <hi>Theſe are the fruites of ſuch dangerous doctrines;</hi> as if the fortunes of the Church or ſtate were hazarded for want of bak't meate or roſt meate on the ſundayes.</p>
                  <p>And to confeſſe a truth, though I never was, nor never am

like to be ſo preciſe; yet conſidering my meane condition, I have divers times thought thus with my ſelfe: why ſhould my proviſion hinder any of my ſervants from Sermons on the Sabbath day; ſo little did I feare any dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this practiſe: but ſince I am better informed by the ſuggeſtions of this judicious Prefacer; I will take heede how I cheriſh ſuch thoughts in my breſt henceforth; and if hee come at any time to take paines amongſt us, ſeeing I finde hee reſpects bak't meate and roſt meate ſo well; it ſhall goe hard but wee will have a tith Pig for his entertainement. And ſo much the rather, that I may cleare my ſelfe from Judaiſme, for <hi>Iack</hi> of <hi>Newbery</hi> my Countreyman being a great Clothier in his dayes; and then ſtrangers came from farre to buy Cloath at his Houſe, and amongſt the reſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Jewes were ſometime entertained by him being a very hoſpitallous man and an excellent houſe-keeper, his houſe being accounted the beſt Inne in the Towne, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe merry, cauſed the table to bee furniſhed with all variety of Hogges fleſh; which they perceaving tooke it for a flout; but after they had grumbled a while upon it, hee made ſhew as if but then hee had remembred himſelfe of his errour, and not till then conſidered that they were Jewes; and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee commanded all the diſhes to be remooved, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſhes already prepared to be ſet on the board, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his table was as well furniſhed as it was with gueſts. But to returne, it is an eaſy matter now a dayes to accuſe of any thing, as Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> hee ſaith, accuſeth us of Judaiſme, but <hi>ſi accuſare ſufficiat, quis innocens erit;</hi> when hee or Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> ſhall prove their accuſations, then let us be condemned; and if wee be not condemned, till then wee care not. Yet it is untrue which hee pins upon Doctor <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> his ſleeve; as if hee ſhould alleage <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaying, <hi>that they who literally underſtand the fourth Commandement, doe not yet ſavour of the ſpirit,</hi> neither S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeakes this of the fourth Commandement, nor is hee ſo alleaged by Doctor <hi>Prideaux,</hi> but of the ſeventh day; <hi>Quiſquis diem illum obſervat ficut litera ſonat, carnaliter ſapit.</hi> As much as to ſay, whoſoever keeps that day which the Jew keepes, ſavoureth carnally. Neither

did I know any of my brethren to ſtand for the ſanctifying of the ſeventh day in correſpondency to the ſeventh day, from the Creation but onely of one day in ſeaven; which day muſt alſo be preſcribed by God as the ſeventh day of the weeke was to the Jewes, which is the next thing imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, but the Lords Day is the firſt day of the weeke to us Chriſtians. </p>

                  <p>This when I had conſidered, when I had ſeriouſly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,  how much theſe fancies were repugnant both to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries of this, Church and judgments of all kinde of writers and how unſafe to be admitted; I thought I could not goe about a better worke then to exhibite to the view of my deare Countreymen this following Treatiſe delivered firſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards publiſhed by the Author in another language. The rather ſince of late the clamour is encreaſed, and that there is not any thing now more frequent in ſome <hi>Zelotes mouthes</hi> (to uſe the Doctors words) then that the Lords Day is with us licentiouſly yea ſacrilegiouſly profaned, <hi>Section</hi> firſt. To ſatisfie whoſe ſcruples and give content unto their mindes, I doubt not but this following diſcourſe will be ſufficient: which for that cauſe I have tranſlated faithfully, and with as good propriety as I could; not ſwerving any where from the ſenſe, and as little as I could from the phraſe and letter. <hi>Gratum opus agricolis:</hi> a worke as I conceave it, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable unto the preſent times, wherein beſides theſe peccant fancies before remembred, ſome have ſo farre proceeded, as not alone to make the Lords Day ſubject to the Jewiſh rigour; but to bring in againſt the Jewiſh Sabbath, and abrogate the Lords Day altogether. I will no longer detaine the reader from the benefit hee ſhall reape thereby. Onely I will crave leave for his greater benefit, to repeat the ſumme thereof which is briefely this: Firſt that the Sabbath was not inſtituted in the firſt Creation of the World, nor ever kept by any of the ancient patriarchs who lived before the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> therefore no morall and perpetuall precept as the other are, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Secondly that the ſanctifying of one day in ſeven is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall onely and obliged the Jewes, not morall to oblige us Chriſtians to the like obſervance. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. and 4. Thirdly,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66015:96"/>
that the Lords Day is founded onely on the authority of the Church, guided therein by the practice of the Apoſtles; not on the fourth Commandement (which hee calls a ſcandalous doctrine, Sect. 7.) nor any other expreſſe authority in holy Scripture, Sect. 6. and 7. Then fourthly, that the Church hath ſtill authority to change the day, though ſuch authority be not fit to be put in practice, Sect. 7. Fifthly, that in the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, there is no ſuch ceſſation from works of labour requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from us, as was exacted of the Jewes, but that we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dreſſe meat proportionable to every mans eſtate, and doe ſuch other things as are no hindrance to the publique ſervice appointed for the day, Sect. 8. Sixthly, that on the Lords Day all recreations whatſoever are to be allowed, which honeſtly may refreſh the ſpirits, and increaſe mutuall love and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood amongſt us, and that the names whereby the Jewes were wont to call their feſtivalls (whereof the Sabbath was the chiefe) were borrowed from an Hebrew word, which ſignifieth to dance, and to be merry, or make glad the countenance. If ſo, if all ſuch ceremonies as do increaſe good neighbor-hood, then wakes and feaſts, and other meetings of that nature. If ſuch as honeſtly may refreſh the ſpirits, then dancing, wreſtling, ſhooting, and all other paſtimes, not by law prohibited, which either exerciſe the body, or revive the mind. And laſtly, that it appertaines to the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, to order and appoint what paſtimes are to be permitted, and what are not (obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto whoſe commands is better farre than ſacrifice to the Idols of our owne inventions) not unto every private perſon (or as the Doctors owne words are) not unto every mans raſh zeale, who, out of a ſchiſmaticall, Stoiciſme (debarring men from lawfull paſtimes) doth incline to Judaiſme, Sect. 8. Adde for the cloſe of all, how doubtingly our Author ſpeakes of the name of Sabbath, which now is growne ſo rife amongſt us, Sect. 8.

As for the judgements of all kinde of writers which he boaſts of, I thinke never came a Divine to take pen in hand to vaunt ſo much, and performe ſo little. As for the unſafe condition of our Tenets which he ſuggeſts, excepting thoſe monſtrous and wild Tenets mentioned by M. <hi>Rogers,</hi> for which I know no better evidence than his word, and that in very odde manner delivered, I know nothing unſafe, nothing dangerous in any Tenet of ours, who now ſeeme to walke as upon the pinacles of the Temple, and indeed in this reſpect they are like to prove very dangerous to us; yet I would it were not more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66015:97"/>
to the Church of God, to be bereaved of ſo many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors: For, certainly it ſhall be honourable unto them, they cannot ſuffer in a more honorable cauſe than this, in ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the ſanctifying of the Lords Day in memory of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, who that day, being formerly a ſtone refuſed of the builders, was made the head of the corner. For what danger is it to maintaine, that from the Creation the Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it; and what a ſhamefull courſe is it ſo to expound it as in reference to a time 2000. and 4. or 500. yeeres after, and that in ſpight of the ancient Fathers: And manifeſt reaſon, as appeares by diviſion of time into weekes, even from the creation, and ſo continuing to the time of the Law delivered on the mount Sinai, as appeares by the ſtory of falling of Manna, and the Jewes gathering of it on ſixe dayes; none fallingnow, being gathered on the ſeventh, as the day on the week whereon God reſted after he had made the world in ſix. What danger in maintaining, that God required from the beginning, and afterwards ſpecified ſo much in the Law, that one day in ſeven is to be conſecrated unto Gods ſervice; and hence to inferre, that if God required ſo much of the Jews under the Law, it were moſt unreaſonable and unconſcionable we ſhould not afford unto him and his ſervice as good a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time under the Goſpel? Thirdly, what danger is there in affirming, that the Lords Day is of Divine inſtitution? Is it not Scripture that calls it the Lords Day? And what day was called the Lords Day before, but the day of the Jewes Sabbath? And hath not our Saviour manifeſtly given us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that even Chriſtians were to have their Sabbath, as the Jewes had theirs, as Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> accommodates the place? <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. And was the reſurrection of Chriſt any thing inferiour to the creation, to give a day unto us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; like as Gods reſt from creation, commended that day to the Jewes: Eſpecially conſidering, that a new creation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a new Sabbath; as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> delivered it of old; And D. <hi>Andrewes</hi> of late yeeres treading in the ſteps of that ancient Father, or rather of all the ancient Fathers: And what danger in maintaining that the Lords Day is entire, and whole to be conſecrated to Divine ſervice; did <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeake

dangerouſly, when he profeſſeth, that thereon we muſt <hi>tantum Deo vacare, tantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cultibus divinis vacare;</hi> would this Prefacer be content to be found dancing about a Maypole, or in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice-dance that day that Chriſt ſhould come in flaming fire, to render vengeance to all them that know not God, nor obey the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus? Nay, would hee not feare to rue the danger of his doctrine, when it will be too late to correct it, and all the profaneneſſe that hee hath promoted by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of his ſhould riſe up in judgement againſt him; yet now he thinkes he could not goe about a better worke than by this preface &amp; tranſlation to harden them in their profane and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure courſes; all his care at this time, is to prevent ſuperſtition, a wonder it is to ſee how zealous men of his ſpirit are to avoyd and ſhun ſuperſtition. Belike all theſe muſt be cenſured for Zelotes that complaine that the Lords day is with us licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, yea, ſacrilegiouſly profaned; yet theſe are the times whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> prophecied, that men ſhould be lovers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure more than lovers of God; yet Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> could take liberty to profeſſe of the Jewes, that by their Bacchanalian rites, they gave the world juſt occaſion to ſuſpect that they did conſecrate their Sabbaths unto devils rather than unto Gods ſervice; yet now adayes, they that oppoſe revels on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, are cenſured and condemned of Judaiſme: Neither is D. <hi>Prideaux</hi> cenſured by way of ſcorne for a zelote in this; but unleſſe wee concurre with this Prefacer, in thinking that the forbidding of dancing in the French Churches hath hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the growth of the reformed Religion there, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bare credit of <hi>Heylins Geography,</hi> wee muſt in ſcorne be termed zelotes.

Is this to keepe the holy day? Can I anſwer this to my God? that gives mee ſix dayes for my ſelfe, and takes but one to himſelfe, of which I rob him alſo?</hi> And Biſhop <hi>Auſtin</hi> too
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66015:98"/>
deſerves to be cenſured a zelote for that which hee writes in his 3. <hi>tract.</hi> upon <hi>Iohn. Obſerve the Sabbath Day, it is rather commanded unto us, becauſe it is commanded</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>in a ſpirituall manner. For the</hi> Jewes <hi>obſerve the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day ſervilely unto luxury, unto drunkenneſſe. How much better were it for their Women to spinne Wooll then to dance on that day in their new Moones,</hi> and in his 44. tract. <hi>The</hi> Jewes <hi>reſt unto toyes, and whereas God commanded the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to be obſerved, they ſpend the Sabbath in ſuch things which the Lord forbids.

pious exerciſe of repeating Sermons commended unto us by this holy Biſhop, which in theſe dayes I have heard to bee cryed downe, by profane perſons, as a cauſe of increaſe of Browniſme. And I willingly confeſſe that when I firſt came to this place, there were no leſſe then tenne that partly had withdrawne themſelves, partly were upon the point of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themſelves from our Common Prayers; but within a ſhort time there was not one ſuch to be found amongſt us, and ſo wee have continued to this day. But to returne, <hi>Ephrem Syrus</hi> may goe for a zelote in like manner, who as hee is alleged by <hi>Rivetus</hi> treating of the Sabbath, exhorts <hi>to honour the Lords feſtivities celebrating them not panegyrically, but Heavenly; not ſecularly, but ſpiritually; not like Heathens, but like Chriſtians; and he ſhewes</hi> wherein this conſiſts in the words following, <hi>Quare non portarum frontes coronemus, let us not hang Garlands upon the frontiſpice of our Gates, non choreas ducamus, let us not leade a dance, non chorum adornemus, let us not by our preſence beautifie any ſuch company; non tibiis audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum effaminemus, let us not effeminate our Eares with their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick or with their fidles—</hi>Nay as Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> complaines <hi>of the</hi> Jewes <hi>corrupting themſelves to the profaning of their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi> ſo <hi>Polidor Virgil</hi> complaines of the like corruptions among Chriſtians on their feſtivalls, lib. 6. cap. 8. <hi>not imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their time in prayer and in the exerciſe of Gods Word; for which cauſe ſuch feſtivalls were inſtituted, but in all manner of evill courſes tending to the corrupting of mens manners;</hi> and that herein they imitate Heathens, though of ancient times <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> (as hee ſayth) reprehended Heathens for ſuch courſes, as in his <hi>Apologeticum,</hi> ſpeaking of the holy ſolemnity of their Emperours. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>Chriſtians are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted enemies to the State, becauſe they doe not dedicate vaine, lying and raſh honors to their Prince. Forſooth it is a great good office, to make bonfiers and dances in publique, and to feaſt in every pariſh, to transforme the City into the</hi> habite of a Taverne; <hi>Vino lutum cogere,</hi> which <hi>Junius</hi> ſayth was a fruit of their deſperate Luxury, and a ſigne of their madneſſe and fury: he proceedes; <hi>to ſtrive who ſhall exceed one another in running about, to doe injuries, to commit impudencies, to provoke unto luſt.</hi>

                     <hi>And is the publike joy after ſuch a manner expreſt</hi> (to wit) <hi>by publique ſhame? O how deſervedly are we Chriſtians to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned (he ſpeakes it ironically) who by carrying our ſelves ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, chaſtly, honeſtly, doe oppoſe the vowes made and the joyes expreſſed for the Emperors, to wit, when for their ſober and chaſt and vertuous carriage on ſuch dayes, not concurring with others to the ſame exceſſe</hi> of riot, were cenſured as enemies untotheir Princes. Yet even in thoſe primitive times the manners of Chriſtians became degenerate, as <hi>Baldwin</hi> obſerves in his caſes of conſcience, <hi>p.</hi> 479. and that out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as whom hee obſerves to have complained of it; namely that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans imitated the manners of the Heathen in this, yea and grew worſe then they, in his booke <hi>de Idol. c.</hi> 14. <hi>O melior fides nationum in ſuam ſectam, quae nullam Chriſtianorum ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennitatem ſibi vendicat, non Dominicam, non Pentecoſtem; etiam ſi noſſent nobiſcum non communicaſſent, ne Chriſtiani videren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; nos ne Ethnici</hi> pronuntiemur, non veremur. <hi>O the fayth of the Nations better then ours towards their own ſect, as who cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge not to themſelves any Chriſtian ſolemnity, not that of the Lords Day, nor that of</hi> Whitſuntide. <hi>Had they known it, they would not communicate with us, leſt they ſhould ſeem Chriſtians; we Chriſtians feare not to be accompted Heathens.</hi> O what a zelote did <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſhew himſelfe in this! nay what thinke wee of <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Anthemius</hi> Emperours; were not they ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotes too in that decree of theirs (alleaged by the former <hi>Baldwin)?

And may not King <hi>Iames</hi> alſo be cenſured for a zelote in making that proclamation of his for the reformation of abuſes in profaning the Lords Day, at his firſt comming into the Land, to receave this Kingdome as his rightfull inheritance? In the Conference before his Majeſty at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, I finde mention made of it by D. <hi>Reynolds</hi> in this manner: <hi>To the former Doctor</hi> Reynolds <hi>did adde the profanation of the Sabbath day, and contempt of his Majeſties proclamation made for the reforming of that abuſe, of</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:66015:100"/>
                     <hi>which he earneſtly deſired a ſtreighter courſe for reformation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and unto this he found a generall and unanimous aſſent.</hi> All theſe be like were zelotes. So was his Majeſty alſo that now is, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the Lords both ſpirituall and temporall, and the houſe of Commons in that Act made in the firſt yeare of King <hi>Charles</hi> to preſerve the Lords Day from profanation, wherein are forbidden expreſſely and by name, bearebaiting, bulbaiting, enterludes, common playes, and in generall all other unlawfull exerciſes and paſtimes; and over and above all meetings and aſſemblies or concourſe of people out of their owne pariſhes for any ſports or paſtimes whatſoever; and conſequently no man ought on the Lords Day, goe forth of his owne pariſh to any may-game, or to ſee a Morrice-dance, or dancing about May-poles; and ſeeing the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that it is good to be zealous alwayes in a good thing <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 18. and Chriſt hath died for us to redeeme us from all iniquity, and to purge us a peculiar people unto himſelfe, zealous of good workes, <hi>Tii.</hi> 2. 14. let them in the Name of God be ſuch zelots ſtill; this zeale being a zeale of Gods Glory; and it becomes us to be zealous of his Glory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how zealous hee is for our good, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 7. &amp; <hi>Eſay</hi> 59. 17. Of the ſufficiency of the following diſcourſe, we ſhall by Gods helpe conſider in due time.</p>
                  <p>But I confeſſe it may be very ſutable to theſe times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apoſtle prophecied, men ſhould be lovers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures more then lovers of God, and undoubtedly it will ſuit well with their affections like a ſweete morſell to the epicure which hee roules under his tongue, but all the praiſe is in parting; and I would they would but thinke of that of the Prophet, <hi>What will be the end thereof;</hi> when wee ſhall give God cauſe to ſay of our Sabbath, as hee ſayd of the Jewiſh, <hi>I have hated your Sabbaths.</hi> And if there be any ſuch practiſes of Satan on foote, as to bring in the Jewiſh Sabbath, let it be conſidered in the feare of God, what doctrine doth more promote therein; whether that which makes the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Day Divine, or rather that which makes it merely of humane inſtitution; and who ſeeth not that if it be left to the liberty of the Church, they may bring in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:66015:100"/>
the Jewiſh Sabbath if it pleaſeth them. Though it be notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly untrue, (as may be made to appeare both by Scripture, evident reaſon and authority humane, both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, both Papiſts and Proteſtants) that the Sabbath was not ordained immediately upon the creation; yet were that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative granted; ſince God hath manifeſted in his Law, that he requires one day in ſeven to be ſet apart for his ſervice, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently followes, even by the very light of nature, that it were moſt unreaſonable wee ſhould allow him a worſe proportion of time for his ſervice under the Goſpell; that conſequently the obſervation of one day in ſeven is to be kept holy unto the Lord, is now become morall and perpetuall unto the very end of the world; neither was it ever heard, that any man did ſet his wits on worke in deviſing a ceremoniality in the proportion of one day in ſeven. A prefiguration of Ghriſt in ſome reſpect hath beene found in the Jewiſh reſt on the ſeventh day of the weeke; but of any prefiguration of ought in Chriſt, by an indefinite proportion of one day in ſeven the world dreamed not of till now; neither doth any man offer to deviſe what poſſibly this might prefigure in Chriſt: As for the third, it cannot be denied, but that Chriſt manifeſted before his death, that his Chriſtian Churches ſhould obſerve a Sabbath as well as the Jewes did; this appeares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. <hi>Pray, that your flight be not in the Winter, nor on the Sabbath day;</hi> and thus Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> accommodates that place in his patterne of Catecheticall doctrine. It is as manifeſt, that the day of Chriſts reſurrection is called in the cripture the Lords Day; as manifeſt that not the day of the yeere, but the day of the week, whereon Chriſt roſe, is called the Lords Day, which few take notice of. Likewiſe in the old Teſtament is manifeſt that the Jews Sabbath is called the <hi>Lords holy Day.</hi> Then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity in reference to the reaſon of the originall inſtitution is moſt exact. For firſt, Chriſt by his reſurrection, brought with him a new creation; and this new creation, as D. <hi>Andrewes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, treading herein in the ſteps of the ancients, requireth a new Sabbath; and as the Lord reſted on the ſeventh day from the worke of creation, ſo our Saviour on the firſt day of the weeke from the worke of Redemption: And laſtly, the day
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66015:101"/>
of Chriſts reſurrection, was the day whereon Chriſt the ſtone formerly refuſed by the builders, was made the head of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and of this day the Prophet profeſſeth of old, ſaying, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath mad, let us be glad and rejoyce in it;</hi> which can have no other congruous meaning but this; this is the day which the Lord hath made feſtivall, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the doctrine of Biſhop <hi>Lake,</hi> which is this; that the worke of the day is the ground of hallowing the day, as is to be ſeene in the inſtitution of all feſtivalls, both Humane and Divine. And I have already ſhewed how abſurd it is, that wee ſhould expect it ſhould be left unto the Church her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to appoint it, conſidering the great danger of diſſention thereabouts, and extreme confuſion thereupon; And it cannot be denyed, but this day was eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles, and that as of authority Divine, as appeares generally by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> profeſſing, that <hi>Dominus conſecravit hunc diem; Auſtin,</hi> that <hi>Apoſtoli ſanxerunt;</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, when hee comes into an humour of imitating Chriſt, ſhould command the obſervation of the Lords Day; and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> hath as pregnant a teſtimony to the ſame purpoſe as any; and <hi>Sedulius;</hi> and that not one of the Ancients, as I know, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged to the contrary. So that to aſcribe the inſtitution of it to humane authority, that every way were a ſcandalous doctrine, and ſo would the practice be alſo according thereunto. And conſequently the Church hath no authority to change the day, as Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> profeſſeth againſt the Rhemiſts: And to ſay the contrary, is to ſay that the Church hath authority to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with the Jewes in keeping with them the Saturday, with the Turks, in keeping with them the Friday; yea, that they have authority to divide the dayes of the weeke, one nation taken one day to obſerve, and another another, which is as much as to ſay, that the Church hath authority to be notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſcandalous. In the fifth he delivers more truth than in all his preface beſides: we make no queſtion, but that workes of neceſſity and workes of charity may be done on this day, though the proper workes of the day are the workes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I know none that thinkes it unlawfull to dreſſe meat proportionable to a mans eſtate on this day: ſome are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66015:101"/>
that this was not forbidden unto the Jewes; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit to go abroad on that day to gather Manna was forbidden, yet not the preparing or dreſſing of it; though the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of our Divines is to the contrary: Some thinke a greater ſtrictneſſe was enjoyned them in the wilderneſſe than afterward obſerved by them. As in the ſtory of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> it is <note place="margin">

And let the law of this nation or of any nation of the world be judge between us, whether in caſe one man owe another a dayes ſervice; I ſay, let the world judge, whether in common equity this be to be interpreted of an houre and an halfe in the morning, and an houre and an halfe in the evening, or onely of a part of the day, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole day. And what vile courſes are theſe, that men ſhould carry themſelves ſo baſely in diſpenſing unto God the proportion of his ſervice. In the ſixth and laſt place, we have that wherunto all the former diſcourſe is conſecrated, namely, to make way for ſuch profane ſports and paſtimes, which here are gloſed with the cleanely ſtiles of <hi>recreations to refreſh the ſpirits, and for the increaſe of mutuall love and neighbourhood amongst us,</hi> as if he were aſhamed to ſpeake our, that all this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66015:102"/>
tends to the countenance of May-games and morricing, and dancing about May-poles on the Lords Day. D <hi>Andrewes,</hi> ſometimes Biſhop of Wincheſter, ſpared not to profeſſe, that <note place="margin">Patterne of Catech. <hi>p.</hi> 244, 245. on the <hi>Con.</hi>

Doctor <hi>Downeham,</hi> Biſhop of Derry, calls ſuch like courſes <hi>profane ſports and paſtimes, which more diſtract, and more hinder our workes than honeſt labours;</hi> and he cenſures alſo ſuch a Sabbath, calling it, <hi>the Sabbath of the calfe,</hi> Exod. 23. 6. 18. 19. Biſhop <hi>Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> on Exod. 16. puts a Chriſtian ſoule upon this meditation, <hi>Good Lord, what doe I upon the Sabbath day? This people of his might not gather Manna, and may I ſafely gad to faires and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, to dancings and drinkings, to wakes and wantons, to Bearc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baitings and Bulbaitings, with ſuch like wicked profanations of the Lords Day? Are theſe workes for the Sabbath? Is this to keepe the holy day? Can I anſwer this to my God, that gives mee ſix dayes for my ſelfe, and takes but one to himſelfe, of which I rob him alſo? No, no, aſſuredly I ſhall not be able to indure his wrath for theſe things one day, and therefore I will leave them, and regard his holy day hereafter better than I have done.</hi> And in his expoſition of the Commandements by way of queſtion and anſwer, <hi>p.</hi> 44. reproves expreſſely <hi>Summer-games on the Lords Day;</hi> and in his <hi>Examen</hi> of conſcience annexed to the fourth Commandement, he ſpeakes againſt going to <hi>Church-ales and Summer-games;</hi> nay, is it not apparent, that by the very act of Parliament, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Caroli,</hi> that <hi>to goe out of a mans owne pariſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any ſports or paſtimes on the Sabbath day,</hi> is to profane the Sabbath? For to prevent the profanation of the Sabbath, is that ſtatute made: Now, unleſſe the ſports themſelves be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanations of the Sabbath, it is as evident, that to goe forth of a mans pariſh unto ſuch ſports, is no profanation, any more, than to goe out of a mans pariſh walking, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre in pious manner with a friend, or to fetch a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian or Surgeon, if need be, or to heare a Sermon. And it is very ſtrange, that wee of the reformed Churches, ſhall juſtifie ſuch liberty on the Lords Day, which Papiſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne on their holy dayes; who uſually complaine of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66015:102"/>
dancing upon ſuch dayes; as <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> upon <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Pariſienſis de legibus cap.</hi> 4. And of old ſuch courſes have beene forbidden by the decrees of <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Anthemius</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; It is condemned alſo in the ſynod of <hi>Toledo Can.</hi> 23. as <hi>Baldwin</hi> the <hi>Lutheran</hi> ſhewes, who alſo writes devoutly againſt ſuch courſes on the Lords Day, and gives this reaſon. <hi>For if the labours of our calling are forbidden in the holy day, how much more ſuch recreations? and</hi> p. 48. <hi>He ſhewed how the Sabbath was profaned by unchaſt dancings and any manner of wantonneſſe; what need I here to make mention of</hi> Auſtin; who profeſſeth, and that againſt the Jewes, that it is better to goe to plow then to dance; and that it were better for their Women to ſpin Wooll, then immodeſtly to dance, as they did; yet now a dayes ſuch as oppoſe the ſame courſes, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> did, are cenſured for Judaizing; thus the World ſeemes to be turned upſide downe. Is it not high time Chriſt ſhould come to ſet an end to it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dielericus</hi> the <hi>Lutherane</hi> complaines of the like profanations of the Sabbath too much in courſe amongſt them, in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalyſis of the Goſpells for the Lords Day. p. 559. and let every Chriſtian conſcience be judge, whether to follow May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles, May-games and Morrice dancing be to ſanctifie the Sabbath as God commands? if any man ſhall ſay, that the fourth Commandement concerned the Jewes, and not us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, hee muſt therewithall renounce the booke of <hi>Homilies.</hi> For it profeſſeth that this Commandement binds us to the obſervation of our Sabbath, which is Sunday; the words are theſe. <hi>So if we will be the children of our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we muſt be carefull to keep the Chriſtian Sabbath Day, which is the Sunday, not only for that it is Gods Commandement, but alſo to declare our ſelves to be loving children in following the example of our gracious Lord and Father. Then complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how</hi> the Sabbath is profaned; <hi>Some uſe all dayes alike—The other ſort worſe: For although they will not travaile, nor labour on the Sunday, yet they will not reſt in holineſſe, as God commandeth; but they reſt in ungodlineſſe and filthineſſe, prancing in their pride, pranking and pricking, poynting &amp; painting themſelves to be gorgeous and gay.

                     <hi>and drunkenneſſe like Rats and Swin: they reſt in brawling and railing, in quarrelling and fighting: they reſt in want onneſſe, in toyiſh talking, in filthy fleſhlineſſe; and concludes after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo that it doth too evidently appeare that God is more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, and the Divell better ſerved on Sunday, then upon all the dayes of the weeke beſide.</hi> And that diſtinction which <hi>Calvin</hi> makes of the Jewiſh obſervation of the Sabbath, and our Chriſtian obſervation of a Sabbath is, for ought I know, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally receaved of all; and the diſtinction is this; that the Jewes obſerved their Sabbath ſo ſtrictly in the point of reſt, for a myſterious ſignification; but wee obſerve it in reſting from other works ſo farre forth as they are <hi>Avocamenta à ſacris ſtudiis &amp; meditationibus,</hi> avocations from holy ſtudies, and meditations; now it is apparant that ſports and pleaſures are as ſtrong avocations from holy ſtudies and meditations, as worldly cares; and both equally are noted out to be ſuch as choake the Word, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 14. And therefore this day is altogether appointed to this end, even to recreate our ſelves in the Lord; For ſeeing God purpoſeth one day to keepe an everlaſting Sabbath with us, when God ſhall be all in all; to make us the more fit for this even the more <hi>meete partakers, of the inheritance of Saints in light,</hi> therefore hee hath given us his Sabbaths to walke with him, and to inure our ſelves to take delight in his company, who takes delight to ſpeake unto us as from Heaven in his holy Word, and to give us li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeake unto him in our prayers, confeſſions, thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings and ſupplications; on other dayes wee care for the things of this World, on this day our care ſhould be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and heavenly in caring for the things of another World; ſo our pleaſures ſhould be ſpirituall on this day; <hi>If thou ſhalt</hi>

                     <hi>call the Sabbath a delight, to conſecrate it as glorious unto the Lord.</hi> Now have we not as much cauſe to performe this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under the Goſpell as ever the Jewes had under the Law? And indeed there is no colour of reaſon againſt this; but by affirming that now the ſetting of a day apart for Gods ſervice is left at large to the liberty of the Church; and albeit the Church hath ſet apart the Lords Day for this; yet their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning herein is no more then this, that they ſhal come to Church

twiſe a day, and afterwards give themſelves to what ſports ſoever are not forbidden them by the Lawes of the Land: ſo that now a dayes wee are free from the obligation to the fourth Commandement, and yet we are taught by the Church aſwell at the hearing of this Commandement as atany other to ſay, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us and incline our hearts to keepe this Law;</hi> and the booke of <hi>Homilies</hi> urgeth us to the ſanctifying of our Chriſtian Sabbath (which is Sunday, ſaith the booke expreſſely) and that by vertue of Gods expreſſe Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I cannot but wonder at the indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Prefacer, who catcheth after ſuch a ſuperficiall advantage as the denomination of a feaſt amongſt the Jewes, not conſidering how little ſutable it is to the grounds of his Tenet; For by his Tenet, after evening Prayer the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is at end, the Churches meaning being not any further to oblige them to the ſanctifying of the Lords Day, but to give them liberty to uſe any ſports or paſtimes not forbidden them by the Lawes of the Land. But ſo was not the feaſt of the Jewes ended when they danced; this being but an expreſſion of that joy whereunto the preſent ſolemnity called them; and they ſinned no more herein then <hi>David,</hi> did when hee danced before the Arke; as wee ſee <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 12. <hi>Therefore they ſhall come and ſing in the height of</hi> Sion, <hi>and ſhall flow together to the goodneſſe of the Lord for Wheat, and for Wine, and for Oile, and for the young of the flock, and of the heard, and their ſoule ſhall be as a well watered Garden, and they ſhall not ſorrow any more at all.</hi> 13: <hi>Then ſhall the Virgin rejoyce in the dance, both yong men, and old together; for I will turne their mourning into joy, and will comfort them &amp; make them rejoyce for their ſorrow.</hi> 14. <hi>And I will ſatiate the ſoule of the Prieſt with fatneſſe, and my people ſhall be ſatisfyed with my goodneſſe ſaith the Lord.</hi> And the like wee reade <hi>Eſay</hi> 30. 19. <hi>Ye ſhall have a ſong as in the Night, when an holy ſolemnity is kept, and gladneſſe of heart, as when one goeth with a Pipe to come into the Mountaine of the Lord to the mighty One of</hi> Iſrael; ſo that if Morricing and May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>games and Dancing about May-poles were a ſanctifying of the Sabbath Day in part (as the Lord commands the day to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66015:104"/>
be ſanctifyed) then indeed theſe ſports were as lawfull on the Lords Day, as the Jewes piping and dancing were lawfull on their feaſts. But that any ſuch piping and dancing were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and allowed in thoſe ancient times among the Jewes on their Sabbaths, there is not the leaſt colour of evidence. And it is evident that ſuch ſports put them to leſſe reſt for their bodies, then the workes of their calling; neither is there any better evidence that any ſuch piping and dancing were in uſe amongſt the Jewes while they continued the people of God on every day of their ſolemne feaſts; for two dayes in each of them, to wit, the firſt day, and the laſt, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to keepe as Sabbaths, whereon they were to have an holy convocation; and thereon they are expreſſely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to reſt from all ſervile workes; and I ſhould thinke, the following of naturall pleaſures are to be preſumed as ſervile workes, as the workes of a mans calling.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, all recreations are to this end, even to fit us to the workes of our calling; either for the workes of our particular callings, or the workes of our generall callings, as we are Chriſtians; Such ſports, if they fit us for the ſervice of God, were more ſeaſonable in the Morning then in the Evening. If for the workes of our particular calling; then are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the workes of our calling, the furthering whereof is their end; and the meanes are alwayes inferiour in dignity unto the end. Now if the more noble workes are forbidden on that day, how much more ſuch as are inferior are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den? But it may be ſayd, that mens minds being burthened, and oppreſſed with the former ſervice of the day, therefore ſome relaxatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be granted for the refreſhing of our ſpirits; As much as to ſay, a part of the Lords Day is to be allowed for profane ſports and paſtimes, to refreſh us after wee have beene tired out with ſerving God; can this be ſavoury in the eares of a Chriſtian? ſhould not wee rather complaine of theſe corruptions, and bewaile it before God, then give our ſelves to ſuch courſes as are apt to ſtrengthen it? It is true; ſuch is our naturall corruption, that nothing is more tedious unto us as wee are in our ſelves, then to converſe with God; but ſhould not the conſideration hereof provoke us ſo much the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66015:104"/>
more to ſtrive againſt it, then give way to the nouriſhing and confirming of it? And hath not our Saviour told us, that not the cares of this World onely, but voluptuous living alſo, is it that choaks the good ſeede of Gods Word, and cauſeth it to become unfruitfull in us? As for the refreſhing of our ſpirits and quickning them, and thereby making us the fitter for Gods ſervice; as in any modeſt exerciſe of the body in private, according to every mans particular diſpoſition, to prevent drowſineſſe and dulneſſe in attending to Gods Word, in praying in ſinging of Pſalmes, I know none that takes any exception againſt it. And as for the authority of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to appoint paſtimes, ſure I am, the high Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament with us, and that in the dayes of King <hi>Chanles,</hi> hath forbidden every man to come out of his pariſh, about any ſports and paſtimes; a manifeſt evidence that in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the publique proſecuting of ſuch ſports, and paſtimes, is a plaine profanation of the Sabbath; and ſo by this authors profound judgement, they deſerve to be cenſured as inclining to Judaiſme.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the uſe of the very name of Sabbath is now a dayes carped at; and why? but becauſe it is a ſore offence unto them in their way; for if a reſt from any thing (otherwiſe lawfull in it ſelfe) be required on the Lords Day, it ſeemes moſt reaſonable that a reſt is required from ſports and paſtimes: undoubtedly they have neither reaſon nor authority to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt this; For our Saviour uſeth the word even of Chriſtian times, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 20. <hi>Pray that your flight be not</hi> in the winter, <hi>nor on the Sabbath Day.</hi> Doctor <hi>Andrewes,</hi> one of the greateſt Prelates of this Kingdome, accommodates this place to the ſame purpoſe. All ceremonies (ſaith hee) were ended in Chriſt; but ſo was not the Sabbath. For <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 20. <hi>Chriſts bids them pray that their viſitation be not on the Sabbath Day:</hi> ſo that there muſt needs be a Sabbath after Chriſts death; and by this name hee commonly calls this day wee keepe weekely as holy unto the Lord. The booke of Homilies plainly tells us, that the Sunday is our Sabbath. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court it is ſo called, without any diſlike ſhewed by any one there preſent. And the onely reaſon why
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66015:105"/>
the ancients put a difference in this, not calling it the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, but the Lords Day, was this, becauſe <hi>Dies Sabbati</hi> in Latine ſignifieth the Saturday, which was the Jewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. But they generally call us to a reſt on this day, and that moſt exact, as wherein wee muſt <hi>Tantum Deo vacare, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum cultibus divinis vacare,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> by name, not ſparing to confeſſe that <hi>Arare melius eſt quam ſaltare;</hi> But <hi>Barklay</hi> it ſeemes, is of more authority with this Prefacer then Doctor <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and the Church, yea, and of our Saviour too: yet wee calling it by that name, underſtand no other thing then our Chriſtian Sabbath, and had rather it were generally called the Lords Day; and Doctor <hi>Bownde</hi> alſo ſtandeth for this denomination, and urgeth it: yet is hee accounted a Sabbatarian by Maſter <hi>Rogers,</hi> though wee all concurre in this, that thereon wee ought to keepe, and ſanctifie our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sabbath, And <hi>Iacobus de Valentia,</hi> who was no ſectary in the opinion of <hi>Barklay,</hi> to diſtinguiſh the Jewiſh Sabbath from ours, calls it <hi>Sabbatum legale,</hi> and concluſ. 4. hee ſaith that <hi>Chriſtiana religio celebrat verum Sabbatum morale in die Dominica.</hi> Chriſtian Religion keepeth a true morall Sabbath on the Lords Day; yet I willingly confeſſe, this is the uſuall courſe of Papiſts now a dayes, not to call the Lords Day, ſo much as by the name of our Sabbath. As for <hi>Barklays</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; hee is much fitter to write ſomthing anſwerable to <hi>Don Quixot</hi> then to reaſon; we doe obſerve the Lords Day, as a Sabbath, not becauſe God reſted that day from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for our Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> (of ſomewhat more credit with us, and that not onely for his place, but for his ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, then <hi>Barklay)</hi> hath delivered it in the Starre Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that <hi>It hath ever been the Churches Doctrine, that Chriſt made an end of all Sabbaths by his Sabbath in the Grave. That Sabbath was the laſt of them. And that the Lords Day preſently came in place of it. And againe. That the Sabbath had reference to the old Creation, but in Chriſt we are a new creature, a new Creation, and ſo to have a new Sabbath.</hi> And this hee ſayth, is deduced plainly: Firſt by practiſe, then by precept. And this new Sabbath on the Lords Day, wee obſerve, becauſe on that day Chriſt reſted from the worke of redemption,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66015:105"/>
which was wrought by his death. So that though the Lord began his labours in the worke of Creation on the firſt day of the weeke, yet the Lord Chriſt ſet an end to his labors in the worke of redemption on the ſame day of the weeke. As for Chriſts vanquiſhing the powers of death on that day, to wit, the firſt day of the weeke; the Women that came to the Sepulchre at ſun riſing, found that he was riſen. And what powers are theſe powers of death, hee rhetoricates of? is there any poſitive nature in death that our Saviour had neede to take ſuch paines to overcome them; The Lord himſelfe when hee reſted, he reſted onely from Creation; he that was beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his courſes hath told us ſaying, <hi>Pater uſ<expan>

               <p>FIrſt, I come to the Doctrine of the Sabbath tranſlated by the Prefacer; I nothing doubt but the Author thereof will take in good part my paines in the diſcuſſion of it, conſidering the preſent occaſion urging mee hereunto; Out of the variety of his reading, hee obſerves many wild derivations of the name Sabbath, and out of his judgment doth pronounce that <hi>the</hi> Jewes <hi>by their Bacchanalian rites gave the World juſt occaſion to ſuspect, that they did conſecrate the Sabbath unto Revells ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Gods ſervice.</hi> As for <hi>the rigorous keeping of the day in</hi>

ſuch ſort; <hi>as neither to kindle fire in the Winter-time wherewith to warme themſelves: or to dreſſe meat for the ſuſtentation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> I am ſo farre from juſtifying it, that I willingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I am utterly ignorant, where any ſuch Chriſtians live, that preſſe any ſuch rigorous obſervation of it. The Jewes were bound to obſerve the reſt on that day for a myſterious ſignification ſake, and thereupon depended their rigorous obſerving of a reſt, as many thinke, and not <hi>Lyra</hi> alone. <hi>We muſt know</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that reſt from manuall works is not</hi> (now) <hi>ſo rigorouſly obſerved as in the old Law, becauſe meate may be dreſſed, and other things done on the Lords Day, which were not lawfull on the Sabbath: becauſe that reſt was in part figurative, as was the whole ſtate under the Law,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. <hi>All things befell them in figure; Now in that which is figurative, if you take away never ſo little; (that is, if that which is figurative bee not exactly obſerved) the whole and intire ſignification faileth, like as if you take away but one letter from the name of Lapis, the whole and intire ſignification is deſtroyed.</hi> To deale plainely, my opinion is, that all ſports, and paſtimes on the Lords Day, are a breaking of the reſt belonging to it, and a profanation of that day which ought to be ſanctified; And I truſt, herein I differ not one jot from the whole Parliament, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Caroli;</hi> wherein was expreſſely prohibited, that any man ſhould goe out of his owne Pariſh to any ſports, and paſtimes on the Sabbath day; and this is done to prevent the profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, as appeares clearely by the reaſons of that Act; which Parliament was held certaine yeares after this Lecture, concerning the Doctrine of the Sabbath was read in the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</hi> And I nothing doubt but the cenſure of a Zelote will paſſe upon mee for this, though wee ſhew no more zeale in ſaying, that <hi>The Lords Day is by ſome licentiouſly profaned,</hi> then others doe in profeſſing that the Lord Day is by us ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly obſerved; nay who are the greateſt zelotes in their cauſe, let the Chriſtian World judge by the effects; This is all I have to note concerning the firſt <hi>Section.</hi> I come unto the ſecond.</p>

               <p>Secondly, and here in the firſt place concerning <hi>the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it;</hi> let mee take leave to profeſſe, that the queſtion it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66015:106"/>
ſelfe is not indifferenly ſtated, when it is ſtated thus, <hi>whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publiſhing of</hi> Moſes <hi>Law, the Sabbath was to be obſerved by the law of Nature.</hi> For I am verily perſwaded, that the Doctor himſelfe will not affirme, that after the <hi>publiſhing of</hi> Moſes <hi>law, it was to be obſerved by the law of nature;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by the law of nature (as I preſume he doth) ſuch a law as is knowne by the very light of nature. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath taught us in generall, that morall duties are rather wrought upon a ſober conſcience by perſwaſion, than doe carry with them any convincing evidence of demonſtration. Yet it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that by the light of nature, ſome time ought to be ſet apart, even for the publike ſervice and worſhip of God, and not onely ſo, but alſo it is nothing leſſe cleare, that a ſufficient proportion of time muſt be alloted to the profeſſed ſervice of our Creator. But wherein this ſufficient proportion of time doth conſiſt, we are to ſeek, being left unto our ſelves, and in my judgement, conſidering what we are, it is very fit we ſhould be to ſeeke in this; that ſo our eyes may wait upon the direction of our Maker. For, is it fit that ſervants ſhould cut out a proportion of ſervice to their Maſter at their owne pleaſure, and not rather be guided herein by their Maſters pleaſure, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by ſuch a Maſter, to whom wee owe not onely all that wee doe enjoy, but our ſelves alſo; <hi>who holdeth our ſoules in life, and in whoſe hands is the breath of all man-kinde.</hi> The queſtion thus untowardly propoſed, it is ſubjoyned that, <hi>They commonly which are more apt to ſay any thing, than able af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to prove it, maintaine affirmatively that it was.</hi> Doctor <hi>Rivet</hi> having propoſed this, addeth, that <hi>if it be ſpoken of the law of nature, properly ſo called, ſcarce any one will be found to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any ſuch thing.</hi> And indeed, the queſtion in hand, is of the inſtitution of the Sabbath: Now, no wiſe man uſeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the inſtitution of that which is written in our hearts, and knowne unto us by the very common light of nature. It is true, <hi>ſome fetch the originall thereof from the beginning of the world, when God firſt bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it:</hi> And what other ſenſe this can have, than that God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be ſet apart for holy uſes, wee cannot deviſe; For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods bleſſing and ſanctifying of it doth undoubtedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66015:107"/>
ſome act of God, this muſt be either an immanent act, or an act tranſient; Not an act immanent, for all ſuch are eternall, but this was temporall, following upon Gods reſt on the ſeventh: For therefore (it is ſaid) <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it;</hi> and being an act tranſient and temporall, it muſt declare his will to have it ſanctified, that is (by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall notion of the word) ſet apart, that is, from profane and ſecular, to holy uſes; And how could this will of God be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted but by commandement, ſeeing it is a will of God not ſo much concerning what ſhall be done, as concerning what ſhall be mans duty to doe? And this hath both <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus,</hi> and after him <hi>Rivetus</hi> juſtified, and this latter againſt <hi>Gomarus,</hi> once and againe, and that by divers arguments. And thus, as we have expreſſe Scripture for it, ſo we have as evident reaſon to juſtifie it: For, no other ground can be deviſed for the dividing of the whole courſe of time into weeks, each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſeven dayes, than as it ſtands in congruity to Gods making the world in ſix dayes, and reſting on the ſeventh. Which diviſion of time was undoubtedly obſerved by the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, and received by them from their forefathers, yea, and from the Patriarches of old, who lived before the flood, and that continued without alteration even from the Creation of the world; For otherwiſe they could not have diſcerned what days had been anſwerable to the firſt ſix of the Creation, and what day to the ſeventh, wherein God reſted, having finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the creation. But this was well known unto them, as appears by their gathering Manna, and promulgation of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, together with the reſt on Mount Sinai; Nay, this diviſion of time into weeks, was generally obſerved among the heathens, as hath been ſhewed by great variety of reading, and that this hath beene the moſt ancient diviſion of time, thoſe other diviſions into moneths and into yeeres, comming in place long after, according as the motion of the Moone and of the Sunne were found out by Aſtrologers, not till then, like as the denomination of the ſeven dayes of the weeke by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall names of the planets, was not brought in, untill the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall motions of all the Planets, come to be diſcovered. As for the ſecond reaſon propoſed thus on our part; <hi>If all the reſt</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:66015:107"/>
                  <hi>of the Commandements flow from the principles of nature, how is this excluded?</hi> It is not fit that any man ſhould take upon him the ſhaping of his adverſaries arguments; That this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement ſhould be taken for a part of the morall Law, I wonder that any man ſhould be ſo unreaſonable as to deny; but that this Commandement ſhould flow from the Principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that delivered without diſtinction, I know no man that affirmes. But let us diſtinguiſh, and I make no doubt, but there will be found no difference of moment betweene Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> and us: For, I find no man to deny, but that ſome time in generall is to be ſet a part, as well for Gods publique worſhip and ſervice, as for private, and that this is acknowledged by the very light of nature; Only as touching the proportion of time that is to be ſet apart for Gods ſervice, herein we are to ſeeke; yet herein alſo the light of nature doth advantage us, and that ſufficiently in two particulars: For the truth whereof, I dare appeale to the judgement of Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> himſelfe. 1. The firſt is this, that not onely ſome time, but a ſufficient proportion of time is to be conſecrated to the exerciſes of piety, both publique and private. <hi>Gomarus</hi> and <hi>Rivetus</hi> are driven to acknowledge this, in anſwer to <hi>Walaeus</hi> about the proportion of one day in ſeven. And whereas we may be to ſeeke of agreement about what is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: 2. Therefore in the next place, the very light of nature doth ſuggeſt unto us; that it is farre more fit that the Maſter ſhould preſcribe unto the ſervant, what proportion of ſervice he expects from his hands, than that the ſervant at his pleaſure ſhould cut out what proportion of ſervice he thinks good unto his Maſter; how much more fit that the Creator ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto his creature, then that the creature ſhould preſcribe unto his Creator; conſidering, 1. how the dominion of God over his creature is incomparably greater than that which any other Maſter hath over his ſervant. 2. That man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unreaſonable in his demands and commands, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. 3. God can give ſtrength to his creature to performe what he commands, man cannot. 4. The more cleare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Commandement is, the more comfortable to the creature, being hereby aſſured, the ſervice hee performes is in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66015:108"/>
the way of obedience, not unto his owne will, but to the will of his Maſter. 3. May I not adde a third? namely, that by the very equity of a naturall conſcience, it is more fit to apportion unto Gods ſervice one day in a weeke, rather than one day in a moneth; eſpecially conſidering that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally time hath beene divided into weekes, and not into moneths, untill a long time after. In all which, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to appeale to the judgement of Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Yet we have not done in this argument; For in the fourth Commandement, there is enjoyned, not onely the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apart of ſome time in generall for Gods ſervice; and the proportion of one day in ſeven in ſpeciall, but alſo the particulating of a certaine day under this proportion; and who ſeeth not, that ſo many different things (though one in ſubordination to another) being duly conſidered, it is no way fit to confound them, and to ſpeake hand over head of the fourth Commandement without diſtinctions? </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>Now, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the particularity of the day, herein I confeſſe, wee are more to ſeeke by the light of nature, than for the ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time due unto God; Yet conſider, whether herein alſo we are not aſſiſted in good meaſure by the light of nature, and that in certaine particulars. 1. As firſt the decent propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time being obſerved, it is nothing materiall in it ſelfe, as touching the advancement of the ſubſtance of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; what day of the weeke it be performed under the duly ſpecified proportion. For wee find by experience, that all Maſters ſtand for a proportion of ſervice, which they expect from the hands of their ſervants; the quantity of ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very conſiderable matter in the judgement of all; but whether a man worke the firſt houre of the day, and reſt the ſecond, or five houres in the morning, and reſt the ſixth; or in what other difference ſoever, ſo the quantity and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſervice for that day be performed, all Maſters reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. So for the ſervice of the weeke, if it be ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thus much ſervice, as namely, a dayes ſervice in a weeke, it matters not what day it be done, ſo the work be performed; I ſay, it matters not, as touching the ſubſtance of the worke it ſelfe to be performed. 2. But though it matters not in this
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66015:108"/>
reſpect, on what day the ſervice is performed; yet it may matter much in another reſpect: For whereas we are all Gods creatures, and conſequently his ſervants; and the ſervice wee ſpeake of concernes us all in generall, and that equally, and all wee are reaſonable creatures, 1. Firſt it ſeemes fit in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that there ſhould be an uniformity: For, like as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe together by commerce and trade in the workes of our calling on other dayes of the weeke; ſo it ſeemes moſt fit we ſhould walke together with God in the performance of his ſervice, otherwiſe there would be a manifeſt breach of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For ſuppoſe there be in ſuch a towne as ours, ſeven times foure hundred perſons (for wee have almoſt 2000. Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants; one of the three pariſhes in Reading hath as many) if one 400. ſhould keepe the firſt day of the weeke for their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, another 400. the ſecond day of the weeke, and ſo to divide the dayes of the weeke betweene them, here were a manifeſt breach of ſociety both in thinges humane, and in things Divine; for every day in the weeke 400. would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, from converſing with their brethren, in buſineſſes temporall; and all the reſt from them whoſe day it is to reſt unto God, in exerciſes ſpirituall, which all I preſume by the very light of nature, would judge intolerable. And this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would have place not onely in particular townes among themſelves, but with other alſo; confidering that ſix dayes in the weeke wee have converſe by commerce and trade, not with our neighbours onely, but with other townes alſo, farre and neere. Againe, another inconvenience would ariſe, and that a miſerable one, more dangerous than the former; For hereupon a window will be opened unto diſſention, each ſtanding for his owne way, as the manner of man is; and what could be expected but wretched confuſion ſhould follow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon? Laſtly conſider, ſhould not the ſervice of man prove more comfortable unto him, if God, as hee hath appointed him the proportion of time, ſo he would be pleaſed not to leave him to ſeeke of the particularity of the day under the forementioned proportion. 2. Therefore, as it is fit there ſhould be an uniformity, for the reaſons given; ſo for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of uniformity, no meanes ſufficient, but Gods owne
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66015:109"/>
preſcribing of it, hereupon all juſt occaſion of diſſention will be cut off, confuſion will be prevented, and the ſervice of God, as every way, even in the very circumſtance of time, according to his will, ſhall be the more cheerefully and comfortably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. 3. Thirdly, conſider what D. <hi>Lake</hi> writes in his <hi>Theſes de Sabbato.</hi> Theſ. 44. <hi>Gods Will is underſtood often by his Precept, but when we have not that, the practice doth guide the Church:</hi> 45. <hi>This is a Catholique rule, obſerveable in the inſtitution of all ſacred feaſts, both divine and humane:</hi> 46. <hi>The worke of the day is the ground of hallowing the day, whether it be weekly, moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or yeerely, as particulars evidence in Scripture and Hiſtory:</hi> 47. <hi>No man can tranſlate the workes, therefore no man can tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the day. This is an undoubted rule in Theologie.</hi> Now, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God had not commanded the obſervation of any one day in the weeke, but left it unto man to chooſe; if withall hee ſhould obſerve one day preferred before another in ſome notable worke; what reaſon is there, why man ſhould chooſe any other day rather than that? 1. This diſcourſe proceeds upon ſuppoſition of one day in ſeven, to be ſet apart for Gods ſervice; and accordingly wee being upon the election of the day. Now, conſider the caſe of <hi>Adam;</hi> God having revealed unto him how many dayes he had ſpent in the creating of all things, and in what order hee created them, the laſt day of the ſix being the day wherein he created the beaſts of the field, then man, and after placing him in Paradiſe, and after expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his wiſedome appearing in the naming of the beaſts brought before him, not finding an help meet for him, caſting him in a ſleepe, and taking a rib out of his ſide, thereof made a woman to be a help meet for him. The next day, which was the ſeventh, God reſting from his worke, what day ſhould man have preferred for Gods ſervice before this; conſidering the proportion betweene Gods reſt from his works, and mans reſt from his; and that as this day was the firſt of Gods reſt, ſo it was the firſt of mans worke; And the very Heathens have counted it reaſonable, <hi>à Iove principium,</hi> to begin with God, eſpecially there being no better meanes to take livery and ſeiſin of the world made by God for the ſervice of man, than by the ſervice of God, man being made to this end, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66015:109"/>
accordingly after Gods image, indued with an underſtanding heart to know him, and with rationall affections to feare and ſerve him. And that with the firſt, as <hi>Caietan</hi> obſerveth, and that out of the judgement of reaſon, <hi>Par est ut poſt accepta be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficia agnoſcamus benefactorem quando<expan>

Whereupon are the foundations thereof faſtened? or who laid the corner ſtone thereof. When the morning ſtarres ſang together, and all the ſonnes of God ſhouted for joy.</hi> The ſumme of all is this: 1. It is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and that by the very light of nature, that ſometime, and that in a ſufficient proportion, is to be ſet apart for Gods ſervice. 2. God being our great Lord and Maſter, it is moſt fit, by the very ſuggeſtion of nature, that God himſelfe ſhould ſet forth unto us his ſervants, both the proportion of time, according to which, and the particularity of the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will be ſerved by us. 3. We judge that proportion which God hath deſigned, and the day alſo which he hath marked out to us in his Word, to be moſt agreeable unto reaſon in the conſideration of his works. And in all this I am very willing to remit my ſelfe to the judgement of Doctor <hi>Prideaux.</hi> The next reaſon here mentioned followeth; <hi>Can we conceive that this onely ceremoniall law crept in, we know not how, amongst the morall? Or that the Prophet</hi> Moſes <hi>would have uſed ſuch care in ordering the Decalogue, onely to bring the Church into greater troubles?</hi> I anſwer, that ſome time ſhould be ſet apart for Gods ſervice, was never accounted ceremoniall; As touching the proportion of one day in ſeven dayes to be conſecrated unto God, I never found any Divine ancient or moderne buſie his wits about deviſing any ceremoniality therein; neither did I obſerve any ancient produced to acknowledge any ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality therein; but as it is fit wee ſhould wait upon God for deſigning the proportion of time, (in which reſpect divers count that poſitive) ſo God having deſigned unto us the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66015:110"/>
proportion of time, we are bold to ſay with <hi>Azorius,</hi> that <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioni maxime comſent aneum eſt, It is moſt agreeable to reaſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſix worke dayes to conſecrate one unto God.</hi> As touching the particularity of the day, under the proportion of one in ſeven, there is to be conſidered, both reſt and ſanctification; As for ſanctification, I never read nor heard any man that conſtituted any ceremoniality in the ſanctification of the day, but onely in the reſt of the day; yet all theſe are ſhuffled together, and uſually men talke of the ceremoniality of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement hand over-head without all diſtinction: Now, it is true, the ancient Fathers generally conceived a ceremoniality in the reſt of the ſeventh day; but what was ſignified by this ceremony, I no where find expreſſely, neither in Maſter <hi>Broad,</hi> nor in this diſcourſe. Other Divines of theſe dayes, had rather call it poſitive; but how? Surely in reference onely to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular day, not to the reſt of it, there being a morall reſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to the ſanctification of it, namely, ſo farre forth in reſting from our works, as they are <hi>avocamenta à ſacris ſtudiis &amp; meditationibus,</hi> avocations from ſacred ſtudies and meditations, as <hi>Calvin</hi> expreſſeth it, and I know none that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from him herein. <hi>Aquinas</hi> is of the ſame judgement; but withall he confeſſeth, that the Jewes obſerved the reſt of this day <hi>for a myſterious ſignification ſake,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, ceremonially; in which reſpect it ought to be abrogated, when the body came that was ſignified thereby. So that this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders the morality of one day in ſeven, no nor the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of any one particular day that Gods Word ſhall commend unto us for our Sabbath, and that unalterable, ſave by that authority whereby it was introduced; Neither had <hi>Moſes</hi> any hand, that I know, in ordering the Decalogue, it being firſt pronounced by the mouth of God, and afterwards written in tables by the finger of God. Nor did the deſigning of a day expoſe the Church to any trouble, much leſſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the proportion of time; It being moſt requiſite, the Law-maker ſhould deſigne each of theſe for the preventing of trouble; and each being thus deſigned, we find the deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to be moſt agreeable unto reaſon. <hi>If Torniellus thought it hardly credible that Enoſh ſhould appart himſelfe from</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:66015:110"/>
                  <hi>the ſonnes of</hi> Cain <hi>to call upon the Name of the Lord, without ſome certaine and appointed time for that performance. I doe</hi> not thinke that Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> conceaves it credible, that any wiſe man would thinke if fit that the ſervant, and not rather the Maſter ſhould apportion out that ſervice which is due unto his Lord and maſter; or that it is more fit the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhould have the deſignation of the particular time rather then the maſter, the former reaſons duly conſidered. Or is there any reaſon why <hi>Calvin</hi> ſhould have ſo little authority, when hee diſcourſeth in reaſon for the originall inſtitution of the Sabbath, as from the Creation; and ſo great authority when hee ſpeakes upon his bare word againſt the morality of one day in ſeven (as ſome thinke) <hi>Septenarium numerum non ita moror, ut ejus ſervituti quicquam aſtringerem.</hi> It is an eaſy matter to ſay they conclude nothing; though I may juſtly wonder any reaſonable man ſhould ſay ſo of the argument drawne from thoſe words <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Therefore God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctifyed it;</hi> the author alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other exception againſt it, but the interpretation of <hi>Toſtatus,</hi> namely, that it is delivered by way of anticipation. For this is as good as to confeſſe, that <hi>to bleſſe and ſanctify the ſeventh day,</hi> is all one as if hee had ſaid that God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be ſanctified. Onely they will not have it underſtood of that time, when the Lord reſted from the works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that the meaning of <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be this, <hi>In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day God ended the works which he had made, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day God reſted from all the workes which he had made, and becauſe God reſted on that ſeventh day from all the works that he had made, therefore he commanded,</hi> not then that, that day from thence forward; but 2400. yeares after, that men ſhould conſecrate that day to divine ſervice. Now in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting againſt the unreaſonableneſſe of this interpretation given by <hi>Toſtatus,</hi> I am very willing to make Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> my judge, and (as it were) under his moderation to proceed in this. And here I purpoſe not to revive the diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Walaeus,</hi> and <hi>Rivetus</hi> againſt <hi>Toſtatus</hi> his anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but onely to content my ſelfe with the ground layd by Doctor <hi>Lake</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> in his Theſis
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66015:111"/>
of the Sabbath, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 46. <hi>The worke of the day is the ground of hallowing the day, whether it be weekly, monthly or yearely, as particulars evince in Scripture and Hiſtory.</hi> I make bold to lay this for my ground in this place, becauſe it is apparant that God made his worke on the ſeventh day, the ground of hallowing that day, namely, becauſe it was the day of Gods reſt, therfore to make it the day of mens reſt, for the ſanctifying of it unto the Lord. Now I pray conſider is it reaſonable, that becauſe ſuch or ſuch a worke hath beene done in ſuch a day, provoking us to keepe it a feſtivall day unto the Lord, therefore it becomes us accordingly to ſanctify it, but when? not that day nor the ſame day ſenight, nor throughout the 52. weekes of that yeare, nor any of the 52. weekes the next yeare; no nor for the ſpace of a 1000 yeares, or two thouſand: but after the expiration of 2500 yeares and more, then and not till then to ſanctify that day, becauſe on that day of the weeke the Lord reſted from the worke of Creation, 2500 yeares before? why might not the wiſdome of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have imitated God, and in memory of our deliverance from the Gunpowder treaſon, on the 5. of <hi>November,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined that day, ſhould bee kept feſtivall, ſo far forth as in the publique congregation to make a ſolemne, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full commemoration of that wonderfull deliverance, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin forſooth a thouſand or two thouſand yeares after. So the Jewes obſerved yearely the feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi> in remembrance of Gods mercifull deliverance of them, from the conſpiracy of <hi>Haman,</hi> but when did they ordaine this feaſt to begin? not till a thouſand yeares after, had they done ſo, who would not have ſaid, that their wiſdome herein had exceeded all humane diſcretion? Or to avoid the like unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe on their ſide, well they ſay that the caſe is not alike; for as much as the freſh remembrance of the Creation, and of Gods reſting on the ſeventh day was ſufficient unto them, both for the maintaining of the diviſion of time into weekes or ſeven dayes; and of ſanctifying each ſeventh unto the Lord; but when the memory hereof began to be obliterated, to wit, about ſome 900 yeares after the flood, then it was fit the Lord ſhould revive the obſervation of this day, by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:66015:111"/>
Commandement? But herby they ſhall make the fourth Commandement not only morall, but alſo more naturall then they are aware. Though I willingly confeſſe they might well conceave that after ſome 15 or 1600 yeares, men might grow weary of obſerving the ſeventh day, the day of Gods reſt from the worke of Creation, becauſe by experience we finde that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome 15 or 1600 yeares, Chriſtians ſeem to grow weary of keeping holy the Lords day, the day whereon the Lord Chriſt roſe from the grave, &amp; ſo reſted from his worke of redemption. But as not long after 1600 yeares the flood came to ſet an end to the World by water; ſo it may be after 1600 yeares of the Goſpell, there are but as few yeares to the comming of Chriſt, to ſet an end unto this World by fire: certainely, as often as ſome feſtivall day, is grounded upon ſome ſingular worke of God done, on that day (which Doctor <hi>Lake</hi> propoſeth as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and undoubted rule, alwayes to hold concerning feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls) no time more fit for the obſervation of ſuch a day, then when the memory of the worke is freſh; then is a man like to be more devout, more chearefull in Gods ſervice, more thankefull unto him for his great goodneſſe, like as the Angells imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly upon their Creation praiſed God <hi>Iob.</hi> 38. 7. <hi>When the Starres of the morning praiſed me, and all the children of God rejoyced,</hi> which in <hi>Cornelius</hi> his language was to obſerve the Sabbath. Now give mee leave to enlarge this by proportion. As there are Sabbaths of rejoycing, ſo there are Sabbaths of mourning. And the expiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day commanded unto the Jewes, was an annuall feaſt, to inure them to this holy exerciſe, not onely once a yeare, but oftner, as God ſhould miniſter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: Now this day is called by the Lord alſo a Sabbath, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 31. And Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> in his paterne of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheticall doctrine, handles the duties of ſuch a day, in his doctrine of the Sabbath. And it is well knowne that dayes of wrath have their courſe, and ſhall have their courſe, as long as this World laſteth as well as dayes of mercy: And wee have cauſe to bleſſe God that hee hath inclined his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties heart to take notice of ſuch dayes of wrath; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly by Proclamation, to command a generall humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation throughout the Land, divers and ſundry times. So
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66015:112"/>
wee reade that the Jewes obſerved a faſt on the firſt moneth, (beſides the faſt of the ſeventh which God commanded) as wee reade <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 3. 5. and it was obſerved on the tenth day of that moneth; that being the day whereon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> burnt the houſe of the Lord, as wee reade, <hi>Ier.</hi> 52. 12, 13. Now thus far had they obſerved the 70 yeares of their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 5. they did not put off the obſervation of it till a thouſand yeares after; it being moſt fit, then eſpecially to mourne, when God calleth us thereunto, and not to put it off when hee calleth us thereunto; the Lord ſore complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſuch courſes, and pronouncing an heavy judgement upon offenders in this kinde, <hi>Eſay</hi> 22. 12, 13, 14. Now like as it becomes us to mourne, when firſt God calleth us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſo it becommeth us to rejoyce in keeping a feſtivall unto him, when hee calleth us thereunto; leſt otherwiſe it prove out of ſeaſon, when it is begun a long time after, and utterly neglected upon the freſh memory thereof. Wee reade that when the <hi>Ilienſes,</hi> inhabitants of <hi>Ilium</hi> called anciently by the name of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſent an Embaſſage to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole the death of his Father <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> hee conſidering the unſeaſonableneſſe thereof, it being a long time after his death; requited them accordingly ſaying, that hee was ſorry for their heavineſſe alſo, having loſt ſo renowned a Knight as <hi>Hector</hi> was, to wit, above a thouſand years before, in the warres of <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely when in the fourth Commandement, and in the reaſon given it is ſayd; <hi>For in ſix dayes the Lord made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, the Sea and all that in them is, and reſted the ſeventh day; therefore the Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it,</hi> it ſtands with far better reaſon to conceave the meaning hereof, in reference to time paſt, thus; therefore the Lord commanded the ſanctification of it 2500 yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; then to underſtand <hi>Moſes</hi> words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Therefore the Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it</hi> in reference to the time to come thus, <hi>therefore the Lord commanded that ſeventh day to be ſanctified</hi> 2500 <hi>yeares after.</hi> And obſerve I pray the forme of words in the fourth Commandement, when it is ſayd, <hi>Therefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day,</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:66015:112"/>
                  <hi>and ſanctified it,</hi> not of the time preſent that hee now doth bleſſe it, and ſanctify it, but of the time paſt, therefore hee did bleſſe it, and ſanctifie it; and when I pray but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Creation, that very day whereon hee firſt reſted, and conſequently that very day, he commanded the ſeventh day to be ſanctified; for to ſanctifie the day is to command the ſanctification of it, as is confeſſed; otherwiſe there were no place to plead anticipation. And that the phraſe of ſpeech muſt ſignifie Gods Command for the ſanctification of it, I have already proved.</p>
               <p>As for the Fathers affirming that the ancient Patriarches did not obſerve the Sabbath, albeit their authority is of no force to countervaile ſo manifeſt evidence both of Scripture it ſelfe; and of the reaſon drawne from the diviſion of time into weekes, even from the creation, and ſo continued unto the Jewes in the very dayes of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Yet I may be bold to ſay, we have better authority from the ancients for juſtifying of our cauſe than our adverſaries have for theirs. <hi>Walaeus</hi> hath repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theophilus, Antiochenus, Auſtin, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</hi> maintaining that the juſtification of the Sabbath hath beene from the Creation: To theſe <hi>Rivetus</hi> addes <hi>Tertullian</hi> as of the ſame mind, howſoever alleged on the adverſaries part. And he alſo acknowledgeth the Jewes to be of the ſame opinion: <hi>Beda</hi> is alleged indeed by <hi>Perenius</hi> as on the part of <hi>Toſtatus,</hi> but no ſuch thing appeares in his <hi>Hexameron,</hi> but rather expreſſely the contrary (his words being theſe of the Sabbath, <hi>ſemper celebrari ſolebat)</hi> as I have ſhewed in my anſwer to the preface; <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note> though ſome are willing to admit that of <hi>Torniellus,</hi> that in the accompliſhment of the Creation, the Angels did obſerve the Sabbath, provided he recompence them in this particular now in queſtion, and adde <hi>that the obſervance of it here upon the earth was not till many ages after.</hi> Yet this naked authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being little worth, his reaſon is ſo weake in the former, that we have cauſe to ſuſpect it will not prove any thing ſtronger in the latter; though I ſhould have beene content to afford it due conſideration had it been propoſed: As for the Angels ſinging and ſhouting for joy, this was performed, as <hi>Torritallus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, the day wherein <hi>the foundation of the earth was laid,</hi> which undoubtedly could not be after the firſt day of the creation. For if the foundation of the earth was not laid then, when the Lord ſaid, that <hi>it was without forme and voyd, and the waters covered it,</hi> I cannot deviſe when it ſhould be; It is granted that it may be probably conjectured, that the ſanctification of the Sabbath was before the Law, as concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring herein with <hi>Calvin,</hi> but that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith that no more, is not proved, neither is that paſſage exhibited wherein <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> ſhould deliver his mind ſo coldly thereof; but <hi>Calvin</hi> in his harmony upon the foure bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and on the fourth Precept, is expreſſe, that <hi>Diem ſeptimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſibi ſumpſit Deus ac conſecravit completa mundi creatione,</hi> that God aſſumed and conſecrated the ſeventh day unto himſelfe upon the finiſhing of the worlds creation. And it is enough for us, that then it was inſtituted; and hereupon let every ſober reader judge, whether it be not more then probable, that the holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches at leaſt obſerved it. Neither doe we affect that any man ſhould reſt ſatisfied with our conjectures; but let our reaſons be conſidered, and the plaine Text of Scripture profeſſing that

If after the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were delivered on Mount <hi>Sina;</hi> what neede of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the equity thereof, ſeeing the equity, and that in this very way, is expreſſed in the Commandement it ſelfe, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:66015:114"/>
that in ſuch manner as to manifeſt evidently that God did not now begin to command this, but that hee commanded it of old, even from the Creation, as already I have diſputed and proved. And though <hi>Abulenſis</hi> were of this opinion, yet <hi>Catarinus</hi> was not; and though <hi>Pererius</hi> the Jeſuite tooke part with <hi>Toſtatus,</hi> yet <hi>Rivetus</hi> hath ſhewed that <hi>Cornelius de lapide, Emmanuel Sa. Ribera,</hi> all Jeſuites do not, but with <hi>Catarinus</hi> rather, or that <hi>Steuchus, Eugubinus, Genebrard, and Iacobus Salianus</hi> concurre with them, againſt the opinion of <hi>Toſtatus, Gomarus</hi> acknowledgeth <hi>Marius</hi> alſo to be of the ſame minde, all Papiſts; and let mee adde unto theſe all the Remiſts, as appeares in their notes upon <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Enoſh might call upon the Lord, and Abraham offer ſacrifice, without relation to a ſet, and appointed time, oftner and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer as they had occaſion.</hi> It was in the former <hi>Section</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>Torniellus</hi> his reaſon which here is anſwered; now <hi>Torniellus</hi> was of a contrary opinion to us in this particular, yet hee confeſſeth that it ſeemed <hi>hardly credible;</hi> neither doth the Doctor deny it, onely hee ſaith that <hi>Enoſh might ſo doe;</hi> hee doth not ſay hee did; yet undoubtedly many things are done that are hardly credible ſhould be done, much more might bee done, though indeed they are not; Yet this is none of our arguments; but ſuch as it is, let us not extenuate it, but take it aright as it deſerves to be taken. <hi>Torniellus</hi> ſuppoſeth that <hi>Enoſh did apart himſelfe from the ſonnes of</hi> Cain; Now <hi>Enoſh</hi> was not alone in this, for the Text ſaith, <hi>Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord,</hi> not <hi>Enoſh</hi> alone. Now in ſeparation, they that ſeparate from the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in an holy manner have reaſon to congregate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the ſame holineſſe is as powerfully effectuall to the one as to the other; and they are called <hi>the Sonnes of God,</hi> in diſtinction from the ſonnes, and <hi>daughtes of men, Gen.</hi> 6. 2. though then the very ſonnes of God began to degenerate. And that theſe meetings of many ſhould be without a ſet, and appointed time, I cannot deviſe any colour of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. 1. For that they could not all meete in one congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. that meeting in diverſe, the children of God ſhould deſire that at one time their meeting might be, the prayers
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:66015:114"/>
of many concurring in the ſame faith, and joyning together doe beſiege Gods Eares, and worke an holy violence upon him. 3. otherwiſe, there would be a breach of ſociety and mutuall commerce, that being an holy day in one place or countrey which was not in another. 4. being divided farre off it would be moſt difficult to make new appointments. 5. little likelihood of agreement herein if left unto themſelves, without ſome divine direction and appointment. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, the next portion of the diſcourſe is this. <hi>And as for the not falling of the Manna on the Sabbath day, this rather was a preparation to the Commandement, then any promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</hi> But ſuppoſe it had beene a promulgation of it, what could that hinder the diſcourſe of <hi>Iacobs</hi> not neglecting <hi>Labans</hi> flocke upon conſcience of the Sabbath, which was long before the children of <hi>Iſraells</hi> going downe into <hi>Egypt;</hi> whereas Manna fell not untill their departing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and comming into the Wilderneſſe, which was diverſe hundreds of yeeres after. But yet the ordering of the Manna in the falling of it ſix dayes, and not the ſeventh; doth evidently argue that this ſeventh ſtanding in juſt correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the ſeventh day from the Creation, (as appeares by the ſtory following) the dividing of time into weekes, and ſeptenaries from the Creation, was exactly obſerved from the Creation all along untill that time: And no leſſe evidently doth it manifeſt, that the Sabbath day was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before the Law given on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and conſequently either by light of nature directing them to the day of the weeke whereon God reſted; or by Commandement, and Commandement wee finde none before that on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> unleſſe that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. Goe for a Commandement from the beginning.</p>
               <p>The firſt mention wee reade of the Sabbath is that <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23. Where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath ſayd, to morrow is the reſt of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord;</hi> and let every one judge whether there bee any forme of a Commandement in this, and whether hee doth not ſpeake unto them of a Sabbath as of a thing formerly well knowne unto them, and <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>To day is the Sabbath unto the Lord;</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:66015:115"/>
                  <hi>to day yee ſhall not find it in the feild.</hi> This is not ſpoken as if the condition of a Sabbath were any new thing unto them. But let us ſee whether there be any great ſtrength in that which followeth. <hi>Put the caſe that Iacob on the Sabbath had neglected Labans flook, and that the Iſraelites under Pharaoh had not made up their tale of brickes, neither had he eſcaped a chiding, nor they the inſolent fury of their taskmaſters. And now according to the principles of theſe Sabbatarians, what would you counſaile them to doe? did they obſerve the Sabbath? they were ſure of puniſhment from man, did they neglect it, they were ſure of vengeance from the Lord, unto ſuch ſtreights are they reduced, who would impoſe the Sabbath as a perpetuall Law of nature.</hi> As for the firſt of theſe, wee cannot be ignorant, that both flockes of ſheepe, and heads of greater cattell were looked unto in the time of the moſt rigorous obſervation of the Sabbath. Our Saviour obſerves the Jewes practiſe (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their rigour this way) was to unlooſe their Oxe, and leade him to watering: Neither was <hi>Laban</hi> ſo rigorous a Lord to <hi>Iacob</hi> being from the firſt his unckle, and afterwards his father in Law, and one that had as good meanes to know the ſtory of the Creation as <hi>Jacob,</hi> and how that the Lord from the beginning <hi>Bleſſedthe ſeaventh day, and ſanctified it;</hi> afterwards <hi>Iacobs</hi> poſterity met with Taske-maſters in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And if the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had made conſcience of ſetting ſome time apart for the ſervice of God, according to the ſuggeſtion of that light which is confeſſed to extend ſo farre by nature, how improbable is it they would deny this unto their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? The Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> did not uſe them ſo hard, but promoted their ſacrifices <hi>that they might pray for the King,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezr. 6. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Kings Children; Traian</hi> made a Law that the Jewes ſhould not be moleſted on their Sabbath. The <hi>Turkes</hi> at this day give liberty unto Chriſtians for the free exerciſe of their religion. And why ſhould wee thinke the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> more rigorous to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> then the <hi>Babylonians</hi> were to the <hi>Iewes?</hi> Or if alike; why may not a man conclude as well of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> that <hi>If they did obſerve the Sabbath they were ſure of puniſhment from man, if they did neglect it, they were ſure of vengeance from God.</hi>

The <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> enjoyning the celebration of the Lords day hath this caution, <hi>ſi poſſint;</hi> which is thought to be ſpoken in reference to ſervants under the tyranny of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then maſters. And if the obſervation of the Sabbath may give way to the exerciſe of charity towards others, and of mercy towards beaſts, may it not much more to the exerciſe of mercy towards our owne bodies? yet what if all this were granted? who ſeeth not that if there be any ſtrength in this argument they may by as good reaſon diſpute againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity under perſecuting tyrants. For if they doe profeſſe chriſtianity under ſuch; <hi>they are ſure of puniſhment from man;</hi> if not, <hi>they are ſure of vengeance from God.</hi> So that to no ſuch ſtraights are wee put as is deviſed, like as the ſtate of the queſtion obtruded upon us is deviſed alſo, but that I have formerly cleered, and ſhewed that wee are to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. 1. of time in generall to be ſet apart for Gods ſervice. 2. of the proportion of time in ſpeciall. 3. of the day under that proportion of time in particular. And how farre the light of nature doth—direct us in all theſe. That the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the ſeventh day as commanded from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto man, I have already proved in the former <hi>Section,</hi> and alſo that reaſon juſtifieth this drawne from the diviſion of time into weekes, as which had its courſe from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World; and how authority both ancient, and moderne doth countenance this way of ours farre more then the contrary. And <hi>Manaſſes ben Iſrael</hi> one of the ancient wiſe Doctors of the Jewes obſerves, that when the Jewes are bid to remember that they were ſervants in <hi>Egypt,</hi> this is as if it had beene ſayd, remember how that in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where thou ſervedſt, thou waſt conſtrayned to worke even upon the Sabbath day. In <hi>Exod. quaeſt.</hi> 36. Upon the Lords bleſſing the ſeventh day and ſanctifying it from the beginning of the World, and upon the fourth Commandement is founded our obſervation of the Sabbath; as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; that God hath manifeſted from the beginning that one day in the circle of the weeke ought to be ſet apart for a ſpirituall reſt.</p>
               <p>All confeſſe that there is a difference betweene. 1. Time in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:66015:116"/>
generall to be ſet apart for Gods ſervice. 2. And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of that time. 3. And the particularity of the day in that proportion. The firſt is generally receaved to be morall, the other two ſome had rather call poſitive, then ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, becauſe they conceave it to have beene inſtituted in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe before the fall, when there was no neede of any ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. They who do moſt judiciouſly diſcourſe of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the fourth Commandement, doe not call it ceremoniall hand over head, but with reference to the reſt of the day. And herein the ceremoniality they apply to the reſt on the ſeventh day. As for the ceremoniality to be found in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time indefinitely conſidered, as in one day of ſeaven, I never read nor heard, till now. Yet wherein this ceremoniality doth conſiſt, I meane the thing ſignified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is not explicated at all, neither in reſpect of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time, as of one day in ſeven, nor in reference to the particular day. Yet the Jewes reſt on the ſeventh day, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conceaved to prefigure Chriſts reſt in the grave that day full and whole, and onely that day. And as Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in his Starre Chamber ſpeech profeſſeth, <hi>that It hath ever been the Churches doctrine that Chriſt made an end of all Sabbaths by his Sabbath in the grave. That Sabbath was the laſt of them.</hi> So <hi>Auſtin de Gen. ad lit. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>Beda</hi> in <hi>Hexameron</hi> on <hi>Geneſis, Aquin.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 121. <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>Piſcat.</hi> on <hi>Luc.</hi> 14. And albeit <hi>the reſt from workes</hi> may have a ceremoniall ſignification of a reſt from ſinne in the way of grace, as, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 20. 12. and a reſt both from ſin, and ſorrow; (which is alſo a ſpeciall worke of ours through ſin, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>haſt thou not procured this unto thy ſelfe becauſe thou haſt forſaken the Lord.) and that in the way of glory, Hebr.</hi> 4. yet this is no ſuch ceremony as to be aboliſhed upon the fulfilling of the thing ſignified; for even the Jewes under the Law had their reſt from ſinne (in the way of grace) as wee Chriſtians under the Goſpell, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe obſerved the Sabbath, and that glorious reſt which ſhall not be accompliſhed till the end of the World, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called an eternall Sabbath. And undoubtedly that is to be accompted as a reſt morall whereunto the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66015:116"/>
of the day calleth us, namely to reſt from all workes, as they are <hi>Avocations from ſacred studies, and meditations.</hi> But doth <hi>Abulenſis</hi> accompt the reſt of one day in ſeven ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and not morall? Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> relates him as of an other opinion, and diſtinguiſhing thus. <hi>There are ſome things which are ſimply morall, and ſome things ſimply ceremoniall; and ſome things of a mixt kinde, as being partly morall, partly ceremoniall. Simply morall are thoſe things which are grounded on the judgement of naturall reaſon, as when naturall reaſon doth dictate that ſome time is to be ſet apart for Gods ſervice; But preciſely to appoint the ſeventh day more then any day of the weeke, is ſimply ceremoniall, quia non habet fundamentum à ratione, ſed à voluntate condentis legem; becauſe it is not groundedon reaſon, but on the will of the law-maker. But to appoint one day of ſeven, and that day wholy for the ſpace of</hi> 24. <hi>houres to conſecrate to Gods ſervice, as therein to abſtaine from all kinds of worke, theſe things are not purely or ſimply ceremoniall, but partly morall as grounded on the judgement of reaſon, though not totally and wholy. For the firſt, if above one day in the weeke ſhould be kept perpetually holy, Gravamen eſſet laborantibus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties vacare; it were a grievance to labourers to reſt from worke ſo oft</hi> (his meaning is in this caſe, they could not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provide for themſelves, and their families, as touching the maintenance of this life temporall) <hi>and if but one day in a fortnight or a month ſhould be appointed, obliviſceremur Dei per deſuetudinem cultus ipſius. We ſhould forget God through not accuſtoming our ſelves ſufficiently to his ſervice. Therefore it ſtands with reaſon that one day in ſeven ſhould be celebrated to the Lord.</hi> This ſurely is not to deny the proportion of one day in ſeven to be conſecrated unto the Lord, to be morall; but to confirme it rather. Neither doe I finde that <hi>Aquinas</hi> reſolves it ſo, as here it is pretended; that which hee ſayth to be ceremoniall, is applied by him onely to the particular day of the weeke. Indeed hee doth ſay that the proportion of one day in ſeven to be conſecrated to the Lord, is morall, neither doth hee deny it; onely hee ſayth, it is morall that ſome time ſhould be ſet apart for Gods ſervice. And it may be under this he comprehends the proportion of one day in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:66015:117"/>
For albeit hee treads in <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſteps when hee ſayth, <hi>Morale eſt quatenus natura docet &amp; pietas poſtulat, ut aliquis dies deſtinetur quieti, ab operibus ſervilibus, quo divino cultui vacare poſſit Eccleſiá; ceremoniale eſt quatenus ſeptimus dies fuit praeſcriptus, &amp; non alius.</hi> It is morall to have a day deſtinate to reſt from ſervile workes ſo to be free for Gods ſervice. It is ceremoniall, that the ſeventh day, and no other is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for this: yet a little before hee manifeſteth that <hi>by one day to be ſet apart,</hi> for this he meanes one day in ſeven, when he thus ſayth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Morale eſt mandatum, quatenus praecipit ut è ſeptem diebus</hi>

                  <hi>unum conſecremus cultui divino—&amp; proinde quatenus tale mandatum eſt nunquam fuit abrogatum nec abrogari poteſt.</hi> The Commandement is morall as it commands us to conſecrate one day in ſeven unto divine ſervice. And ſo doth <hi>Dominicus Bannes</hi> 22. <hi>q.</hi> 44. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; Bellarmine de cultu Sanctorum lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. And if no other be the opinion of <hi>Aquinas, if the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of what ſect ſoever ſay the ſame;</hi> it followeth that they differ no more from us then <hi>Aquinas</hi> did; it may be they will be found to agree with us. For I doe not thinke any ſchooleman, being put to it will deny but that by the very light of nature, not onely ſometime, but a ſufficient propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time muſt be ſet apart for Gods ſervice. And albeit had we beene left unto our ſelves without any indication of this proportion from God, wee might well have beene to ſeeke in the ſetting forth of this convenient proportion. Yet conſidering how God hath gone before us making the World in ſix daies, and reſting the ſeventh, and conſidering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the diviſion of time into ſeptenaries of dayes, reaſon I ſhould thinke with <hi>Toſtatus,</hi> doth dictate that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of one day in ſeven was more convenient then any other. Or if this were not ſufficient for our direction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; yet when God hath manifeſted unto us both after the Creation, and in the fourth Commandement what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time hee likes beſt for this (as it is in reaſon fit that the Maſter, eſpecially ſuch a Maſter ſhould preſcribe what proportion of time ſhall be ſet apart for his ſervice) then with <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> wee have cauſe by the very light of nature
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66015:117"/>
undoubtedly to conclude; that if in the beginning, and under the Law God required one day in ſeven to be conſecrated to his ſervice; wee ſurely cannot allow unto him a worſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion under the Goſpell. And <hi>Iacobus de Valentia adverſ. Judae. q.</hi> 2. <hi>Praeceptum de Sabbato celebrando eſt partim morale</hi>

By the way, it doth not follow from any evidence, that either theſe or <hi>Toſtatus</hi> have given, that the aſſigning of one day above another was ceremoniall, taking this word (ceremoniall) in proper ſpeech: for 1. it may be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted poſitive. 2. what have wee to doe with ceremonialls (in proper ſpeech) now under the Goſpell, who yet doe ſtill obſerve one day in ſeven. 3. nay why may not that alſo juſtly be accompted morall, if God hath marked out that day wee celebrate by ſome notable worke, to be conſecrated to the Lord, above others? eſpecially accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Biſhop <hi>Lake</hi> his grounds, namely that the <hi>worke of</hi>

For albeit <hi>Brentius</hi> upon <hi>Leviticus</hi> affirmes, that the Church may in theſe dayes obſerve but one day in 14. if they will. Yet not onely <hi>Gomarus,</hi> and <hi>Rivet</hi> profeſſe that under the Goſpell wee muſt allow a better proportion of time for Gods ſervice, rather then a worſe, in reference to that which was allowed under the Law: But <hi>Luther tom.</hi> 5. <hi>fol.</hi> 610. profeſſeth that <hi>ad minimum unus dies aliquis per hebdomadam,</hi> is to be choſen for Gods worſhip, and <hi>Baldwin</hi> in his caſes of conſcience. 2. c. 13. <hi>caſ.</hi> 2. touching feaſts. <hi>It is morall</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>to ſanctifie one day in ſeven.</hi> Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> confeſſeth as much in his Eccleſiaſticall policy.

For if it be reaſonable that one day in ſeven ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the eaſe, and recreation of ſervants; what day ſhall be their Sabbath, if not the day of reſt? and if this be moſt reaſonable, I hope in the ſecond place it will be judged moſt unreaſonable that there ſhould be one Sabbath for the Maſter, and another for the ſervants: undoubtedly, now God hath gone before us in allotting this proportion of time for his ſervice; wee may be bold to ſay with <hi>Azorius</hi> (and that incorreſpondency to <hi>Toſtatus</hi> his diſcourſe) that <hi>rationi maximè conſentaneum eſt after ſix worke dayes to conſecrate one unto divine ſervice.</hi> And ſeeing God hath required ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time for his ſervice under the Law: by the very light of nature it appeares to be moſt unreaſonable wee ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him a worſe proportion under the Goſpell, and <hi>Calvin</hi> profeſſeth that <hi>Nobis cum veteri populo quoad hanc partem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis eſt Sabbati neceſſitas.</hi> We have as much neede of a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath <note place="margin">

As touching the three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars wherein <hi>Toſtatus</hi> is vouched to affirme the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to bee <hi>an unſtable, and alterable ceremony.</hi> Firſt I have not hitherto found, that <hi>Toſtatus</hi> confoundeth the proportion of one day in ſeven, with the particular day under this proportion; as if theſe were equally ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. The reſt on the ſeventh day in the judgement of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients prefigured the reſt of Chriſt (that day) in his grave, and in that reſpect was accompted by them ceremoniall. But as for the proportion of one day in ſeven, never yet did I meete with any who ſet his wits on worke to deviſe any thing in Chriſt to be prefigured thereby, that ſo it alſo might be accompted ceremoniall. Yet I nothing doubt but this proportion is alterable by that power whereby it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, but not by any inferiour power; and ſo it is accompted by <hi>Jacobus de Valentia, ſtabile &amp; aeternum,</hi> ſtable and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; and moſt unreaſonable that wee ſhould not be bound to allow as good a proportion of ſervice unto God under the Goſpell, as the Jewes were bound to allow him under the Law.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the ſeventh day being ceremoniall, wee hold not onely with <hi>Toſtatus</hi> that it is alterable, but with <hi>Stella</hi> that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:66015:119"/>
it muſt be altered; and I hope the word it ſelfe affords evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough for this. It is true, the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the very front commands <hi>the ſanctifying the Sabbath</hi> not the ſeventh day, but the Sabbath: and in like maner it ends with profeſſing that the Lord <hi>Bleſſed the Sabbath day</hi> (not the ſeventh) <hi>&amp; ſanctified it.</hi> But when the queſtion is made <hi>what Sabbath?</hi> I ſhould rather anſwer <hi>a reſt from all ſervile works,</hi> then as here it is anſwered, <hi>The ſeventh day.</hi> For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly God doth not therein command us to reſt the ſeventh day in correſpondency to the ſeventh day from the Creation, there is commanded one day in ſeven, and a ſeventh after ſix dayes of worke. But wee muſt leave it unto God as to preſcribe unto us, the Maſter to his ſervants, the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time to be ſet apart for his ſervice, ſo the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the day alſo under the ſpecified proportion; leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe there might be as many different opinions herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, and courſes according thereunto amongſt the people of God, as there be dayes in the weeke. Now God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the ſeventh day of the weeke unto the Jewes for their Sabbath; but the firſt day of the weeke, hee hath appointed unto us for our Sabbath; ſtill obſerving ſix dayes worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and a ſeventh of reſt unto God, after. And thus <hi>Zanchy</hi> a learned and judicious Divine interpreteth the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in 4. praecept. <hi>p.</hi> 599. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>Stat ſententia non ſine cauſa factum eſſe, ut in ſubſtantia praecepti dictum non ſit, Memento ut diem ſeptimum, ſed ut diem Sabbati. i. quietis ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.

For by this meanes, wee alſo keepe this precept in ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Day.</p>
               <p>So that this is not the opinion of Doctor <hi>Bownde</hi> onely, and of Maſter <hi>Perkins,</hi> but of <hi>Zanchy</hi> alſo, and <hi>Iacobus de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia adverſ.

                  <hi>time, in as much as it celebrates it on the day, whereon it ought to be celebrated,</hi> and concludes, <hi>So the precept of the Sabbath as it is morall remaines in the new time celebrated on the Lords day.</hi> So <hi>Dominicus Bannes</hi> formerly alleaged diſtinguiſheth <hi>the ſubſtance of the praecept, from the particular determination of the day;</hi> and addes, that by a poſitive precept <hi>the ſeventh day was deſigned unto the Iewes; but afterwards under the Law of grace</hi>

                  <hi>was deſigned the day of the Lords Reſurrection, So that alwayes to Gods faithfull people was deſigned one day in the weeke, for Divine Service.</hi> Whereas <hi>other feſtivities</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>are in courſe by the inſtitution of the Church.</hi> And Doctor <hi>Andreues</hi> alſo ſheweth out of Math. 24. 20. <hi>that there muſt needs be a Sabbath after Chriſts death,</hi> and addes, that <hi>Thoſe which were ceremonies were abrogated: but thoſe which were not cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were changed; as the Miniſtery from the</hi> Levites <hi>to be choſen throughout the World. So here the day changed from the day of the</hi> Jewes <hi>to the Lords Day,</hi> Revel. 1. 10. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpreteth the fourth Commandement as belonging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us Chriſtians as bound to obſerve the Sabbath 1. <hi>in our judgment by a reverend eſteeming of it, not as a day appointed by man.</hi> 2. <hi>in our uſe ſet downe,</hi> Eſay 58. 13. <hi>not following our owne will, nor doing our owne workes.</hi> Hereupon a queſtion is propoſed thus. <hi>But is not the Sabbath a ceremony, and ſo abrogated by Chriſt?</hi> and the anſwer is this, <hi>Do as Chriſt did in the caſe of divorce, looke whether it were ſo from the beginning; Now the beginning of the Sabbath was in Paradiſe before there was any ſin, and ſo before there needed any Saviour, and if they ſay it prefigured the reſt we ſhall have from our ſins in Chriſt, We grant it, and therefore the day is changed, but no ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony proved.</hi> The <hi>practiſe of piety</hi> is a booke dedicated unto his Majeſty that now is, when hee was <hi>Prince Carles</hi> in the yeere 1626. which is now 15. yeeres agoe, came forth the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Edition of it; wee have heard it highly commended by King <hi>Iames,</hi> and that it commended the author of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to a Biſhoprick. The author of this treatiſe, is large upon the Sabbath, and concurres with us in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar wherein wee are by the Prefacer to this tranſlation op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Amongſt other particulars this is one, that hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66015:120"/>
the fourth Commandement as <hi>Zanchy</hi> doth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The Commandement doth not ſay. Remember to keepe holy the ſeventh day next following the ſixt day of the Creation or this or that ſeventh day: but indefinitely, Remember that thou keepe holy a Sabbath day,</hi> and that <hi>Our Lord Ieſus having authority as Lord over the Sabbath, had likewiſe far greater reaſon to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Sabbath day, from the Iewiſh ſeventh unto the ſeventh day whereon Chriſtians doe keepe their Sabbath;</hi> which alſo hee proves by diverſe reaſons. And the booke of Homilies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all our Miniſters are required to ſubſcribe, profeſſeth that wee Chriſtians are ſtill bound to the obſervation of the Sabbath, and that the Sunday is now our Sabbath. So then as the Jewes were tied to the obſervation of the Sabbath on the day preſcribed too them, ſo are wee Chriſtians tied to the obſervation of the Sabbath too, but on the day preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto us; ſhould wee obſerve the ſame day with the Jewes, wee ſhould fall juſtly under <hi>Auſtins</hi> cenſure, that <hi>every ſuch one carnaliter ſapit.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſeth that <hi>Doctores Eccleſiae decreverunt omnem gloriam Iudaici Sabbati</hi>

                  <hi>in illam transferre.</hi> The Doctors of the Church have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to transferre all the glory of the Jewes Sabbath unto the Lords Day. So that the cenſure following in theſe words. <hi>They therefore are but idly buſied, who would ſo farre enlarge the Sabbath or ſeventh day in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, as to include the Lords Day in it,</hi> muſt light not upon us onely, but upon other greater Divines, yea and upon the Church of England alſo; but our comfort is, that wee finde it very weakly grounded. As for the inſtitution of the Lords Day, I never reade nor heard any that grounded it upon the fourth Commandement otherwiſe, then by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
               <p>That Commandement containes two things 1. the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Sabbath. 2. a deſigning of the time when; both as touching the proportion of time, to wit of one day in ſeven; and as touching the particularity of the day under the forementioned proportion. For in commanding a ſeventh, it commands one day in ſeven, the former inferring the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as it doth inferre the ſetting of ſome time in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:66015:120"/>
a part for Gods ſervice, which not one (that I know) denies to bee the ſubſtance of this commandement. Now as the Lord deſigned, what ſhould bee their Sabbath day unto the Jewes; ſo hath hee deſigned what ſhall bee the Sabbath day to us Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>This deſignation made to us we do not derive from the fourth commandement; but this day being by the word of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned unto us, ſtill holding up the ſame proportion of time: the reſt of this day and the ſanctification thereof, this and this alone doe we derive from the fourth commandement, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that undoubtedly we Chriſtians ought not to allow unto God a worſe proportion of time for his Service, then did the Jewes: and the proportion is apparant betweene the Lord the creators reſt, and the Lord the redeemers reſt. And our reſt on the day of our Lord the creators reſt, being aboliſhed as a type of Chriſts reſt in the grave; what is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to come in the place thereof then our reſt on that day, which is the Lord our redeemers reſt. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the paſſage here alleaged out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> I am ſorry to obſerve the common errour of others committed here alſo; by diſmembring <hi>Calvins</hi> ſentence, leaving out one halfe of it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to deliver that abſolutely, which hee utters onely conditionally. And the other halfe of the firſt ſentence here mentioned doth manifeſt as much, namely that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeakes only againſt them, who think themſelves obliged to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of one day in 7. for ſome myſterious ſignifications ſake; and accordingly <hi>Wallaeus</hi> ſheweth that he oppoſeth none but Papiſts, whoſe courſe is to obſerve feſtivall dayes for ſome myſtery ſake, whereof hee gives good evidence by a paſſage which he allegeth out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> all which I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented more at large, in my anſwer to the Preface <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. I come to the fourth Section of the Author; <hi>That ſome doe urge the words of this Commandement, ſo farre till they draw blood inſteed of comfort,</hi> are but words: nothing of this kind hath beene hitherto made good ſo much as in the leaſt colour of probabilitie: And who upon due obſerving of the fourth commandement may not well be brought to admire the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that as hee hath placed it in the morall law,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:66015:121"/>
which concerneth all times and perſons; ſo he hath ordered it after ſuch a manner; that howſoever the day ſhould be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet the proportion of time ſtill to be kept; and a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath ſtill to bee of force, whether on the ſeventh day which was the Sabbath day unto the Jewes, or the Lords day which ſhould be our Chriſtian Sabbath; thereon to reſt unto God and to ſanctifie that day unto his ſervice; we make no doubt but the Sonne of man is Lord of the Sabbath, and ſo hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to change it, and none hath power to change it, but hee that is Lord of it. It is true, this was one argument amongſt many, which the Author of the <hi>Practice of Pietie</hi> uſeth to prove that the fourth commandement ſtands ſtill in force; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Saviour profeſſeth that, <hi>He came not to deſtroy the law, but to fulfill it: and that the leaſt of them, ſhould not be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his kingdome of the new Teſtament. In ſo much that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever breaketh one of the leaſt of theſe tenne commandments and teacheth men ſo, hee ſhould be called the leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven, that is</hi> (ſaith the Author) <hi>he ſhould have no place in his Church.</hi> To the firſt of theſe here the Doctor anſwereth thus, <hi>To which we ſay with the Apoſtle: Doe we deſtroy the Law by faith? God forbid: We confirme it rather.</hi> 2 <hi>Chriſt then hath put away the ſhadow, but retained the light, and ſpreads it wider then before: ſhewing thereby the excellent harmony, betweene the Goſpell and the Law.</hi> As touching the firſt part of this preſent anſwer; that is too aliene from our preſent purpoſe; the queſtion betweene us, being not whether the Law be deſtroyed, by preaching juſtification by faith; we know that as touching the ceremoniall Law, whatſoever was prefigured thereby is fulfilled by Chriſt; and as touching the morall Law, Chriſt hath fulfilled that alſo partly in himſelfe by perfect obedience thereunto, and making ſatisfaction for our diſobedience; and partly in us, by giving us more power to performe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto through faith in him, then ever we had before ſince the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> But our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. treats of deſtroying the law by abrogating it or any part thereof, which how they can avoid, who teach that Chriſt by his death, hath freed us from the Yoke of the fourth commandement, I cannot comprehend; Suppoſe it be but one of the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:66015:121"/>
yet let them looke to it, who diſcourſe of abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating it, and teach men that they are not obliged by it, hand over head; leaſt they be accompted by the Lord of Sabbath the leaſt in the kingdome of heaven: therefore it ſtands them upon to confirme it rather as they profeſſe, but how they doe performe that which they pretend, I am utterly to ſeeke. 2. I come therefore to the conſideration of the ſecond part of the anſwer conſiſting of two parts, 1. <hi>That Chriſt hath put away the ſhadow,</hi> 2. <hi>That he hath retained the light &amp; ſpreads it further.</hi> As for the firſt wee have heard the proportion of one day in ſeven allowed unto Gods ſervice, to be called a ceremony, and conſequently a ſhadow; But what this prefigured is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed at all, nor ever hath beene that ever I read or heard. Neither is this put away, but continueth ſtill in the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords day all the Chriſtian world over; and I doubt not but it will continue to the end of the world. The reſtraint of the worſhip to the ſeventh day hath beene alſo called a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, but too too crudely and without all explication of what it figured: yet we willingly grant a faire prefiguration of ſomewhat concerning Chriſt is found in the ſeventh day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Ancients and by moderne writers, both Papiſts and Proteſtants, both <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> but that is not in reference to the worſhip reſtrained to that day, but in reference to the reſt, fairely repreſenting Chriſts reſt that day in his grave; and thereupon grounding the rigorous condition of the Jewiſh reſt, which is the practiſe both of Papiſts &amp; of Proteſtants ſo that the Sabbath is not taken away neither as touching ſome time, in generall to be ſanctified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, nor as touching the proportion of time in ſpeciall, as of one day in ſeven; but only as touching the particular day which is changed into the Lords day: Our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that a Sabbath ſtill was to bee kept of Chriſtians, as Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> proveth out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. As for the ſecond, to wit, <hi>the light</hi> that is ſaid to be <hi>retained and ſpread wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then before;</hi> this is meere darkneſſe unto me, for I cannot by any meanes comprehend the meaning of it: Neither is here any courſe taken to expound it, and bring us acquainted with the interpretation of it. Suppoſe by the light is meant
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:66015:122"/>
the thing prefigured, and that is deviſed to bee a ſpirituall reſt from ſinne. But this I hope the Prophets and holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God under the Law were partakers of, together with the reſt of the Sabbath and the ſanctification of it, as well as we under the Goſpell; and if the ſanctification of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath (I ſpeak of our Chriſtian Sabbath, according to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours language, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20.) be taken from us, I doubt wee ſhall enjoy that ſpirituall reſt from ſinne, in farre leſſe meaſure under the Goſpell, then the Jewes did under the law. Yet neither they nor we ſhall enjoy it intirely, till we are brought to our reſt in glory. Certainely the conſcionable obſervation of the Sabbath ever was, and is a principall meanes to draw us to that ſpirituall reſt from ſin, and eternall reſt in glory. If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by taxing the Jewiſh obſervation of dayes &amp; times, doth therewithall tax the obſervation of the Lords day in place of the Jewiſh: then let us turne Anabaptiſts, and Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and utterly renounce the obſervation of the Lords day, as well as of the Jewiſh Sabbath. The ſame Apoſtle <hi>Col.</hi> 2. ſpeakes not of the Sabbath, but of Sabbaths; and there were dayes enough ſo called amongſt the Jewes, and that by the Lord both of dayes and yeares, beſides the weekely Sabbath; yet we are content the reſt of the ſeventh may be ranged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Sabbaths, as prefiguring Chriſts reſt that day in the grave. But to ſpeake of the Sabbath hand-over-head without diſtinction we love not; nor ſee I any cauſe, why men ſhould be in love therewith unleſſe withall they love confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and to fiſh in troubled waters, is many times an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſerve turnes. Let the reſt of the ſeventh be in Gods name crucified with Chriſt upon the croſſe, or at leaſt be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with him in his grave, and ſo as never to riſe with him; but let our Chriſtian Sabbath (our Saviour ſpeakes of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20.) take life together with our Saviours reſurrection that brought with it a new creation, a new world, and there withall a new Sabbath, as Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> Biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter delivers it in his Starre Chamber ſpeech in the caſe of <hi>Trask.</hi> As reaſon tells us that <hi>there muſt be ſome certaine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time for Gods publique Service;</hi> ſo as good reaſon tells us, wee Chriſtians cannot without ſinne, allow unto God for
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:66015:122"/>
his publique ſervice a worſe proportion of time under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, then the Jewes were bound to allow unto him under the Law. God himſelfe never having deſerved ſo much at the hands of man as under the Goſpell; and there never being greater neceſſitie of obſerving a Sabbath, then under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the way of truth and holineſſe being ſo beſet, and with ſuch encombrances as the like were never knowne to the world before; yet ſtill <hi>from the bondage and neceſſitie of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh Sabbath, we are delivered by the Goſpell;</hi> for neither doe we keepe their day, then called <hi>the Lords holy day;</hi> but the firſt day of the weeke, the day of Chriſts reſurrection in the new Teſtament, called <hi>the Lords day, Revel.</hi> 1. 10. And ſo willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we come to the conſideration of the right, whereby <hi>The Lords day hath ſucceeded in the place thereof;</hi> Let it be the <hi>ſhame of the Anabaptiſt, Familiſt and Swenk feldian,</hi> to make all dayes equall and equally to be regarded, <hi>ſo inſteed of Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bring into the Church, an Heatheniſh licentiouſneſſe,</hi> yet ſurely the heathens ever had their feſtivalls even weekely, and that on the ſeventh day, which was ſometimes called in this reſpect <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And at this day the Turkes feſtivall is their Friday, the firſt day of <hi>Mahumets</hi> kingdome, when hee fled from <hi>Maecha</hi> to <hi>Iethrib,</hi> and thenceforth conſtituted both the firſt day of their weeke and of their yeare. Let as many as by their Sabbatarian ſpeculations, bring all to Iudaiſme bee cenſured as they deſerve; but as for them that deſire to have <hi>all the glory of the Iewes Sabbath transferred to the Lords day,</hi> take heed how you cenſure them, leaſt you cenſure <hi>Auſtin</hi> alſo, and the Doctors of the Church mentioned by him, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed this. As for the river called <hi>Sabbaticus,</hi> let ſuch lettice ſerves their lips that like them. Cenſures of fanatick and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh ſpirits, are as liberally beſtowed by ſome; as the Baiocchi and Bagalini, which the Pope ſcatters at the day of his coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but who they be that deſerve them, God will one day Judge. But I perceive whither this tends; If ſome conceive the Lords day to be prophaned by Maygames and Morice dances, they are cenſured for men fanatick &amp; of peeviſh ſpirits; but they little think that all the Prelates of the kingdome may as well come under their laſh, and the whole Parliament in the

               <p n="5">5 In this fifth Section things are ſo carryed, that it is an hard matter to diſcerne the Doctors meaning, eſpecially in relating the different opinions, concealing the Authors of them and the place where they are to be found, and their arguments which here are only ſaid to be derived from the ſanctification of the ſeventh day in the firſt creation of the world, and from the inſtitution of the Sabbath in the fourth commandement: For herence it is ſaid, that they who ſtand for the tranſlation of the Sabbath from the ſeventh day of the week, to the Lords day, as by divine authority, doe draw their arguments for the juſtifying of their Tenet; which I willingly profeſſe, doth ſeeme a prodigy unto me; namely that any man ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute thus. In the beginning of the world, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſeventh day to be ſanctified, therefore now under the Goſpell, the Sabbath is to be tranſlated from the ſeventh day to the firſt day of the weeke. Or thus, the Lord in the fourth commandement gave in charge to ſanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and tells them, that the ſeventh day (of the weeke) was their Sabbath, therefore the tranſlation of the Sabbath from the ſeventh day of the weeke to the Lords day is of divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: As touching the firſt of theſe deductions, that which comes neareſt thereunto, is the diſcourſe of Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> Biſhop of Wincheſter, in the Starre Chamber. <hi>The Sabbath had reference to the old creation, but in Chriſt we are a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a new creation, and ſo to have a new Sabbath.</hi> And <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> his diſcourſe long agone upon that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>All things are given to me of my Father, Finis prioris creationis Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum, The end of the firſt creation, was the Sabbath day, but the beginning of the ſecond creation is the Lords day:</hi> and of this hee diſcourſeth there more at large. And we find manifeſtly this notable congruitie betweene the Sabbath day and the Lords day, that like as God on the ſeventh day reſted from the worke of creation; ſo Chriſt our Saviour riſing on the firſt day of the weeke from the dead, made that the firſt day of his reſting from the worke of redemption.

It is more likely by farre that ſome meaner perſons, and poore ſnakes are herein ſet up as markes to ſhoot at, and as ſignes to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt.

                  </gap>, and accordingly that one day in ſeven is to bee obſerved, and conſecrated unto Gods Service, as Chryſoſtome long agoe hath inferred herence; but it is nothing uſuall to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre herence the celebration of the Lords day. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner not one that <hi>I</hi> know, ancient or late, doe conclude from the fourth commandement, either the celebration of the Lords day, or the tranſlation of the Sabbath from the ſeventh day to the firſt day of the weeke. But herence indeed they inferre (and moſt juſtly in my judgement) that if one day in the weeke were to be conſecrated unto the Lord, by vertue of the morall law, in the dayes of the old Teſtament, much more doth it become us (by the very light of nature) to conſecrate as good a proportion of time to Gods ſervice under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; And accordingly to reſt from all workes, that hinder the ſanctification of that day in the exerciſes of pietie, and ſo farre forth as they are found to hinder it, not for any myſterious ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications ſake, in which reſpect a very rigorous reſt is moſt commonly conceived to bee enjoyned to the Jewes. I doe wonder the Canoniſts are reckoned amongſt thoſe, who doe build the celebration of the Lords day, <hi>upon the conſtitution of</hi>

                  <hi>the Church and affirme this abſolutely;</hi> when in the next Section many Canoniſts are alleaged out of <hi>Azorius,</hi> as maintaining <hi>the divine authority of the Lords dayes:</hi> and one of them, <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter</hi> by name, profeſſing it to be <hi>opinionem communem.</hi> And <note place="margin">22. q. 44. <hi>art.</hi> 1.</note> as for Schoole-men, it is apparant, that <hi>Dominicus Bannes,</hi> puts a manifeſt difference betweene the Lords day and other feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, which are <hi>ex inſtitutione eccleſiae.</hi> And whereas <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> is alleaged as the mouth of the Schoolemen, to affirme abſolutely, that the celebration of the Lords day, is by the conſtitution of the Church, and that in diſtinction from them who ſay it was ordered by the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> I find no ſuch matter in the place quoted, but rather the contrary, both confirming, that one day in a weeke is to be conſecrated to the Lord by law divine, and whereas it was not fit, that now the Saturday ſhould be it; therefore the Sabbath was turned into the Lords day by the Apoſtles; his words are theſe, <hi>Ius divinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> requirebat ut vnus dies hebdomadae dicaretur cultui divino: non autem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniebat ut ſervaretur Sabbatum.

It is true that which is here reported of <hi>Brentius,</hi> as who profeſſeth it to be left indifferent to the Church to ordain one day in ſeven, or on day in fourteene to be conſecrated; which whether it be not an unreaſonable conceit, I am willing to appeale to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Doctor <hi>Prideaux,</hi> yet <hi>Gemardus</hi> the Lutheran will not follow <hi>Brentius</hi> in this (as I have ſhewed in my anſwer to the preface and 5. Section) For hee acknowledgeth the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords day, to be <hi>juxta Apoſtolorum conſtitutionem,</hi> And as for <hi>Chemnitius</hi> what he writes hereof, is not expreſſed, but for the divine authority of the celebration of the Lords day, I have repreſented the joynt conſent of ſome 11. or 12. of our moderne divines in the place before mentioned; Beſides the concurrence of the ancient Fathers, not one of them being ſo much as pleaded for the oppoſite Tenet; and laſtly the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall anſwer of Chriſtians in the times of perſecution, when they were demanded in this manner <hi>Dominicum ſervaſti, haſt thou kept the Lords day;</hi> for uſually it was this, <hi>Chriſtianus ſum,</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:66015:124"/>
                  <hi>intermittere non poſſum: I cannot omit it, for I am a Chriſtian.</hi> The firſt opinion (to wit of thoſe who maintained the divine authoritie, of the celebritie of the Lords day by the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament) is here cenſured for inclining much to Judaiſine, but it is not expreſſed wherein. And it is apparant, they doe not maintaine the obſervation of the ſeventh day. Certainely this is delivered in reference to ſomewhat, that is not thought fit to be expreſſed; yet the prefacer did expreſſe it, imputing unto them whom he oppoſeth, that they doe obſerve the Jewiſh Sabbath, not in reſpect of the Jewiſh day, but of the Jewiſh manner obſerving it, to wit, in the way of a rigorous reſt. But I know none that maintaines any other reſt from works, then as they are avocations from ſacred ſtudies and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations: whereas the Jewes obſerved it for ſome myſterious ſignification ſake, and thereupon were tyed to a more rigorous reſt. But let them ſpeake plainly, and ſay we are too rigorous in thinking ſports and paſtimes unlawfull on the Lords day. And herein <hi>I</hi> appeale to every Chriſtian conſcience; whether theſe be not as great avocations from ſacred ſtudies and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as the workes of our ordinary callings. Then againe which of us comes neareſt to Judaiſme herein? Is it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Jewes, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſeth? <hi>Melius eſt orare quam ſaltare, Better to goe to plough then to dances;</hi> and <hi>Foeminae vc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrae melius lanam facerent quam ſaltarent.</hi> Better it were your women ſhould ſpin wooll then dance: as their courſe was in their feſtivalls. Againe, why ſhould their opinion be Jewiſh, by maintaining it out of the old Teſtament; rather then out of the new? Then, who are they that maintaine it onely by the old Teſtament? And laſtly, not one that I know (neither doe I thinke it can be juſtly obtruded on any) doe maintaine the ſucceſſion of the Lords day, in the place of the Jewiſh Sabbath, either by the originall inſtitution of it, as from the creation, or by the fourth commandement; yet upon theſe nullities is founded the imputation of <hi>both impudency and ignorance, in oppugning the received opinion of Divines:</hi> That confidently taken up for a received opinion among divines, which is in no tolerable ſort proved; not one Ancient alleaged for it, and but two Papiſts quoted; the one of which I have ſhewed to be
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:66015:125"/>
of a plaine contrary opinion. And of Proteſtant Divines, I have repreſented no leſſe then eleven, maintaining the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall and divine conſtitution of the Lords day, beſides <hi>Gerar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> the Lutheran, to affront <hi>Brentius;</hi> Nay, Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> himſelfe <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. maintaines that it is of Divine authority; and as I remember, in the veſpers at the laſt act unalterable by the Church; <hi>That the Prieſthood being changed, there is made alſo a change of the law</hi> we beleeve, becauſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith it <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. &amp; it is well if the Schoolemen make the word of God their principles; but of what Law? of the morall law, or of the tenne commandements; or any one of them? (yet we willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe a change of one particular in one of them) &amp; not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the law of ſacrifices; &amp; ſuch a change as to ſet an end to them. That herence the Schoolemen conclude that at this day, <hi>the morall law bindeth not, as it was publiſhed and proclaimed by Moſes;</hi> but <hi>as at firſt it appertained no leſſe to the Gentiles then to the Iewes;</hi> this I ſay is a myſtery: And to confeſſe a truth, when I met with this, in a certaine manuſcript of one <hi>Brewers,</hi> it ſeemed to me a very wilde diſcourſe, from this place of the Apoſtle to inferre ſo much; but now I meet with it in a lecture, of ſo judicious and learned Divine as Doctor <hi>Prideaux,</hi> I will ſuſpend my judgement, and waite untill I heare what thoſe Schoolemen are, and where it is that they make ſuch infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; that being made acquainted with them, I may judge of them according to my capacity, as they deſerve. Certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Zanchy</hi> in the place quoted, makes no ſuch Inference from that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. yet the Doctrine which he delivers is good and ſound, though the inſtance he makes of the Sabbath, too weake to prove it, as appeares to all that acknowledge the Commandement of ſanctifying the Sabbath to be given to <hi>Adam,</hi> immediatly after his creation; who deſerve to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted more hot ſpurres then they, in whom <hi>The deſire of prey doth over-runne the ſent?</hi> Now what one of our Divines can be alleaged to derive the authority of <hi>the Lords day from the law of Moſes?</hi> I am verily perſwaded, not one: The ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords Sabbath they derive from thence, and the ſanctifying of one day in ſeven, but not the authority of the Lords day: But if it may appeare otherwiſe, that the Lords
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66015:125"/>
day by good authority is ſubſtituted in the place of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth to become our Chriſtian Sabbath, ſuch as our Saviour fore-prophecied of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. then from the fourth commandement, they may make bold to conclude, that it ought to be ſanctified. And this <hi>Zanchy</hi> himſelfe juſtifies in the place quoted <hi>Chap.</hi> 19, as before hath beene ſhewed. And our booke of homilies expreſly tell us, that now Sunday is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Sabbath. But we keepe not the ſeventh day, the reſt on that day being ceremoniall, and prefiguring the reſt of Chriſt that day in his grave.</p>
               <p>And as for the authority whereby wee have ſubſtituted the Lords Day in the place of the ſeventh, we anſwer, that we are not they that have ſubſtituted, but the Apoſtles have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted it unto our hands; God having marked out that day unto them by a worke nothing inferior to the worke of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to wit, the worke of Chriſts Reſurrection, ſuch a worke as brings with it a new Creation, and therewithall a new Sabbath, as Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> obſerves out of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and delivered as much in the Starre Chamber. And whereas under the Law the Jewiſh Sabbath was called the Lords Day; Now under the Goſpell the firſt day of the weeke is called the Lords Day in the language of the holy Ghoſt in the new Teſtament. And whereas our Saviour gives us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand, that wee are to have a Sabbath under the Goſpell <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 20. as the aforementioned Doctor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> doth obſerve in his patterne of Catecheticall doctrine, In common reaſon, and in the conſcience of a Chriſtian what day ought to be this our Sabbath rather then the Lords Day, ſo called in the language of the holy Ghoſt; eſpecially conſidering that not that day of the yeere, but that day of the weeke is called the Lords Day, as by moſt generall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of all the ancients hath beene ſuppoſed. And to urge one place more out of the old Teſtament, then here is in a violent manner obtruded upon us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 14. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, let us rejoyce, and be glad in it, is evidently ſpoken of that day wherein the ſtone which the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders refuſed was made the head of the corner.</hi> Now by that ſtone the holy Ghoſt chiefely underſtands the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi>

21. 42. <hi>Marc.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Luc.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 11. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 7. and when was hee made the head of the corner, but in the day of his Reſurrection; the Apoſtle profeſſing, that <hi>He was</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>declared mightily to be the Sonne of God touching the ſpirit of ſanctification by the Reſurrection from the dead.</hi> And under what ſtile did they reject him, and condemne him as a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer but for making himſelfe the Son of God? As for the rigorous obſervation of the reſt preſcribed unto the Jewes; as from kindling of fire, and dreſſing of meate; ſome qualifie that rigour, conceaving that <hi>kindling of fire</hi> was forbidden onely for the works to be done about making the Tabernacle. This being delivered as a preface, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 2. when the free will offerings were now to be receaved for the promoting of the workemanſhip of that which formerly was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And that dreſſing of meate was not forbidden them, no not in the gathering of Manna, as ſome thinke; if then, yet not as a generall courſe to be obſerved for ever; And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Table that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> kept, thus we reade. <hi>Moreover there were at my Table, an</hi> 150. <hi>of the Iewes and rulers which</hi>

                  <hi>came unto us from among the Heathen that are about us. And there was prepared daily an Oxe, and ſix choſen Sheepe, and Birds were prepared for me—</hi>and hee was ſo farre from conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of profaning the Lords Sabbath herein, that hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thus, <hi>Remember me O my God in goodneſſe, according to all that I have done for this people.</hi> But ſuppoſe they were tied ſo ſtrictly to ſuch a reſt, as from workes not ſervile, onely in ſeeking againe, (as <hi>Zanchy</hi> inſtanceth the condition of a worke ſervile) but even from ſuch as tended to the refreſhing of their natures; yet the reaſon hereof depended upon the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious ſignification of this reſt, as formerly I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented out of <hi>Lyra,</hi> from which ceremoniality wee are abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and conſequently freed from that rigorous reſt depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon, and reſt onely from works ſo farre forth as they are <hi>avocations from Sacred Studies and meditations,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> expreſſeth it; and this wee accompt a morall reſt, diſtinguiſhed from ceremoniall. And whereas the Doctor tells us that ſuch a like diſtinction is infirme, being content to ſay nothing to confirme it, ſave that <hi>the Text</hi> (as hee
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66015:126"/>
ſaith) <hi>affords it not:</hi> I had thought the very light of nature had beene ſufficient to embolden us to conclude, that where the ſanctification of the day is commanded, therewithall is commanded abſtinence from all ſuch things as would hinder the ſanctification of it, And as for the text it ſelfe, it is apparent that neither the kindling of the fire, nor dreſſing of meate is particularly forbidden in the fourth Commandement. Neither doth hee ſo much as obtrude upon his adverſaries that they derive the ſanctification of their chriſtian Sabbath from ought in the old Teſtament, ſave from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. and from the fourth Commandement. In neither of which doth he deale fairely; but is content to confound things that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as if in this particular he affected to fiſh in troubled waters; and we have better evidence (and indeed it is our only evidence therence) out of the old Teſtament, for the feſtivity of the Lords day, then he is willing to take notice of, namely out of the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 24. Neither is it poſſible he ſhould be ignorant thereof, howſoever hee doth diſſemble his knowledge of it. Yet I hope it is enough for us to finde evidence for it in the Sunſhine of the Goſpell; and indeed here alone we have the originall obſervation of it, though that it ſhould be obſerved, is as evidently prophecied in the old Teſtament, as that Chriſt is <hi>the ſtone which was firſt refuſed of the builders,</hi> and after <hi>made the head of the corner,</hi> adding only this unto it, that the day wherein the Lord did this, and made ſo glorious a worke, marvellous in the eyes of men, was the day of the reſurrection, which I ſuppoſe no intelligent Chriſtian will deny, I come unto the 6. <hi>Section.</hi>

But is it not enough that <hi>Paul</hi> cryeth downe the ceremonies of the Jewes, and in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all their holy dayes, and particularly Sabbaths; to wit, ſo far forth, as they are found to be ſhadowes, the body whereof was Chriſt, ſuch was the reſt on the ſeventh day, as prefiguring Chriſts reſt in the grave. But no ſober man (I trow) will he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence conclude that herewithall hee cryeth downe the ſetting apart of any time for Gods ſervice, that having no colour of ceremony, or reſt from ſuch workes, as hinder us in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, this being as little ceremoniall as the former. I make bold to goe one ſtep farther, and conclude by the ſame reaſon, that neither doth he cry downe the proportion of time, to wit, of one day in ſeven, to be ſet a part for the exerciſes of piety, becauſe in this particular, there is no more ceremonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to be found, then in any one of the former. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, what indifferent man would once expect, that in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours diſputations with the Phariſees about the Sabbath, mention ſhould bee made of the Lords day inſtituted in the place thereof? It is enough, wee find it inſtituted after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours reſurrection; and ſufficient I trowe it is to prove that it was inſtituted, and that in the beſt manner, namely by eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing it <hi>de facto</hi> in practiſe amongſt the Churches; I ſay, this is ſufficiently proved by the obſervation of it; which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, neither was nor could be by chance. A Sowe muſling in the earth, may make ſomething like the letter A. but not <hi>Ennius</hi> his <hi>Andromacha</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero.</hi> In like ſort the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Churches, in the obſervation hereof from the Apoſtles, and continuance therein unto this day, could not be by chance, but by order, and that from the Apoſtles. When
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:66015:127"/>
you aske, <hi>Did not the Apoſtles keepe the Iewiſh Sabbath?</hi> I anſwer, I doe not finde they did, yet I finde revelations were made unto them of what was to be done by degrees. <hi>Peter</hi> was challenged <hi>Acts</hi> 11. by the reſt of the Apoſtles, for preaching the Goſpell unto the Gentiles. They tooke indeed advantage of the Jewes Sabbath, to preach the Goſpell unto them congregated together <hi>Act.</hi> 13. ſo did they to the ſame end take the oppotunity of the feaſt of Pentecoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 21. I grant the Sabbath day was obſerved together with the Lords day by ſome Chriſtians; <hi>Baronius</hi> imputes it to the <hi>Orientales,</hi> and gives the reaſon why formerly repreſented. If any man inferre herehence that the celebration of the Lords day, is grounded upon the conſtitution of the Church onely, let him make it good; for there is no reaſon that words ſhould carry it, much leſſe the voyce of one Papiſt who here is quoted. I am ſure <hi>Dominicus Bannes</hi> and <hi>Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> are of another opinion, formerly produced; and hereafter follow many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts that maintaine the contrary, by the relation of <hi>Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and one of them, <hi>Sylveſter</hi> by name, profeſſeth that it is <hi>Communis opinio,</hi> that it is of <hi>Divine authoritie.</hi> If <hi>Brentius</hi> thinkes otherwiſe, yet <hi>Gerardus</hi> refuſeth to tread in his ſteps, though both are Lutherans. And if the Remonſtrants concurre with <hi>Brentius,</hi> it is nothing ſtrange, they are ſo neer a kin to the Socinians and Anabaptiſts, who renounce altogether the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords day. I have formerly reckoned up and produced no leſſe then eleven of our Proteſtant Divines main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ordinance thereof to be Divine and Apoſtolicall. Beſides the Ancients who are many, and they expreſſe for the ſame, and not one that I know avouched to the contrary. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept indeed we have not for this in the new Teſtament, but that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is better then a precept. For had the Apoſtles commanded it, and the Churches not practiſed it, their commandement had beene obnoxious to various interpretations; but they tooke order to eſtabliſh it as appeares, <hi>de facto.</hi> And D.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66015:128"/>
conſcience, whether upon ſuſpition that we Chriſtians muſt have a Sabbath to obſerve, as the Jewes had, for which we have the expreſſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. D. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> concurring with us in this; and that this Sabbath muſt be ſome one day in the weeke; which from the ordinance of God immediately from the creation, that God himſelfe hath declared unto us, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerveth, and reaſon conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as much for this, and that from conſideration of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time which the Lord required of the Jewes under the law, for undoubtedly we ſhould ſinne if we ſhould allow God a worſe proportion under the Goſpell; and it is evident that no ceremoniality can be found in the ſanctification of one day in ſeven, or in the reſt of one day in ſeven. I ſay let every one judge whether in Chriſtian reaſon any day in the weeke be to be preferred for this before the Lords day; that being the day of Chriſts reſurrection, the day wherein <hi>The Stone which the Builders refuſed was made the head of the corner;</hi> and this day not of the yeere, but of the weeke being in Scripture-phraſe called the Lords day; like as the Jewiſh Sabbath was formerly called the Lords holy day, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 58.

Or that the Church ſhould not aſſemble but at the pleaſure of the Clergie, and they perhaps not well at one among themſelves. For what would men buſied about their Farms, their yokes of Oxen and domeſticke troubles (as the invited gueſts in the holy Goſpell) would they not eaſily ſet at naught an humane ordinance, would not prophane men eaſily diſpenſe with their abſenting themſelves from prayers and preaching, and give themſelves free leave of doing or neglecting any thing, were there not ſomething found in Scripture which more then any humane ordinance or inſtitution ſhould binde the conſcience?</hi> yet it is eaſie to conjecture what would be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to all this, for excommunication upon diſobedience to the Church may be a bond ſtrong enough to oblige them hereunto; Or if men be not ſo ſenſible hereof, yet the lawes

of the land and penall ſtatutes, may provide for ſuch reſtraints by ſuch puniſhments; as whereof every naturall man will be ſenſible enough; we have other conſiderations to propoſe, as 1. Touching the proportion of time, to be allowed to Gods ſervice, which concerneth the quantity of the ſervice it ſelfe. 1. This is a thing very conſiderable and of moment. 2. We have no example, that the quantity of ſervice to be performed to the maſter, was left unto the conſcience, or pleaſure of the ſervant: but rather is to be preſcribed by the Maſter, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſuch a Maſter as God is. 1. Who hath made us? 2. Who will infinitely reward us? 3. To ſerve whom is our moſt perfect freedome and happineſſe. 4. And who is able to give us ſtrength to performe it? 5. And who is tenderly ſenſible of our weakneſſes, as he is moſt privy to them. 6. And after God hath diſcovered this unto us, and required the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one day in ſeven to be conſecrated to him, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; ſurely reaſon doth ſuggeſt, that we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme leſſe unto him under the Goſpell. 2. As touching the particularity of the day under this proportion. 1. We read that there is one, that is <hi>Lord of the Sabbath;</hi> Now in reaſon, who ſhall appoint this day, but he that is Lord of it? eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering that it is <hi>his holy day Eſ.</hi> 58. and ſuch feſtivalls were ſaid to be of his making <hi>Pſalme</hi> 118. 24. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made,</hi> not of mans making: ſecondly, but it may be ſaid, he may leave unto man the appointing of it, if it pleaſe him; I anſwer, that in this caſe it ſtands them upon, to ſhew their Charter for this. Thirdly, for my part, I ſee no cauſe, we ſhould deſire any ſuch liberty, but rather pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God to bleſſe us from it, 1. For as <hi>I</hi> am fleſh, I ſhall bee ſure to put it off to the end of the weeke; and I may be gone out of the world ere that day comes; and when that day comes, I ſhall be as loath to come to the ſervice that day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as ever, and aſſoone weary of it, and ſay, <hi>when will the Sabbath be gone,</hi> that I may returne to my former courſes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as I am ſpirit, I have cauſe to make choyce of the firſt day; for <hi>à Iove principium;</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beaſts of the field, made on the ſixt day, and planted in Paradiſe, the ſeventh day, was the firſt entire day to him

4. Doctor <hi>Lake</hi> Biſhop of Bath and Wells, obſerves that feſtivalls dayes have ever beene commended unto us, by ſome notable worke done on that day. Now what worke, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reſurrection of Chriſt, on the firſt day of the weeke? 5. Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> obſerves in his Starre Chamber ſpeech, that this reſurrection brings with it a new creation, and calls for a new Sabbath; and I find this, to have beene the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> about 1300. yeeres agoe. 6. If we were left at liberty in the choyce of the day, it is to be feared, that if there were twenty dayes in the weeke, there would be twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty differences betweene us thereabouts, 7. Laſtly, if left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; I find no reaſon why we ſhould keepe our ſelves, to the obſervation of the ſame day; this is ſo apt and prone to breed in us an opinion of the neceſſitie thereof, and ſo plunge us into ſuperſtition ere we are aware, and thereby make our whole ſervice of God, on that day diſtaſtfull unto him. To proceed, the Practiſe of the Apoſtles is in Scripture, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us in three ſeverall places; the firſt whereof is <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>upon the firſt day of the weeke, when the Diſciples came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to breake bread,</hi> Paul <hi>preached unto them.</hi> The practiſe is improved thus, <hi>why is it ſaid expreſſely, that the Diſciples came together to heare the word preached, and receive the Sacraments, rather on this day then any other; rather then on the Iewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, were it not then a cuſtome, to celebrate on that day their publique meetings, the Sabbath of the Iewes, beginning by degrees to vaniſh?</hi> It is farther confeſſed, that the Fathers and all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters (almoſt) doe ſo conceive it. Obſerve, not a Father is found, to take it in any other ſenſe, only the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> are ſaid to ſtick at the phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

But the Doctor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, that <hi>from a caſuall fact</hi> he ſeeth not, <hi>how a ſolemne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution may be juſtly grounded;</hi> but it is not proved, that this fact was caſuall; nay the text carryeth in the face of it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt evidence againſt caſualitie. For it is ſaid that they came
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66015:129"/>
together to eat bread; all then convening to a ſacred action, how could this be done, if they had not agreed hereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; eſpecially it being a buſineſſe whereabout they came, that required ſolemne and ſacred preparation? all which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front caſualitie. Take the circumſtances aright, <hi>The Diſciples from divers parts came together that day about ſolemne and ſacred action;</hi> therefore it was ordered before, to meet together on that day; Now this concludes only concerning them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Wallaeus</hi> profeſſeth, that the force of theſe three texts, taken apart doe not conclude, but joyntly; Now by the next place, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. it appeareth, that the ſame day was the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day of meeting for the <hi>Corinths;</hi> and for the Churches of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia</hi> alſo: Now how came it to paſſe, the ſame day was the day of meeting about holy exerciſes, in the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and in the Churches of <hi>Galatia?</hi> could this ordinary courſe (for ſo much is ſignified, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2.) of ſo many Churches concurring herein, come to paſſe by chance, or could their conſent herein, ſo many Churches ſo farre diſtant one from another, be wrought by chance, and not rather in all reaſon, was wrought by authority Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call? And as for the ſecond place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. whereas the exception is, that there it is ſaid <hi>the Apoſtles ordered collections on that day, but not their meetings;</hi> yet Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> in his Starre Chamber ſpeech alleageth it, as the Apoſtles precept, for their meetings on that day; and ſo doth <hi>Paraeus;</hi> for though it be not expreſſed, yet ſo much is implyed, as by the reaſon formerly mentioned hath beene argued: eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt place, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 10. where the firſt day of the weeke is called the Lords day, a notable evidence of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority; the Scripture phraſe no where calling any the Lords day, or the Lords Altars, or the Lords feaſts, but ſuch as are of the Lords inſtitution; and in this particular, Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> compares <hi>the Lords day with the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> profeſſing the notion to be a like in both. And hereupon it is moſt ingenuouſly acknowledged, that <hi>The alteration of the name doth intimate, that the Sabbath was alſo altered, in relation to Gods worſhip,</hi> but <hi>the appointment of the tim,</hi> &amp;c. wherein en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this Section. </p>

               <p n="6">And the next begins with this queſtion,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66015:130"/>
                  <hi>what then? ſhall we affirme that the Lords day is founded on divine authority?</hi> and the anſwer is, <hi>For my part (without prejudice to any mans opinion) I aſſent unto it; how ever the arguments like me not, whereby it is ſupported;</hi> well therefore, let us lovingly and candidly, as it becomes the gates of the muſes, conferre about theſe arguments. <hi>Firſt, this inference offends me; That in the cradle of the world, God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it; therefore all men are bound to ſanctifie it by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſince I both doubt, whether the Patriarches did obſerve it before</hi> Moſes <hi>time, and have learnt alſo that the Law of nature is immutable;</hi> Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> in his patterne of Catecheticall Doctrine writes ſaying, <hi>This is a principle, that the Decalogue is the Law of nature revived, and the law of nature is the Image of God.</hi> But let us conſider the argument. It is one thing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt the antecedent, another to except againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference made herence: As touching the Antecedent, it is one thing, what God hath ordained, and may be another thing, what the Patriarches obſerved; we ſay God ordained it in as much as hee commanded it in theſe words, <hi>Therefore God bleſſed the ſeventh day and hallowed it,</hi> that is, commanded man <hi>to ſanctifie it as hath beene proved:</hi> and is alſo confeſſed; only to helpe themſelves, as it were at a dead lift; they ſay, thoſe words in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> are uttered by way of anticipation; as much as to ſay; becauſe God reſted on that day, therefore God commanded man to reſt on the ſame day, and ſanctifie it, but when? 2500. yeeres after; for the unreaſonableneſſe of which interpretation, and the incongruitie thereof unto the ſame words, repeated in the fourth commandement; I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to that which I have formerly diſcourſed he reupon: Now if God from the beginning ordained the ſeventh day to be kept holy; wee leave it to every ſober conſcience to judge, whether it be not moſt likely, that both <hi>Adam</hi> and the holy Patriarches obſerved it; for we inſiſt not in this argument upon humane obſervation, but meerely upon Divine inſtitution. And though God did from the beginning command it, yet it followeth not, that all men are bound to ſanctifie that day, unleſſe they have ſome evidence of Gods command, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are made acquainted by the Scriptures. If the law of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:66015:130"/>
nature be meant a light of nature convincing us, we doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer herence or at all maintaine (nor any that I know) that in this ſenſe, all or any are bound to keep the ſeventh, or a ſeventh day holy; but onely by vertue of Gods command. Yet this wee profeſſe, that ſeeing it is generally confeſſed that <hi>by the very light of nature ſome time is to be ſet apart for Gods ſervice.</hi> Wee cannot deviſe in reaſon any better courſe, then to ſet one day in ſeaven apart for this; conſidering the firſt divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of dayes is into weekes, and if a ſeventh part of our time be in reaſon to be conſecrated unto God, wee thinke it more convenient to ſet one intire day in ſeven apart for this, then the ſeventh part of every day, becauſe the other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of every day are apt to cauſe diſtraction from the Lords ſervice. And as I have but erſt diſcourſed; it is more fit the Maſter ſhould appoint unto the ſervant what proportion of ſervice hee ſhall performe unto him; then that this ſhould be left to the diſcretion or liberty of the ſervant. 1. both the honour of the Maſter requiring this. 2. and the good of the ſervant; for hereby hee ſhall be aſſured of the better accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at the hands of his maſter. And ſo for the particular day, it is fit the Maſter ſhould marke out that alſo unto him by ſome prerogative ſet upon the day, as hee did the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, by finiſhing the worke of Creation, and by his reſt thereon from his workes to call man to an holy reſt from his, ſo to be more free for the ſervice of his Creator. In which caſes, both touching the proportion of the time, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity of the day, the Law being made, it ſhall continue immutable and unalterable by the will of the Creature; but mutable, and alterable according to the will of the Creator: ſo that things being well diſtinguiſhed, and rightly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſtated, I ſee no bug-beare of inconvenience in all this. Neyther doe I ſee any reaſon why <hi>the ſpending of one day in Gods holy worſhip as a morall and perpetuall duty,</hi> ſhould ſeeme diſtaſtfull to any. Since it is apparant that God commanded it unto his people of the Jewes; and for 1600 yeares it hath beene continually obſerved by Chriſtian Churches unto this day; and I make no doubt, but it ſhall hold till Chriſts comming; though from the beginning of the World it was
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:66015:131"/>
never found to be ſo hotly oppoſed as at this day. And why ſhould any man ſtick in acknowledging it to be morall; when never any man buſied himſelfe to finde out any ceremonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in reference to the proportion of one day in ſeven? Neither doe I thinke ever any man called it judiciall, but <hi>Azorius</hi> profeſſeth it to be <hi>rationi maximè conſontaneum moſt agreeable to reaſon:</hi> and no man that I know hath at any time ſet himſelfe to deviſe a proportion of time to be ſpent in Gods ſervice, more agreeable to reaſon then this. And as for the third offence taken (for I know not any that give it) The fourth Commandement is brought by none that I know to prove that the Lords Day is now become our Chriſtian Sabbath; but ſuppoſing it to be our Sabbath, as the booke of Homilies ſayth it is; and our Saviour ſignified that Chriſtians ſhould have their Sabbath, as well as the Jewes had theirs, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 20. wee produce the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to prove, that wee ought to ſanctifie it, and that we may the better ſanctifie it, to reſt from all workes that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſanctification thereof; And indeed the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is ſo drawen, as to command one day in ſeaven to be obſerved, and whatſoever is that ſeventh preſcribed by lawfull authority, to ſanctifie it, and abſtaine from all works whereby the hallowing of it is diſturbed; and all this we take to be morall, namely the worſhipping of God in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine proportion of time preſcribed by him, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to reſt from workes, not for any myſterious ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſake, as did the Jewes; wee thinke the practiſe of the Church in the Apoſtles dayes is ſufficient to inferre the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall, and divine inſtitution thereof; from hence <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Cyrill, Auſtin,</hi> and the Fathers generally, (for I know not one alleaged to the contrary) ſo take it. And the Lords Day hath no other notion in Scripture language, then a day of the Lords inſtitution; and this is confirmed in that it comes in the place of the Jewes Sabbath, which is called in Scripture, <hi>the Lords holy day Eſay</hi> 58. <hi>and Pſal.</hi> 118. 24. of the day wherein Chriſt was made the head of the corner, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beene formerly refuſed of the builders, it is expreſly ſaid, that it is <hi>the day that the Lord hath made;</hi> and thereupon wee
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66015:131"/>
are called <hi>to rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi> And it hath this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity in the cauſe of its inſtitution to the firſt Sabbath; that as on the ſeventh day the Lord reſted from his worke of Creation, ſo on the firſt day of the weeke the Lord Chriſt riſing from the dead, then reſted from his worke of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. And laſtly Chriſt bringing with him a new Creation is it ſtrange that he ſhould bring with him a new Sabbath? and no day ſo fit for this, as the day of his Reſurrection. And laſtly whoſoever doth not reſt ſatisfied with <hi>the bare ordinance of the Church;</hi> muſt hee not be driven to acknowledge an ordination more then humane, requirable thereunto? Of the neceſſity of my conſequences, and evidence of expreſſe Scripture formerly mentioned, I leave it to the indifferent to judge; and to none ſooner then to Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, none being more able to judge of conſequences then hee, being ſo verſed therein, and I am well perſuaded of the indifferency of his affections, and had thoſe writings in the canvaſſing of this point beene extant before this Lecture of his which hath ſince come to the light of the preſſe; I am apt to conceave that either hee would have given way to that which ſeemes in my judgement to be the truth, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented good reaſon of his diſſenting from it. The Apoſtles example, nor ſo onely, but drawing the Churches generally to the ſame practiſe, doth argue a conſtitution; yet more is brought for the confirmation of the authority of the Lords Day then example. That of <hi>ſearching into the veyles and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of the old Teſtament to finde this inſtitution</hi> is a myſtery unto mee, and ſo farre am I from that courſe, that I know none guilty of it; The ancient Fathers ſometimes doe expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate this way, for the ſetting forth of the honorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Lords Day; but they build not doctrines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; which if they had done in ſome particular caſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to our adverſaries, it had beene enough to have cryed us downe.</p>
               <p>As for Judaiſme, I have often ſhewed, how little colour there is for any ſuch imputation to be caſt upon us, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon our adverſaries: I ſee no cauſe to range the <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſian</hi> with the <hi>Ebionite,</hi> but were they yoake-fellowes,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:66015:132"/>
whereof I finde not the leaſt evidence; yet ſhould not wee draw with them under the ſame yoake; <hi>Chemnitius</hi> his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I have formerly examined ſomewhat at large; <hi>The voluntary conſecration of it by Chriſtians</hi> no man hath cauſe to embrace, who profeſſeth himſelfe not ſatisfied with the bare ordinance of the Church, as but erſt the Doctor did. Of <hi>Brentius</hi> I have ſpoken enough; yet well fare him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the authority of the day to be <hi>ſo farre divine, that he who ſhall neglect it, or raſhly breake it, doth forthwith become worſe then the Jew or Infidell.</hi> As for the <hi>Arminians,</hi> what reſpect ſoever they pretend <hi>to the patterne of the primitive Church,</hi> like enough they could be very well content with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> to make all dayes equall in uſe, as well as they are in nature, or in reſpect of any myſterious ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I leave <hi>Azorius</hi> to refreſh himſelfe with the juyce of his owne diſtinction; It is well that <hi>Suarez</hi> comes ſo farre as to profeſſe that <hi>practically it is not alterable by</hi> the Church. As for <hi>Calvin, Bucer, Chemnitius,</hi> and the reſt, who are onely ſayd to affirme that <hi>ſtill the Church hath power to change the Lords day to ſome other,</hi> I finde no ſuch thing in <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Bucer:</hi> as for what <hi>Chemnitius</hi> delivers hereupon, in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hee ſayth no more then <hi>Calvin:</hi> though ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in him I have found to be weake enough, upon diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the 6 <hi>Section,</hi> of my anſwer to the Preface: having there met with the ſame names, named to the ſame purpoſe. It is not credible to mee they ſhould give power to the Church to bring us backe to the Jewiſh Sabbath: in that caſe who ſhould ſavour moſt of Judaiſme? or preferre us to the <hi>Turkes</hi> feſtivall day which is the Friday. To be inſtituted in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our redemption, admits an ambiguous ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That bringing with it a new Creation, and ſo requiring a new Sabbath; as Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> diſcourſeth and <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> 1200 yeares before him; No day had a better marke for this to be preferred into the place of the Jewes Sabbath then the day of Chriſts Reſurrection; yet conſidering that not that day of the yeare; but that day of the weeke is called in Scripture <hi>the Lords Day,</hi> this maketh it evidently to ſavour of Divine inſtitution, yet it is well that here it is acknowledged
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:66015:132"/>
to be <hi>expreſly of traditions Apoſtolicall. Beza</hi> addeth, <hi>&amp; vere Divinae, on Revel.</hi> 1. 10. I truſt we ſhall ever give due reſpect, both to Law, and Goſpell; and the better concurrence wee finde of them for the maintenance of any doctrine of ours, the more cauſe wee ſhall have to rejoyce therein without feare of cenſure for the mixing of them, or <hi>framing any Sabbaticall Idoll out of them.</hi> It is not the firſt time I have read of ſome ſuch aſperſion in <hi>Rogers</hi> his preface to his <hi>Analyſis</hi> of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Church of England; And the next yeere was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted D. <hi>Willet</hi> upon <hi>Geneſis</hi> dedicated to King <hi>Iames,</hi> where on the. 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> he concludes his diſcourſe on this argument after this manner; <hi>But theſe allegations are here ſuperfluous, ſeeing there is a learned treatiſe of the Sabbath already publiſhed of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (meaning D. <hi>Bownds</hi> diſcourſe thereon) <hi>Which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

                  <hi>a moſt ſound doctrine of the Sabbath, as is layd downe in the former poſitions, which ſhalbe able to abide the triall of the Word of God, and ſtand warranted thereby, when other humane fantaſies ſhall vaniſh: howſoever ſome in their heate and</hi> intemperance, <hi>are not afraid to call them Sabbatarian errors, yea hereticall aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a new Iubily, Saint Sabbath, more then either Iewiſh or Popiſh inſtitution;</hi> much leſſe doe wee feare the ſtory of the Jew of <hi>Teukesbury; Solomon</hi> hath taught us that <hi>the righteous ſpareth his beaſt,</hi> and in our Saviours dayes the Jewes themſelves though very ſuperſtitious in the obſervation of their Sabbath, yet ſhewed mercy towards their beaſts in leading to them to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and helping them out of the ditch on their Sabbath day. But God can give men over into a minde voyd of all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to the deſtruction of their ſoules, ſo to the temporall deſtruction of their bodies alſo, and that as in the way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenes, wherof we have manifold experience, ſo in the way of ſuperſtition. Now ſuch ſtories are pretty flouriſhes, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the judicious, provided they are to purpoſe, and ſound argument hath not beene wanting to juſtifie the doctrine they maintaine: but when they are out of ſeaſon, or ſupply the want of better argument, they want their grace, and are pleaſing only to the ignorant or partialiſt.

Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call after Trinity Sunday, hath ſuch a paſſage, <hi>Hieronymus ex Act.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>colligit, quod die etiam Dominica, quando quibus in publico concionaretur, Paulus non habebat, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus ſuis laboravit.</hi> But where it is that <hi>Hierome</hi> doth collect this he doth not ſpecifie: our Saviour was borne under the Law, and knew full well, it became him to fulfill all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore undoubtedly he never did tranſgreſſe the fourth commandement: indeed ſome there are, who diſtaſte the name of Sabbath now a dayes; and truly the Ancients doe uſually ſpeake of the Lords day, in diſtinction from the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, becauſe that denomination doth denote the Saturday; but I doubt, that in theſe dayes it is diſtaſted in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, even for the reſt of it; which I no where finde diſtaſted amongſt the Ancients, nor any libertie given by them for ſports and paſtimes on the Lords day: But our booke of Homilies ſpeakes plainly in ſaying, <hi>The Sunday is our Sabbath day,</hi> And Proclamations that come forth in his Majeſties name uſually call the Lords day by the name of Sabbath. And in the conference at Hampton Court, Doctor <hi>Raynolds</hi> made a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:66015:133"/>
motion, for preſerving the Sabbath day from prophanation, according to the Kings proclamation, neither have we heard of any prelate of this kingdome, that then interpoſed to alter that phraſe; And which is more, our Saviour calls it the Sabbath, ſpeaking of the times of the Goſpell, when the Jewiſh Sabbath was to bee buried with Chriſt, to wit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. and Doctor <hi>Andrewes</hi> in his patterne of Catecheticall Doctrine, juſtifieth this interpretation of that place, and that to this end, ſo to maintaine the continuance of a Sabbath amongſt us Chriſtians. I doe highly approve the diſtinction following of things commanded, and things permitted on the Lords day, and the explication of each member; the object of the one, all actions advancing Gods ſervice, the object of the other, ſuch things as are no hinderance thereunto; As in the firſt place <hi>workes</hi> of <hi>neceſſitie;</hi> then <hi>workes of charitie;</hi> yet the permitting of theſe, is rightly to be underſtood; not ſo as if the workes of neceſſity here mentioned, were in ſuch ſort per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as left to a mans liberty, whether he will performe them or no. For undoubtedly we are bound as much as lyes in our power, to quench a dangerous fire kindled in a Towne, on the Sabbath day, it being a worke of mercy, neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. For if to returne a pledge ere the poore pawner of it went to his bed, in caſe it were his covering, were a worke of mercy, how much more to ſave a mans houſe from burning, how much more to ſave a whole Towne from being conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whereby many might bee driven to lye without doores, void of all comfort to the body? So to draw the ox out of the ditch, and to lead Cattells to watering, I take it to bee a worke of mercy, as tending to the preſervation of life in a dum creature. In like ſort the dreſſing of meat for the health of mans body, I take to bee a worke of mercy. So that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of theſe in reference to the end whereto they tend, I take to be of neceſſary duty (as here they are called workes of neceſſitie) and conſequently not permitted only, but comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo in the generall, though not in this commandement; but in the ſecond commandement of the ſecond table only they are ſaid to be permitted on the Lords day to ſignifie, that the fourth commandement doth not enjoyne them nor forbid them, in commanding reſt from workes on that day, and the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:66015:134"/>
ſanctifying of that reſt. I doe not doubt but that <hi>charitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins from it ſelfe,</hi> and the Scripture commands us <hi>to love our neighbour as our ſelves.</hi> And can wee performe better love to our ſelves in advancing our owne good, then by making <hi>The Sabbath our delight, to conſecrate it as glorious to the Lord?</hi> As for the recreations, which are here ſaid to ſerve lawfully to the refreſhing of our Spirits; this appellation is very ambiguous, neither doe I know any difference betweene the recreating of our Spirits, and the refreſhing of our Spirits: yet here the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of our Spirits is made the end of recreation. Againe it were good to diſtinguiſh betweene recreation of the body, and recreation of the mind. I thinke the refreſhing of Spirits pertaines to the recreation of the body; mens ſpirits are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and materiall things, and they are apt to bee waſted firſt naturally: for as life conſiſts in <hi>calido,</hi> in an hot matter, ſo heate is apt to ſpend and waſte the matter wherein it is; and Spirits thus waſted are recreated, that is, repaired by eating and drinking. And thus proviſions of victuall are commonly called recreats. 2. Secondly they are waſted alſo by labour voluntarily undertaken, and theſe are repaired, as by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way, ſo by reſt alſo. And each way we are allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create our ſpirits on the Lords day; and as to allow ſuch reſt to our ſervants as a work of mercy, ſo to our own bodies alſo. But now a dayes many courſes are called recreations, wherein there is found little reſt; and the naturall Spirits of man are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waſted, and his nature tyred; farre more then the one is repaired, or the other eaſed. And when all comes to all, I doubt the iſſue will be, to ſtile the pleaſures of our ſenſes by the cleanly name of recreations. Now the Jewes were expreſſely forbidden <hi>to find their owne pleaſure on the Lords holy day Eſ.</hi> 58. 13. yet were they not forbidden all pleaſure, that belonged on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuch a Sabbath as was a faſt; and therein indeed hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are taxed for finding pleaſure on that day <hi>Eſ.</hi> 58. 3. But the weekely Sabbath, was for pleaſure and delight, but not for mans owne pleaſure, nor for the <hi>doing of their owne wayes.</hi> But to delight in the Lord, which is ſpirituall pleaſure, and the recreating of our ſouls in the Lord: this is a bleſſed reſt, thus to reſt unto him; and the word of God is the beſt food of the ſoule; No recreates like unto Gods holy ordinances. Of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

it is ſaid, that <hi>her wayes are the wayes of pleaſantneſſe.</hi> I willingly confeſſe, that to the naturall man, as <hi>the things of God are fooliſhneſſe, ſo the word of God is a reproach unto him, hee</hi>

                  <hi>thou in the Lord,</hi> and he ſhall give thee thy hearts deſire; to meete with the contrary iudgement of carnall men, who ſay, <hi>It profitteth not a man, that he ſhould delight himſelfe with God.</hi> If it <note place="margin">Pſ. 37. 4.</note> be ſaid that ſuch ſports are tolerated, to fit a man for his calling <note place="margin">Job 34. 9.</note> the day following; It is very ſtrange, that workes of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhould not <hi>be permitted</hi> on any part of the Sabbath day, and ſports and paſtimes ſhould; And ſhall not the ſpending of our time in Gods Service, not publique only, but private alſo, farre better fit us to ſerve God in the workes of our calling, and make us more capable of his bleſſing upon our labours, then the exerciſing of our ſelves in ſports and paſtimes? As for the maintaining of good neighbourhood, I appeale to every mans conſcience, whether Chriſtian neighbourhood be not better maintained, in meeting together in the repeating of a Sermon, the word in the originall being only <hi>Conſortium,</hi> or in edifying one another in holy communication; then in meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at beare-baiting, or at a play, or at a may game, or to look upon a morice dance. 2. whether on the Lords day which is our Chriſtian Sabbath it is not fit to maintaine neighbourhood, and Communion in things ſpirituall; as at other times to maintaine neighbourhood in things civill, and temporall. To conclude this, there are 3. things that in this diſcourſe give little ſatisfaction. 1. that under recreations are comprehended not only ſuch courſes as recreate, and refreſh the Spirits, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are made more fit for labour both of body, and minde, but alſo, (and that more principally intended as it ſemees) the pleaſing of the ſenſes, and eſpecially the eye and the eare, and thus mens pleaſures carnall pleaſures are cleanely carryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtile of recreations, and refreſhments of the ſpirit, when they deſerve rather to be called the tickling of the fleſh. 2. here is no mention made of the end whereunto recreations tend which ought to be only to fit us either for the labours of our ſpeciall vocations, or for the works of our generall calling, as ſauſe is for meats. 3. Laſtly under recreations lawfull there ſeemes to be no intention to acknowledge our converſing with God in any recreation; yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could take notice of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure taken in this that a man knowes by curious demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a Triangle containes three angles equall to two right: ſuch like thing was that which <hi>Archimedes</hi> rejoyced in, when
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:66015:135"/>
he cried out <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And <hi>Pythagoras</hi> as I remember, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed a great ſacrifice upon the finding out the equality of the ſquare of the ſubtendent line in a rectangle Triangle, to the ſquares of the two ſides. So a ſcholar takes delight in finding out by curious demonſtration the ſquaring of a Circle, a thing confeſſed by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to be knowable, but the demonſtration of it hath not beene found untill about fifty yeares agoe, as <hi>Salmuth</hi> writes upon <hi>Pancirolla.</hi> Should any pleaſure taken in any other worldly thing, be comparable to that which ought to be taken in the enjoying of friends, and their mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication? I have heard it accompted the beſt muſick; how much leſſe ſhould be all other pleaſure in compariſon to that pleaſure which is taken in God, who hath <hi>Rivers of pleaſures in his houſe,</hi> wherewith to entertaine us? not to ſpeake of that <note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 8.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Prov. 21. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and not vainely caught at;</hi> but in what caſes it falls out to be juſtly given, and in what not; in what caſe it is vainly caught at, and in what not, here we find no explication; which yet I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume will ſeeme neceſſary in every wiſe mans judgement; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to me it muſt needs ſeeme ſo, being as I am, in extreame deſpaire of deviſing theſe different caſes of mine owne head. Of Chriſtian liberty from the yoke of Jewiſh ceremonies I have read, but of Chriſtian liberty unto ſports, and paſtimes, under the gentile notion of recreations, and that on the Lords day, I never read till now. The Jewes to this day continue their ceremonies, but not any abſtinence from al ſports, and paſtimes on their Sabbath; for if they did, why ſhould <hi>Auſtin</hi> tell them, it were better for them to goe to plough then to dance? In the very feſtivalls of the Jewes which were yearely, a difference there was in the dayes of each; the firſt, and laſt were Sabbaths appointed for holy convocations, and thereon abſtinence commanded from all ſervile works; I no where finde any pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:66015:136"/>
and dancing on thoſe dayes, ſaving their temple muſick; how much more undecent is it to clap the weekely Sabbath, together with other feſtivalls, as if there were no difference: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies to be moved round, and conſequently it ſignifies, as ſometimes to dance, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. ſo ſometimes alſo to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger like a drunken man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 27. And dancing was uſed ſometimes in the feſtivalls of the Jewes, whereby they teſtified their rejoycing in the Lord, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. and with a pipe they came to the mount of the Lord, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 30. and <hi>Miriam Moſes</hi> ſiſter, and other women alſo with Timbrells, and dances expreſſed their joy in the Lord for their deliverance from the hands of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and for their ſafe paſſage through the red Sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the enemies were drowned. But of any ſuch courſe uſed on the firſt, and laſt day of their yearely feaſts, which were ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for holy convocations, we find no example amongſt them; much leſſe as approved, while they continued the Church, and people of God, leaſt of all on the weekely Sabbath. As for love feaſts on the Sabbath untill abuſe crept in, they continued without exception in great ſobriety, only to quicken one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and provoke unto love, and gracious communication for the edification of their ſouls. I never heard of any ſchiſmatique how raſhly zealous or Stoicall ſoever, that tooke upon him the authority of the civill magiſtrate: All for ought I know, concurre in this, that it belongs onely to the magiſtrate out of coercitive power to command, and compell, but to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of what ſect ſoever, only to perſuade, and worke upon mens conſciences: ſo that the members of this compariſon are moſt indecently yoaked feigning men to be of what ſpirit ſoever it pleaſeth to ſhape them, and to doe whatſoever they thinke good, though never ſo unreaſonably, and without all example. Of the Jewes I have read, that they count it unlawfull to kill a Flea on the Sabbath; and ſuch things muſt be pinned upon the ſleeve of oppoſites to grace their cauſe, for want of better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſtrengthen it. Infine we have a buffe give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed companions in words, when under the cleanly terme of Recreations on the Lords Day, the courſe here taken is to ſacrifice unto them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and in effect.</p>

25. The reſerving of the ſeventh part I hold to be by Gods Ordinance who is not variable in his choice, as everlaſting as the World, becauſe appointed before the fall.</p>
            <p n="26">26. And ſo ſhould the hallowing of the ſeventh ayfm the Creation have beene as laſting, had it not beene for ſin, for what could have altered it but a new Creation?</p>
            <p n="27">27. But man having ſinned, and ſo by ſin aboliſhed the firſt Creation <hi>de jure,</hi> though not <hi>de facto,</hi> God was pleaſed to make by Chriſtan inſtauration of the World.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Hee (as the Scripture ſpeakes of Chriſts Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) made a new Heaven, and a new Earth; old things paſſed then away, and ſo all things were made new.</p>
            <p n="29">29 Yea every man in Chriſt is a new Creature.</p>
            <p n="30">30 As God then when he ended the firſt Creation, made a day of reſt, and ſanctified it.</p>
            <p n="31">31 So did Chriſt, when he ended his worke, make a day of reſt and ſanctified it.</p>
            <p n="32">32. Not altering the proportion of time which is eternall, but taking the firſt day of ſeven for his portion, becauſe ſin had made the ſeventh alterable, Therefore.</p>
            <p n="33">33. This firſt day ſucceeded the ſeventh, and by that was this memoriall aboliſhed.</p>
            <p n="34">34. And although the Apoſtles were indulgent to the Jewes in keeping the ſeventh as well as the firſt, when they converſed with them; untill the deſtruction of the Temple.</p>
            <p n="35">35 Yet would they not endure, that the Gentiles ſhould be tied to the obſervation thereof.</p>
            <p n="36">36. This firſt day Chriſt ſanctified not only by his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but alſo by ſundry apparitions before his aſcenſion, and after his aſcenſion by ſending thereon the Holy Ghoſt; this is cleare in the Goſpell and Actes.</p>
            <p n="37">37 The Apoſtles directed by Chriſts not onely example, but ſpirits alſo, obſervéd the ſame; witneſſe in the <hi>Acts</hi> S. <hi>Paul;</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="38">38 And from the Apoſtles the Catholike Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly received it; witneſſe all Eccleſiaſticall writers.</p>
            <p n="39">39 And the Church hath received it not to be <hi>Liberae obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationis,</hi> as if men might at their pleaſure, accept or refuſe it.</p>

40 But to be perpetually obſerved to the Worlds end; for as God only hath power to apportion his time: ſo hath he power to ſet out the day that hee will take for his portion, for hee is Lord of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p n="41">41 And he doth it by the worke which hee doth on the day; the worke I ſay doth difference a day from a day.</p>
            <p n="42">42 Whereas otherwiſe all dayes are equall, and the ſame in themſelves; as the ſonne of Syrach teacheth.</p>
            <p n="43">43 Now then when God doth any remarkeable worke, then will hee be honoured with a commemoration day for that worke; if the worke concerne the whole by the whole Church; and by a part if it concerne a part.</p>
            <p n="44">44 And his will is underſtood often by his precept, but when we have not that, the practiſe doth guide the Church.</p>
            <p n="45">45 This is a catholick rule obſerveable in the inſtitution of all ſacred feaſts both Divine and Humane.</p>
            <p n="46">46 The worke of the day is the ground of hallowing the day, whether it be weekly monethly or yearly, as particulars evince in Scripture and Hiſtory.</p>
            <p n="47">47 No man can tranſlate the worke, therefore can no man tranſlate the day; this is an undoubted rule in <hi>Theology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="48">48 And no man can in reaſon deny due reſpect unto the worke, therefore hee cannot deny the hallowing of the day; a true rule in morality.</p>
            <p n="49">49 Now then ſeeing the Lords Day hath not altered the proportion of time, but onely changed the day, though not properly, yet by analogy; though not with the acceſſories, yet according to the Originall Sabbath, It may well agree with the tenor of the fourth Commandement, and the obſervance thereof be commanded therein.</p>

                  <hi>By</hi> Sabbath you muſt underſtand the Lords Day, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe none but Hereticks hold this opinion.</p>
               <p>Then I thinke the proportion of time is perpetuall <hi>Theſi</hi> 15; though if you looke to the aſſiguation of the day, it is not perpetuall; ſin hath altered it occaſionally, and God <hi>Cauſally; abſque hoc</hi> it was intended that it ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, <hi>Theſi</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>But whether is the obſervation of the Lords Day morall?</p>

               <p>But there is a mutability in the obſervance of ſuch times as cloath Gods works, becauſe the works themſelves are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to mutability, and ſo the ſeventh day was changed for the firſt, becauſe the firſt Creation needed an inſtauration; and he that cauſed the Inſtauration might make the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Theſi</hi> 33.</p>

A ſtrange anſwer; I thinke they muſt and doe agree; for by analogy is the Lords Day contained in the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Church directeth us ſo to underſtand.</p>

               <p>I ſuppoſe in my <hi>Theſes</hi> I have given a probable anſwer. Seeing the apportionment of time is eternall, which I thinke cannot juſtly be denyed, I hold the tranſlation of of the feaſt from the ſeventh to the firſt day is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Analogy.</p>
               <p>For ſeeing God was pleaſed that the day of the Creation ſhould be commemorated (as appeareth by the Letter of the Commandement) and the firſt Creation being by ſin diſſolved jure, &amp; reſtored againe by Chriſt upon the firſt day; where we find the reſt after the new Creation, there we muſt fix the feaſt; And this is perſwaded by the drift of the Law.</p>

               <p>Secondly, hee thinketh that all the Lawes morall are as he calleth them of nature, doe repreſent the Image of God, and are unalterable even by God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Not conſidering that there is a morality that concerneth man as he is <hi>Animal rationale,</hi> and reaſon moderateth the ſenſuall part, which commeth not within the compaſſe of the Image of God.</p>
               <p>And in many particulars is mutable, and diſpenſable in caſes of neceſſity; as it is held againſt the Law of Nature that bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters ſhould marry, but God diſpenſed with it, but I ſhould wade into a large argument if I ſhould rippe up theſe two Errors.</p>
               <p>I rather note, that hee underſtandeth not the ground of a Feſtivall day, that maketh no other ground of it than <hi>Omnia ſiant ordine &amp; decenter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords Day had a higher ground, which I opened in the <hi>Theſes,</hi> and that is Chriſts Reſurrection, and thereby a new Inſtauration of the World.</p>
               <p>Which wee are bound to obſerve upon the grounds ſet downe in the <hi>Theſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in a word; Hee that doth not let Gods Word be the guide directing to ſanctifie a Feſtivall day, I thinke hee ſquareth not his opinion according to truth, neither hath he any preſident from Gods Word.</p>

            <p n="16">16 Where had <hi>Rhenanus</hi> that opinion? his varying from thoſe whom I anſwered on the 13 <hi>Theſis</hi> ſheweth that hee was not of <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> or <hi>Tertullian</hi> his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and yet giveth no reaſon that may move to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit him, or countervaile what I have alleadged for my opinion.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Yes, there is more, if you compare <hi>Deut. c.</hi> 5. with <hi>Exodus c.</hi> 20. but I meant not onely that, but other paſſages which make the Sabbath a ſigne of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence ſanctifying the Jewes, &amp;c. which I expreſſed in the next <hi>theſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19 <hi>Bedes</hi> conceipt may paſſe for an allegory built upon a witty accommodation of the literall ſenſe which other fathers obſerved before him. But that cannot be the literall ſenſe of the Commandement.

            <p n="31">31 True it is, that Chriſt did reſt from ſuffering upon the ſeventh; but the laſt enemy death was not apparently overthrowne untill the reunion of his ſoule, and body, till he roſe againe for our juſtification, &amp;c.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> concerning the liberty from <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. Neither doth he beare out the Gentiles againſt the Jewes, but qualifie rather the deſtempered zeale of the Gentiles that were too hot againſt the Jewes; <hi>Senſus dictorum ſumendus eſt ex cauſis dicendorum,</hi> It is plaine that there was a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether the Chriſtian gentile ſhould be preſſed to obſerve the ceremonies whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chriſtian Jewes were pertinaciouſly addicted? but never was there (for ought I read) a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Jewes ſhould keepe the Lords day? for I think they never refuſed it. Had there been ſuch a quarrell, I would enlarge the ſenſe of that Chapter, as you doe, to our queſtion, but ſeeing there was not, I ſee not how it ſhould be reaſonably done.</p>
            <p n="36">36 I ſay not that the Apoſtles imprinted any holineſſe upon the firſt day of the weeke; It was Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection that honoured that day, which (I ſay) the Apoſtles were to reſpect, not arbitrarily, but neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. You may perceive the reaſon in my <hi>Theſes.</hi> You cannot obſerve from the beginning of the world any other inducement to the inſtitution of feaſts, but Gods worke done on the day; If it were not a continued worke, as the dwelling in Tabernacles.</p>
            <p>But you thinke the Apoſtles did not preſcribe the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that day; No? you confeſſe they made choice of it, and were moved ſo to doe by the reaſon which I alleage, And were they not ſcattered over all the world? &amp; where they came did they not all give the ſame order for the ſacred aſſemblies? And ſhall we thinke that this could be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an apoſtolicall preſcript?</p>
            <p n="37">37. &amp; 43. I conjoyne them, becauſe one anſwer will cleare both; Let us then firſt agree, what it is for a thing to be <hi>Liberae obſervationis.</hi> The Queſtioniſt in his interpretation, which commonly is received,
<pb facs="tcp:66015:143"/>
leaveth a poſſibility for an alteration by humane auctority, if any reaſon ſhall perſwade a conveniency ſo to doe; though ſo long as publike auctority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth it, he will have it dutifully obſerved.</p>
            <p>Whereupon will follow a Conſectary or two. Firſt, that this Law doth not immediately bind the conſcience, becauſe <hi>Merè humani Iuris poſitivi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that <hi>Extra ſcandalum,</hi> a man may tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe it. For example, a Tradeſman may worke in his Chamber, if no body bee privy to it.</p>
            <p>If this be the Commentary upon <hi>Libera obſervatio</hi> (and if it be well inquired into, you will finde that I doe not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the meaning) then I profeſſe I cannot like of ſuch a <hi>Libera obſervatio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For I am perſwaded that if all Chriſtendome ſhould meete, and have never ſo plauſible a ground, they cannot alter the day <hi>de jure,</hi> though <hi>de facto</hi> they may; but it is worſe then p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eviſhneſſe ſo to doe. And why? they cannot alter the firſt ground, Chriſts ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon that day. Secondly, they cannot alter the uniforme order that upon that undenyable ground was ſet down by the Apoſtles themſelves, which were infallibly guided by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And out of theſe grounds I deduce, that the Law doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately bind their conſcience.</p>
            <p>And that it is to be obſerved, even where it may be tranſgreſſed without any ſcandall.</p>
            <p>Chriſt and the Apoſtles were not abſolutely bound to lay ſuch a foundation of the Lords Day, and ſo it was <hi>Liberae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionis;</hi> but they having layd it, I deny that it is now <hi>Liberae Obſervationis;</hi> ſo that under God I know no power that can alter it.</p>
            <p>The Fathers ſpeake of the Jewiſh Sabbath, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Theſ.</hi> 49.</note> Allegorize that as it was carnally uſed by the Jewes. But we ſhall wrong the Fathers, if we thinke they held that there was no Morality in the Letter of the Commandement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66015:143"/>
For though there were a myſtery figured in it, yet they doe not deny that there was a morall proportioning of time for Divine Service preſcribed therein, which is the ſeventh part of the weeke.</p>
            <p>It is one thing to ſay that all our life time we muſt be religious in our converſation, and keepe a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Sabbath; anotherthing to affirme that we muſt not have a ſolemne weekely day, wherein to intend onely Divine worſhip.</p>
            <p>This laſt point the Fathers doe not ſay, the former they doe, and to argue from their Omiſſion, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their words beyond their meaning; at leaſt, their meaning is not <hi>adaequate</hi> to the ſenſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
            <p>No nor to their practiſe; For they did conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a ſeventh part of the weeke, which I ſay is the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple contained in the fourth Commandement.</p>
            <p>Though I deny not but there is moreover a limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſeventh day from the Creation expreſt, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles altered; but this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration cannot overthrow the firſt principle; they may both well goe together.</p>
            <p>To the particular allegations out of the Fathers I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer no more then, that what they ſay is true, but doth not contradict what I hold. For the myſticall ſenſe doth not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the literall of the Commandement. And they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſeventh day preciſely from the Creation, which we confeſſe altered, and ſpeake not of the divine Ordinance, for the apportioning of time, but the carnall obſervation of the Jewes.</p>
            <p>And your anſwer to the firſt Queſtion grounded on the Fathers words may paſſe for good; but there is more in the Commandement then ſo.</p>
            <p>Your Anſwer to the ſecond I cannot ſo well approve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Excluſive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66015:144"/>
As for your third anſwer, That the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is not the Law of nature, but a poſitive law; take the Law of Nature for Morall Reaſon, then I think there is more then meere poſitiveneſſe in it. For morall reaſon teacheth to honour the day whereon the work is done; and that morall reaſon which gave this in charge was Apoſtolicall, and ſo of a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power in both. And then you ſee that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meerely poſitive, nor meerely naturall, but mixt, and ſo binding accordingly, <hi>ut ſupra ad Theſin.</hi> 37. <hi>&amp;</hi> 43.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>You adde two Queſtions.</head>
               <p n="1">1 Whether ſeeing the Lords day ſucceeds the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, wee are to keepe it in the ſame manner, and with the ſame ſtrictneſſe?</p>
               <p>Firſt I hold in my <hi>Theſes,</hi> that our Lords day doth properly ſucceed the Sabbath inſtituted at the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I ſeparate all the Acceſſories from <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Jewes did miſconſture the ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Sabbath, as appeareth by the many corrections of our Saviour in the Goſpell, and his Generall Rule: The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They held that they might not ſo much as kindle a fire, or dreſſe Meat upon that day, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their conceipt upon the Texts that are <hi>Ex.</hi> 35. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>But both Texts ſeeme to be wreſted; for that <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. about kindling a fire, muſt be limited by the verſe going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and is not to be underſtood of any other kindling of fire, then for following of their Trades or Servile workes, as they are called. And ſo <hi>Munſter, Vatable,</hi> and others upon that place cenſure their miſtake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:66015:144"/>
And that it is a miſtake againſt the meaning of the Commandment, I gather from hence: For the Jewes that will not put their owne hands to kindle a fire, will hire Chriſtians to doe it for them; as if the Commandment did not reach Servants and ſtrangers within their gates; and they offend as much in doing it by others, as if they did it by themſelves. But ſo doe they uſe to abuſe the Scripture, and confute their Gloſſes by their owne practice.</p>
               <p>As for the 16. Chapter of <hi>Exod.</hi> which ſeemeth to forbid the dreſſing of Meat, <hi>I</hi> hold that miſtaken alſo. Read the Chapter and mark whether you can finde that upon the ſixth day they were to dreſſe any more then ſerved for that day, and to lay up the reſt undreſſed untill the Sabbath; at what time (I hope) they were to dreſſe it before they did eat it.</p>
               <p>And indeed only the providing of Manna is there forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and a promiſe (whereof they had experience) that it would not putrifie upon the Sabbath, though they kept it till then, whereas upon other dayes it would.</p>
               <p>And in this ſenſe doe I underſtand the ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of him that gathered ſticks upon the ſeventh day, it was becauſe he then made his proviſion, and did it, it ſhould ſeeme, with an high hand. Numb. cap. 15.</p>
               <p>As for recreations I can ſay nothing, but that ſeeing the Lords day is to be the exerciſe of that life which is ſpirituall, and as a foretaſt of that which is eternall, it were to be wiſht that wee did intend thoſe things as farre as our frailty will reach.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Vivitur non cum perfect is hominibus,</hi> and wee muſt be content to have men as good as we may, when it is not to be hoped they will be as good as they ſhould.</p>
               <p>Yet we muſt take heed that we doe not ſolemnize our feaſt vainly as either the Iewes or Gentiles did.</p>
               <p>Againſt whom <hi>Nazianzene</hi> is very tart, &amp; <hi>Tertul.</hi> in his Apolog.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:66015:145"/>
In the Civill Law we finde a diſpenſation for Husbandmen in caſe of neceſſity, contrary to the Jewiſh policy, Exod. 34.</p>
               <p>Which is followed by our Law. <hi>Edward.</hi> the 6. Wee may in apparrell and diet, be more liberall and coſtly on feaſts then on other dayes.</p>

               <p>Which they little thinke of, that for feare of breaking the Sabbath have taken away Hoſpitality.</p>
               <p>Some men are over-nice in this point, more nice then Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Luc.</hi> 14. who on the Sabbath went to a feaſt, and that was to a wedding feaſt.</p>
               <p>And why not? ſeeing the Sabbath is <hi>Symbolum Aeternae,</hi> not only <hi>quietis,</hi> but <hi>Laetitiae;</hi> therefore reſembled to a feaſt without the toyle of Acquiſition.</p>
               <p>So that the Sabbath is not violated by feaſts, if wee exceed not <hi>Neceſſitatem Perſonae,</hi> though <hi>Natura</hi> wee doe.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Neceſſitas Perſonae</hi> requireth that more be imployed in providing feaſts; as a Kings diet then a Subjects, a Noble then a Common mans, a Colledge then a ſingle Perſon:</p>

               <p>And we muſt keepe the Apoſtles rule; Whether wee eat or drinke, we muſt doe all to the glory of God.</p>
               <p>And it were to bee wiſhed, that the old practice, whereof there is a Patterne in the Kings houſe, &amp; ſome

               <p>That at ſix a Clock in the Morning Prayers, were every where appointed for Servants and ſuch as were to prepare dinner, to goe then to Church, at whoſe returne the Maſters might goe with the reſt of their familie.</p>
               <p>As for other recreations, if they be not oppoſite or prejudiciall to Piety, they may well ſtand with the ſolemnizing of the Sabbath and other feaſts.</p>
               <p>Too much Auſterity doth rather hurt then good; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in thoſe dayes, wherein Indulgence, where of we have Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes in Gods Synchoreticall Lawes, is extorted from thoſe that are in Authoritie, by the generall corruption of the time.</p>
